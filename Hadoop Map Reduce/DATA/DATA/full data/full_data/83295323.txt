83295323	antonina  or the fall of rome   by  wilkie collins     preface  in preparing to compose a fiction founded on history the writer of these pages thought it no necessary requisite of such a work that the principal characters appearing in it should be drawn from the historical personages of the period  on the contrary he felt that some very weighty objections attached to this plan of composition  he knew well that it obliged a writer to add largely from invention to what was actually knownto fill in with the colouring of romantic fancy the bare outline of historic factand thus to place the novelists fiction in what he could not but consider most unfavourable contrast to the historians truth  he was further by no means convinced that any story in which historical characters supplied the main agents could be preserved in its fit unity of design and restrained within its due limits of development without some falsification or confusion of historical datesa species of poetical licence of which he felt no disposition to avail himself as it was his main anxiety to make his plot invariably arise and proceed out of the great events of the era exactly in the order in which they occurred  influenced therefore by these considerations he thought that by forming all his principal characters from imagination he should be able to mould them as he pleased to the main necessities of the story to display them without any impropriety as influenced in whatever manner appeared most strikingly interesting by its minor incidents and further to make them on all occasions without trammel or hindrance the practical exponents of the spirit of the age of all the various historical illustrations of the period which the authors researches among conflicting but equally important authorities had enabled him to garner up while at the same time the appearance of verisimilitude necessary to an historical romance might he imagined be successfully preserved by the occasional introduction of the living characters of the era in those portions of the plot comprising events with which they had been remarkably connected  on this plan the recent work has been produced   to the fictitious characters alone is committed the task of representing the spirit of the age the roman emperor honorius and the gothic king alaric mix but little personally in the business of the storyonly appearing in such events and acting under such circumstances as the records of history strictly authorise but exact truth in respect to time place and circumstance is

already furrowed in numerous directions by the tracks of the invading forces of those northern nations generally comprised under the appellation of goths  in some places these tracks were denoted on either side by fallen trees and occasionally assumed when half obliterated by the ravages of storms the appearance of desolate and irregular marshes  in other places they were less palpable  here the temporary path was entirely hidden by the incursions of a swollen torrent there it was faintly perceptible in occasional patches of soft ground or partly traceable by fragments of abandoned armour skeletons of horses and men and remnants of the rude bridges which had once served for passage across a river or transit over a precipice  among the rocks of the topmost of the range of mountains immediately overhanging the plains of italy and presenting the last barrier to the exertions of a traveller or the march of an invader there lay at the beginning of the fifth century a little lake  bounded on three sides by precipices its narrow banks barren of verdure or habitations and its dark and stagnant waters brightened but rarely by the presence of the lively sunlight this solitary spotat all times mournfulpresented on the autumn of the day when our story commences an aspect of desolation at once dismal to the eye and oppressive to the heart  it was near noon but no sun appeared in the heaven  the dull clouds monotonous in colour and form hid all beauty in the firmament and shed heavy darkness on the earth  dense stagnant vapours clung to the mountain summits from the drooping trees dead leaves and rotten branches sunk at intervals on the oozy soil or whirled over the gloomy precipice and a small steady rain fell slow and unintermitting upon the deserts around  standing upon the path which armies had once trodden and which armies were still destined to tread and looking towards the solitary lake you heard at first no sound but the regular dripping of the raindrops from rock to rock you saw no prospect but the motionless waters at your feet and the dusky crags which shadowed them from above  when however impressed by the mysterious loneliness of the place the eye grew more penetrating and the ear more attentive a cavern became apparent in the precipices round the lake and in the intervals of the heavy raindrops were faintly perceptible the sounds of a human voice  the mouth of the cavern was partly concealed by a large stone on which were piled some masses of rotten brushwood as if for the purpose of protecting any inhabitant it might contain from the coldness of the atmosphere without  placed at the eastward boundary of the lake this strange place of refuge commanded a view not only of the rugged path immediately below it but of a large plot of level ground at a short distance to the west which overhung a second and lower range of rocks from this spot might be seen far beneath on days when the atmosphere was clear the olive grounds that clothed the mountains base and beyond stretching away to the distant horizon the plains of fated italy whose destiny of defeat and shame was now hastening to its dark and fearful accomplishment  the cavern within was low and irregular in form  from its rugged walls the damp oozed forth upon its floor of decayed moss  lizards and noisome animals had tenanted its comfortless recesses undisturbed until the period we have just described when their miserable rights were infringed on for the first time by human intruders  a woman crouched near the entrance of the place  more within on the driest part of the ground lay a child asleep  between them were scattered some withered branches and decayed leaves which were arranged as if to form a fire  in many parts this scanty collection of fuel was slightly blackened but wetted as it was by the rain all efforts to light it permanently had evidently been fruitless  the womans head was bent forwards and her face hid in her hands rested on her knees  at intervals she muttered to herself in a hoarse moaning voice  a portion of her scanty clothing had been removed to cover the child  what remained on her was composed partly of skins of animals partly of coarse cotton cloth  in many places this miserable dress was marked with blood and her long flaxen hair bore upon its dishevelled locks the same ominous and repulsive stain  the child seemed scarcely four years of age and showed on his pale thin face all the peculiarities of his gothic origin  his features seemed to have been once beautiful both in expression and form but a deep wound extending the whole length of his cheek had now deformed him for ever  he shivered and trembled in his sleep and every now and then mechanically stretched forth his little arms towards the dead cold branches that were scattered before him  suddenly a large stone became detached from the rock in a distant part of the cavern and fell noisily to the ground  at this sound he woke with a screamraised himselfendeavoured to advance towards the woman and staggered backward against the side of the cave  a second wound in the leg had wreaked that destruction on his vigour which the first had effected on his beauty  he was a cripple  at the instant of his awakening the woman had started up  she now raised him from the ground and taking some herbs from her bosom applied them to his wounded cheek  by this action her dress became discomposed  it was stiff at the top with coagulated blood which had evidently flowed from a cut in her neck  all her attempts to compose the child were in vain he moaned and wept piteously muttering at intervals his disjointed exclamations of impatience at the coldness of the place and the agony of his recent wounds  speechless and tearless the wretched woman looked vacantly down on his face  there was little difficulty in discerning from that fixed distracted gaze the nature of the tie that bound the mourning woman to the suffering boy  the expression of rigid and awful despair that lowered in her fixed gloomy eyes the livid paleness that discoloured her compressed lips the spasms that shook her firm commanding form mutely expressing in the divine eloquence of human emotion that between the solitary pair there existed the most intimate of earths relationshipsthe connection of mother and child  for some time no change occurred in the womans demeanour  at last as if struck by some sudden suspicion she rose and clasping the child in one arm displaced with the other the brushwood at the entrance of her place of refuge cautiously looking forth on all that the mists left visible of the western landscape  after a short survey she drew back as if reassured by the unbroken solitude of the place and turning towards the lake looked down upon the black waters at her feet  night has succeeded to night she muttered gloomily and has brought no succour to my body and no hope to my heart  mile on mile have i journeyed and danger is still behind and loneliness for ever before the shadow of death deepens over the boy the burden of anguish grows weightier than i can bear  for me friends are murdered defenders are distant possessions are lost  the god of the christian priests has abandoned us to danger and deserted us in woe  it is for me to end the struggle for us both  our last refuge has been in this placeour sepulchre shall be here as well  with one last look at the cold and comfortless sky she advanced to the very edge of the lakes precipitous bank  already the child was raised in her arms and her body bent to accomplish successfully the fatal spring when a sound in the eastfaint distant and fugitivecaught her ear  in an instant her eye brightened her chest heaved her cheek flushed  she exerted the last relics of her wasted strength to gain a prominent position upon a ledge of the rocks behind her and waited in an agony of expectation for a repetition of that magic sound   in a moment more she heard it againfor the child stupefied with terror at the action that had accompanied her determination to plunge with him into the lake now kept silence and she could listen undisturbed  to unpractised ears the sound that so entranced her would have been scarcely audible  even the experienced traveller would have thought it nothing more than the echo of a fallen stone among the rocks in the eastward distance  but to her it was no unimportant sound for it gave the welcome signal of deliverance and delight  as the hour wore on it came nearer and nearer tossed about by the sportive echoes and now clearly betraying that its origin was as she had at first divined the note of the gothic trumpet soon the distant music ceased and was succeeded by another sound low and rumbling as of an earthquake afar off or a rising thunderstorm and changing ere long to a harsh confused noise like the rustling of a mighty wind through whole forests of brushwood  at this instant the woman lost all command over herself her former patience and caution deserted her reckless of danger she placed the child upon the ledge on which she had been standing and though trembling in every limb succeeded in mounting so much higher on the crag as to gain a fissure near the top of the rock which commanded an uninterrupted view of the vast tracts of uneven ground leading in an easterly direction to the next range of precipices and ravines  one after another the long minutes glided on and though much was still audible nothing was yet to be seen  at length the shrill sound of the trumpet again rang through the dull misty air and the next instant the advance guard of an army of goths emerged from the distant woods  then after an interval the multitudes of the main body thronged through every outlet in the trees and spread in dusky masses over the desert ground that lay between the woods and the rocks about the borders of the lake  the front ranks halted as if to communicate with the crowds of the rearguard and the stragglers among the baggage waggons who still poured forth apparently in interminable hosts from the concealment of the distant trees  the advanced troops evidently with the intention of examining the roads still marched rapidly on until they gained the foot of the ascent leading to the crags to which the woman still clung and from which with eager attention she still watched their movements  placed in a situation of the extremest peril her strength was her only preservative against the danger of slipping from her high and narrow elevation  hitherto the moral excitement of expectation had given her the physical power necessary to maintain her position but just as the leaders of the guard arrived at the cavern her overwrought energies suddenly deserted her her hands relaxed their grasp she tottered and would have sunk backwards to instant destruction had not the skins wrapped about her bosom and waist become entangled with a point of one of the jagged rocks immediately around her  fortunatelyfor she could utter no crythe troops halted at this instant to enable their horses to gain breath  two among them at once perceived her position and detected her nation  they mounted the rocks and while one possessed himself of the child the other succeeded in rescuing the mother and bearing her safely to the ground  the snorting of horses the clashing of weapons the confusion of loud rough voices which now startled the native silence of the solitary lake and which would have bewildered and overwhelmed most persons in the womans exhausted condition seemed on the contrary to reassure her feelings and reanimate her powers  she disengaged herself from her preservers support and taking her child in her arms advanced towards a man of gigantic stature whose rich armour sufficiently announced that his position in the army was one of command  i am goisvintha said she in a firm calm voicesister to hermanric  i have escaped from the massacre of the hostages of aquileia with one child  is my brother with the army of the king  this declaration produced a marked change in the bystanders  the looks of indifference or curiosity which they had at first cast on the fugitive changed to the liveliest expression of wonder and respect the chieftain whom she had addressed raised the visor of his helmet so as to uncover his face answered her question in the affirmative and ordered two soldiers to conduct her to the temporary encampment of the main army in the rear  as she turned to depart an old man advanced leaning on his long heavy sword and accosted her thus  i am withimer whose daughter was left hostage with the romans in aquileia  is she of the slain or of the escaped  her bones rot under the city walls was the answer  the romans made of her a feast for the dogs  no word or tear escaped the old warrior  he turned in the direction of italy but as he looked downwards towards the plains his brow lowered and his hands tightened mechanically round the hilt of his enormous weapon  the same gloomy question was propounded to goisvintha by the two men who guided her to the army that had been asked by their aged comrade it received the same terrible answer which was borne with the same stern composure and followed by the same ominous glance in the direction of italy as in the instance of the veteran withimer  leading the horse that carried the exhausted woman with the utmost care and yet with wonderful rapidity down the paths which they had so recently ascended the men in a short space of time reached the place where the army had halted and displayed to goisvintha in all the majesty of numbers and repose the vast martial assemblage of the warriors of the north  no brightness gleamed from their armour no banners waved over their heads no music sounded among their ranks  backed by the dreary woods which still disgorged unceasing additions to the warlike multitude already encamped surrounded by the desolate crags which showed dim wild and majestic through the darkness of the mist covered with the dusky clouds which hovered motionless over the barren mountain tops and poured their stormy waters on the uncultivated plainsall that the appearance of the goths had of solemnity in itself was in awful harmony with the cold and mournful aspect that the face of nature had assumed silentmenacingdarkthe army looked the fit embodiment of its leaders tremendous purposethe subjugation of rome  conducting goisvintha quickly through the front files of warriors her guides pausing at a spot of ground which shelved upwards at right angles with the main road from the woods desired her to dismount and pointing to the group that occupied the place said yonder is alaric the king and with him is hermanric thy brother  at whatever point of view it could have been regarded the assemblage of persons thus indicated to goisvintha must have arrested inattention itself  near a confused mass of weapons scattered on the ground reclined a group of warriors apparently listening to the low muttered conversation of three men of great age who rose above them seated on pieces of rock and whose long white hair rough skin dresses and lean tottering forms appeared in strong contrast with the ironclad and gigantic figures of their auditors beneath  above the old men on the highroad was one of alarics waggons and on the heaps of baggage piled against its clumsy wheels had been chosen restingplace of the future conqueror of rome  the top of the vehicle seemed absolutely teeming with a living burden  perched in every available nook and corner were women and children of all ages and weapons and live stock of all varieties now a childlively mischievous inquisitivepeered forth over the head of a batteringram now a lean hungry sheep advanced his inquiring nostrils sadly to the open air and displayed by the movement the head of a withered old woman pillowed on his woolly flanks  here appeared a young girl struggling half entombed in shields  there gasped an emaciated campfollower nearly suffocated in heaps of furs the whole scene with its background of great woods drenched in a vapour of misty rain with its striking contrasts at one point and its solemn harmonies at another presented a vast combination of objects that either startled or aweda gloomy conjunction of the menacing and the sublime   bidding goisvintha wait near the waggon one of her conductors approached and motioned aside a young man standing near the king  as the warrior rose to obey the demand he displayed with all the physical advantages of his race and ease and elasticity of movement unusual among the men of his nation  at the instant when he joined the soldier who had accosted him his face was partially concealed by an immense helmet crowned with a boars head the mouth of which forced open at death gaped wide as if still raging for prey  but the man had scarcely stated his errand when he started violently removed the grim appendage of war and hastened bareheaded to the side of the waggon where goisvintha awaited his approach  the instant he was beheld by the woman she hastened to meet him placed the wounded child in his arms and greeted him with these words  your brother served in the armies of rome when our people were at peace with the empire of his household and his possessions this is all that the romans have left  she ceased and for an instant the brother and sister regarded each other in touching and expressive silence  though in addition to the general characteristics of country the countenances of the two naturally bore the more particular evidences of community of blood all resemblance between them at this instantso wonderful is the power of expression over featurehad utterly vanished  the face and manner of the young man he had numbered only twenty years expressed a deep sorrow manly in its stern tranquility sincere in its perfect innocence of display  as he looked on the child his blue eyesbright piercing and livelysoftened like a womans his lips hardly hidden by his short beard closed and quivered and his chest heaved under the armour that lay upon its noble proportions  there was in this simple speechless tearless melancholythis exquisite consideration of triumphant strength for suffering weaknesssomething almost sublime opposed as it was to the emotions of malignity and despair that appeared in goisvinthas features  the ferocity that gleamed from her dilated glaring eyes the sinister markings that appeared round her pale and parted lips the swelling of the large veins drawn to their extremest point of tension on her lofty forehead so distorted her countenance that the brother and sister as they stood together seemed in expression to have changed sexes for the moment  from the warrior came pity for the sufferer from the mother indignation for the offence  arousing himself from his melancholy contemplation of the child and as yet answering not a word to goisvintha hermanric mounted the waggon and placing the last of his sisters offspring in the arms of a decrepid old woman who sat brooding over some bundles of herbs spread out upon her lap addressed her thus  these wounds are from the romans  revive the child and you shall be rewarded from the spoils of rome  ha ha ha chuckled the crone hermanric is an illustrious warrior and shall be obeyed hermanric is great for his arm can slay but brunechild is greater than he for her cunning can cure  as if anxious to verify this boast before the warriors eyes the old woman immediately began the preparation of the necessary dressings from her store of herbs but hermanric waited not to be a witness of her skill  with one final look at the pale exhausted child he slowly descended from the waggon and approaching goisvintha drew her towards a sheltered position near the ponderous vehicle  here he seated himself by her side prepared to listen with the deepest attention to her recital of the scenes of terror and suffering through which she had so recently passed  you she began born while our nation was at peace transported from the field of war to those distant provinces where tranquility still prevailed preserved throughout your childhood from the chances of battle advanced to the army in your youth only when its toils are past and its triumphs are already at handyou alone have escaped the miseries of our people to partake in the glory of their approaching revenge  hardly had a year passed since you had been removed from the settlements of the goths when i wedded priulf  the race of triflers to whom he was then allied spite of their roman haughtiness deferred to him in their councils and confessed among their legions that he was brave  i saw myself with joy the wife of a warrior of renown i believed in my pride that i was destined to be the mother of a race of heroes when suddenly there came news to us that the emperor theodosius was dead  then followed anarchy among the people of the soil and outrages on the liberties of their allies the goths  ere long the call to arms arose among our nation  soon our waggons of war were rolled across the frozen danube our soldiers quitted the roman camp our husbandmen took their weapons from their cottage walls we that were women prepared with our children to follow our husbands to the field and alaric the king came forth as the leader of our hosts  we marched upon the territories of the greeks  but how shall i tell you of the events of those years of war that followed our invasion of the glory of our victories of the hardships of our defences of the miseries of our retreats of the hunger that we vanquished of the diseases that we endured of the shameful peace that was finally ratified against the wishes of our king  how shall i tell of all this when my thoughts are on the massacre from which i have just escapedwhen these first evils though once remembered in anguish are even now forgotten in the superior horrors that ensued  the truce was made  alaric departed with the remnant of his army and encamped at aemona on the confines of that land which he had already invaded and which he is now prepared to conquer  between our king and stilicho the general of the romans passed many messages for the leaders disputed on the terms of the peace that should be finally ordained meanwhile as an earnest of the gothic faith bands of our warriors and among them priulf were despatched into italy to be allies once more of the legions of rome and with them they took their wives and their children to be detained as hostages in the cities throughout the land  i and my children were conducted to aquileia  in a dwelling within the city we were lodged with our possessions  it was night when i took leave of priulf my husband at the gates  i watched him as he departed with the army and when the darkness hid him from my eyes i reentered the town from which i am the only woman of our nation who has escaped alive  as she pronounced these last words goisvinthas manner which had hitherto been calm and collected began to change  she paused abruptly in her narrative her head sunk upon her breast her frame quivered as if convulsed with violent agony  when she turned towards hermanric after an interval of silence to address him again the same malignant expression lowered over her countenance that had appeared on it when she presented to him her wounded child her voice became broken hoarse and unfeminine and pressing closely to the young mans side she laid her trembling fingers on his arm as if to bespeak his most undivided attention  time grew on she continued and still there came no tidings that the peace was finally secured  we that were hostages lived separate from the people of the town for we felt enmity towards each other even then in my captivity there was no employment for me but patienceno pursuit but hope  alone with my children i was wont to look forth over the sea towards the camp of our king but day succeeded to day and his warriors appeared not on the plains nor did priulf return with the legions to encamp before the gates of the town  so i mourned in my loneliness for my heart yearned towards the homes of my people i longed once more to look upon my husbands face and to behold again the ranks of our warriors and the majesty of their battle array   but already when the great day of despair was quickly drawing near a bitter outrage was preparing for me alone  the men who had hitherto watched us were changed and of the number of the new guards was one who cast on me the eyes of lust  night after night he poured his entreaties into my unwilling ear for in his vanity and shamelessness he believed that i who was gothic and the wife of a goth might be won by him whose parentage was but roman  soon from prayers he rose to threats and one night appearing before me with smiles he cried out that stilicho whose desire was to make peace with the goths had suffered for his devotion to our people the penalty of death that a time of ruin was approaching for us all and that he alonewhom i despisedcould preserve me from the anger of rome  as he ceased he approached me but i who had been in many battlefields felt no dread at the prospect of war and i spurned him with laughter from my presence  then for a few nights more my enemy approached me not again  until one evening as i sat on the terrace before the house with the child that you have beheld a helmetcrest suddenly fell at my feet and a voice cried to me from the garden beneath  priulf thy husband has been slain in a quarrel by the soldiers of rome  already the legions with whom he served are on their way to the town for a massacre of the hostages is ordained  speak but the word and i can save thee even yet  i looked on the crest  it was bloody and it was his  for an instant my heart writhed within me as i thought on my warrior whom i had loved then as i heard the messenger of death retire cursing from his lurkingplace in the garden i recollected that now my children had none but their mother to defend them and that peril was preparing for them from the enemies of their race  besides the little one in my arms i had two that were sleeping in the house  as i looked round bewildered and in despair to see if a chance were left us to escape there rang through the evening stillness the sound of a trumpet and the tramp of armed men was audible in the street beneath  then from all quarters of the town rose as one sudden sound the shrieks of women and the yells of men  already as i rushed towards my childrens beds the fiends of rome had mounted the stairs and waved in bloody triumph their reeking swords  i gained the steps and as i looked up they flung down at me the body of my youngest child  o hermanric hermanric it was the most beautiful and the most beloved  what the priests say that god should be to us that the fairest one of my offspring was to me  as i saw it mutilated and deadi who but an hour before had hushed it on my bosom to restmy courage forsook me and when the murderers advanced on me i staggered and fell  i felt the swordpoint enter my neck i saw the dagger gleam over the child in my arms i heard the deathshriek of the last victim above and then my senses failed me and i could listen and move no more  long must i have lain motionless at the foot of those fatal stairs for when i awoke from my trance the noises in the city were hushed and from her place in the firmament the moon shone softly into the deserted house  i listened to be certain that i was alone with my murdered children  no sound was in the dwelling the assassins had departed believing that their labour of blood was ended when i fell beneath their swords and i was able to crawl forth in security and to look my last upon my offspring that the romans had slain  the child that i held to my breast still breathed  i stanched with some fragments of my garment the wounds that he had received and laying him gently by the stairsin the moonlight so that i might see him when he movedi groped in the shadow of the wall for my first murdered and my last born for that youngest and fairest one of my offspring whom they had slaughtered before my eyes  when i touched the corpse it was wet with blood i felt its face and it was cold beneath my hands i raised its body in my arms and its limbs already were rigid in death  then i thought of the eldest child who lay dead in the chamber above  but my strength was failing me fast  i had an infant who might yet be preserved and i knew that if morning dawned on me in the house all chances of escape were lost for ever  so though my heart was cold within me at leaving my childs corpse to the mercy of the romans i took up the dead and the wounded one in my arms and went forth into the garden and thence towards the seaward quarter of the town   i passed through the forsaken streets  sometimes i stumbled against the body of a childsometimes the moonlight showed me the deathpale face of some woman of my nation whom i had loved stretched upward to the sky but i still advanced until i gained the wall of the town and heard on the other side the waters of the river running onward to the port of aquileia and the sea  i looked around  the gates i knew were guarded and closed  by the wall was the only prospect of escape but its top was high and its sides were smooth when i felt them with my hands  despairing and wearied i laid my burdens down where they were hidden by the shade and walked forward a few paces for to remain still was a torment that i could not endure  at a short distance i saw a soldier sleeping against the wall of a house  by his side was a ladder placed against the window  as i looked up i beheld the head of a corpse resting on its top the victim must have been lately slain for her blood still dripped slowly down into an empty winepot that stood within the soldiers reach  when i saw the ladder hope revived within me i removed it to the walli mounted and laid my dead child on the great stones at its topi returned and placed my wounded boy by the corpse slowly and with many efforts i dragged the ladder upwards until from its own weight one end fell to the ground on the other side  as i had risen so i descended  in the sand of the riverbank i scraped a hole and buried there the corpse of the infant for i could carry the weight of two no longer  then with my wounded child i reached some caverns that lay onward near the seashore  there throughout the next day i lay hiddenalone with my sufferings of body and my affliction of heartuntil the night came on when i set forth on my journey to the mountains for i knew that at aemona in the camp of the warriors of my people lay the only refuge that was left to me on earth  feebly and slowly hiding by day and travelling by night i kept on my way until i gained that lake among the rocks where the guards of the army came forward and rescued me from death  she ceased  throughout the latter portion of her narrative her demeanour had been calm and sad and as she dwelt with the painful industry of grief over each minute circumstance connected with the bereavements she had sustained her voice softened to those accents of quiet mournfulness which make impressive the most simple words and render musical the most unsteady tones  it seemed as if those tenderer and kinder emotions which the attractions of her offspring had once generated in her character had at the bidding of memory become revivified in her manner while she lingered over the recital of their deaths  for a brief space of time she looked fixedly and anxiously upon the countenance of hermanric which was half averted from her and expressed a fierce and revengeful gloom that sat unnaturally on it noble lineaments  then turning from him she buried her face in her hands and made no effort more to attract him to attention or incite him to reply  this solemn silence kept by the bereaved woman and the brooding man had lasted but a few minutes when a harsh trembling voice was heard from the top of the waggon calling at intervals hermanric  hermanric  at first the young man remained unmoved by those discordant and repulsive tones  they repeated his name however so often and so perseveringly that he noticed them ere long and rising suddenly as if impatient of the interruption advanced towards the side of the waggon from which the mysterious summons appeared to come  as he looked up towards the vehicle the voice ceased and he saw that the old woman to whom he had confided the child was the person who had called him so hurriedly but a few moments before  her tottering body clothed in bearskins was bent forward over a large triangular shield of polished brass on which she leant her lank shrivelled arms  her head shook with a tremulous palsied action a leer half smile half grimace distended her withered lips and lightened her sunken eyes sinister cringing repulsive her face livid with the reflection from the weapon that was her support and her figure scarcely human in the rugged garments that encompassed its gaunt proportions she seemed a deformity set up by evil spirits to mock the majesty of the human forman embodied satire on all that is most deplorable in infirmity and most disgusting in age   the instant she discerned hermanric she stretched her body out still farther over the shield and pointing to the interior of the waggon muttered softly that one fearful and expressive worddead  without waiting for any further explanation the young goth mounted the vehicle and gaining the old womans side saw stretched on her collection of herbsbeautiful in the sublime and melancholy stillness of deaththe corpse of goisvinthas last child  is hermanric wroth whined the hag quailing before the steady rebuking glance of the young man  when i said that brunechild was greater than hermanric i lied  it is hermanric that is most powerful see the dressings were placed on the wounds and though the child has died shall not the treasures that were promised me be mine  i have done what i could but my cunning begins to desert me for i am oldoldold  i have seen my generation pass away aha  i am old hermanric i am old  when the young warrior looked on the child he saw that the hag had spoken truth and that the victim had died from no fault of hers  pale and serene the countenance of the boy showed how tranquil had been his death  the dressings had been skilfully composed and carefully applied to his wounds but suffering and privation had annihilated the feebleness of human resistance in their march toward the last dread goal and the treachery of imperial rome had once more triumphed as was its wont and triumphed over a child  as hermanric descended with the corpse goisvintha was the first object that met his eyes when he alighted on the ground  the mother received from him the lifeless burden without an exclamation or a tear  that emanation from her former and kinder self which had been produced by the closing recital of her sufferings was henceforth at the signal of her last childs death extinguished in her for ever  his wounds had crippled him said the young man gloomily  he could never have fought with the warriors  our ancestors slew themselves when they were no longer vigorous for the fight  it is better that he has died  vengeance gasped goisvintha pressing up closely to his side  we will have vengeance for the massacre of aquileia  when blood is streaming in the palaces of rome remember my murdered children and hasten not to sheathe thy sword  at this instant as if to rouse still further the fierce determination that appeared already in the face of the young goth the voice of alaric was heard commanding the army to advance hermanric started and drew the panting woman after him to the restingplace of the king there armed at all points and rising by his superior stature high above the throng around him stood the dreaded captain of the gothic hosts  his helmet was raised so as to display his clear blue eyes gleaming over the multitude around him he pointed with his sword in the direction of italy and as rank by rank the men started to their arms and prepared exultingly for the march his lips parted with a smile of triumph and ere he moved to accompany them he spoke thus  warriors of the goths our halt is a short one among the mountains but let not the weary repine for the glorious restingplace that awaits our labours is the city of rome  the curse of odin when in the infancy of our nation he retired before the myriads of the empire it is our privilege to fulfil  that future destruction which he denounced against rome it is ours to effect  remember your hostages that the romans have slain your possessions that the romans have seized your trust that the romans have betrayed  remember that i your king have within me that supernatural impulse which never deceives and which calls to me in a voice of encouragementadvance and the empire is thine  assemble the warriors and the city of the world shall be delivered to the conquering goths  let us onward without delay our prey awaits us  our triumph is near  our vengeance is at hand  he paused and at that moment the trumpet gave signal for the march   up up cried hermanric seizing goisvintha by the arm and pointing to the waggon which had already begun to move make ready for the journey  i will charge myself with the burial of the child  yet a few days and our encampment may be before aquileia  be patient and i will avenge thee in the palaces of rome  the mighty mass moved  the multitude stretched forth over the barren ground and even now the warriors in front of the army might be seen by those in the rear mounting the last range of passes that lay between the plains of italy and the goths    chapter 2  the court  the traveller who so far departs from the ordinary track of tourists in modern italy as to visit the city of ravenna remembers with astonishment as he treads its silent and melancholy streets and beholds vineyards and marshes spread over an extent of four miles between the adriatic and the town that this place now half deserted was once the most populous of roman fortresses and that where fields and woods now present themselves to his eyes the fleets of the empire once rode securely at anchor and the merchant of rome disembarked his precious cargoes at his warehouse door  as the power of rome declined the adriatic by a strange fatality began to desert the fortress whose defence it had hitherto secured coeval with the gradual degeneracy of the people was the gradual withdrawal of the ocean from the city walls until at the beginning of the sixth century a grove of pines already appeared where the port of augustus once existed  at the period of our storythough the sea had even then receded perceptiblythe ditches round the walls were yet filled and the canals still ran through the city in much the same manner as they intersect venice at the present time  on the morning that we are about to describe the autumn had advanced some days since the events mentioned in the preceding chapter although the sun was now high in the eastern horizon the restlessness produced by the heat emboldened a few idlers of ravenna to brave the sultriness of the atmosphere in the vain hope of being greeted by a breeze from the adriatic as they mounted the seaward ramparts of the town  on attaining their destined elevation these sanguine citizens turned their faces with fruitless and despairing industry towards every point of the compass but no breath of air came to reward their perseverance nothing could be more thoroughly suggestive of the undiminished universality of the heat than the view in every direction from the position they then occupied  the stone houses of the city behind them glowed with a vivid brightness overpowering to the strongest eyes the light curtains hung motionless over the lonely windows  no shadows varied the brilliant monotony of the walls or softened the lively glitter on the waters of the fountains beneath not a ripple stirred the surface of the broad channel that now replaced the ancient harbour not a breath of wind unfolded the scorching sails of the deserted vessels at the quay  over the marshes in the distance hung a hot quivering mist and in the vineyards near the town not a leaf waved upon its slender stem  on the seaward side lay vast and level the prospect of the burning sand and beyond it the main oceanwaveless torpid and suffused in a flood of fierce brightnessstretched out to the cloudless horizon that closed the sunbright view   within the town in those streets where the tall houses cast a deep shadow on the flagstones of the road the figures of a few slaves might here and there be seen sleeping against the walls or gossiping languidly on the faults of their respective lords  sometimes an old beggar might be observed hunting on the wellstocked preserves of his own body the lively vermin of the south  sometimes a restless child crawled from a doorstep to paddle in the stagnant waters of a kennel but with the exception of these doubtful evidences of human industry the prevailing characteristic of the few groups of the lowest orders of the people which appeared in the streets was the most listless and utter indolence  all that gave splendour to the city at other hours of the day was at this period hidden from the eye  the elegant courtiers reclined in their lofty chambers the guards on duty ensconced themselves in angles of walls and recesses of porticoes the graceful ladies slumbered on perfumed couches in darkened rooms the gilded chariots were shut into the carriagehouses the prancing horses were confined in the stables and even the wares in the marketplaces were removed from exposure to the sun  it was clear that the luxurious inhabitants of ravenna recognised no duties of sufficient importance and no pleasures of sufficient attraction to necessitate the exposure of their susceptible bodies to the noontide heat  to give the reader some idea of the manner in which the indolent patricians of the court loitered away their noon and to satisfy at the same time the exigencies attaching to the conduct of this story it is requisite to quit the loungingplaces of the plebeians in the streets for the couches of the nobles in the emperors palace  passing through the massive entrance gates crossing the vast hall of the imperial abode with its statues its marbles and its guards in attendance and thence ascending the noble staircase the first object that might on this occasion have attracted the observer when he gained the approaches to the private apartments was a door at an extremity of the corridor richly carved and standing half open  at this spot were grouped some fifteen or twenty individuals who conversed by signs and maintained in all their movements the most decorous and complete silence  sometimes one of the party stole on tiptoe to the door and looked cautiously through returning almost instantaneously and expressing to his next neighbour by various grimaces his immense interest in the sight he had just beheld  occasionally there came from this mysterious chamber sounds resembling the cackling of poultry varied now and then by a noise like the falling of a shower of small light substances upon a hard floor  whenever these sounds were audible the members of the party outside the door looked round upon each other and smiledsome sarcastically some triumphantly  a few among these patient expectants grasped rolls of vellum in their hands the rest held nosegays of rare flowers or supported in their arms small statues and pictures in mosaic  of their number some were painters and poets some orators and philosophers and some statuaries and musicians among such a motley assemblage of professions remarkable in all ages of the world for fostering in their votaries the vice of irritability it may seem strange that so quiet and orderly a behaviour should exist as that just described  but it is to be observed that in attending at the palace these men of genius made sure at least of outward unanimity among their ranks by coming equally prepared with one accomplishment and equally animated by one hope they waited to employ a common agentflattery to attain a common endgain  the chamber thus sacred even from the intrusion of intellectual inspiration although richly ornamented was of no remarkable extent at other times the eye might have wandered with delight on the exquisite plants and flowers scattered profusely over a noble terrace to which a second door in the apartment conducted but at the present moment the employment of the occupant of the room was of so extraordinary a nature that the most attentive observation must have missed all the inferior characteristics of the place to settle immediately on its inhabitant alone   in the midst of a large flock of poultry which seemed strangely misplaced on a floor of marble and under a gilded roof stood a pale thin debilitated youth magnificently clothed and holding in his hand a silver vase filled with grain which he ever and anon distributed to the cackling multitude at his feet  nothing could be more pitiably effeminate than the appearance of this young man  his eyes were heavy and vacant his forehead low and retiring his cheeks sallow and his form curved as if with a premature old age  an unmeaning smile dilated his thin colourless lips and as he looked down on his strange favourites he occasionally whispered to them a few broken expressions of endearment almost infantine in their simplicity  his whole soul seemed to be engrossed by the labour of distributing his grain and he followed the different movements of the poultry with an earnestness of attention which seemed almost idiotic in its ridiculous intensity  if it be asked why a person so contemptible as this solitary youth has been introduced with so much care and described with so much minuteness it must be answered that though destined to form no important figure in this work he played from his position a remarkable part in the great drama on which it is foundedfor this feeder of chickens was no less a person than honorius emperor of rome  it is the very imbecility of this man at such a time as that we now write on which invests his character with a fearful interest in the eye of posterity  in himself the impersonation of the meanest vices inherent in the vicious civilisation of his period to his feebleness was accorded the terrible responsibility of liberating the longprisoned storm whose elements we have attempted to describe in the preceding chapter  with just intellect enough to be capricious and just determination enough to be mischievous he was an instrument fitted for the uses of every ambitious villain who could succeed in gaining his ear  to flatter his puerile tyranny the infatuated intriguers of the court rewarded the heroic stilicho for the rescue of his country with the penalty of death and defrauded alaric of the moderate concessions that they had solemnly pledged themselves to perform  to gratify his vanity he was paraded in triumph through the streets of rome for a victory that others had gained  to pander to his arrogance by an exhibition of the vilest privilege of that power which had been intrusted to him for good the massacre of the helpless hostages confided by gothic honour to roman treachery was unhesitatingly ordained and finally to soothe the turbulence of his unmanly fears the last act of his unscrupulous councillors ere the empire fell was to authorise his abandoning his people in the hour of peril careless who suffered in defenceless rome while he was secure in fortified ravenna  such was the man under whom the mightiest of the worlds structures was doomed to totter to its fall  such was the figure destined to close a scene which time and glory had united to hallow and adorn  raised and supported by a superhuman daring that invested the nauseous horrors of incessant bloodshed with a rude and appalling magnificence the mistress of nations was now fated to sink by the most ignoble of defeats under the most abject of tremblers for this had the rough old kingdom shaken off its enemies by swarms from its vigorous arms  for this had the doubtful virtues of the republic and the perilous magnificence of the empire perplexed and astonished the world in such a conclusion as honorius ended the dignified barbarities of a brutus the polished splendours of an augustus the unearthly atrocities of a nero and the immortal virtues of a trajan  vainly through the toiling ages over the ruin of her noblest hearts and the prostitution of her grandest intellects had rome striven pitilessly onward grasping at the shadowglory the fiat had now gone forth that doomed her to possess herself finally of the substanceshame  when the imperial trifler had exhausted his store of grain and satisfied the cravings of his voracious favourites he was relieved of his silver vase by two attendants  the flock of poultry was then ushered out at one door while the flock of geniuses was ushered in at the other  leaving the emperor to cast his languid eyes over objects of art for which he had no admiration and to open his unwilling ears to panegyrical orations for which he had no comprehension we proceed to introduce the reader to an apartment on the opposite side of the palace in which are congregated all the beauty and elegance of his court   imagine a room two hundred feet long and proportionably broad  its floor is mosaic wrought into the loveliest patterns  its sides are decorated with immense pillars of variegated marble the recesses formed by which are occupied by statues all arranged in exquisite variety of attitude so as to appear to be offering to whoever approaches them the rare flowers which it is the duty of the attendants to place in their hands  the ceiling is painted in fresco in patterns and colours harmonising with those on the mosaic floor  the cornices are of silver and decorated with mottoes from the amatory poets of the day the letters of which are formed by precious stones  in the middle of the room is a fountain throwing up streams of perfumed water and surrounded by golden aviaries containing birds of all sizes and nations  three large windows placed at the eastern extremity of the apartment look out upon the adriatic but are covered at this hour from the outside with silk curtains of a delicate green shade which cast a soft luxurious light over every object but are so thinly woven and so skilfully arranged that the slightest breath of air which moves without finds its way immediately to the languid occupants of the court waitingroom  the number of these individuals amounts to about fifty or sixty persons  by far the larger half of the assemblage are women their black hair tastefully braided into various forms and adorned with flowers or precious stones contrasts elegantly with the brilliant whiteness of the robes in which they are for the most part clothed some of them are occupied in listlessly watching the movements of the birds in the aviaries others hold a languid and whispered conversation with such of the courtiers as happen to be placed near them  the men exhibit in their dresses a greater variety of colour and in their occupations a greater fertility of resource than the women  their garments of the lightest rose violet or yellow tints diversify fantastically the monotonous white robes of their gentle companions of their employments the most conspicuous are playing on the lute gaming with dice teasing their lapdogs and insulting their parasites whatever their occupation it is performed with little attention and less enthusiasm  some recline on their couches with closed eyes as if the heat made the labour of using their organs of vision too much for them others in the midst of a conversation suddenly leave a sentence unfinished apparently incapacitated by lassitude from giving expression to the simplest ideas  every sight in the apartment that attracts the eye every sound that gains the ear expresses a luxurious repose no brilliant light mars the pervading softness of the atmosphere no violent colour materialises the light ethereal hues of the dresses no sudden noises interrupt the fitful and plaintive notes of the lute jar with the soft twittering of the birds in the aviaries or drown the still regular melody of the ladies voices  all objects animate and inanimate are in harmony with each other  it is a scene of spiritualised indolencea picture of dreamy beatitude in the inmost sanctuary of unruffled repose  amid this assemblage of beauty and nobility the members of which were rather to be generally noticed than particularly observed there was however one individual who both by the solitary occupation he had chosen and his accidental position in the room was personally remarkable among the listless patricians around him  his couch was placed nearer the window than that of any other occupant of the chamber some of his indolent neighboursespecially those of the gentler sexoccasionally regarded him with mingled looks of admiration and curiosity but no one approached him or attempted to engage him in conversation  a piece of vellum lay by his side on which from time to time he traced a few words and then resumed his reclining position apparently absorbed in reflection and utterly regardless of all the occupants male and female of the imperial apartment  judging from his general appearance he could scarcely be twentyfive years of age  the conformation of the upper part of his face was thoroughly intellectualthe forehead high broad and upright the eyes clear penetrating and thoughtfulbut the lower part was on the other hand undeniably sensual  the lips full and thick formed a disagreeable contrast to the delicate chiselling of the straight grecian nose while the fleshiness of the chin and the jovial redundancy of the cheeks were in their turn utterly at variance with the character of the pale noble forehead and the expression of the quick intelligent eyes  in stature he was barely of the middle size but every part of his body was so perfectly proportioned that he appeared in any position taller than he really was  the upper part of his dress thrown open from the heat partly disclosed the fine statuesque formation of his neck and chest his ears hands and feet were of that smallness and delicacy which is held to denote the aristocracy of birth and there was in his manner that indescribable combination of unobtrusive dignity and unaffected elegance which in all ages and countries and through all changes of manners and customs has rendered the demeanour of its few favoured possessors the instantaneous interpreter of their social rank   while the patrician was still occupied over his vellum the following conversation took place in whispers between two ladies placed near the situation he occupied  tell me camilla said the eldest and stateliest of the two who is the courtier so occupied in composition  i have endeavoured i know not how often to catch his eye but the man will look at nothing but his roll of vellum or the corners of the room  what are you so great a stranger in italy as not to know him replied the other a lively girl of small delicate form who fidgeted with persevering restlessness on her couch and seemed incapable of giving an instants steady attention to any of the objects around her by all the saints martyrs and relics of my uncle the bishop  hush  you should not swear  not swear  why i am making a new collection of oaths intended solely for ladies use  i intend to set the fashion of swearing by them myself  but answer my question i beseech you  will you never learn to talk on one subject at a time  your questionah your question  it was about the goths  no no  it was about that man who is incessantly writing and will look at nobody  he is almost as provoking as camilla herself  dont frown so  that man as you call him is the senator vetranio  the lady started  it was evident that vetranio had a reputation  yes continued the lively camilla that is the accomplished vetranio but he will be no favourite of yours for he sometimes swearsswears by the ancient gods too which is forbidden  he is handsome  handsome he is beautiful  not a woman in italy but is languishing for him  i have heard that he is clever  who has not  he is the author of some of the most celebrated sauces of the age  cooks of all nations worship him as an oracle  then he writes poetry and composes music and paints pictures  and as for philosophyhe talks it better than my uncle the bishop  is he rich  ah my uncle the bishopi must tell you how i helped vetranio to make a satire on him when i was staying with him at rome i used often to see a woman in a veil taken across the garden to his study so to perplex him i asked him who she was  and he frowned and stammered and said at first that i was disrespectful but he told me afterwards that she was an arian whom he was labouring to convert  so i thought i should like to see how this conversion went on and i hid myself behind a bookcase  but it is a profound secret i tell it you in confidence  i dont care to know it  tell me about vetranio  how illnatured you are  oh i shall never forget how we laughed when i told vetranio what i had seen  he took up his writing materials and made the satire immediately  the next day all rome heard of it  my uncle was speechless with rage  i believe he suspected me but he gave up converting the arian lady and  i ask you againis vetranio rich   half sicily is his  he has immense estates in africa olivegrounds in syria and cornfields in gaul  i was present at an entertainment he gave at his villa in sicily  he fitted up one of his vessels from the descriptions of the furnishing of cleopatras galley and made his slaves swim after us as attendant tritons  oh it was magnificent  i should like to know him  you should see his cats  he has a perfect legion of them at his villa twelve slaves are employed to attend on them  he is mad about cats and declares that the old egyptians were right to worship them he told me yesterday that when his largest cat is dead he will canonise her in spite of the christians  and then he is so kind to his slaves  they are never whipped or punished except when they neglect or disfigure themselves for vetranio will allow nothing that is ugly or dirty to come near him  you must visit his banquetinghall in rome  it is perfection  but why is he here  he has come to ravenna charged with some secret message from the senate and has presented a rare breed of chickens to that foolish  hush you may be overheard  wellto that wise emperor of ours  ah the palace has been so pleasant since he has been here  at this instant the above dialoguefrom the frivolity of which the universallylearned readers of modern times will we fear recoil with contemptwas interrupted by a movement on the part of its hero which showed that his occupation was at an end  with the elaborate deliberation of a man who disdains to exhibit himself as liable to be hurried by any mortal affair vetranio slowly folded up the vellum he had now filled with writing and depositing it in his bosom made a sign to a slave who happened to be then passing near him with a dish of fruit  having received his message the slave retired to the entrance of the apartment and beckoning to a man who stood outside the door motioned him to approach vetranios couch  this individual immediately hurried across the room to the window where the elegant roman awaited him  not the slightest description of him is needed for he belonged to a class with which moderns are as well acquainted as ancientsa class which has survived all changes of nations and mannersa class which came in with the first rich man in the world and will only go out with the last  in a word he was a parasite  he enjoyed however one great superiority over his modern successors in his day flattery was a professionin ours it has sunk to a pursuit  i shall leave ravenna this evening said vetranio  the parasite made three low bows and smiled ecstatically  you will order my travelling equipage to be at the palace gates an hour before sunset  the parasite declared he should never forget the honour of the commission and left the room  the sprightly camilla who had overheard vetranios command jumped off her couch as soon as the parasites back was turned and running up to the senator began to reproach him for the determination he had just formed  have you no compunction at leaving me to the dulness of this horrible palace to satisfy your idle fancy for going to rome said she pouting her pretty lip and playing with a lock of the dark brown hair that clustered over vetranios brow   has the senator vetranio so little regard for his friends as to leave them to the mercy of the goths said another lady advancing with a winning smile to camillas side  ah those goths exclaimed vetranio turning to the last speaker tell me julia is it not reported that the barbarians are really marching into italy  everybody has heard of it  the emperor is so discomposed by the rumour that he has forbidden the very name of the goths to be mentioned in his presence again  for my part continued vetranio drawing camilla towards him and playfully tapping her little dimpled hand i am in anxious expectation of the goths for i have designed a statue of minerva for which i can find no model so fit as a woman of that troublesome nation  i am informed upon good authority that their limbs are colossal and their sense of propriety most obediently pliable under the discipline of the purse  if the goths supply you with a model for anything said a courtier who had joined the group while vetranio was speaking it will be with a representation of the burning of your palace at rome which they will enable you to paint from the inexhaustible reservoir of your own wounds  the individual who uttered this last observation was remarkable among the brilliant circle around him by his excessive ugliness  urged by his personal disadvantages and the loss of all his property at the gamingtable he had latterly personated a character the accomplishments attached to which rescued him by their disagreeable originality in that frivolous age from oblivion or contempt  he was a cynic philosopher  his remark however produced no other effect on his hearers serenity than to excite their merriment  vetranio laughed camilla laughed julia laughed  the idea of a troop of barbarians ever being able to burn a palace at rome was too wildly ridiculous for any ones gravity and as the speech was repeated in other parts of the room in spite of their dulness and lassitude the whole court laughed  i know not why i should be amused by that mans nonsense said camilla suddenly becoming grave at the very crisis of a most attractive smile when i am so melancholy at the thought of vetranios departure what will become of me when he is gone  alas who will be left in the palace to compose songs to my beauty and music for my lute who will paint me as venus and tell me stories about the ancient egyptians and their cats  who at the banquet will direct what dishes i am to choose and what i am to reject  whoand poor little camilla stopped suddenly in her enumeration of the pleasures she was about to lose and seemed on the point of weeping as piteously as she had been laughing rapturously but the instant before  vetranio was touchednot by the compliment to his more intellectual powers but by the admission of his convivial supremacy as a guide to the banquet contained in the latter part of camillas remonstrance the sex were then as now culpably deficient in gastronomic enthusiasm it was therefore a perfect triumph to have made a convert to the science of the youngest and loveliest of the ladies of the court  if she can gain leave of absence said the gratified senator camilla shall accompany me to rome and shall be present at the first celebration of my recent discovery of a nightingale sauce  camilla was in ecstasies  she seized vetranios cheeks between her rosy little fingers kissed him as enthusiastically as a child kisses a new toy and darted gaily off to prepare for her departure   vetranio would be better employed sneered the cynic in inventing new salves for future wounds than new sauces for future nightingales his carcase will be carved by gothic swords as a feast for the worms before his birds are spitted with roman skewers as a feast for his guests  is this a time for cutting statues and concocting sauces  fie on the senators who abandon themselves to such pursuits as vetranios  i have other designs replied the object of all this moral indignation looking with insulting indifference on the cynics repulsive countenance which from their immense importance to the world must meet with universal approval  the labour that i have just achieved forms one of a series of three projects which i have for some time held in contemplation  the first is an analysis of the new priesthood the second a true personification both by painting and sculpture of venus the third a discovery of what has been hitherto uninventeda nightingale sauce  by the inscrutable wisdom of fate it has been so willed that the last of the objects i proposed to myself has been the first attained  the sauce is composed and i have just concluded on this vellum the ode that is to introduce it at my table the analysation will be my next labour  it will take the form of a treatise in which making the experience of past years the groundwork of prophecy for the future i shall show the precise number of additional dissensions controversies and quarrels that will be required to enable the new priesthood to be themselves the destroyers of their own worship  i shall ascertain by an exact computation the year in which this destruction will be consummated and i have by me as the materials for my work an historical summary of christian schisms and disputes in rome for the last hundred years  as for my second design the personification of venus it is of appalling difficulty it demands an investigation of the women of every nation under the sun a comparison of the relative excellences and peculiarities of their several charms and a combination of all that is loveliest in the infinite variety of their most prominent attractions under one form to forward the execution of this arduous project my tenants at home and my slavemerchants abroad have orders to send to my villa in sicily all women who are born most beautiful in the empire or can be brought most beautiful from the nations around  i will have them displayed before me of every shade in complexion and of every peculiarity in form  at the fitting period i shall commence my investigations undismayed by difficulty and determined on success  never yet has the true venus been personified  should i accomplish the task how exquisite will be my triumph  my work will be the altar at which thousands will offer up the softest emotions of the heart  it will free the prisoned imagination of youth and freshen the fading recollections on the memory of age  vetranio paused  the cynic was struck dumb with indignation  a solitary zealot for the church who happened to be by frowned at the analysation  the ladies tittered at the personification  the gastronomists chuckled at the nightingale sauce but for the first few minutes no one spoke  during this temporary embarrassment vetranio whispered a few words in julias ear andjust as the cynic was sufficiently recovered to retortaccompanied by the lady he quitted the room  never was popularity more unalloyed than vetranios  gifted with a disposition the pliability of which adapted itself to all emergencies his generosity disarmed enemies while his affability made friends munificent without assumption successful without pride he obliged with grace and shone with safety  people enjoyed his hospitality for they knew that it was disinterested and admired his acquirements for they felt that they were unobtrusive  sometimes as in his dialogue with the cynic the whim of the moment or the sting of a sarcasm drew from him a hint at his station or a display of his eccentricities but as he was always the first soon afterwards to lead the laugh at his own outbreak his credit as a noble suffered nothing by his infirmity as a man  gaily and attractively he moved in all grades of the society of his age winning his social laurels in every rank without making a rival to dispute their possession or an enemy to detract from their value   on quitting the court waitingroom vetranio and julia descended the palace stairs and passed into the emperors garden  used generally as an evening lounge this place was now untenanted save by the few attendants engaged in cultivating the flowerbeds and watering the smooth shady lawns  entering one of the most retired of the numerous summerhouses among the trees vetranio motioned his companion to take a seat and then abruptly addressed her in the following words  i have heard that you are about to depart for romeis it true  he asked this question in a low voice and with a manner in its earnestness strangely at variance with the volatile gaiety which had characterised him but a few moments before among the nobles of the court  as julia answered him in the affirmative his countenance expressed a lively satisfaction and seating himself by her side he continued the conversation thus  if i thought that you intended to stay for any length of time in the city i should venture upon a fresh extortion from your friendship by asking you to lend me your little villa at aricia  you shall take with you to rome an order on my steward to place everything there at your entire disposal  my generous julia  you are of the gifted few who really know how to confer a favour  another woman would have asked me why i wanted the villayou give it unreservedly  so delicate an unwillingness to intrude on a secret reminds me that the secret should now be yours  to explain the easy confidence that existed between vetranio and julia it is necessary to inform the reader that the ladyalthough still attractive in appearancewas of an age to muse on her past rather than to meditate on her future conquests  she had known her eccentric companion from his boyhood had been once flattered in his verses and was sensible enoughnow that her charms were on the waneto be as content with the friendship of the senator as she had formerly been enraptured with the adoration of the youth  you are too penetrating resumed vetranio after a short pause not to have already suspected that i only require your villa to assist me in the concealment of an intrigue  so peculiar is my adventure in its different circumstances that to make use of my palace as the scene of its development would be to risk a discovery which might produce the immediate subversion of all my designs  but i fear the length of my confession will exceed the duration of your patience  you have aroused my curiosity  i could listen to you for ever  a short time before i took my departure from rome for this place continued vetranio i encountered an adventure of the most extraordinary nature which has haunted me with the most extraordinary perseverance and which will have i feel assured the most extraordinary results  i was sitting one evening in the garden of my palace on the pincian mount occupied in trying a new composition on my lute  in one of the pauses of the melody which was tender and plaintive i heard sounds that resembled the sobbing of some one in distress among the trees behind me  i looked cautiously round and discerned halfhidden by the verdure the figure of a young girl who appeared to be listening to the music with the most entranced attention flattered by such a testimony to my skill and anxious to gain a nearer view of my mysterious visitant i advanced towards her hidingplace forgetting in my haste to continue playing on the lute the instant the music ceased she discerned me and disappeared determined to behold her i again struck the chords and in a few minutes i saw her white robe once more among the trees  i redoubled my efforts  i played with the utmost expression the most pathetic parts of the melody  as if under the influence of a charm she began to advance towards me now hesitating now moving back a few steps now approaching halfreluctantly half willingly until utterly vanquished by the long trembling close of the last cadence of the air she ran suddenly up to me and falling at my feet raised her hands as if to implore my pardon  truly this was no common tribute to your skill  did she speak to you   she uttered not a word continued vetranio  her large soft eyes bright with tears looked piteously up in my face her delicate lips trembled as if she wished to speak but dared not her smooth round arms were the very perfection of beauty  child as she seemed in years and emotions she looked a woman in loveliness and form  for the moment i was too much astonished by the suddenness of her supplicating action to move or speak  as soon as i recovered myself i attempted to fondle and console her but she shrunk from my embrace and seemed inclined to escape from me again until i touched once more the strings of the lute and then she uttered a subdued exclamation of delight nestled close up to me and looked into my face with such a strange expression of mingled adoration and rapture that i declare to you julia i felt as bashful before her as a boy  you bashful  the senator vetranio bashful exclaimed julia looking up with an expression of the most unfeigned incredulity and astonishment  the lute pursued vetranio gravely without heeding the interruption was my sole means of procuring any communication with her  if i ceased playing we were as strangers if i resumed we were as friends so subduing the notes of the instrument while she spoke to me in a soft tremulous musical voice i still continued to play  by this plan i discovered at our first interview that she was the daughter of one numerian that she was on the point of completing her fourteenth year and that she was called antonina  i had only succeeded in gaining this mere outline of her story when as if struck by some sudden apprehension she tore herself from me with a look of the utmost terror and entreating me not to follow her if i ever desired to see her again she disappeared rapidly among the trees  more and more wonderful  and in your new character of a bashful man you doubtless obeyed her injunctions  i did replied the senator but the next evening i revisited the garden grove and as soon as i struck the chords as if by magic she again approached  at this second interview i learned the reason of her mysterious appearances and departures  her father she told me was one of a new sect who imaginewith what reason it is impossible to comprehendthat they recommend themselves to their deity by making their lives one perpetual round of bodily suffering and mental anguish not content with distorting all his own feelings and faculties this tyrant perpetrated his insane austerities upon the poor child as well he forbade her to enter a theatre to look on sculpture to read poetry to listen to music  he made her learn long prayers and attend to interminable sermons  he allowed her no companions of her own agenot even girls like herself  the only recreation that she could obtain was the permissiongranted with much reluctance and many rebukesto cultivate a little garden which belonged to the house they lived in and joined at one point the groves round my palace  there while she was engaged over her flowers she first heard the sound of my lute for many months before i had discovered her she had been in the habit of climbing the enclosure that bounded her garden and hiding herself among the trees to listen to the music whenever her fathers concerns took him abroad  she had been discovered in this occupation by an old man appointed to watch her in his masters absence  the attendant however on hearing her confession not only promised to keep her secret but permitted her to continue her visits to my grove whenever i chanced to be playing there on the lute  now the most mysterious part of this matter is that the girl seemedin spite of his severity towards herto have a great affection for her surly for when i offered to deliver her from his custody she declared that nothing could induce her to desert himnot even the attraction of living among fine pictures and hearing beautiful music every hour in the day  but i see i weary you and indeed it is evident from the length of the shadows that the hour of my departure is at hand  let me then pass from my introductory interviews with antonina to the consequences that had resulted from them when i set forth on my journey to ravenna  i think i can imagine the consequences already  said julia smiling maliciously   begin then retorted vetranio by imagining that the strangeness of this girls situation and the originality of her ideas invested her with an attraction for me which the charms of her person and age contributed immensely to heighten  she delighted my faculties as a poet as much as she fired my feelings as a man and i determined to lure her from the tyrannical protection of her father by the employment of every artifice that my ingenuity could suggest i began by teaching her to exercise for herself the talent which had so attracted her in another by the familiarity engendered on both sides by such an occupation i hoped to gain as much in affection from her as she acquired in skill from me but to my astonishment i still found her as indifferent towards the master and as tender towards the music as she had appeared at our first interview  if she had repelled my advances if they had overwhelmed her with confusion i could have adapted myself to her humour i should have felt the encouragement of hope but the coldness the carelessness the unnatural incomprehensible ease with which she received even my caresses utterly disconcerted me  it seemed as if she could only regard me as a moving statue as a mere impersonation immaterial as the science i was teaching her if i spoke she hardly looked on me if i moved she scarcely noticed the action  i could not consider it dislike she seemed to gentle to nourish such a feeling for any creature on earth  i could not believe it coldness she was all life all agitation if she heard only a few notes of music when she touched the chords of the instrument her whole frame trembled her eyes mild serious and thoughtful when she looked on me now brightened with delight now softened with tears when she listened to the lute  as day by day her skill in music increased so her manner towards me grew more inexplicably indifferent at length weary of the constant disappointments that i experienced and determined to make a last effort to touch her heart by awakening her gratitude i presented her with the very lute which she had at first heard and on which she had now learned to play  never have i seen any human being so rapturously delighted as this incomprehensible girl when she received the instrument from my hands  she alternately wept and laughed over it she kissed it fondled it spoke to it as if it had been a living thing  but when i approached to suppress the expressions of thankfulness that she poured on me for the gift she suddenly hid the lute in her robe as if afraid that i should deprive her of it and hurried rapidly from my sight  the next day i waited for her at our accustomed meetingplace but she never appeared  i sent a slave to her fathers house but she would hold no communication with him  it was evident that now she had gained her end she cared no more to behold me  in my first moments of irritation i determined to make her feel my power if she despised my kindness but reflection convinced me from my acquaintance with her character that in such a matter force was impolitic that i should risk my popularity in rome and engage myself in an unworthy quarrel to no purpose  dissatisfied with myself and disappointed in the girl i obeyed the first dictates of my impatience and seizing the opportunity afforded by my duties in the senate of escaping from the scene of defeated hopes i departed angrily for ravenna  departed for ravenna cried julia laughing outright  oh what a conclusion to the adventure i confess it vetranio such consequences as these are beyond all imagination  you laugh julia returned the senator a little piqued but hear me to the end and you will find that i have not yet resigned myself to defeat  for the few days that i have remained here antoninas image has incessantly troubled my thoughts  i perceive that my inclination as well as my reputation is concerned in subduing her ungrateful aversion  i suspect that my anxiety to gain her will if unremoved so far influence my character that from vetranio the serene i shall be changed into vetranio the sardonic  pride honour curiosity and love all urge me to her conquest  to prepare for my banquet is an excuse to the court for my sudden departure from this place the real object of my journey is antonina alone  ah now i recognise my friend again in his own character remarked the lady approvingly   you will ask me how i purpose to obtain another interview with her continued vetranio i answer that the girls attendant has voluntarily offered himself as an instrument for the prosecution of my plans  the very day before i departed from rome he suddenly presented himself to my in my garden and proposed to introduce me into numerians househaving first demanded with the air more of an equal than an inferior whether the report that i was still a secret adherent of the old religion of the worship of the gods was true  suspicious of the fellows motives for he abjured all recompense as the reward of his treachery and irritated by the girls recent ingratitude i treated his offer with contempt  now however that my dissatisfaction is calmed and my anxiety aroused i am determined at all hazards to trust myself to this man be his motives for aiding me what they may if my efforts at my expected interviewand i will not spare themare rewarded with success it will be necessary to obtain some refuge for antonina that will neither be suspected nor searched  for such a hidingplace nothing can be more admirably adapted than your arician villa  do younow that you know for what use it is intendedrepent of your generous disposal of it in aid of my design  i am delighted to have had it to bestow on you replied the liberal julia pressing vetranios hand  your adventure is indeed uncommoni burn with impatience to hear how it will end whatever happens you may depend on my secrecy and count on my assistance  but see the sun is already verging towards the west and yonder comes one of your slaves to inform you i doubt not that your equipage is prepared  return with me to the palace and i will supply you with the letter necessary to introduce you as master to my country abode                                  the worthy citizens of ravenna assembled in the square before the palace to behold the senators departure had entirely exhausted such innocent materials for amusement as consisted in staring at the guards catching the clouds of gnats that hovered about their ears and quarrelling with each other and were now reduced to a state of very noisy and unanimous impatience when their discontent was suddenly and most effectually appeased by the appearance of the travelling equipage with vetranio and camilla outside the palace gates  uproarious shouts greeted the appearance of the senator and his magnificent retinue but they were increased a hundredfold when the chief slaves by their masters command each scattered a handful of small coin among the poorer classes of the spectators  every man among that heterogeneous assemblage of rogues fools and idlers roared his loudest and capered his highest in honour of the generous patrician gradually and carefully the illustrious travellers moved through the crowd around them to the city gate and thence amid incessant shouts of applause raised with imposing unanimity of lung and wrought up to the most distracting discordancy of noise vetranio and his lively companion departed in triumph for rome                                  a few days after this event the citizens were again assembled at the same place and hourprobably to witness another patrician departurewhen their ears were assailed by the unexpected sound produced by the call to arms which was followed immediately by the closing of the city gates  they had scarcely asked each other the meaning of these unusual occurrences when a peasant half frantic with terror rushed into the square shouting out the terrible intelligence that the goths were in sight  the courtiers heard the news and starting from a luxurious repast hurried to the palace windows to behold the portentous spectacle  for the remainder of the evening the banqueting tables were unapproached by the guests   the wretched emperor was surprised among his poultry by that dreaded intelligence  he too hastened to the windows and looking forth saw the army of avengers passing in contempt his solitary fortress and moving swiftly onward towards defenceless rome  long after the darkness had hidden the masses of that mighty multitude from his eyes did he remain staring helplessly upon the fading landscape in a stupor of astonishment and dread and for the first time since he had possessed them his flocks of fowls were left for that night unattended by their masters hand    chapter 3  rome  the perusal of the title to this chapter will we fear excite emotions of apprehension rather than of curiosity in the breasts of experienced readers  they will doubtless imagine that it is portentous of long rhapsodies on those wonders of antiquity the description of which has long become absolutely nauseous to them by incessant iteration  they will foresee wailings over the palace of the caesars and meditations among the arches of the colosseum loading a long series of weary paragraphs to the very chapters end and considerately anxious to spare their attention a task from which it recoils they will unanimously hurry past the dreaded desert of conventional reflection to alight on the first oasis that may present itself whether it be formed by a new division of the story or suddenly indicated by the appearance of a dialogue animated therefore by apprehensions such as these we hasten to assure them that in no instance will the localities of our story trench upon the limits of the wellworn forum or mount the arches of the exhausted colosseum  it is with the beings and not the buildings of old rome that their attention is to be occupied  we desire to present them with a picture of the inmost emotions of the timesof the living breathing actions and passions of the people of the doomed empire  antiquarian topography and classical architecture we leave to abler pens and resign to other readers  it is however necessary that the sphere in which the personages of our story are about to act should be in some measure indicated in order to facilitate the comprehension of their respective movements that portion of the extinct city which we design to revive has left few traces of its existence in the modern town  its sites are traditionaryits buildings are dust the church rises where the temple once stood and the wineshop now lures the passing idler where the bath invited his ancestor of old  the walls of rome are in extent at the present day the same as they were at the period of which we now write  but here all analogy between the ancient and modern city ends  the houses that those walls were once scarcely wide enough to enclose have long since vanished and their modern successors occupy but a third of the space once allotted to the capital of the empire  beyond the walls immense suburbs stretched forth in the days of old gorgeous villas luxurious groves temples theatres bathsinterspersed by colonies of dwellings belonging to the lower orders of the peoplesurrounded the mighty city  of these innumerable abodes hardly a trace remains  the modern traveller as he looks forth over the site of the famous suburbs beholds here and there a ruined aqueduct or a crumbling tomb tottering on the surface of a pestilential marsh  the present entrance to rome by the porta del popolo occupies the same site as the ancient flaminian gate  three great streets now lead from it towards the southern extremity of the city and form with their tributaries the principal portion of modern rome  on one side they are bounded by the pincian hill on the other by the tiber  of these streets those nearest the river occupy the position of the famous campus martius those on the other side the ancient approaches to the gardens of sallust and lucullus on the pincian mount  on the opposite bank of the tiber gained by the ponte st angelo formerly the pons elius two streets pierced through an irregular and populous neighbourhood conduct to the modern church of st peter  at the period of our story this part of the city was of much greater consequence both in size and appearance than it is at present and led directly to the ancient basilica of st peter which stood on the same site as that now occupied by the modern edifice   the events about to be narrated occur entirely in the parts of the city just described  from the pincian hill across the campus martius over the pons elius and on to the basilica of st peter the reader may be often invited to accompany us but he will be spared all necessity of penetrating familiar ruins or mourning over the sepulchres of departed patriots  ere however we revert to former actors or proceed to new characters it will be requisite to people the streets that we here attempt to rebuild  by this process it is hoped that the reader will gain that familiarity with the manners and customs of the romans of the fifth century on which the influence of this story mainly depends and which we despair of being able to instil by a philosophical disquisition on the features of the age  a few pages of illustration will serve our purpose better perhaps than volumes of historical description  there is no more unerring index to the character of a people than the streets of their cities  it is near evening  in the widest part of the campus martius crowds of people are assembled before the gates of a palace  they are congregated to receive several baskets of provisions distributed with ostentatious charity by the owner of the mansion  the incessant clamour and agitation of the impatient multitude form a strange contrast to the stately serenity of the natural and artificial objects by which they are enclosed on all sides  the space they occupy is oblong in shape and of great extent in size part of it is formed by a turf walk shaded with trees part by the paved approaches to the palace and the public baths which stand in its immediate neighbourhood  these two edifices are remarkable by their magnificent outward adornments of statues and the elegance and number of the flights of steps by which they are respectively entered  with the inferior buildings the marketplaces and the gardens attached to them they are sufficiently extensive to form the boundary of one side of the immediate view  the appearance of monotony which might at other times be remarked in the vastness and regularity of their white fronts is at this moment agreeably broken by several gailycoloured awnings stretched over their doors and balconies  the sun is now shining on them with overpowering brightness the metallic ornaments on their windows glitter like gems of fire even the trees which form their groves partake of the universal flow of light and fail like the objects around them to offer to the weary eye either refreshment or repose  towards the north the mausoleum of augustus towering proudly up into the brilliant sky at once attracts the attention  from its position parts of this noble building are already in shade not a human being is visible on any part of its mighty galleriesit stands solitary and sublime an impressive embodiment of the emotions which it was raised to represent  on the side opposite the palace and the baths is the turf walk already mentioned  trees thickly planted and interlaced by vines cast a luxurious shade over this spot  in their interstices viewed from a distance appear glimpses of gay dresses groups of figures in repose stands loaded with fruit and flowers and innumerable white marble statues of fauns and woodnymphs  from this delicious retreat the rippling of fountains is to be heard occasionally interrupted by the rustling of leaves or the plaintive cadences of the roman flute   southward two pagan temples stand in lonely grandeur among a host of monuments and trophies  the symmetry of their first construction still remains unimpaired their white marble pillars shine in the sunlight brightly as of old yet they now present to the eye an aspect of strange desolation of unnatural mysterious gloom  although the laws forbid the worship for which they were built the hand of reform has as yet not ventured to doom them to ruin or adapt them to christian purposes  none venture to tread their oncecrowded colonnades  no priest appears to give the oracles from their doors no sacrifices reek upon their naked altars under their roofs visited only by the light that steals through their narrow entrances stand unnoticed unworshipped unmoved the mighty idols of old rome  human emotion which made them omnipotence once has left them but stone now  the star in the east has already dimmed the fearful halo which the devotion of bloodshed once wreathed round their forms forsaken and alone they stand but as the gloomy monuments of the greatest delusion ever organised by the ingenuity of man  we have now so to express it exhibited the frame surrounding the moving picture which we shall next attempt to present to the reader by mixing with the multitude before the palace gates  this assembly resolved itself into three divisions  that collected before the palace steps that loitering about the public baths and that reposing in the shade of the groves  the first was of the most consequence in numbers and of the greatest variety in appearance composed of rogues of the worst order from every quarter of the world it might be said to present in its general aspect of numerical importance the very sublime of degradation  confident in their rude union of common avidity these worthy citizens vented their insolence on all objects and in every direction with a careless impartiality which would have shamed the most victorious efforts of modern mobs the hubbub of voices was perfectly fearful  the coarse execrations of drunken gauls the licentious witticisms of effeminate greeks the noisy satisfaction of native romans the clamorous indignation of irritable jewsall sounded together in one incessant chorus of discordant noises nor were the senses of sight and smell more agreeably assailed than the faculty of hearing by this anomalous congregation  immodest youth and irreverent age woman savage man cowardly the swarthy ethiopian beslabbered with stinking oil the stolid briton begrimed with dirtthese and a hundred other varying combinations to be imagined rather than expressed met the attention in every direction  to describe the odours exhaled by the heat from this seething mixture of many pollutions would be to force the reader to close the book we prefer to return to the distribution which was the cause of this degrading tumult and which consisted of small baskets of roasted meat packed with common fruits and vegetables and handed or rather flung down to the mob by the servants of the nobleman who gave the feast  the people revelled in the abundance thus presented to them they threw themselves upon it like wild beasts they devoured it like hogs or bore it off like plunderers while secure in the eminence on which they were placed the purveyors of this public banquet expressed their contempt for its noisy recipients by holding their noses stopping their ears turning their backs and other pantomimic demonstrations of lofty and excessive disgust  these actions did not escape the attention of those members of the assembly who having eaten their fill were at leisure to make use of their tongues and who showered an incessant storm of abuse on the heads of their benefactors retainers  see those fellows cried one they are the waiters at our feast and they mock us to our faces down with the filthy kitchen thieves  excellently well said davusbut who is to approach them  they stink at this distance  the rottenbodied knaves have the noses of dogs and the carcases of goats  then came a chorus of voicesdown with them  down with them  in the midst of which an indignant freedman advanced to rebuke the mob receiving as the reward of his temerity a shower of missiles and a volley of curses after which he was thus addressed by a huge greasy butcher hoisted on his companions shoulders  by the soul of the emperor could i get near you you rogue i would quarter you with my fingers alonea grinning scoundrel that jeers at others  a filthy flatterer that dirts the very ground he walks on  by the blood of the martyrs should i fling the sweepings of the slaughterhouse at him he knows not where to get himself dried   thou rag of a man roared a neighbour of the indignant butchers dost thou frown upon the guests of thy master the very scrapings of whose skin are worth more than thy whole carcase it is easier to make a drinkingvessel of the skull of a flea than to make an honest man of such a villainous nightwalker as thou art  health and prosperity to our noble entertainer shouted one section of the grateful crowd as the last speaker paused for breath  death to all knaves of parasites  chimed in another  honour to the citizens of rome roared a third party with modest enthusiasm  give that freedman our bones to pick screamed an urchin from the outskirts of the crowd  this ingenious piece of advice was immediately followed and the populace gave vent to a shout of triumph as the unfortunate freedman scared by a new volley of missiles retreated with ignominious expedition to the shelter of his patrons halls  in the slight and purified specimen of the table talk of a roman mob which we have here ventured to exhibit the reader will perceive that extraordinary mixture of servility and insolence which characterised not only the conversation but the actions of the lower orders of society at the period of which we write  oppressed and degraded on the one hand to a point of misery scarcely conceivable to the public of the present day the poorer classes in rome were on the other invested with such a degree of moral license and permitted such an extent of political privilege as flattered their vanity into blinding their sense of indignation slaves in their season of servitude masters in their hours of recreation they presented as a class one of the most amazing social anomalies ever existing in any nation and formed in their dangerous and artificial position one of the most important of the internal causes of the downfall of rome  the steps of the public baths were almost as crowded as the space before the neighbouring building  incessant streams of people either entering or departing poured over the broad flagstones of its marble colonnades this concourse although composed in some parts of the same class of people as that assembled before the palace presented a certain appearance of respectability  here and therechequering the dusky monotony of masses of dirty tunicsmight be discerned the refreshing vision of a clean robe or the grateful indication of a handsome person little groups removed as far as possible from the neighbourhood of the noisy plebeians were scattered about either engaged in animated conversation or listlessly succumbing to the lassitude induced by a recent bath  an instants attention to the subject of discourse among the more active of these individuals will aid us in pursuing our social revelations  the loudest voice among the speakers at this particular moment proceeded from a tall thin sinisterlooking man who was haranguing a little group of listeners with great vehemence and fluency  i tell you socius said he turning suddenly upon one of his companions that unless new slavelaws are made my calling is at an end  my patrons estate requires incessant supplies of these wretches i do my best to satisfy the demand and the only result of my labour is that the miscreants either endanger my life or fly with impunity to join the gangs of robbers infesting our woods  truly i am sorry for you but what alteration would you have made in the slavelaws  i would empower bailiffs to slay upon the spot all slaves whom they thought disorderly as an example to the rest  what would such a permission avail you  these creatures are necessary and such a law would exterminate them in a few months  can you not break their spirit with labour bind their strength with chains and vanquish their obstinacy with dungeons   all this i have done but they die under the discipline or escape from their prisons  i have now three hundred slaves on my patrons estates against those born on our lands i have little to urge  many of them it is true begin the day with weeping and end it with death but for the most part thanks to their diurnal allowance of stripes they are tolerably submissive  it is with the wretches that i have been obliged to purchase from prisoners of war and the people of revolted towns that i am so dissatisfied  punishments have no effect on them they are incessantly indolent sulky desperate  it was but the other day that ten of them poisoned themselves while at work in the fields and fifty more after setting fire to a farmhouse while my back was turned escaped to join a gang of their companions who are now robbers in the woods  these fellows however are the last of the troop who will perpetrate such offences with the concurrence of my patron i have adopted a plan that will henceforth tame them efficiently  are you at liberty to communicate it  by the keys of st peter i wish i could see it practised on every estate in the land  it is thisnear a sulphur lake at some distance from my farmhouse is a tract of marshy ground overspread here and there by the ruins of an ancient slaughterhouse  i propose to dig in this place several subterranean caverns each of which shall be capable of holding twenty men here my mutinous slaves shall sleep after their days labour  the entrances shall be closed until morning with a large stone on which i will have engraven this inscription  these are the dormitories invented by gordian bailiff of saturninus a nobleman for the reception of refractory slaves  your plan is ingenious but i suspect your slaves so insensible to hardships are the brutal herd will sleep as unconcernedly in their new dormitories as in their old  sleep  it will be a most original species of repose that they will taste there  the stench of the sulphur lake will breathe sabian odours for them over a couch of mud  their anointing oil will be the slime of attendant reptiles  their liquid perfumes will be the stagnant oozings from their chamber roof  their music will be the croaking of frogs and the humming of gnats and as for their adornments why they will be decked forth with headgarlands of twining worms and movable brooches of cockchafers and toads  tell me now most sagacious socius do you still think that amidst such luxuries as these my slaves will sleep  no they will die  you are again wrong  they will curse and rave perhaps but that is of no consequence  they will work the longer above ground to shorten the term of their repose beneath  they will wake at an instants notice and come forth at a moments signal  i have no fear of their dying  do you leave rome soon  i go this evening taking with me such a supply of trustworthy assistants as will enable me to execute my plan without delay farewell socius  most ingenious of bailiffs i bid you farewell  as the worthy gordian stalked off big with the dignity of his new projects the gestures and tones of a man who formed one of a little group collected in a remote part of the portico he was about to quit attracted his attention  curiosity formed as conspicuous an ingredient in this mans character as cruelty  he stole behind the base of a neighbouring pillar and as the frequent repetition of the word goths struck his ear the report of that nations impending invasion having by this time reached rome he carefully disposed himself to listen with the most implicit attention to the speakers voice   goths cried the man in the stern concentrated accents of despair is there one among us to whom this report of their advance upon rome does not speak of hope rather than of dread have we a chance of rising from the degradation forced on us by our superiors until this den of heartless triflers and shameless cowards is swept from the very earth that it pollutes  your sentiments on the evils of our condition are undoubtedly most just observed a fat pompous man to whom the preceding remarks had been addressed but i cannot desire the reform you so ardently hope for  think of the degradation of being conquered by barbarians  i am the exile of my countrys privileges  what interest have i in upholding her honourif honour she really has replied the first speaker  nay  your expressions are too severe  you are too discontented to be just  am i  hear me for a moment and you will change your opinion  you see me now by my bearing and appearance superior to yonder plebeian herd you doubtless think that i live at my ease in the world that i can feel no anxiety for the future about my bodily necessities  what would you say were i to tell you that if i want another meal a lodging for tonight a fresh robe for tomorrow i must rob or flatter some great man to gain them  yet so it is  i am hopeless friendless destitute  in the whole of the empire there is not an honest calling in which i can take refuge  i must become a pander or a parasitea hired tyrant over slaves or a chartered groveller beneath noblesif i would not starve miserably in the streets or rob openly in the woods this is what i am  now listen to what i was  i was born free  i inherited from my father a farm which he had successfully defended from the encroachments of the rich at the expense of his comfort his health and his life when i succeeded to his lands i determined to protect them in my time as studiously as he had defended them in his i worked unintermittingly  i enlarged my house i improved my fields i increased my flocks  one after another i despised the threats and defeated the wiles of my noble neighbours who desired possession of my estate to swell their own territorial grandeur  in process of time i married and had a child  i believed that i was picked out from my race as a fortunate manwhen one night i was attacked by robbers  slaves made desperate by the cruelty of their wealthy masters  they ravaged my cornfields they deprived me of my flocks  when i demanded redress i was told to sell my lands to those who could defend themto those rich nobles whose tyranny had organised the band of wretches who had spoiled me of my possessions and to whose fraudgotten treasures the government were well pleased to grant that protection which they had denied to my honest hoards  in my pride i determined that i would still be independent  i planted new crops  with the little remnant of my money i hired fresh servants and bought more flocks  i had just recovered from my first disaster when i became the victim of a second i was again attacked  this time we had arms and we attempted to defend ourselves my wife was slain before my eyes my house was burnt to the ground i myself only escaped mutilated with wounds my child soon afterwards pined and died  i had no wife no offspring no house no money  my fields still stretched round me but i had none to cultivate them  my walls still tottered at my feet but i had none to rear them again none to inhabit them if they were reared  my fathers lands were now become a wilderness to me  i was too proud to sell them to my rich neighbour i preferred to leave them before i saw them the prey of a tyrant whose rank had triumphed over my industry and who is now able to boast that he can travel over ten leagues of senatorial property untainted by the propinquity of a husbandmans farm houseless homeless friendless i have come to rome alone in my affliction helpless in my degradation do you wonder now that i am careless about the honour of my country  i would have served her with my life and my possessions when she was worthy of my service but she has cast me off and i care not who conquers her  i say to the gothswith thousands who suffer the same tribulation that i now undergoenter our gates  level our palaces to the ground  confound if you will in one common slaughter we that are victims with those that are tyrants  your invasion will bring new lords to the land they cannot crush it morethey may oppress it less  our posterity may gain their rights by the sacrifice of lives that our country has made worthless  romans though we are we are ready to suffer and submit   he stopped for by this time he had lashed himself into fury  his eyes glared his cheeks flushed his voice rose  could he then have seen the faintest vision of the destiny that future ages had in store for the posterity of the race that now suffered throughout civilised europe like himcould he have imagined how in after years the middle class despised in his day was to rise to privilege and power to hold in its just hands the balance of the prosperity of nations to crush oppression and regulate rule to soar in its mighty flight above thrones and principalities and rank and riches apparently obedient but really commandingcould he but have foreboded this what a light must have burst upon his gloom what a hope must have soothed him in his despair  to what further extremities his anger might have carried him to what proceedings the indignant gordian who still listened from his concealment might have had recourse it is difficult to say for the complaints of the illfated landholder and the cogitations of the authoritative bailiff were alike suddenly suspended by an uproar raging at this moment round a carriage which had just emerged from the palace we have elsewhere described  this vehicle looked one mass of silver  embroidered silk curtains fluttered all around it gold ornaments studded its polished sides and it held no less a person than the nobleman who had feasted the people with baskets of meat  this fact had become known to the rabble before the palace gates  such an opportunity of showing their exultation in their bondage their real servility in their imaginary independence was not to be lost and accordingly they let loose such a torrent of clamorous gratitude on their entertainers appearance that a stranger in rome would have thought the city in revolt  they leapt they ran they danced round the prancing horses they flung their empty baskets into the air and patted approvingly their fair round bellies  from every side as the carriage moved on they gained fresh recruits and acquired new importance  the timid fled before them the noisy shouted with them the bold plunged into their ranks and the constant burden of their rejoicing chorus washealth to the noble pomponius prosperity to the senators of rome who feast us with their food and give us the freedom of their theatres  glory to pomponius  glory to the senators  fate seemed on this day to take pleasure in pampering the insatiable curiosity of gordian the bailiff  the cries of the multitude had scarcely died away in the distance as they followed the departing carriage when the voices of two men pitched to a low confidential tone reached his ear from the opposite side of the pillar  he peeped cautiously round and saw that they were priests  what an eternal jester is that pomponius said one voice  he is going to receive absolution and he journeys in his chariot of state as if he were preparing to celebrate his triumph instead of to confess his sins  has he committed then a fresh imprudence  alas yes  for a senator he is dreadfully wanting in caution  a few days since in a fit of passion he flung a drinkingcup at one of his female slaves  the girl died on the spot and her brother who is also in his service threatened immediate vengeance  to prevent disagreeable consequences to his body pomponius has sent the fellow to his estates in egypt and now from the same precaution for the welfare of his soul he goes to demand absolution from our holy and beneficent church  i am afraid these incessant absolutions granted to men who are too careless even to make a show of repentance for their crimes will prejudice us with the people at large  of what consequence are the sentiments of the people while we have their rulers on our side absolution is the sorcery that binds these libertines of rome to our will  we know what converted constantinepolitic flattery and ready absolution the people will tell you it was the sign of the cross  it is true this pomponius is rich and may increase our revenues but still i fear the indignation of the people  fear nothing  think how long their old institutions imposed on them and then doubt if you can that we may shape them to our wishes as we will  any deceptions will be successful with a mob if the instrument employed to forward them be a religion  the voices ceased  gordian who still cherished a vague intention of denouncing the fugitive landholder to the senatorial authorities employed the liberty afforded to his attention by the silence of the priests in turning to look after his intended victim  to his surprise he saw that the man had left the auditors to whom he had before addressed himself and was engaged in earnest conversation in another part of the portico with an individual who seemed to have recently joined him and whose appearance was so remarkable that the bailiff had moved a few steps forwards to gain a nearer view of him when he was once more arrested by the voices of the priests  irresolute for an instant to which party to devote his unscrupulous attention he returned mechanically to his old position  ere long however his anxiety to hear the mysterious communications proceeding between the landholder and his friend overbalanced his delight in penetrating the theological secrets of the priests  he turned once more but to his astonishment the objects of his curiosity had disappeared  he stepped to the outside of the portico and looked for them in every direction but they were nowhere to be seen  peevish and disappointed he returned as a last resource to the pillar where he had left the priests but the time consumed in his investigations after one party had been fatal to his reunion with the other  the churchmen were gone  sufficiently punished for his curiosity by his disappointment the bailiff walked doggedly off towards the pincian hill  had he turned in the contrary direction towards the basilica of st peter he would have found himself once more in the neighbourhood of the landholder and his remarkable friend and would have gained that acquaintance with the subjects of their conversation which we intend that the reader shall acquire in the course of the next chapter    chapter 4  the church  in the year 324 on the locality assigned by rumour to the martyrdom of st peter and over the ruins of the circus of nero constantine erected the church called the basilica of st peter  for twelve centuries this building raised by a man infamous for his murders and his tyrannies stood uninjured amid the shocks which during that long period devastated the rest of the city after that time it was removed tottering to its base from its own reverend and illustrious age by pope julius ii to make way for the foundations of the modern church  it is towards this structure of twelve hundred years duration erected by hands stained with blood and yet preserved as a star of peace in the midst of stormy centuries of war that we would direct the readers attention  what art has done for the modern church time has effected for the ancient  if the one is majestic to the eye by its grandeur the other is hallowed to the memory by its age   as this church by its rise commemorated the triumphant establishment of christianity as the religion of rome so in its progress it reflected every change wrought in the spirit of the new worship by the ambition the prodigality or the frivolity of the priests  at first it stood awful and imposing beautiful in all its parts as the religion for whose glory it was built  vast porphyry colonnades decorated its approaches and surrounded a fountain whose waters issued from the representation of a gigantic pinetree in bronze  its double rows of aisles were each supported by fortyeight columns of precious marble its flat ceiling was adorned with beams of gilt metal rescued from the pollution of heathen temples  its walls were decorated with large paintings of religious subjects and its tribunal was studded with elegant mosaics thus it rose simple and yet sublime awful and yet alluring in this its beginning a type of the dawn of the worship which it was elevated to represent  but when flushed with success the priests seized on christianity as their path to politics and their introduction to power the aspect of the church gradually began to change  as slowly and insensibly ambitious man heaped the garbage of his mysteries his doctrines and his disputes about the pristine purity of the structure given him by god so one by one gaudy adornments and meretricious alterations arose to sully the once majestic basilica until the threatening and reproving apparition of the pagan julian when both church and churchmen received in their corrupt progress a sudden and impressive check  the short period of the revival of idolatry once passed over the priests unmoved by the warning they had received returned with renewed vigour to confuse that which both in their gospel and their church had been once simple  day by day they put forth fresh treatises aroused fierce controversies subsided into new sects and day by day they altered more and more the once noble aspect of the ancient basilica they hung their nauseous relics on its mighty walls they stuck their tiny tapers about its glorious pillars they wreathed their tawdry fringes around its massive altars  here they polished there they embroidered wherever there was a window they curtained it with gaudy cloths wherever there was a statue they bedizened it with artificial flowers wherever there was a solemn recess they outraged its religious gloom with intruding light until arriving at the period we write of they succeeded so completely in changing the aspect of the building that it looked within more like a vast pagan toyshop than a christian church  here and there it is true a pillar or an altar rose unencumbered as of old appearing as much at variance with the frippery that surrounded it as a text of scripture quoted in a sermon of the time  but as regarded the general aspect of the basilica the decent glories of its earlier days seemed irrevocably departed and destroyed  after what has been said of the edifice the reader will have little difficulty in imagining that the square in which it stood lost whatever elevation of character it might once have possessed with even greater rapidity than the church itself  if the cathedral now looked like an immense toyshop assuredly its attendant colonnades had the appearance of the booths of an enormous fair   the day whose decline we have hinted at in the preceding chapter was fast verging towards its close as the inhabitants of the streets on the western bank of the tiber prepared to join the crowds that they beheld passing by their windows in the direction of the basilica of st peter the cause of this sudden confluence of the popular current in once common direction was made sufficiently apparent to all inquirers who happened to be near a church or a public building by the appearance in such situations of a large sheet of vellum elaborately illuminated raised on a high pole and guarded from contact with the inquisitive rabble by two armed soldiers  the announcements set forth in these strange placards were all of the same nature and directed to the same end  in each of them the bishop of rome informed his pious and honourable brethren the inhabitants of the city that as the next days was the anniversary of the martyrdom of st luke the vigil would necessarily be held on that evening in the basilica of st peter and that in consideration of the importance of the occasion there would be exhibited before the commencement of the ceremony those precious relics connected with the death of the saint which had become the inestimable inheritance of the church and which consisted of a branch of the olivetree to which st luke was hung a piece of the nooseincluding the knotwhich had been passed round his neck and a picture of the apotheosis of the virgin painted by his own hand  after some sentences expressive of lamentation for the sufferings of the saint which nobody read and which it is unnecessary to reproduce here the proclamation went on to state that a sermon would be preached in the course of the vigil and that at a later hour the great chandelier containing two thousand four hundred lamps would be lit to illuminate the church  finally the worthy bishop called upon all members of his flock in consideration of the solemnity of the day to abstain from sensual pleasures in order that they might the more piously and worthily contemplate the sacred objects submitted to their view and digest the spiritual nourishment to be offered to their understandings  from the specimen we have already given of the character of the populace of rome it will perhaps be unnecessary to say that the great attractions presented by this theological bill of fare were the relics and the chandelier  pulpit eloquence and vigil solemnities alone must have long exhibited their more sober allurements before they could have drawn into the streets a fiftieth part of the immense crowd that now hurried towards the desecrated basilica indeed so vast was the assemblage soon congregated that the advanced ranks of sightseers had already filled the church to overflowing before those in the rear had come within view of the colonnades  however dissatisfied the unsuccessful portion of the citizens might feel at their exclusion from the church they found a powerful counterattraction in the amusements going forward in the place the occupants of which seemed thoroughly regardless of the bishops admonitions upon the sobriety of behaviour due to the solemnity of the day  as if in utter defiance of the decency and order recommended by the clergy popular exhibitions of all sorts were set up on the broad flagstones of the great space before the church  street dancinggirls exercised at every available spot those gliding gyrations so eloquently condemned by the worthy ammianus marcellinus of orderly and historical memory booths crammed with relics of doubtful authenticity baskets filled with neat manuscript abstracts of furiously controversial pamphlets pagan images regenerated into portraits of saints pictorial representations of arians writhing in damnation and martyrs basking in haloes of celestial light tempted in every direction the more pious among the spectators  cooks perambulated with their shops on their backs rival slavemerchants shouted petitions for patronage winesellers taught bacchanalian philosophy from the tops of their casks poets recited compositions for sale sophisters held arguments destined to convert the wavering and perplex the ignorant  incessant motion and incessant noise seemed to be the sole compensations sought by the multitude for the disappointment of exclusion from the church  if a stranger after reading the proclamation of the day had proceeded to the basilica to feast his eyes on the contemplation of the illustrious aggregate of humanity entitled by the bishop his pious and honourable brethren he must on mixing at this moment with the assemblage have either doubted the truth of the episcopal appellation or have given the citizens credit for that refinement of intrinsic worth which is of too elevated a nature to influence the character of the outward man   at the time when the sun set nothing could be more picturesque than the distant view of this joyous scene  the deep red rays of the departing luminary cast their radiance partly from behind the church over the vast multitude in the place  brightly and rapidly the rich light roved over the waters that leaped towards it from the fountain in all the loveliness of natural and evanescent form  bathed in that brilliant glow the smooth porphyry colonnades reflected chameleon like ethereal and varying hues the white marble statues became suffused in a delicate rosecolour and the sobertinted trees gleamed in the innermost of their leafy depths as if steeped in the exhalations of a golden mist while contrasting strangely with the wondrous radiance around them the huge bronze pinetree in the middle of the place and the wide front of the basilica rose up in gloomy shadow indefinite and exaggerated lowering like evil spirits over the joyous beauty of the rest of the scene and casting their great depths of shade into the midst of the light whose dominion they despised  beheld from a distance this wild combination of vivid brightness and solemn gloom these buildings at one place darkened till they looked gigantic at another lightened till they appeared ethereal these crowded groups seeming one great moving mass gleaming at this point in radiant light obscured at that in thick shadow made up a whole so incongruous and yet so beautiful so grotesque and yet so sublime that the scene looked for the moment more like some inhabited meteor half eclipsed by its propinquity to earth than a mortal and material prospect  the beauties of this atmospheric effect were of far too serious and sublime a nature to interest the multitude in the place  out of the whole assemblage but two men watched that glorious sunset with even an appearance of the admiration and attention which it deserved  one was the landholder whose wrongs were related in the preceding chapterthe other his remarkable friend  these two men formed a singular contrast to each other both in demeanour and appearance as they gazed forth upon the crimson heaven the landholder was an undersized restlesslooking man whose features naturally sharp were now distorted by a fixed expression of misery and discontent  his quick penetrating glance wandered incessantly from place to place perceiving all things but resting on none  in his attention to the scene before him he appeared to have been led more by the influence of example than by his own spontaneous feelings for ever and anon he looked impatiently round upon his friend as if expecting him to speakbut no word or movement escaped his thoughtful companion occupied exclusively in his own contemplations he appeared wholly insensible to any ordinary outward appeal  in age and appearance this individual was in the decline of life for he had numbered sixty years his hair was completely grey and his face was covered with deep wrinkles  yet in spite of these disadvantages he was in the highest sense of the word a handsome man  though worn and thin his features were still bold and regular and there was an elevation about the habitual mournfulness of his expression and an intelligence about his somewhat severe and earnest eyes that bore eloquent testimony to the superiority of his intellectual powers  as he now stood gazing fixedly out into the glowing sky his tall meagre figure half supported upon his staff his lips firmly compressed his brow slightly frowning and his attitude firm and motionless the most superficial observer must have felt immediately that he looked on no ordinary being  the history of a life of deep thoughtperhaps of long sorrowseemed written in every lineament of his meditative countenance and there was a natural dignity in his manner which evidently restrained his restless companion from offering any determined interruption to the course of his reflections  slowly and gorgeously the sun had continued to wane in the horizon until he was now lost to view  as his last rays sunk behind the distant hills the stranger started from his reverie and approached the landholder pointing with his staff towards the fastfading brightness of the western sky  probus said he in a low melancholy voice as i looked on that sunset i thought on the condition of the church  i see little in the church to think of or in the sunset to observe replied his companion  how pure how vivid murmured the other scarcely heeding the landholders remark was the light which that sun cast upon this earth at our feet  how nobly for a time its brightness triumphed over the shadows around and yet in spite of the promise of that radiance how swiftly did it fade ere long in its conflict with the gloomhow thoroughly even now has it departed from the earth and withdrawn the beauty of its glory from the heavens  already the shadows are lengthening around us and shrouding in their darkness every object in the place  but a short hour hence andshould no moon arisethe gloom of night will stretch unresisted over rome  to what purpose do you tell me this   are you not reminded by what we have observed of the course of the worship which it is our privilege to profess  does not that first beautiful light denote its pure and perfect rise that short conflict between the radiance and the gloom its successful preservation by the apostles and the fathers that rapid fading of the radiance its desecration in later times and the gloom which now surrounds us the destruction which has encompassed it in this age we live ina destruction which nothing can avert but a return to that pure first faith that should now be the hope of our religion as the moon is the hope of night  how should we reform  do people who have no liberties care about a religion  who is to teach them  i havei will  it is the purpose of my life to restore to them the holiness of the ancient church to rescue them from the snare of traitors to the faith whom men call priests  they shall learn through me that the church knew no adornment once but the presence of the pure that the priest craved no finer vestment than his holiness that the gospel which once taught humility and now raises dispute was in former days the rule of faithsufficient for all wants powerful over all difficulties  through me they shall know that in times past it was the guardian of the heart through me they shall see that in times present it is the plaything of the proud through me they shall fear that in times future it may become the exile of the church  to this task i have vowed myself to overthrow this idolatrywhich like another paganism rises among us with its images its relics its jewels and its goldi will devote my child my life my energies and my possessions  from this attempt i will never turn asidefrom this determination i will never flinch  while i have a breath of life in me i will persevere in restoring to this abandoned city the true worship of the most high  he ceased abruptly  the intensity of his agitation seemed suddenly to deny to him the faculty of speech  every muscle in the frame of that stern melancholy man quivered at the immortal promptings of the soul within him  there was something almost feminine in his universal susceptibility to the influence of one solitary emotion  even the rough desperate landholder felt awed by the enthusiasm of the being before him and forgot his wrongs terrible as they wereand his misery poignant as it wasas he gazed upon his companions face  for some minutes neither of the men said more  soon however the last speaker calmed his agitation with the facility of a man accustomed to stifle the emotions that he cannot crush and advancing to the landholder took him sorrowfully by the hand  i see probus that i have amazed you said he but the church is the only subject on which i have no discretion  in all other matters i have conquered the rashness of my early manhood in this i have to wrestle with my hastier nature still  when i look on the mockeries that are acting around us when i behold a priesthood deceivers a people deluded a religion defiled then i confess it my indignation overpowers my patience and i burn to destroy where i ought only to hope to reform  i knew you always violent of imagination but when i last saw you your enthusiasm was love your wife  peace  she deceived me  your child  lives with me at rome  i remember her an infant when fourteen years since i was your neighbour in gaul  on my departure from the province you had just returned from a journey into italy unsuccessful in your attempts to discover there a trace either of your parents or of that elder brother whose absence you were wont so continually to lament  tell me have you since that period discovered the members of your ancient household  hitherto you have been so occupied in listening to the history of my wrongs that you have scarcely spoken of the changes in your life since we last met   if probus i have been silent to you concerning myself it is because for me retrospection has little that attracts  while yet it was in my power to return to those parents whom i deserted in my boyhood i thought not of repentance and now that they must be but too surely lost to me my yearning towards them is of no avail  of my brother from whom i parted in a moment of childish jealousy and anger and whose pardon and love i would give up even my ambition to acquire i have never yet discovered a trace  atonement to those whom i  injured in early life is a privilege denied to the prayers of my age  from my parents and my brother i departed unblest and unforgiven by them i feel that i am doomed to die  my life has been careless useless godless passing from rapine and violence to luxury and indolence and leading me to the marriage which i exulted in when i last saw you but which i now feel was unworthy alike in its motives and its results but blessed and thrice blessed by that last calamity of my wicked existence for it opened my eyes to the truthit made a christian of me while i was yet alive  is it thus that the christian can view his afflictions  i would then that i were a christian like you murmured the landholder in low earnest tones  it was in those first days probus continued the other when i found myself deserted and dishonoured left alone to be the guardian of my helpless child exiled for ever from a home that i had myself forsaken that i repented me in earnest of my misdeeds that i sought wisdom from the book of salvation and the conduct of life from the fathers of the church  it was at that time that i determined to devote my child like samuel of old to the service of heaven and myself to the reformation of our degraded worship  as i have already told you i forsook my abode and changed my name remember it is as numerian that you must henceforth address me that of my former self no remains might be left that of my former companions not one might ever discover and tempt me again  with incessant care have i shielded my daughter from the contamination of the world  as a precious jewel in a misers hands she has been watched and guarded in her fathers house  her destiny is to soothe the afflicted to watch the sick to succour the forlorn when i her teacher have restored to the land the dominion of its ancient faith and the guidance of its faultless gospel  we have neither of us an affection or a hope that can bind us to the things of earth  our hearts look both towards heaven our expectations are only from on high  do not set your hopes too firmly on your child  remember how the nobles of rome have destroyed the household i once had and tremble for your own  i have no fear for my daughter she is cared for in my absence by one who is vowed to aid me in my labours for the church  it is now nearly a year since i first met ulpius and from that time forth he has devoted himself to my service and watched over my child  who is this ulpius that you should put such faith in him  he is a man of age like mine  i found him like me worn down by the calamities of his early life and abandoned as i had once been to the delusions of the pagan gods  he was desolate suffering forlorn and i had pity on him in his misery  i proved to him that the worship he still professed was banished for its iniquities from the land that the religion which had succeeded it had become defiled by man and that there remained but one faith for him to choose if he would be savedthe faith of the early church  he heard me and was converted from that moment he has served me patiently and helped me willingly under the roof where i assemble the few who as yet are true believers he is always the first to come and the last to remain  no word of anger has ever crossed his lipsno look of impatience has ever appeared in his eyes though sorrowful he is gentle though suffering he is industrious  i have trusted him with all i possess and i glory in my credulity  ulpius is incorruptible  and your daughteris ulpius reverenced by her as he is respected by you   she knows that her duty is to love whom i love and to avoid whom i avoid  can you imagine that a christian virgin has any feelings disobedient to her fathers wishes  come to my house judge with your own eyes of my daughter and my companion  you whose misfortunes have left you no home shall find one if you will with me  come then and labour with me in my great undertaking  you will withdraw your mind from the contemplation of your woes and merit by your devotion the favour of the most high  no numerian i will still be independent even of my friends  nor rome nor italy are abidingplaces for me  i go to another land to abide among another people until the arms of a conqueror shall have restored freedom to the brave and protection to the honest throughout the countries of the empire  probus i implore you stay  never  my determination is taken numerianfarewell  for a few minutes numerian stood motionless gazing wistfully in the direction taken by his companion on his departure  at first an expression of grief and pity softened the austerity which seemed the habitual characteristic of his countenance when in repose but soon these milder and tenderer feelings appeared to vanish from his heart as suddenly as they had arisen his features reassumed their customary sternness and he muttered to himself as he mixed with the crowd struggling onwards in the direction of the basilica  let him depart unregretted he has denied himself to the service of his maker  he should no longer be my friend  in this sentence lay the index to the character of the man  his existence was one vast sacrifice one scene of intrepid selfimmolation although in the brief hints at the events of his life which he had communicated to his friend he had exaggerated the extent of his errors he had by no means done justice to the fervour of his penitencea penitence which outstripped the usual boundaries of repentance and only began in despair to terminate in fanaticism  his desertion of his fathers house into the motives of which it is not our present intention to enter and his long subsequent existence of violence and excess indisposed his naturally strong passions to submit to the slightest restraint  in obedience to their first impulses he contracted at a mature age a marriage with a woman thoroughly unworthy of the ardent admiration that she had inspired  when he found himself deceived and dishonoured by her the shock of such an affliction thrilled through his whole beingcrushed all his energiesstruck him prostrate heart and mind at one blow  the errors of his youth committed in his prosperity with moral impunity reacted upon him in his adversity with an influence fatal to his future peace  his repentance was darkened by despondency his resolutions were unbrightened by hope he flew to religion as the suicide flies to the knifein despair  leaving all remaining peculiarities in numerians character to be discussed at a future opportunity we will now follow him in his passage through the crowd to the entrance of the basilicacontinuing to designate him here and elsewhere by the name which he had assumed on his conversion and by which he had insisted on being addressed during his interview with the fugitive landholder  although at the commencement of his progress towards the church our enthusiast found himself placed among the hindermost of the members of the advancing throng he soon contrived so thoroughly to outstrip his dilatory and discursive neighbours as to gain with little delay the steps of the sacred building  here in common with many others he was compelled to stop while those nearest the basilica squeezed their way through its stately doors  in such a situation his remarkable figure could not fail to be noticed and he was silently recognised by many of the bystanders some of whom looked on him with wonder and some with aversion nobody however approached or spoke to him  every one felt the necessity of shunning a man whose bold and daily exposures of the abuses of the church placed in incessant peril his liberty and even his life   among the bystanders who surrounded numerian there were nevertheless two who did not remain content with carelessly avoiding any communication with the intrepid and suspected reformer  these two men belonged to the lowest order of the clergy and appeared to be occupied in cautiously watching the actions and listening to the conversation of the individuals immediately around them  the instant they beheld numerian they moved so as to elude his observation taking care at the same time to occupy such a position as enabled them to keep in view the object of their evident distrust  look osius said one that man is here again  and doubtless with the same motives which brought him here yesterday replied the other you will see that he will again enter the church listen to the service retire to his little chapel near the pincian mount and there before his ragged mob of adherents attack the doctrines which our brethren have preached as we know he did last night and as we suspect he will continue to do until the authorities think proper to give the signal for his imprisonment  i marvel that he should have been permitted to persist so long a time as he has in his course of contumacy towards the church  have we not evidence enough in his writings alone to convict him of heresy  the carelessness of the bishop upon such a matter as this is quite inexplicable  you should consider numerian not being a priest that the carelessness about our interests lies more with the senate than the bishop  what time our nobles can spare from their debaucheries has been lately given to discussions on the conduct of the emperor in retiring to ravenna and will now be dedicated to penetrating the basis of this rumour about the goths  besides even were they at liberty what care the senate about theological disputes they only know this numerian as a citizen of rome a man of some influence and possessions and consequently a person of political importance as a member of the population  in addition to which it would be no easy task for us at the present moment to impugn the doctrines broached by our assailant for the fellow has a troublesome facility of supporting what he says by the bible  believe me in this matter our only way of righting ourselves will be to convict him of scandal against the highest dignitaries of the church  the order that we have lately received to track his movements and listen to his discourses leads me to believe that our superiors are of your opinion  whether my convictions are correct or not of this i feel assuredthat his days of liberty are numbered  it was but a few hours ago that i saw the bishops chamberlains headassistant and he told me that he had heard through the crevice of a door  hush he moves he is pressing forward to enter the church  you can tell me what you were about to say as we follow him  quick let us mix with the crowd  ever enthusiastic in the performance of their loathsome duties these two discreet pastors of a christian flock followed numerian with the most elaborate caution into the interior of the sacred building   although the sun still left a faint streak of red in the western sky and the moon had as yet scarcely risen the great chandelier of two thousand four hundred lamps mentioned by the bishop in his address to the people was already alight  in the days of its severe and sacred beauty the appearance of the church would have suffered fatally by this blaze of artificial brilliancy but now that the ancient character of the basilica was completely changed now that from a solemn temple it had been altered to the semblance of a luxurious palace it gained immensely by its gaudy illumination  not an ornament along the vast extent of its glorious nave but glittered in vivid distinctness in the dazzling light that poured downwards from the roof  the gilded rafters the smooth inlaid marble pillars the rich hangings of the windows the jewelled candlesticks on the altars the pictures the statues the bronzes the mosaics each and all glowed with a steady and luxurious transparency absolutely intoxicating to the eye not a trace of wear not a vestige of tarnish now appeared on any object each portion of the nave to which the attention was directed appeared too finely spotlessly radiant ever to have been touched by mortal hands entranced and bewildered the observation roamed over the surface of the brilliant scene until wearied by the unbroken embellishment of the prospect it wandered for repose upon the dimly lighted aisles and dwelt with delight upon the soft shadows that hovered about their distant pillars and the gliding forms that peopled their dusky recesses or loitered past their lofty walls  at the moment when numerian entered the basilica a part of the service had just concluded the last faint echo from the voices of the choir still hung upon the incenseladen air and the vast masses of the spectators were still grouped in their listening and various attitudes as the devoted reformer looked forth upon the church  even he stern as he was seemed for a moment subdued by the ineffable enchantment of the scene but ere long as if displeased with his own involuntary emotions of admiration his brow contracted and he sighed heavily as still followed by the attentive spies he sought the comparative seclusion of the aisles  during the interval between the divisions of the service the congregation occupied themselves in staring at the relics which were enclosed in a silver cabinet with crystal doors and placed on the top of the high altar  although it was impossible to obtain a satisfactory view of these ecclesiastical treasures they nevertheless employed the attention of every one until the appearance of a priest in the pulpit gave signal of the commencement of the sermon and admonished all those who had seats to secure them without delay  passing through the ranks of the auditors of the sermonsome of whom were engaged in counting the lights in the chandelier to be certain that the bishop had not defrauded them of one out of the two thousand four hundred lamps others in holding whispered conversations and opening small boxes of sweetmeatswe again conduct the reader to the outside of the church  the assemblage here had by this time much diminished the shadows flung over the ground by the lofty colonnades had deepened and increased and in many of the more remote recesses of the place hardly a human being was to be observed  at one of these extremities where the pillars terminated in the street and the obscurity was most intense stood a solitary old man keeping himself cautiously concealed in the darkness and looking out anxiously upon the public way immediately before him  he had waited but a short time when a handsome chariot preceded by a bodyguard of gailyattired slaves stopped within a few paces of his lurkingplace and the voice of the person it contained pronounced audibly the following words  no no  drive onwe are later than i thought  if i stay to see this illumination of the basilica i shall not be in time to receive my guests for tonights banquet  besides this inestimable kitten of the breed most worshipped by the ancient egyptians has already taken cold and i would not for the world expose the susceptible animal any longer than is necessary to the dampness of the nightair  drive on good carrio drive on  the old man scarcely waited for the conclusion of this speech before he ran up to the chariot where he was immediately confronted by two headsone that of vetranio the senator the other that of a glossy black kitten adorned with a collar of rubies and half enveloped in its masters ample robes  before the astonished noble could articulate a word the man whispered in hoarse hurried accents i am ulpiusdismiss your servantsi have something important to say  ha my worthy ulpius  you have a most unhappy faculty of delivering a message with the manner of an assassin  but i must pardon your unpleasant abruptness in consideration of your diligence  my excellent carrio if you value my approbation remove your companions and yourself out of hearing   the freedman yielded instant obedience to his masters mandate  the following conversation then took place the strange man opening it thus  you remember your promise  i do  upon your honour as a nobleman and a senator you are prepared to abide by it whenever it is necessary  i am  then at the dawn of morning meet me at the private gate of your palace garden and i will conduct you to antoninas bedchamber  the time will suit me  but why at the dawn of morning  because the christian dotard will keep a vigil until midnight which the girl will most probably attend  i wished to tell you this at your palace but i heard there that you had gone to aricia and would return by way of the basilica so i posted myself to intercept you thus  industrious ulpius  remember your promise  vetranio leaned forward to reply but ulpius was gone  as the senator again commanded his equipage to move on he looked anxiously around him as if once more expecting to see his strange adherent still lurking near the chariot  he only perceived however a man whom he did not know followed by two other walking rapidly past him  they were numerian and the spies  at last my projects are approaching consummation exclaimed vetranio to himself as he and his kitten rolled off in the chariot  it is well that i thought of securing possession of julias villa today for i shall now assuredly want to use it tomorrow  jupiter  what a mass of dangers contradictions and mysteries encompass this affair when i think that i who pride myself on my philosophy have quitted ravenna borrowed a private villa leagued myself with an uncultivated plebeian and all for the sake of a girl who has already deceived my expectations by gaining me as a musicmaster without admitting me as a lover i am positively astonished at my own weakness  still it must be owned that the complexion my adventure has lately assumed renders it of some interest in itself  the mere pleasure of penetrating the secrets of this numerians household is by no means the least among the numerous attraction of my design  how has he gained his influence over the girl why does he keep her in such strict seclusion  who is this old halffrantic unceremonious manmonster calling himself ulpius refusing all reward for his villainy raving about a return to the old religion of the gods and exulting in the promise he has extorted from me as a good pagan to support the first restoration of the ancient worship that may be attempted in rome  where does he come from  why does he outwardly profess himself a christian  what sent him into numerians service  by the girdle of venus everything connected with the girl is as incomprehensible as herself  but patiencepatience  a few hours more and these mysteries will be revealed  in the meantime let me think of my banquet and of its presiding deity the nightingale sauce    chapter 5  antonina  who that has been at rome does not remember with delight the attractions of the pincian hill  who after toiling through the wonders of the dark melancholy city has not been revived by a visit to its shady walks and by breathing its fragrant breezes  amid the solemn mournfulness that reigns over declining rome this delightful elevation rises light airy and inviting at once a refreshment to the body and a solace to the spirit  from its smooth summit the city is seen in its utmost majesty and the surrounding country in its brightest aspect the crimes and miseries of rome seem deterred from approaching its favoured soil it impresses the mind as a place set apart by common consent for the presence of the innocent and the joyfulas a scene that rest and recreation keep sacred from the intrusion of tumult and toil  its appearance in modern days is the picture of its character for ages past  successive wars might dull its beauties for a time but peace invariably restored them in all their pristine loveliness  the old romans called it the mount of gardens  throughout the disasters of the empire and the convulsions of the middle ages it continued to merit its ancient appellation and a mount of gardens it still triumphantly remains to the present day  at the commencement of the fifth century the magnificence of the pincian hill was at its zenith were it consistent with the conduct of our story to dwell upon the glories of its palaces and its groves its temples and its theatres such a glowing prospect of artificial splendour aided by natural beauty might be spread before the reader as would tax his credulity while it excited his astonishment  this task however it is here unnecessary to attempt  it is not for the wonders of ancient luxury and taste but for the abode of the zealous and religious numerian that we find it now requisite to arouse interest and engage attention  at the back of the flaminian extremity of the pincian hill and immediately overlooking the city wall stood at the period of which we write a small but elegantly built house surrounded by a little garden of its own and protected at the back by the lofty groves and outbuildings of the palace of vetranio the senator  this abode had been at one time a sort of summerhouse belonging to the former proprietor of a neighbouring mansion  profligate necessities however had obliged the owner to part with this portion of his possessions which was purchased by a merchant well known to numerian who received it as a legacy at his friends death disgusted as soon as his reforming projects took possession of his mind at the bare idea of propinquity to the ennobled libertines of rome the austere christian determined to abandon his inheritance and to sell it to another but at the repeated entreaties of his daughter he at length consented to change his purpose and sacrifice his antipathy to his luxurious neighbours to his childs youthful attachment to the beauties of nature as displayed in his legacy on the pincian mount  in this instance only did the natural affection of the father prevail over the acquired severity of the reformer  here he condescended for the first and the last time to the sweet trivialities of youth  here indulgent in spite of himself he fixed his little household and permitted to his daughter her sole recreations of tending the flowers in the garden and luxuriating in the loveliness of the distant view                                  the night has advanced an hour since the occurrence mentioned in the preceding chapter the clear and brilliant moonlight of italy now pervades every district of the glorious city and bathes in its pure effulgence the groves and palaces on the pincian mount  from the garden of numerian the irregular buildings of the great suburbs of rome the rich undulating country beyond and the long ranges of mountains in the distance are now all visible in the soft and luxurious light  near the spot which commands this view not a living creature is to be seen on a first examination but on a more industrious and patient observation you are subsequently able to detect at one of the windows of numerians house half hidden by a curtain the figure of a young girl   soon this solitary form approaches nearer to the eye  the moonbeams that have hitherto shone only upon the window now illuminate other objects  first they display a small white arm then a light simple robe then a fair graceful neck and finally a bright youthful innocent face directed steadfastly towards the wide moonbrightened prospect of the distant mountains  for some time the girl remains in contemplation at her window  then she leaves her post and almost immediately reappears at a door leading into the garden  her figure as she advances towards the lawn before her is light and smalla natural grace and propriety appear in her movementsshe holds pressed to her bosom and half concealed by her robe a gilt lute  when she reaches a turf bank commanding the same view as the window she arranges her instrument upon her knees and with something of restraint in her manner gently touches the chords then as if alarmed at the sound she has produced she glances anxiously around her apparently fearful of being overheard  her large dark lustrous eyes have in them an expression of apprehension her delicate lips are half parted a sudden flush rises in her soft olive complexion as she examines every corner of the garden  having completed her survey without discovering any cause for the suspicions she seems to entertain she again employs herself over her instrument once more she strikes the chords and now with a bolder hand  the notes she produces resolve themselves into a wild plaintive irregular melody alternately rising and sinking as if swayed by the fickle influence of a summer wind these sounds are soon harmoniously augmented by the young minstrels voice which is calm still and mellow and adapts itself with exquisite ingenuity to every arbitrary variation in the tone of the accompaniment  the song that she has chosen is one of the fanciful odes of the day  its chief merit to her lies in its alliance to the strange eastern air which she heard at her first interview with the senator who presented her with the lute paraphrased in english the words of the composition would run thus  the origin of music  i      spirit whose dominion reigns     over musics thrilling strains     whence may be thy distant birth     say what tempted thee to earth

obey     neer shall shake my gentle sway     still tis mine all hearts to move     in eternity of love  as the last sounds of her voice and her lute died softly away upon the still night air an indescribable elevation appeared in the girls countenance  she looked up rapturously into the far starbright sky her lip quivered her dark eyes filled with tears and her bosom heaved with the excess of the emotions that the music and the scene inspired then she gazed slowly around her dwelling tenderly upon the fragrant flowerbeds that were the work of her own hands and looking forth with an expression half reverential half ecstatic over the long smooth shining plains and the still glorious mountains that had so long been the inspiration of her most cherished thoughts and that now glowed before her eyes soft and beautiful as her dreams on her virgin couch then overpowered by the artless thoughts and innocent recollections which on the magic wings of nature and night came wafted over her mind she bent down her head upon her lute pressed her round dimpled cheek against its smooth frame and drawing her fingers mechanically over its strings abandoned herself unreservedly to the reveries of maidenhood and youth  such was the being devoted by her fathers fatal ambition to a lifelong banishment from all that is attractive in human art and beautiful in human intellect  such was the daughter whose existence was to be one long acquaintance with mortal woe one unvaried refusal of mortal pleasure whose thoughts were to be only of sermons and fasts whose action were to be confined to the binding up of strangers wounds and the drying of strangers tears whose life in brief was doomed to be the embodiment of her fathers austere ideal of the austere virgins of the ancient church  deprived of her mother exiled from the companionship of others of her age permitted no familiarity with any living being no sympathies with any other heart commanded but never indulged rebuked but never applauded she must have sunk beneath the severities imposed on her by her father but for the venial disobedience committed in the pursuit of the solitary pleasure procured for her by her lute  vainly in her hours of study did she read the fierce anathemas against love liberty and pleasure poetry painting and music gold silver and precious stones which the ancient fathers had composed for the benefit of the submissive congregations of former days vainly did she imagine during those long hours of theological instruction that her hearts forbidden longings were banished and destroyedthat her patient and childlike disposition was bowed in complete subserviency to the most rigorous of her fathers commands  no sooner were her interviews with numerian concluded than the promptings of that nature within us which artifice may warp but can never destroy lured her into a forgetfulness of all that she had heard and a longing for much that was forbidden we live in this existence but by the companionship of some sympathy aspiration or pursuit which serves us as our habitual refuge from the tribulations we inherit from the outer world the same feeling which led antonina in her childhood to beg for a flowergarden in her girlhood induced her to gain possession of a lute  the passion for music which prompted her visit to vetranio which alone saved her affections from pining in the solitude imposed on them and which occupied her leisure hours in the manner we have already described was an inheritance of her birth   her spanish mother had sung to her hour after hour in her cradle for the short time during which she was permitted to watch over her child the impression thus made on the dawning faculties of the infant nothing ever effaced  though her earliest perception were greeted only by the sight of her fathers misery though the form which his despairing penitence soon assumed doomed her to a life of seclusion and an education of admonition the passionate attachment to the melody of sound inspired by her mothers voicealmost imbibed at her mothers breastlived through all neglect and survived all opposition  it found its nourishment in childish recollections in snatches of street minstrelsy heard through her window in the passage of the night winds of winter through the groves on the pincian mount and received its rapturous gratification in the first audible sounds from the roman senators lute  how her possession of an instrument and her skill in playing were subsequently gained the reader already knows from vetranios narrative at ravenna  could the frivolous senator have discovered the real intensity of the emotions his art was raising in his pupils bosom while he taught her could he have imagined how incessantly during their lessons her sense of duty struggled with her love for musichow completely she was absorbed one moment by an agony of doubt and fear another by an ecstasy of enjoyment and hopehe would have felt little of that astonishment at her coldness towards himself which he so warmly expressed at his interview with julia in the gardens of the court  in truth nothing could be more complete than antoninas childish unconsciousness of the feelings with which vetranio regarded her  in entering his presence whatever remnant of her affections remained unwithered by her fears was solely attracted and engrossed by the beloved and beautiful lute  in receiving the instrument she almost forgot the giver in the triumph of possession or if she thought of him at all it was to be grateful for having escaped uninjured from a member of that class for whom her fathers reiterated admonitions had inspired her with a vague feeling of dread and distrust and to determine that now she had acknowledged his kindness and departed from his domains nothing should ever induce her to risk discovery by her father and peril to herself by ever entering them again  innocent in her isolation almost infantine in her natural simplicity a single enjoyment was sufficient to satisfy all the passions of her age father mother lover and companion liberties amusements and adornmentsthey were all summed up for her in that simple lute  the archness the liveliness and the gentleness of her disposition the poetry of her nature and the affection of her heart the happy bloom of youth which seclusion could not all wither nor distorted precept taint were now entirely nourished expanded and freshenedsuch is the creative power of human emotionby that inestimable possession she could speak to it smile on it caress it and believe in the ecstasy of her delight in the carelessness of her selfdelusion that it sympathised with her joy  during her long solitudes when she was silently watched in her fathers absence by the brooding melancholy stranger whom he had set over her it became a companion dearer than the flowergarden dearer even that the plains and mountains which formed her favourite view  when her father returned and she was led forth to sit in a dark place among strange silent people and to listen to interminable declamations it was a solace to think of the instrument as it lay hidden securely in her chamber and to ponder delightedly on what new music of her own she could play upon it next and then when evening arrived and she was left alone in her gardenthen came the hour of moonlight and song the moment of rapture and melody that drew her out of herself elevated her she felt not how and transported her she knew not whither  but while we thus linger over reflection on motives and examinations into character we are called back to the outer world of passing interests and events by the appearances of another figure on the scene we left antonina in the garden thinking over her lute  she still remains in her meditative position but she is now no longer alone  from the same steps by which she had descended a man now advances into the garden and walks towards the place she occupies  his gait is limping his stature crooked his proportions distorted  his large angular features stand out in gaunt contrast to his shrivelled cheeks his dry matted hair has been burnt by the sun into a strange tawny brown  his expression is one of fixed stern mournful thought  as he steps stealthily along advancing towards antonina he mutters to himself and clutches mechanically at his garments with his lank shapeless fingers the radiant moonlight falling fully upon his countenance invests it with a livid mysterious spectral appearance seen by a stranger at the present moment he would have been almost awful to look upon  this was the man who had intercepted vetranio on his journey home and who had now hurried back so as to regain his accustomed post before his masters return for he was the same individual mentioned by numerian as his aged convert ulpius in his interview with the landholder at the basilica of st peter  when ulpius had arrived within a few paces of the girl he stopped saying in a hoarse thick voice  hide your toynumerian is at the gates   antonina started violently as she listened to those repulsive accents the blood rushed into her cheeks she hastily covered the lute with her robe paused an instant as if intending to speak to the man then shuddered violently and hurried towards the house  as she mounted the steps numerian met her in the hall  there was now no chance of hiding the lute in its accustomed place  you stay too late in the garden said the father looking proudly in spite of all his austerity upon his beautiful daughter as she stood by his side  but what affects you he added noticing her confusion you tremble your colour comes and goes your lips quiver  give me your hand  as antonina obeyed him a fold of the treacherous robe slipped aside and discovered a part of the frame of the lute  numerians quick eye discovered it immediately  he snatched the instrument from her feeble grasp  his astonishment on beholding it was too great for words and for an instant he confronted the poor girl whose pale face looked rigid with terror in ominous and expressive silence  this thing said he at length this invention of libertines in my housein my daughters possession and he dashed the lute into fragments on the floor  for one moment antonina looked incredulously on the ruins of the beloved companion which was the centre of all her happiest expectations for future days  then as she began to estimate the reality of her deprivation her eyes lost all their heavenborn brightness and filled to overflowing with the tears of earth  to your chamber thundered numerian as she knelt sobbing convulsively over those hapless fragments  to your chamber tomorrow shall bring this mystery of iniquity to light  she rose humbly to obey him for indignation had no part in the emotions that shook her gentle and affectionate nature  as she moved towards the room that no lute was henceforth to occupy as she thought on the morrow that no lute was henceforth to enliven her grief almost overpowered her  she turned back and looked imploringly at her father as if entreating permission to pick up even the smallest of the fragments at his feet  to your chamber he reiterated sternly  am i to be disobeyed to my face  without any repetition of her silent remonstrance she instantly retired  as soon as she was out of sight ulpius ascended the steps and stood before the angered father  look ulpius cried numerian my daughter whom i have so carefully cherished whom i intended for an example to the world has deceived me even thus  he pointed as he spoke to the ruins of the unfortunate lute but ulpius did not address to him a word in reply and he hastily continued  i will not sully the solemn offices of tonight by interrupting them with my worldly affairs tomorrow i will interrogate my disobedient child  in the meantime do not imagine ulpius that i connect you in any way with this wicked and unworthy deception  in you i have every confidence in your faithfulness i have every hope  again he paused and again ulpius kept silence  any one less agitated less confiding than his unsuspicious master would have remarked that a faint sinister smile was breaking forth upon his haggard countenance but numerians indignation was still too violent to permit him to observed and spite of his efforts to control himself he again broke forth in complaint   on this night too of all others cried he when i had hoped to lead her among my little assembly of the faithful to join in their prayers and to listen to my exhortationson this night i am doomed to find her a player on a pagan lute a possessor of the most wanton of the worlds vanities  god give me patience to worship this night with unwandering thoughts for my heart is vexed at the transgression of my child as the heart of eli of old at the iniquities of his sons  he was moving rapidly away when as if struck with a sudden recollection he stopped abruptly and again addressed his gloomy companion  i will go by myself to the chapel tonight said he  you ulpius will stay to keep watch over my disobedient child  be vigilant good friend over my house for even now on my return i thought that two strangers were following my steps and i forebode some evil in store for me as the chastisement for my sins even greater than this misery of my daughters transgression  be watchful good ulpiusbe watchful  and as he hurried away the stern serious man felt as overwhelmed at the outrage that had been offered to his gloomy fanaticism as the weak timid girl at the destruction that had been wreaked upon her harmless lute  after numerian had departed the sinister smile again appeared on the countenance of ulpius he stood for a short time fixed in thought and then began slowly to descend a staircase near him which led to some subterranean apartments  he had not gone far when a slight noise became audible at an extremity of the corridor above  as he listened for a repetition of the sound he heard a sob and looking cautiously up discovered by the moonlight antonina stepping cautiously along the marble pavement of the hall  she held in her hand a little lamp her small rosy feet were uncovered the tears still streamed over her cheeks  she advanced with the greatest caution as if fearful of being overheard until she gained the part of the floor still strewn with the ruins of the broken lute  here she knelt down and pressed each fragment that lay before her separately to her lips  then hurriedly concealing a single piece in her bosom she arose and stole quickly away in the direction by which she had come  be patient till the dawn muttered her faithless guardian gazing after her from his concealment as she disappeared it will bring to thy lute a restorer and to ulpius an ally    chapter 6  an apprenticeship to the temple  the action of our characters during the night included in the last two chapters has now come to a pause  vetranio is awaiting his guests for the banquet numerian is in the chapel preparing for the discourse that he is to deliver to his friends ulpius is meditating in his masters house antonina is stretched upon her couch caressing the precious fragment that she had saved from the ruins of her lute  all the immediate agents of our story are for the present in repose  it is our purpose to take advantage of this interval of inaction and direct the readers attention to a different country from that selected as the scene of our romance and to such historical events of past years as connect themselves remarkably with the early life of numerians perfidious convert  this man will be found a person of great importance in the future conduct of our story  it is necessary to the comprehension of his character and the penetration of such of his purposes as have been already hinted at and may subsequently appear that the long course of his existence should be traced upwards to its source  it was in the reign of julian when the gods of the pagan achieved their last victory over the gospel of the christian that a decently attired man leading by the hand a handsome boy of fifteen years of age entered the gates of alexandria and proceeded hastily towards the high priests dwelling in the temple of serapis   after a stay of some hours at his destination the man left the city alone as hastily as he entered it and was never after seen at alexandria  the boy remained in the abode of the high priest until the next day when he was solemnly devoted to the service of the temple  the boy was the young emilius afterwards called ulpius  he was nephew to the high priest to whom he had been confided by his father a merchant of rome  ambition was the ruling passion of the father of emilius  it had prompted him to aspire to every distinction granted to the successful by the state but it had not gifted him with the powers requisite to turn his aspirations in any instance into acquisitions  he passed through existence a disappointed man planning but never performing seeing his more fortunate brother rising to the highest distinction in the priesthood and finding himself irretrievably condemned to exist in the affluent obscurity ensured to him by his mercantile pursuits  when his brother macrinus on julians accession to the imperial throne arrived at the pinnacle of power and celebrity as high priest of the temple of serapis the unsuccessful merchant lost all hope of rivalling his relative in the pursuit of distinction  his insatiable ambition discarded from himself now settled on one of his infant sons  he determined that his child should be successful where he had failed  now that his brother had secured the highest elevation in the temple no calling could offer more direct advantages to a member of his household that the priesthood  his family had been from their earliest origin rigid pagans  one of them had already attained to the most distinguished honours of his gorgeous worship  he determined that another should rival his kinsman and that that other should be his eldest son  firm in this resolution he at once devoted his child to the great design which he now held continually in view  he knew well that paganism revived though it was was not the universal worship that it had been that it was now secretly resisted and might soon be openly opposed by the persecuted christians throughout the empire and that if the young generation were to guard it successfully from all future encroachments and to rise securely to its highest honours more must be exacted from them than the easy attachment to the ancient religion require from the votaries of former days  then the performance of the most important offices in the priesthood was compatible with the possession of military or political rank  now it was to the temple and to the temple only that the future servant of the gods should be devoted  resolving thus the father took care that all the sons occupations and rewards should from his earliest years be in some way connected with the career for which he was intended  his childish pleasures were to be conducted to sacrifices and auguries his childish playthings and prizes were images of the deities  no opposition was offered on the boys part to this plan of education  far different from his younger brother whose turbulent disposition defied all authority he was naturally docile and his imagination vivid beyond his years was easily led captive by any remarkable object presented to it  with such encouragement his father became thoroughly engrossed by the occupation of forming him for his future existence  his mothers influence over him was jealously watched the secret expression of her love of her sorrow at the prospect of parting with him was ruthlessly suppressed whenever it was discovered and his younger brother was neglected almost forgotten in order that the parental watchfulness might be entirely and invariably devoted to the eldest son  when emilius had numbered fifteen years his father saw with delight that the time had come when he could witness the commencement of the realisation of all his projects  the boy was removed from home taken to alexandria and gladly left by his proud and triumphant father under the especial guardianship of macrinus the high priest   the chief of the temple full sympathised in his brothers designs for the young emilius  as soon as the boy had entered on his new occupations he was told that he must forget all that he had left behind him at rome that he must look upon the high priest as his father and upon the temple henceforth as his home and that the sole object of his present labours and future ambition must be to rise in the service of the gods  nor did macrinus stop here  so thoroughly anxious was he to stand to his pupil in the place of a parent and to secure his allegiance by withdrawing him in every way from the world in which he had hitherto lived that he even changed his name giving to him one of his own appellations and describing it as a privilege to stimulate him to future exertions  from the boy emilius he was now permanently transformed to the student ulpius  with such a natural disposition as we have already described and under such guardianship as that of the high priest there was little danger that ulpius would disappoint the unusual expectations which had been formed of him  his attention to his new duties never relaxed his obedience to his new masters never wavered  whatever macrinus demanded of him he was sure to perform  whatever longings he might feel to return to home he never discovered them he never sought to gratify the tastes naturally peculiar to his age  the high priest and his colleagues were astonished at the extraordinary readiness with which the boy himself forwarded their intentions for him  had they known how elaborately he had been prepared for his future employments at his fathers house they would have been less astonished at their pupils unusual docility  trained as he had been he must have shown a more than human perversity had he displayed any opposition to his uncles wishes  he had been permitted no childhood either of thought or action his natural precocity had been seized as the engine to force his faculties into a perilous and unwholesome maturity and when his new duties demanded his attention he entered on them with the same sincerity of enthusiasm which his boyish coevals would have exhibited towards a new sport  his gradual initiation into the mysteries of his religion created a strange voluptuous sensation of fear and interest in his mind  he heard the oracles and he trembled he attended the sacrifices and the auguries and he wondered  all the poetry of the bold and beautiful superstition to which he was devoted flowed overwhelmingly into his young heart absorbing the service of his fresh imagination and transporting him incessantly from the vital realities of the outer world to the shadowy regions of aspiration and thought   but his duties did not entirely occupy the attention of ulpius  the boy had his peculiar pleasures as well as his peculiar occupations when his employments were over for the day it was a strange unearthly vital enjoyment to him to wander softly in the shade of the temple porticoes looking down from his great mysterious eminence upon the populous and sunbrightened city at his feet watching the brilliant expanse of the waters of the nile glittering joyfully in the dazzling and pervading light raising his eyes from the fields and woods the palaces and garden that stretched out before him below to the lovely and cloudless sky that watched round him afar and above and that awoke all that his new duties had left of the joyfulness the affectionate sensibility which his rare intervals of uninterrupted intercourse with his mother had implanted in his heart  then when the daylight began to wane and the moon and stars already grew beautiful in their places in the firmament he would pass into the subterranean vaults of the edifice trembling as his little taper scarcely dispelled the dull solemn gloom and listening with breathless attention for the voices of those guardian spirits whose fabled habitation was made in the apartments of the sacred place  or when the multitude had departed for their amusements and their homes he would steal into the lofty halls and wander round the pedestals of the mighty statues breathing fearfully the still atmosphere of the temple and watching the passage of the cold melancholy moonbeams through the openings in the roof and over the colossal limbs and features of the images of the pagan gods sometimes when the services of serapis and the cares attendant on his communications with the emperor were concluded macrinus would lead his pupil into the garden of the priests and praise him for his docility till his heart throbbed with gratitude and pride  sometimes he would convey him cautiously outside the precincts of the sacred place and show him in the suburbs of the city silent pale melancholy men gliding suspiciously through the gay crowded streets  those fugitive figures he would declare were the enemies of the temple and all that it contained conspirators against the emperor and the gods wretches who were to be driven forth as outcasts from humanity whose appellation was christian and whose impious worship if tolerated would deprive him of the uncle whom he loved of the temple that he reverenced and of the priestly dignity and renown which it should be his lifes ambition to acquire  thus tutored in his duties by his guardian and in his recreations by himself as time wore on the boy gradually lost every remaining characteristic of his age  even the remembrance of his mother and his mothers love grew faint on his memory  serious solitary thoughtful he lived but to succeed in the temple he laboured but to emulate the high priest  all his feelings and faculties were now enslaved by an ambition at once unnatural at his present age and ominous of affliction for his future life  the design that macrinus had contemplated as the work of years was perfected in a few months  the hope that his father had scarce dared to entertain for his manhood was already accomplished in his youth  in these preparations for future success passed three years of the life of ulpius  at the expiration of that period the death of julian darkened the brilliant prospects of the pagan world  scarcely had the priests of serapis recovered the first shock of astonishment and grief consequent upon the fatal news of the vacancy in the imperial throne when the edict of toleration issued by jovian the new emperor reached the city of alexandria and was elevated on the walls of the temple  the first sight of this proclamation permitting freedom of worship to the christians aroused in the highly wrought disposition of ulpius the most violent emotions of anger and contempt the enthusiasm of his character and age guided invariably in the one direction of his worship took the character of the wildest fanaticism when he discovered the emperors careless infringement of the supremacy of the temple  he volunteered in the first moments of his fury to tear down the edict from the walls to lead an attack on the meetings of the triumphant christians or to travel to the imperial abode and exhort jovian to withdraw his act of perilous leniency ere it was too late with difficulty did his more cautious confederates restrain him from the execution of his impetuous designs  for two days he withdrew himself from his companions and brooded in solitude over the injury offered to his beloved superstition and the prospective augmentation of the influence of the christian sect  but the despair of the young enthusiast was destined to be further augmented by a private calamity at once mysterious in its cause and overwhelming in its effect  two days after the publication of the edict the high priest macrinus in the prime of vigour and manhood suddenly died  to narrate the confusion and horror within and without the temple on the discovery of this fatal even to describe the execrations and tumults of the priests and the populace who at once suspected the favoured and ambitious christians of causing by poison the death of their spiritual ruler might be interesting as a history of the manners of the times but is immaterial to the object of this chapter  we prefer rather to trace the effect on the mind of ulpius of his personal and private bereavement of this lossirretrievable to himof the master whom he loved and the guardian whom it was his privilege to revere   an illness of some months during the latter part of which his attendants trembled for his life and reason sufficiently attested the sincerity of the grief of ulpius for the loss of his protector during his paroxysms of delirium the priests who watched round his bed drew from his ravings many wise conclusions as to the effects that his seizure and its causes were likely to produce on his future character but in spite of all their penetration they were still far from appreciating to a tithe of its extent the revolution that his bereavement had wrought in his disposition  the boy himself until the moment of the high priests death had never been aware of the depth of his devotion to his second father  warped as they had been by his natural parent the affectionate qualities that were the mainspring of his nature had never been entirely destroyed and they seized on every kind word and gentle action of macrinus as food which had been grudged them since their birth  morally and intellectually macrinus had been to him the beacon that pointed the direction of his course the judge that regulated his conduct the muse that he looked to for inspiration and now when this link which had connected every ramification of his most cherished and governing ideas was suddenly snapped asunder a desolation sunk down upon his mind which at once paralysed its elasticity and withered its freshness  he glanced back and saw nothing but a home from whose pleasures and affections his fathers ambition had exiled him for ever  he looked forward and as he thought of his unfitness both from character and education to mix in the world as others mixed in it he saw no guiding star of social happiness for the conduct of his existence to come  there was now no resource left for him but entirely to deliver himself up to those pursuits which had made his home as a strange place to him which were hallowed by their connection with the lost object of his attachment and which would confer the sole happiness and distinction that he could hope for in the wide world on his future life  in addition to this motive for labour in his vocation there existed in the mind of ulpius a deep and settled feeling that animated him with unceasing ardour for the prosecution of his cherished occupations this governing principle was detestation of the christian sect  the suspicion that others had entertained regarding the death of the high priest was to his mind a certainty  he rejected every idea which opposed his determined persuasion that the jealousy of the christians had prompted them to the murder by poison of the most powerful and zealous of the pagan priests  to labour incessantly until he attained the influence and position formerly enjoyed by his relative and to use that influence and position when once acquired as the means of avenging macrinus by sweeping every vestige of the christian faith from the face of the earth were now the settled purposes of his heart inspired by his determination with the deliberate wisdom which is in most men the result only of the experience of years he employed the first days of his convalescence in cautiously maturing his future plans and impartially calculating his chances of success  this selfexamination completed he devoted himself at once and for ever to his lifes great design  nothing wearied nothing discouraged nothing impeded him  outward events passed by him unnoticed the citys afflictions and the citys triumphs spoke no longer to his heart  year succeeded to year but time had no tongue for him  paganism gradually sank and christianity imperceptibly rose but change spread no picture before his eyes  the whole outward world was a void to him until the moment arrived that beheld him successful in his designs  his preparations for the future absorbed every faculty of his nature and left him as to the present a mere automaton reflecting no principle and animated by no eventa machine that moved but did not perceivea body that acted without a mind that thought  returning for a moment to the outward world we find that on the death of jovian in 364 valentinian the new emperor continued the system of toleration adopted by his predecessor on his death in 375 gratian the successor to the imperial throne so far improved on the example of the two former potentates as to range himself boldly on the side of the partisans of the new faith  not content with merely encouraging both by precept and by example the growth of christianity the emperor further testified to his zeal for the rising religion by inflicting incessant persecutions upon the rapidly decreasing advocates of the ancient worship serving by these acts of his reign as pioneer to his successor theodosius the great in the religious revolution which that illustrious opponent of paganism was destined to effect   the death of gratian in 383 saw ulpius enrolled among the chief priests of the temple and pointed out as the next inheritor of the important office once held by the powerful and active macrinus beholding himself thus secure of the distinction for which he had laboured the aspiring priest found leisure at length to look forth upon the affairs of the passing day  from every side desolation darkened the prospect that he beheld  already throughout many provinces of the empire the temples of the gods had been overthrown by the destructive zeal of the triumphant christians  already hosts of the terrified people fearing that the fate of their idols might ultimately be their own finding themselves deserted by their disbanded priests and surrounded by the implacable enemies of the ancient faith had renounced their worship for the sake of saving their lives and securing their property  on the wide field of pagan ruin there now rose but one structure entirely unimpaired  the temple of serapis still reared its headunshaken unbending unpolluted  here the sacrifice still prospered and the people still bowed in worship before this monument of the religious glories of ages even the rising power of christian supremacy quailed in dismay  though the ranks of its once multitudinous congregations were now perceptibly thinned though the new churches swarmed with converts though the edicts from rome denounced it as a blot on the face of the earth its gloomy and solitary grandeur was still preserved  no unhallowed foot trod its secret recesses no destroying hand was raised as yet against its ancient and glorious walls  indignation but not despondency filled the heart of ulpius as he surveyed the situation of the pagan world  a determination nourished as his had been by the reflections of years and matured by incessant industry of deliberation is above all those shocks which affect a hasty decision or destroy a wavering intention  impervious to failure disasters urge it into action but never depress it to repose  its existence is the air that preserves the vitality of the mindthe spring that moves the action of the thoughts  never for a moment did ulpius waver in his devotion to his great design or despair of its ultimate execution and success  though every succeeding day brought the news of fresh misfortunes for the pagans and fresh triumphs for the christians still with a few of his more zealous comrades he persisted in expecting the advent of another julian and a day of restoration for the dismantled shrines of the deities that he served while the temple of serapis stood uninjured to give encouragement to his labours and refuge to his persecuted brethren there existed for him such an earnest of success as would spur him to any exertion and nerve him against any peril  and now to the astonishment of priests and congregations the silent thoughtful solitary ulpius suddenly started from his long repose and stood forth the fiery advocate of the rights of his invaded worship in a few days the fame of his addresses to the pagans who still attended the rites of serapis spread throughout the whole city  the boldest among the christians as they passed the temple walls involuntarily trembled when they heard the vehemence of the applause which arose from the audience of the inspired priest  addressed to all varieties of age and character these harangues woke an echo in every breast they reached  to the young they were clothed in all the poetry of the worship for which they pleaded  they dwelt on the altars of venus that the christians would lay waste on the woodlands that the christians would disenchant of their dryads on the hallowed arts that the christians would arise and destroy  to the aged they called up remembrances of the glories of the past achieved through the favour of the gods of ancestors who had died in their service of old forgotten loves and joys and successes that had grown and prospered under the gentle guardianship of the deities of oldwhile the unvarying burden of their conclusion to all was the reiterated assertion that the illustrious macrinus had died a victim to the toleration of the christian sect   but the efforts of ulpius were not confined to the delivery of orations every moment of his leisure time was dedicated to secret pilgrimages into alexandria  careless of peril regardless of threats the undaunted enthusiast penetrated into the most private meetingplaces of the christians reclaiming on every side apostates to the pagan creed and defying the hostility of half the city from the stronghold of the temple walls  day after day fresh recruits arrived to swell the ranks of the worshippers of serapis  the few members of the scattered congregations of the provinces who still remained faithful to the ancient worship were gathered together in alexandria by the private messengers of the unwearied ulpius  already tumults began to take place between the pagans and the christians and even now the priest of serapis prepared to address a protest to the new emperor in behalf of the ancient religion of the land  at this moment it seemed probable that the heroic attempts of one man to prop the structure of superstition whose foundations were undermined throughout and whose walls were attacked by brigands might actually be crowned with success  but time rolled on and with him came inexorable change trampling over the little barriers set up against it by human opposition and erecting its strange and transitory fabrics triumphantly in their stead  in vain did the devoted priest exert all his powers to augment and combine his scattered band in vain did the mighty temple display its ancient majesty its gorgeous sacrifices its mysterious auguries  the spirit of christianity was forth for triumph on the earththe last destinies of paganism were fast accomplishing  yet a few seasons more of unavailing resistance passed by and then the archbishop of alexandria issued his decree that the temple of serapis should be destroyed  at the rumour of their primates determination the christian fanatics rose by swarms from every corner of egypt and hurried into alexandria to be present at the work of demolition from the arid solitudes of the desert from their convents on rocks and their caverns in the earth hosts of rejoicing monks flew to the city gates and ranged themselves with the soldiery and the citizens impatient for the assault  at the dawn of morning this assembly of destroyers was convened and as the sun rose over alexandria they arrived before the temple walls  the gates of the glorious structure were barred the walls were crowded with their pagan defenders  a still dead mysterious silence reigned over the whole edifice and of all the men who thronged it one only moved from his appointed placeone only wandered incessantly from point to point wherever the building was open to assault  those among the besiegers who were nearest the temple saw in this presiding genius of the preparations for defence the object at once of their most malignant hatred and their most ungovernable dreadulpius the priest  as soon as the archbishop gave the signal for the assault a band of monkstheir harsh discordant voices screaming fragments of psalms their tattered garments waving in the air their cadaverous faces gleaming with ferocious joyled the way placed the first ladders against the walls and began the attack  from all sides the temple was assailed by the infuriated besiegers and on all sides it was successfully defended by the resolute besieged  shock after shock fell upon the massive gates without forcing them to recede missile after missile was hurled at the building but no breach was made in its solid surface  multitudes scaled the walls gained the outer porticoes and slaughtered their pagan defenders but were incessantly repulsed in their turn ere they could make their advantage good  over and over again did the assailants seem on the point of storming the temple successfully but the figure of ulpius invariably appearing at the critical moment among his disheartened followers acted like a fatality in destroying the effect of the most daring exertions and the most important triumphs  wherever there was danger wherever there was carnage wherever there was despair thither strode the undaunted priest inspiring the bold succouring the wounded reanimating the feeble  blinded by no stratagem wearied by no fatigue there was something almost demoniac in his activity for destruction in his determination under defeat  the besiegers marked his course round the temple by the calamities that befell them at his every step  if the bodies of slaughtered christians were flung down upon them from the walls they felt that ulpius was there  if the bravest of the soldiery hesitated at mounting the ladders it was known that ulpius was directing the defeat of their comrades above  if a sally from the temple drove back the advanced guard upon the reserves in the rear it was pleaded as their excuse that ulpius was fighting at the head of his pagan bands  crowd on crowd of christian warriors still pressed forward to the attack but though the ranks of the unbelievers were perceptibly thinned though the gates that defended them at last began to quiver before the reiterated blows by which they were assailed every court of the sacred edifice yet remained in the possession of the besieged and was at the disposal of the unconquered captain who organised the defence   depressed by the failure of his efforts and horrified at the carnage already perpetrated among his adherents the archbishop suddenly commanded a cessation of hostilities and proposed to the defenders of the temple a short and favourable truce  after some delay and apparently at the expense of some discord among their ranks the pagans sent to the primate an assurance of their acceptance of his terms which were that both parties should abstain from any further struggle for the ascendancy until an edict from theodosius determining the ultimate fate of the temple should be applied for and obtained  the truce once agreed on the wide space before the respited edifice was gradually cleared of its occupants  slowly and sadly the archbishop and his followers departed from the ancient walls whose summits they had assaulted in vain and when the sun went down of the great multitude congregated in the morning a few corpses were all that remained  within the sacred building death and repose ruled with the night where morning had brightly glittered on life and action the wounded the wearied and the cold all now lay hushed alike fanned by the night breezes that wandered through the lofty porticoes or soothed by the obscurity that reigned over the silent halls  among the ranks of the pagan devotees but one man still toiled and thought  round and round the temple restless as a wild beast that is threatened in his lair watchful as a lonely spirit in a city of strange tombs wandered the solitary and brooding ulpius  for him there was no rest of bodyno tranquility of mind  on the events of the next few days hovered the fearful chance that was soon either for misery or happiness to influence irretrievably the years of his future life round and round the mighty walls he watched with mechanical and useless anxiety every stone in the building was eloquent to his lonely heartbeautiful to his wild imagination on those barren structures stretched for him the loved and fertile home there was the shrine for whose glory his intellect had been enslaved for whose honour his youth had been sacrificed round and round the secret recesses and sacred courts he paced with hurried footstep cleansing with gentle and industrious hand the stains of blood and the defilements of warfare from the statues at his side  sad solitary thoughtful as in the first days of his apprenticeship to the gods he now roved in the same moonlit recesses where macrinus had taught him in his youth  as the menacing tumults of the day had aroused his fierceness so the stillness of the quiet night awakened his gentleness  he had combated for the temple in the morning as a son for a parent and he now watched over it at night as a miser over his treasure as a lover over his mistress as a mother over her child  the days passed on and at length the memorable morning arrived which was to determine the fate of the last temple that christian fanaticism had spared to the admiration of the world  at an early hour of the morning the diminished numbers of the pagan zealots met their reinforced and determined opponentsboth sides being alike unarmedin the great square of alexandria  the imperial prescript was then publicly read it began by assuring the pagans that their priests plea for protection for the temple had received the same consideration which had been bestowed on the petition against the gods presented by the christian archbishop and ended by proclaiming the commands of the emperor that serapis and all other idols in alexandria should immediately be destroyed  the shout of triumph which followed the conclusion of the imperial edict still rose from the christian ranks when the advanced guard of the soldiers appointed to ensure the execution of the emperors designs appeared in the square  for a few minutes the forsaken pagans stood rooted to the spot where they had assembled gazing at the warlike preparations around them in a stupor of bewilderment and despair  then as they recollected how diminished were their numbers how arduous had been their first defence against a few and how impossible would be a second defence against manyfrom the boldest to the feeblest a panic seized on them and regardless of ulpius regardless of honour regardless of the gods they turned with one accord and fled from the place   with the flight of the pagans the work of demolition began  even women and children hurried to join in the welcome task of indiscriminate destruction  no defenders on this occasion barred the gates of the temple to the christian hosts  the sublime solitude of the tenantless building was outraged and invaded in an instant  statues were broken gold was carried off doors were splintered into fragments but here for a while the progress of demolition was delayed  those to whom the labour of ruining the outward structure had been confided were less successful than their neighbours who had pillaged its contents  the ponderous stones of the pillars the massive surfaces of the walls resisted the most vigorous of their puny efforts and forced them to remain contented with mutilating that which they could not destroywith tearing off roofs defacing marbles and demolishing capitals  the rest of the buildings remained uninjured and grander even now in the wildness of ruin than ever it had been in the stateliness of perfection and strength  but the most important achievement still remained the deathwound of paganism was yet to be struckthe idol serapis which had ruled the hearts of millions and was renowned in the remotest corners of the empire was to be destroyed  a breathless silence pervaded the christian ranks as they filled the hall of the god  a superstitious dread to which they had hitherto thought themselves superior overcame their hearts as a single soldier bolder than his fellows mounted by a ladder to the head of the colossal statue and struck at its cheek with an axe  the blow had scarcely been dealt when a deep groan was heard from the opposite wall of the apartment succeeded by a noise of retreating footsteps and then all was silent again  for a few minutes this incident stayed the feet of those who were about to join their companion in the mutilation of the idol but after an interval their hesitation vanished they dealt blow after blow at the statue and no more groans followedno more sounds were heard save the wild echoes of the stroke of hammer crowbar and club resounding through the lofty hall  in an incredibly short space of time the image of serapis lay in great fragments on the marble floor  the multitude seized on the limbs of the idol and ran forth to drag them in triumph through the streets yet a few minutes more and the ruins were untenanted the temple was silentpaganism was destroyed  throughout the ravaging course of the christians over the temple they had been followed with dogged perseverance and at the same time with the most perfect impunity by the only pagan of all his brethren who had not sought safety by flight  this man being acquainted with every private passage and staircase in the sacred building was enabled to be secretly present at each fresh act of demolition in whatever part of the edifice it might be perpetrated  from hall to hall and from room to room he tracked with noiseless step and glaring eye the movements of the christian mobnow hiding himself behind a pillar now passing into concealed cavities in the walls now looking down from imperceptible fissures in the roof but whatever his situation invariably watching from it with the same industry of attention and the same silence of emotion the minutest acts of spoliation committed by the most humble follower of the christian ranks  it was only when he entered with the victorious ravagers into the vast apartment occupied by the idol serapis that the mans countenance began to give evidence of the agony under which his heart was writhing within him he mounted a private staircase cut in the hollow of the massive wall of the room and gaining a passage that ran round the extremities of the ceiling looked through a sort of lattice concealed in the ornaments of the cornice  as he gazed down and saw the soldier mounting axe in hand to the idols head great drops of perspiration trickled from his forehead  his hot thick breath hissed through his closed teeth and his hands strained at the strong metal supports of the lattice until they bent beneath his grasp  when the stroke descended on the image he closed his eyes  when the fragment detached by the blow fell on the floor a groan burst from his quivering lips  for one moment more he glared down with a gaze of horror upon the multitude at his feet and then with frantic speed he descended the steep stairs by which he had mounted to the roof and fled from the temple   the same night this man was again seen by some shepherds whom curiosity led to visit the desecrated building weeping bitterly in its ruined and deserted porticoes  as they approached to address him he raised his head and with a supplicating action signed to them to leave the place for the few moments during which he confronted them the moonlight shone full upon his countenance and the shepherds who had in former days attended the ceremonies of the temple saw with astonishment that the solitary mourner whose meditations they had disturbed was no other than ulpius the priest  at the dawn of day these shepherds had again occasion to pass the walls of the pillaged temple throughout the hours of the night the remembrance of the scene of unsolaced unpartaken grief that they had beheldof the awful loneliness of misery in which they had seen the heartbroken and forsaken man whose lightest words they had once delighted to revereinspired them with a feeling of pity for the deserted pagan widely at variance with the spirit of persecution which the spurious christianity of their day would fain have instilled in the bosoms of its humblest votaries  bent on consolation anxious to afford help these men like the samaritan of old went up at their own peril to succour a brother in affliction  they searched every portion of the empty building but the object of their sympathy was nowhere to be seen they called but heard no answering sound save the dirging of the winds of early morning through the ruined halls which but a short time since had resounded with the eloquence of the once illustrious priest  except a few nightbirds already sheltered by the deserted edifice not a living being moved in what was once the temple of the eastern world ulpius was gone  these events took place in the year 389  in 390 pagan ceremonies were made treason by the laws throughout the whole roman empire  from that period the scattered few who still adhered to the ancient faith became divided into three parties each alike insignificant whether considered as openly or secretly inimical to the new religion of the state at large  the first party unsuccessfully endeavoured to elude the laws prohibitory of sacrifices and divinations by concealing their religious ceremonies under the form of convivial meetings  the second preserved their ancient respect for the theory of paganism but abandoned all hope and intention of ever again accomplishing its practice  by such timely concessions many were enabled to preserveand some even to attainhigh and lucrative employments as officers of the state  the third retired to their homes the voluntary exiles of every religion resigning the practice of their old worship as a necessity and shunning the communion of christians as a matter of choice  such were the unimportant divisions into which the last remnants of the once powerful pagan community now subsided but to none of them was the ruined and degraded ulpius ever attached  for five weary yearsdating from the epoch of the prohibition of paganismhe wandered through the empire visiting in every country the ruined shrines of his deserted worshipa friendless hopeless solitary man   throughout the whole of europe and all of asia and the east that still belonged to rome he bent his slow and toilsome course  in the fertile valleys of gaul over the burning sands of africa through the sunbright cities of spain he travelledunfriended as a man under a curse lonely as a second cain  never for an instant did the remembrance of his ruined projects desert his memory or his mad determination to revive his worship abandon his mind  at every relic of paganism however slight that he encountered on his way he found a nourishment for his fierce anguish and employment for his vengeful thoughts often in the little villages children were frightened from their sports in a deserted temple by the apparition of his gaunt rigid figure among the tottering pillars or the sound of his hollow voice as he muttered to himself among the ruins of the pagan tombs  often in crowded cities groups of men congregated to talk over the fall of paganism found him listening at their sides and comforting them when they carelessly regretted their ancient faith with a smiling and whispered assurance that a time of restitution would yet come  by all opinions and in all places he was regarded as a harmless madman whose strange delusions and predilections were not to be combated but to be indulged  thus he wandered through the christian world regardless alike of lapse of time and change of climate living within himself mourning as a luxury over the fall of his worship patient of wrongs insults and disappointments watching for the opportunity that he still persisted in believing was yet to arrive holding by his fatal determination with all the recklessness of ambition and all the perseverance of revenge  the five years passed away unheeded uncalculated unregretted by ulpius  for him living but in the past hoping but for the future space held no obstaclestime was an oblivion  years pass as days hours as moments when the varying emotions which mark their existence on the memory and distinguish their succession on the dial of the heart exist no longer either for happiness or woe  dead to all freshness of feeling the mind of ulpius during the whole term of his wanderings lay numbed beneath the one idea that possessed it  it was only at the expiration of those unheeded years when the chances of travel turned his footsteps towards alexandria that his faculties burst from the long bondage which had oppressed them  thenwhen he passed through those gates which he had entered in former years a proud ambitious boy when he walked ungreeted through the ruined temple where he had once lived illustrious and reveredhis dull cold thoughts arose strong and vital within him  the spectacle of the scene of his former glories which might have awakened despair in others aroused the dormant passions emancipated the stifled energies in him the projects of vengeance and the visions of restoration which he had brooded over for five long years now rose before him as realised already under the vivid influence of the desecrated scenes around  as he stood beneath the shattered porticoes of the sacred place not a stone crumbling at his feet but rebuked him for his past inaction and strengthened him for daring for conspiracy for revenge in the service of the outraged gods the ruined temples he had visited in his gloomy pilgrimages now became revived by his fancy as one by one they rose on his toiling memory broken pillars soared from the ground desecrated idols reoccupied their vacant pedestals and he the exile and the mourner stood forth once again the ruler the teacher and the priest  the time of restitution was come though his understanding supplied him with no distinct projects his heart urged him to rush blindly on the execution of his reform  the moment had arrivedmacrinus should yet be avenged the temple should at last be restored  he descended into the city he hurriedneither welcomed nor recognisedthrough the crowded streets he entered the house of a man who had once been his friend and colleague in the days that were past and poured forth to him his wild determinations and disjointed plans entreating his assistance and promising him a glorious success  but his old companion had become by a timely conversion to christianity a man of property and reputation in alexandria and he turned from the friendless enthusiast with indignation and contempt  repulsed but not disheartened ulpius sought others who he had known in his prosperity and renown  they had all renounced their ancient worshipthey all received him with studied coldness or careless disdain but he still persisted in his useless efforts  he blinded his eyes to their contemptuous looks he shut his ears to their derisive words persevering in his selfdelusion he appointed them messengers to their brethren in other countries captains of the conspiracy that was to commence in alexandria orators before the people when the memorable revolution had once begun  it was in vain that they refused all participation in his designs he left them as the expressions of refusal rose to their lips and hurried elsewhere as industrious in his efforts as devoted to his unwelcome mission as if half the population of the city had vowed themselves joyfully to aid him in his frantic attempt   thus during the whole day he continued his labour of useless persuasion among those in the city who had once been his friends  when the evening came he repaired weary but not despondent to the earthly paradise that he was determined to regainto the temple where he had once taught and where he still imagined that he was again destined to preside  here he proceeded ignorant of the new laws careless of discovery and danger to ascertain by divination as in the days of old whether failure or success awaited him ultimately in his great design  meanwhile the friends whose assistance ulpius had determined to extort were far from remaining inactive on their parts after the departure of the aspiring priest  they remembered with terror that the laws affected as severely those concealing their knowledge of a pagan intrigue as those actually engaged in directing a pagan conspiracy and their anxiety for their personal safety overcoming every consideration of the dues of honour or the claims of ancient friendship they repaired in a body to the prefect of the city and informed him with all the eagerness of apprehension of the presence of ulpius in alexandria and of the culpability of the schemes that he had proposed  a search after the devoted pagan was immediately commenced  he was found the same night before a ruined altar brooding over the entrails of an animal that he had just sacrificed  further proof of his guilt could not be required  he was taken prisoner led forth the next morning to be judged amid the execrations of the very people who had almost adored him once and condemned the following day to suffer the penalty of death  at the appointed hour the populace assembled to behold the execution to their indignation and disappointment however when the officers of the city appeared before the prison it was only to inform the spectators that the performance of the fatal ceremony had been adjourned after a mysterious delay of some weeks they were again convened not to witness the execution but to receive the extraordinary announcement that the culprits life had been spared and that his amended sentence now condemned him to labour as a slave for life in the coppermines of spain  what powerful influence induced the prefect to risk the odium of reprieving a prisoner whose guilt was so satisfactorily ascertained as that of ulpius never was disclosed  some declared that the city magistrate was still at heart a pagan and that he consequently shrunk from authorising the death of a man who had once been the most illustrious among the professors of the ancient creed  others reported that ulpius had secured the leniency of his judges by acquainting them with the position of one of those secret repositories of enormous treasure supposed to exist beneath the foundations of the dismantled temple of serapis  but the truth of either of these rumours could never be satisfactorily proved  nothing more was accurately discovered than that ulpius was removed from alexandria to the place of earthly torment set apart for him by the zealous authorities at the dead of night and that the sentry at the gate through which he departed heard him mutter to himself as he was hurried onward that his divinations had prepared him for defeat but that the great day of pagan restoration would yet arrive  in the year 407 twelve years after the events above narrated ulpius entered the city of rome  he had not advanced far before the gaiety and confusion in the streets appeared completely to bewilder him  he hastened to the nearest public garden that he could perceive and avoiding the frequented paths flung himself down apparently fainting with exhaustion at the foot of a tree   for some time he lay on the shady restingplace which he had chosen gasping painfully for breath his frame ever and anon shaken to its centre by sudden spasms and his lips quivering with an agitation which he vainly endeavoured to suppress  so changed was his aspect that the guards who had removed him from alexandria wretched as was his appearance even then would have found it impossible to recognise him now as the same man whom they had formerly abandoned to slavery in the mines of spain  the effluvia exhaled from the copper ore in which he had been buried for twelve years had not only withered the flesh upon his bones but had imparted to its surface a livid hue almost deathlike in its dulness  his limbs wasted by age and distorted by suffering bent and trembled beneath him and his form once so majestic in its noble proportions was now so crooked and misshapen that whoever beheld him could only have imagined that he must have been deformed from his birth  of the former man no characteristic remained but the expression of the stern mournful eyes and these the truthful interpreters of the indomitable mind whose emotions they seemed created to express preserved unaltered by suffering and unimpaired by time the same look partly of reflection partly of defiance and partly of despair which had marked them in those past days when the temple was destroyed and the congregations of the pagans dispersed  but the repose at this moment demanded by his wornout body was even yet denied to it by his untamed unwearied mind and as the voice of his old delusion spoke within him again the devoted priest rose from his solitary restingplace and looked forth upon the great city whose new worship he was vowed to overthrow  by years of patient watchfulness he whispered to himself have i succeeded in escaping successfully from my dungeon among the mines yet a little more cunning a little more endurance a little more vigilance and i shall still live to people by my own exertions the deserted temples of rome  as he spoke he emerged from the grove into the street  the joyous sunlighta stranger to him for yearsshone warmly down upon his face as if to welcome him to liberty and the world  the sounds of gay laughter rang in his ears as if to woo him back to the blest enjoyments and amenities of life but natures influence and mans example were now silent alike to his lonely heart  over its dreary wastes still reigned the ruthless ambition which had exiled love from his youth and friendship from his manhood and which was destined to end its mission of destruction by banishing tranquility from his age scowling fiercely at all around and above him he sought the loneliest and shadiest streets  solitude had now become a necessity to his heart  the great gulph of his unshared aspirations had long since socially separated him for ever from his fellowmen  he thought laboured and suffered for himself alone  to describe the years of unrewarded labour and unalleviated hardship endured by ulpius in the place of his punishment to dwell on the day that brought with itwhatever the season in the world abovethe same unwearying inheritance of exertion and fatigue to chronicle the history of night after night of broken slumber one hour of wearying thought the next would be to produce a picture from the mournful monotony of which the attention of the reader would recoil with disgust  it will be here sufficient to observe that the influence of the same infatuation which had nerved him to the defence of the assaulted temple and encouraged him to attempt his illplanned restoration of paganism had preserved him through sufferings under which stronger and younger men would have sunk for ever had prompted his determination to escape from his slavery and had now brought him to romeold forsaken and feeble as he wasto risk new perils and suffer new afflictions for the cause to which body and soul he had ruthlessly devoted himself for ever   urged therefore by his miserable delusion he had now entered a city where even his name was unknown faithful to his frantic project of opposing himself as a helpless solitary man against the people and government of an empire  during his term of slavery regardless of his advanced years he had arranged a series of projects the gradual execution of which would have demanded the advantages of a long and vigorous life  he no more desired as in his former attempt at alexandria to precipitate at all hazards the success of his designs he was now prepared to watch wait plot and contrive for years on years he was resigned to be contented with the poorest and slowest advancementto be encouraged by the smallest prospect of ultimate triumph  acting under this determination he started his project by devoting all that remained of his enfeebled energies to cautiously informing himself by every means in his power of the private political and religious sentiments of all men of influence in rome wherever there was a popular assemblage he attended it to gather the scandalous gossip of the day wherever there was a chance of overhearing a private conversation he contrived to listen to it unobserved about the doors of taverns and the haunts of discharged servants he lurked noiseless as a shadow attentive alike to the careless revelations of intoxication or the scurrility of malignant slaves  day after day passed on and still saw him devoted to his occupation which servile as it was in itself was to his eyes ennobled by its lofty end until at the expiration of some months he found himself in possession of a vague and inaccurate fund of information which he stored up as a priceless treasure in his mind he next discovered the name and abode of every nobleman in rome suspected even of the most careless attachment to the ancient form of worship  he attended christian churches mastered the intricacies of different sects and estimated the importance of contending schisms gaining this collection of heterogeneous facts under the combined disadvantages of poverty solitude and age dependent for support on the poorest public charities and for shelter on the meanest public asylums  every conclusion that he drew from all he learned partook of the sanguine character of the fatal selfdeception which had embittered his whole life  he believed that the dissensions which he saw raging in the church would speedily effect the destruction of christianity itself that when such a period should arrive the public mind would require but the guidance of some superior intellect to return to its old religious predilections and that to lay the foundation for effecting in such a manner the desired revolution it was necessary for himimpossible though it might seem in his present degraded conditionto gain access to the disaffected nobles of rome and discover the secret of acquiring such an influence over them as would enable him to infect them with his enthusiasm and fire them with his determination  greater difficulties even than these had been overcome by other men  solitary individuals had ere this originated revolutions  the gods would favour him his own cunning would protect him  yet a little more patience a little more determination and he might still after all his misfortunes be assured of success  it was about this period that he first heard while pursuing his investigations of an obscure man who had suddenly arisen to undertake a reformation in the christian church whose declared aim was to rescue the new worship from that very degeneracy on the fatal progress of which rested all his hopes of triumph  it was reported that this man had been for some time devoted to his reforming labours but that the difficulties attendant on the task that he had appointed for himself had hitherto prevented him from attaining all the notoriety essential to the satisfactory prosecution of his plans  on hearing this rumour ulpius immediately joined the few who attended the new orators discourses and there heard enough to convince him that he listened to the most determined zealot for christianity in the city of rome  to gain this mans confidence to frustrate every effort that he might make in his new vocation to ruin his credit with his hearers and to threaten his personal safety by betraying his inmost secrets to his powerful enemies in the church were determinations instantly adopted by the pagan as duties demanded by the exigencies of his creed  from that moment he seized every opportunity of favourably attracting the new reformers attention to himself and as the reader already knows he was at length rewarded for his cunning and perseverance by being received into the household of the charitable and unsuspicious numerian as a pious convert to the christianity of the early church   once installed under numerians roof the treacherous pagan saw in the christians daughter an instrument admirably adapted in his unscrupulous hands for forwarding his wild project of obtaining the ear of a roman of power and station who was disaffected to the established worship  among the patricians of whose antichristian predilections report had informed him was numerians neighbour vetranio the senator to such a man renowned for his life of luxury a girl so beautiful as antonina would be a bribe rich enough to enable him to extort any promise required as a reward for betraying her while under the protection of her fathers house  in addition to this advantage to be drawn from her ruin was the certainty that her loss would so affect numerian as to render him for a time at least incapable of pursuing his labours in the cause of christianity  fixed then in his detestable purpose the ruthless priest patiently awaited the opportunity of commencing his machinations  nor did he watch in vain  the victim innocently fell into the very trap that he had prepared for her when she first listened to the music of vetranios lute and permitted her treacherous guardian to become the friend who concealed her disobedience from her fathers ear  after that first fatal step every day brought the projects of ulpius nearer to success the longsought interview with the senator was at length obtained the engagement imperatively demanded on the one side was as we have already related carelessly accepted on the other the day that was to bring success to the schemes of the betrayer and degradation to the honour of the betrayed was appointed and once more the cold heart of the fanatic warmed to the touch of joy  no doubts upon the validity of his engagement with vetranio ever entered his mind  he never imagined that powerful senator could with perfect impunity deny him the impracticable assistance he had demanded as his reward and thrust him as an ignorant madman from his palace gates  firmly and sincerely he believed that vetranio was so satisfied with his readiness in pandering to his profligate designs and so dazzled by the prospect of the glory which would attend success in the great enterprise that he would gladly hold to the performance of his promise whenever it should be required of him  in the meantime the work was begun  numerian was already through his agency watched by the spies of a jealous and unscrupulous church  feuds schisms treacheries and dissensions marched bravely onward through the christian ranks  all things combined to make it certain that the time was near at hand when through his exertions and the friendly senators help the restoration of paganism might be assured  with the widest diversity of pursuit and difference of design there was still a strange and mysterious analogy between the temporary positions of ulpius and numerian  one was prepared to be a martyr for the temple the other to be a martyr for the church  both were enthusiasts in an unwelcome cause both had suffered more than a lifes wonted share of affliction and both were old passing irretrievably from their fading present on earth to the eternal future awaiting them in the unknown spheres beyond  but herewith their positionthe comparison between them ends  the christians principle of action drawn from the divinity he served was love the pagans born of the superstition that was destroying him was hate  the one laboured for mankind the other for himself  and thus the aspirations of numerian founded on the general good nourished by offices of kindness and nobly directed to a generous end might lead him into indiscretion but could never degrade him into crimemight trouble the serenity of his life but could never deprive him of the consolation of hope  while on the contrary the ambition of ulpius originating in revenge and directed to destruction exacted cruelty from his heart and duplicity from his mind and as the reward for his service mocked him alternately throughout his whole life with delusion and despair    chapter 7  the bedchamber  it is now time to resume our chronicle of the eventful night which marked the destruction of antoninas lute and the conspiracy against antoninas honour   the gates of vetranios palace were closed and the noises in it were all hushed the banquet was over the triumph of the nightingale sauce had been achieved and the daybreak was already glimmering in the eastern sky when the senators favoured servant the freedman carrio drew back the shutter of the porters lodge where he had been dozing since the conclusion of the feast and looked out lazily into the street  the dull faint light of dawn was now strengthening slowly over the lonely roadway and on the walls of the lofty houses  of the groups of idlers of the lowest class who had assembled during the evening in the street to snuff the fragrant odours which steamed afar from vetranios kitchens not one remained men women and children had long since departed to seek shelter wherever they could find it and to fatten their lean bodies on what had been charitable bestowed on them of the coarser relics of the banquet  the mysterious solitude and tranquility of daybreak in a great city prevailed over all things nothing impressed however by the peculiar and solemn attraction of the scene at this moment the freedman apostrophised the fresh morning air as it blew over him in strong terms of disgust and even ventured in lowered tones to rail against his masters uncomfortable fancy for being awakened after a feast at the approach of dawn  far too well aware nevertheless of the necessity of yielding the most implicit obedience to the commands he had received to resign himself any longer to the pleasant temptations of repose carrio after yawning rubbing his eyes and indulging for a few moments more in the luxury of complaint set forth in earnest to follow the corridors leading to the interior of the palace and to awaken vetranio without further delay  he had not advanced more than a few steps when a proclamation written in letters of gold on a bluecoloured board and hung against the wall at his side attracted his attention  this public notice which delayed his progress at the very outset and which was intended for the special edification of all the inhabitants of rome was thus expressed  on this day and for ten days following the affairs of our patron oblige him to be absent from rome  here the proclamation ended without descending to particulars  it had been put forth in accordance with the easy fashion of the age to answer at once all applications at vetranios palace during the senators absence  although the colouring of the board the writing of the letters and the composition of the sentence were the work of his own ingenuity the worthy carrio could not prevail upon himself to pass the proclamation without contemplating its magnificence anew  for some time he stood regarding it with the same expression of lofty and complacent approbation which we see in these modern days illuminating the countenance of a connoisseur before one of his own old pictures which he has bought as a great bargain or dawning over the bland features of a linendraper as he surveys from the pavement his mornings arrangement of the window of the shop  all things however have their limits even a mans approval of an effort of his own skill accordingly after a prolonged review of the proclamation some faint ideas of the necessity of immediately obeying his masters commands revived in the mind of the judicious carrio and counselled him to turn his steps at once in the direction of the palace sleeping apartments  greatly wondering what new caprice had induced the senator to contemplate leaving rome at the dawn of dayfor vetranio had divulged to no one the object of his departurethe freedman cautiously entered his masters bedchamber  he drew aside the ample silken curtains suspended around and over the sleeping couch from the hands of graces and cupids sculptured in marble but the statues surrounded an empty bed  vetranio was not there  carrio next entered the bathroom the perfumed water was steaming in its long marble basin and the soft wrappingcloths lay ready for use the attendant slave with his instruments of ablution waited half asleep in his accustomed place but here also no signs of the masters presence appeared  somewhat perplexed the freedman examined several other apartments  he found guests dancing girls parasites poets paintersa motley crewoccupying every kind of dormitory and all peacefully engaged in sleeping off the effects of the wine they had drunk at the banquet but the great object of his search still eluded him as before  at last it occurred to him that the senator in an excess of convivial enthusiasm and jovial hospitality might yet be detaining some favoured guest at the table of the feast  pausing therefore at some carved doors which stood ajar at one extremity of a spacious hall he pushed them open and hurriedly entered the banquetingroom beyond   a soft dim luxurious light reigned over this apartment which now presented as far as the eye could discern an aspect of confusion that was at once graceful and picturesque  of the various lamps of every variety of pattern hanging from the ceiling but few remained alight from those however which were still unextinguished there shone a mild brightness admirably adapted to display the objects immediately around them  the golden garlands and the alabaster pots of sweet ointment which had been suspended before the guests during the banquet still hung from the painted ceiling  on the massive table composed partly of ebony and partly of silver yet lay in the wildest confusion fragments of gastronomic delicacies grotesque dinner services vases of flowers musical instruments and crystal dice while towering over all rose the glittering dish which had contained the nightingales consumed by the feasters with the four golden cupids which had spouted over them that illustrious inventionthe nightingale sauce  around the couches of violet and rose colour ranged along the table the perfumed and gailytinted powders that had been strewn in patterns over the marble floor were perceptible for a few yards but beyond this point nothing more was plainly distinguishable  the eye roved down the sides of the glorious chamber catching dim glimpses of gorgeous draperies crowded statues and marble columns but discerning nothing accurately until it reached the halfopened windows and rested upon the fresh dewy verdure now faintly visible in the shady gardens without  therewaving in the morning breezes charged on every leaf with their burden of pure and welcome moisturerose the lofty pinetrees basking in the recurrence of the new days beautiful and undying youth and rising in reproving contrast before the exhausted allurements of luxury and the perverted creations of art which burdened the tables of the hall within  after a hasty survey of the apartment the freedman appeared to be on the point of quitting it in despair when the noise of a falling dish followed by several partly suppressed and wholly confused exclamations of affright caught his ear  he once more approached the banquetingtable retrimmed a lamp that hung near him and taking it in his hand passed to the side of the room whence the disturbance proceeded  a hideous little negro staring in ludicrous terror at a silver oven half filled with bread which had just fallen beside him was the first object he discovered  a few paces beyond the negro reposed a beautiful boy crowned with vine leaves and ivy still sleeping by the side of his lyre and farther yet stretched in an uneasy slumber on a silken couch lay the identical object of the freedmans searchthe illustrious author of the nightingale sauce  immediately above the sleeping senator hung his portrait in which he was modestly represented as rising by the assistance of minerva to the top of parnassus the nine muses standing round him rejoicing  at his feet reposed a magnificent white cat whose head rested in all the luxurious laziness of satiety on the edge of a golden saucer half filled with dormice stewed in milk  the most indubitable evidences of the nights debauch appeared in vetranios disordered dress and flushed countenance as the freedman regarded him  for some minutes the worthy carrio stood uncertain whether to awaken his master or not deciding finally however on obeying the commands he had received and disturbing the slumbers of the wearied voluptuary before him to effect this purpose it was necessary to call in the aid of the singingboy for by a refinement of luxury vetranio had forbidden his attendants to awaken him by any other method than the agency of musical sounds  with some difficulty the boy was sufficiently aroused to comprehend the service that was required of him  for a short time the notes of the lyre sounded in vain  at last when the melody took a louder and more martial character the sleeping patrician slowly opened his eyes and stared vacantly around him  my respected patron said the polite carrio in apologetic tones commanded that i should awaken him with the dawn the daybreak has already appeared  when the freedman had ceased speaking vetranio sat up on the couch called for a basin of water dipped his fingers in the refreshing liquid dried them abstractedly on the long silky curls of the singingboy who stood beside him gazed about him once more repeated interrogatively the word daybreak and sunk gently back upon his couch  we are grieved to confess itbut the author of the nightingale sauce was moderately inebriated   a short pause followed during which the freedman and the singingboy stared upon each other in mutual perplexity  at length the one resumed his address of apology and the other resumed his efforts on the lyre once more after an interval the eyes of vetranio lazily unclosed and this time he began to speak but his thoughtsif thoughts they could be calledwere as yet wholly occupied by the tabletalk at the past nights banquet  the ancient egyptiansoh sprightly and enchanting camillawere a wise nation murmured the senator drowsily  i am myself descended from the ancient egyptians and therefore i hold in high veneration that cat in your lap and all cats besides  herodotusan historian whose works i feel a certain gratification in publicly mentioning as goodinforms us that when a cat died in the dwelling of an ancient egyptian the owner shaved his eyebrows as a mark of grief embalmed the defunct animal in a consecrated house and carried it to be interred in a considerable city of lower egypt called bubastisan egyptian word which i have discovered to mean the sepulchre of all the cats whence it is scarcely erroneous to infer  at this point the speakers power of recollection and articulation suddenly failed him and carriowho had listened with perfect gravity to his masters oration upon catstook immediate advantage of the opportunity now afforded him to speak again  the equipage which my patron was pleased to command to carry him to aricia said he with a strong emphasis on the last word now stands in readiness at the private gate of the palace gardens  as he heard the word aricia the senators powers of recollection and perception seemed suddenly to return to him  among that high order of drinkers who can imbibe to the point of perfect enjoyment and stop short scientifically before the point of perfect oblivion vetranio occupied an exalted rank  the wine he had swallowed during the night had disordered his memory and slightly troubled his selfpossession but had not deprived him of his understanding there was nothing plebeian even in his debauchery there was an art and a refinement in his very excesses  ariciaaricia he repeated to himself ah the villa that julia lent to me at ravenna  the pleasures of the table must have obscured for a moment the image of my beautiful pupil of other days which now revives before me again as love resumes the dominion that bacchus usurped my excellent carrio he continued speaking to the freedman you have done perfectly right in awakening me delay not a moment more in ordering my bath to be prepared or my manmonster ulpius the king of conspirators and high priest of all that is mysterious will wait for me in vain  and you glyco he pursued when carrio had departed addressing the singingboy array yourself for a journey and wait with my equipage at the gardengate  i shall require you to accompany me in my expedition to aricia  but first oh gifted and valued songster let me reward you for the harmonious symphony that has just awakened me  of what rank of my musicians are you at present glyco  of the fifth replied the boy  were you bought or born in my house asked vetranio  neither but bequeathed to you by getas testament rejoined the gratified glyco  i advance you continued vetranio to the privileges and the pay of the first rank of my musicians and i give you as a proof of my continued favour this ring  in return for these obligations i desire to keep secret whatever concerns my approaching expedition to employ your softest music in soothing the ear of a young girl who will accompany usin calming her terrors if she is afraid in drying her tears if she weeps and finally to exercise your voice and your lute incessantly in uniting the name antonina to the sweetest harmonies of sound that your imagination can suggest  pronouncing these words with an easy and benevolent smile and looking round complacently on the display of luxurious confusion about him vetranio retired to the bath that was to prepare him for his approaching triumph   meanwhile a scene of a very different nature was proceeding without at numerians gardengate here were no singingboys no freedmen no profusion of rich treasureshere appeared only the solitary and deformed figure of ulpius half hidden among surrounding trees while he waited at his appointed post  as time wore on and still vetranio did not appear the pagans selfpossession began to desert him  he moved restlessly backwards and forwards over the soft dewy grass sometimes in low tones calling upon his gods to hasten the tardy footsteps of the libertine patrician who was to be made the instrument of restoring to the temples the worship of other dayssometimes cursing the reckless delay of the senator or exulting in the treachery by which he madly believed his ambition was at last to be fulfilled but still whatever his words or thoughts wrought up to the same pitch of fierce fanatic enthusiasm which had strengthened him for the defence of his idols at alexandria and had nerved him against the torment and misery of years in his slavery in the copper mines of spain  the precious moments were speeding irrevocably onwards  his impatience was rapidly changing to rage and despair as he strained his eyes for the last time in the direction of the palace gardens and now at length discerned a white robe among the distant trees  vetranio was rapidly approaching him  restored by his bath no effect of the nights festivity but its exhilaration remained in the senators brain  but for a slight uncertainty in his gait and an unusual vacancy in his smile the elegant gastronome might now have appeared to the closest observer guiltless of the influence of intoxicating drinks  he advanced radiant with exultation prepared for conquest to the place where ulpius awaited him and was about to address the pagan with that satirical familiarity so fashionable among the nobles of rome in their communications with the people when the object of his intended pleasantries sternly interrupted him saying in tones more of command than of advice be silent  if you would succeed in your purpose follow me without uttering a word  there was something so fierce and determined in the tones of the old mans voicelow tremulous and husky though they wereas he uttered those words that the bold confident senator instinctively held his peace as he followed his stern guide into numerians house avoiding the regular entrance which at that early hour of the morning was necessarily closed ulpius conducted the patrician through a small wicket into the subterranean apartment or rather outhouse which was his customary though comfortless retreat in his leisure hours and which was hardly ever entered by the other members of the christians household  from the low arched brick ceiling of this place hung an earthenware lamp whose light small and tremulous left all the corners of the apartment in perfect obscurity  the thick buttresses that projected inwards from the walls made visible by their prominence displayed on their surfaces rude representations of idols and temples drawn in chalk and covered with strange mysterious hieroglyphics  on a block of stone which served as a table lay some fragments of small statues which vetranio recognised as having belonged to the old accredited representations of pagan idols  over the sides of the table itself were scrawled in latin characters these two words serapis macrinus and about its base lay some pieces of torn soiled linen which still retained enough of their former character both in shape size and colour to convince vetranio that they had once served as the vestments of a pagan priest  further than this the senators observation did not carry him for the close almost mephitic atmosphere of the place already began to affect him unfavourably  he felt a suffocating sensation in his throat and a dizziness in his head the restorative influence of his recent bath declined rapidly  the fumes of the wine he had drunk in the night far from having been as he imagined permanently dispersed again mounted to his head  he was obliged to lean against the stone table to preserved his equilibrium as he faintly desired the pagan to shorten their sojourn in his miserable retreat   without even noticing the request ulpius hurriedly proceeded to erase the drawings on the buttresses and the inscriptions on the table  then collecting the fragments of statues and the pieces of linen he deposited them in a hidingplace in the corner of the apartment  this done he returned to the stone against which vetranio supported himself and for a few minutes silently regarded the senator with a firm earnest and penetrating gaze  a dark suspicion that he had betrayed himself into the hands of a villain who was then plotting some atrocious project connected with his safety or honour began to rise on the senators bewildered brain as he unwillingly submitted to the penetrating examination of the pagans glance at that moment however the withered lips of the old man slowly parted and he began to speak whether as he looked on vetranios disturbed countenance and marked his unsteady gait the heart of ulpius for the first time since his introduction to the senator misgave him when he thought of their monstrous engagement or whether the near approach of the moment that was henceforth as he wildly imagined to fix vetranio as his assistant and ally so powerfully affected his mind that it instinctively sought to vent its agitation through the natural medium of words it is useless to inquire  whatever his motives for speech the impressive earnestness of his manner gave evidence of the depth and intensity of his emotions as he addressed the senator thus  i have submitted to servitude in a christians house i have suffered the contamination of a christians prayers to gain the use of your power and station when the time to employ them should arrive  the hour has now come when my part of the conditions of our engagement is to be performed the hour will yet come when your part shall be exacted from you in turn  do you wonder at what i have done and what i will do  do you marvel that a household drudge should speak thus to a nobleman of rome  are you astonished that i risk so much as to venture on enlisting youby the sacrifice of the girl who now slumbers abovein the cause whose end is the restoration of our fathers gods and in whose service i have suffered and grown old  listen and you shall hear from what i have fallenyou shall know what i once was  i adjure you by all the gods and goddesses of our ancient worship let me hear you where i can breathein the garden on the housetop anywhere but in this dungeon murmured the senator in entreating accents  my birth my parents my education my ancient abodethese i will not disclose interrupted the pagan raising one arm authoritatively as if to obstruct vetranio from approaching the door  i have sworn by my gods that until the day of restitution these secrets of my past life shall remain unrevealed to strangers ears  unknown i entered rome and unknown i will labour in rome until the projects i have lived for are crowned with success  it is enough that i confess to you that with those sacred images whose fragments you have just beheld i was once lodged that those sacred vestments whose remains you discerned at your feet i once wore  to attain the glories of the priesthood there was nothing that i did not resign to preserve them there was nothing i did not perform to recover them there is nothing that i will not attempt i was once illustrious prosperous beloved of my glory my happiness my popularity the christians have robbed me and i will yet live to requite it heavily at their hands  i had a guardian who loved me in my youth the christians murdered him  a temple was under the rule of my manhood the christians destroyed it  the people of a whole nation once listened to my voice the christians have dispersed them  the wise the great the beautiful the good were once devoted to me the christians have made me a stranger at their doors and outcast of their affections and thoughts for all this shall i take no vengeance  shall i not plot to rebuild my ruined temple and win back in my age the honours that adorned me in my youth  assuredlyat oncewithout delay stammered vetranio returning the stern and inquiring gaze of the pagan with a bewildered uneasy stare   to mount over the bodies of the christian slain continued the old man his sinister eyes dilating in anticipated triumph as he whispered close at the senators ear to rebuild the altars that the christians have overthrown is the ambition that has made light to me the sufferings of my whole life  i have battled and it has sustained me in the midst of carnage i have wandered and it has been my home in the desert i have failed and it has supported me i have been threatened with death and it has preserved me from fear i have been cast into slavery and it has made my fetters light  you see me now old degraded lonelybelieve that i long neither for wife children tranquility nor possessions that i desire no companion but my cherished and exalted purpose remember then in the hour of performance the promise you have now made to aid me in the achievement of that purpose  remember that you are a pagan yourself  feast laugh carouse with your compeers be still the airy jester the gay companion but never forget the end to which you are vowedthe destiny of glory that the restoration of our deities has in store for us both  he ceased  though his voice while he spoke never rose beyond a hoarse monotonous halfwhispering tone all the ferocity of his abused and degraded nature was for the instant thoroughly aroused by his recapitulation of his wrongs  had vetranio at this moment shown any symptoms of indecision or spoken any words of discouragement he would have murdered him on the spot where they stood  every feature in the pagans seared and livid countenance expressed the stormy emotions that were rushing over his heart as he now confronted his bewildered yet attentive listener  his firm menacing position his poor and scanty garments his wild shaggy hair his crooked distorted form his stern solemn unwavering gazeopposed as they were under the fitful illumination of the expiring lamp and the advancing daylight to the unsteady gait the vacant countenance the rich robes the youthful grace of form and delicacy of feature of the object of his steady contemplation made so wild and strange a contrast between his patrician ally and himself that they scarcely looked like beings of the same race nothing could be more immense than the difference more wild than the incongruity between them  it was sickness handinhand with health pain marshalled face to face with enjoyment darkness ranged in monstrous discordance by the very side of light  the next instantjust as the astonished senator was endeavouring to frame a suitable answer to the solemn adjuration that had been addressed to himulpius seized his arm and opening a door at the inner extremity of the apartment led him up some stairs that conducted to the interior of the house  they passed the hall on the floor of which still lay the fragments of the broken lute dimly distinguishable in the soft light of daybreak and ascending another staircase paused at a little door at the top which ulpius cautiously opened and in a moment afterwards vetranio was admitted into antoninas bedchamber   the room was of no great extent its scanty furniture was of the most ordinary description no ornaments glittered on its walls no frescoes adorned its ceiling and yet there was a simple elegance in its appearance an unobtrusive propriety in its minutest details which made it at once interesting and attractive to the eye  from the white curtains at the window to the vase of flowers standing by the bedside the same natural refinement of taste appeared in the arrangement of all that the apartment contained  no sound broke the deep silence of the place save the low soft breathing occasionally interrupted by a long trembling sigh of its sleeping occupant  the sole light in the room consisted of a little lamp so placed in the middle of the flowers round the sides of the vase that no extended or steady illumination was cast upon any object  there was something in the decent propriety of all that was visible in the bedchamber in the soft obscurity of its atmosphere in the gentle and musical sound that alone interrupted its magical stillness impressive enough it might have been imagined to have awakened some hesitation in the bosom of the boldest libertine ere he deliberately proceeded to intrude on the unprotected slumbers of its occupant  no such feeling of indecision however troubled the thoughts of vetranio as he cast a rapid glance round the apartment which he had ventured so treacherously to invade  the fumes of the wine he had imbibed at the banquet had been so thoroughly resuscitated by the oppressive atmosphere of the subterranean retreat he had just quitted as to have left him nothing of his more refined nature  all that was honourable or intellectual in his character had now completely ceded to all that was base and animal  he looked round and perceiving that ulpius had silently quitted him softly closed the door  then advancing to the bedside with the utmost caution compatible with the involuntary unsteadiness of an intoxicated man he took the lamp from the vase in which it was half concealed and earnestly surveyed by its light the figure of the sleeping girl  the head of antonina was thrown back and rested rather over than on her pillow  her light linen dress had become so disordered during the night that it displayed her throat and part of her bosom in all the dawning beauties of their youthful formation to the gaze of the licentious roman  one hand half supported her head and was almost entirely hidden in the locks of her long black hair which had escaped from the white cincture intended to confine it and now streamed over the pillow in dazzling contrast to the light bedfurniture around it the other hand held tightly clasped to her bosom the precious fragment of her broken lute  the deep repose expressed in her position had not thoroughly communicated itself to her face  now and then her slightly parted lips moved and trembled and ever and anon a change so faint and fugitive that it was hardly perceptible appeared in her complexion breathing on the soft olive that was its natural hue the light rosy flush which the emotions of the past night had impressed on it ere she slept  her position in its voluptuous negligence seemed the very type of oriental loveliness while her face calm and sorrowful in its expression displayed the more refined and sober graces of the european model  and thus these two characteristics of two different orders of beauty appearing conjointly under one form produced a whole so various and yet so harmonious so impressive and yet so attractive that the senator as he bent over the couch though the warm soft breath of the young girl played on his cheeks and waved the tips of his perfumed locks could hardly imagine that the scene before him was more than a bright delusive dream  while vetranio was yet absorbed in admiration of her charms antoninas form slightly moved as if agitated by the influence of a passing dream the change thus accomplished in her position broke the spell that its former stillness and beauty had unconsciously wrought to restrain the unhallowed ardour of the profligate roman  he now passed his arm round her warm slender figure and gently raising her till her head rested on his shoulder as he sat by the bed imprinted kiss after kiss on the pure lips that sleep had innocently abandoned to him  as he had foreseen antonina instantly awoke but to his unmeasured astonishment neither started nor shrieked  the moment she had opened her eyes she had recognised the person of vetranio and that overwhelming terror which suspends in its victims the use of every faculty whether of the body or the mind had immediately possessed itself of her heart  too innocent to imagine the real motive that prompted the senators intrusion on her slumbers where others of her sex would have foreboded dishonour she feared death  all her fathers vague denunciations against the enormities of the nobles of rome rushed in an instant over her mind and her childish imagination pictured vetranio as armed with some terrible and mysterious vengeance to be wreaked on her for having avoided all communication with him as soon as she had gained possession of her lute  prostrate beneath the petrifying influence of her fears motionless and powerless before him as its prey before the serpent she made no effort to move or speak but looked up steadfastly into the senators face her large eyes fixed and dilated in a gaze of overpowering terror  intoxicated though he was the affrighted expression of the poor girls pale rigid countenance did not escape vetranios notice and he taxed his bewildered brain for such soothing and reassuring expressions as would enable him to introduce his profligate proposals with some chance that they would be listened to and understood   dearest pupil  most beautiful of roman maidens he began in the husky monotonous tones of inebriety abandon your fears  i come hither wafted by the breath of love to restore the worship of thei would say to bear you on my bosom to a villathe name of which has for the moment escaped my remembrance  you cannot have forgotten that it was i who taught you to compose the nightingale sauceor nolet me rather say to play upon the lute  love music pleasure all await you in the arms of your attached vetranio  your eloquent silence speaks encouragement to my heart  beloved anto  here the senator suddenly paused for the eyes of the girl which had hitherto been fixed on him with the same expression of blank dismay that had characterised them from the first slowly moved in the direction of the door  the instant afterwards a slight noise caught vetranios ear and antonina shuddered so violently as he pressed her to his side that he felt it through his whole frame  slowly and unwillingly he withdrew his gaze from the pale yet lovely countenance on which it had been fixed and looked up  at the open door pale silent motionless stood the master of the house  incapable from the confusion of his ideas of any other feeling than the animal instinct of selfdefence vetranio no sooner beheld numerians figure than he rose and drawing a small dagger from his bosom attempted to advance on the intruder  he found himself however restrained by antonina who had fallen on her knees before him and grasped his robe with a strength which seemed utterly incompatible with the slenderness of her form and the feebleness of her sex and age  the first voice that broke the silence which ensued was numerians  he advanced his face ghastly with anguish his lip quivering with suppressed emotions to the senators side and addressed him thus  put up your weapon i come but to ask a favour at your hands  vetranio mechanically obeyed him  there was something in the stern calmness frightful at such a moment of the christians manner that awed him in spite of himself  the favour i would petition for continued numerian in low steady bitter tones is that you would remove your harlot there to your own abode  here are no singingboys no banquetinghalls no perfumed couches  the retreat of a solitary old man is no place for such an one as she  i beseech you remove her to a more congenial home  she is well fitted for her trade her mother was a harlot before her  he laughed scornfully and pointed as he spoke to the figure of the unhappy girl kneeling with outstretched arms at his feet  father father she cried in accents bereft of their native softness and melody have you forgotten me  i know you not he replied thrusting her from him  return to his bosom you shall never more be pressed to mine  go to his palace my house is yours no longer  you are his harlot not my daughter  i command yougo  as he advanced towards her with fierce glance and threatening demeanour she suddenly rose up her reason seemed crushed within her as she looked with frantic earnestness from vetranio to her father and then back again from her father to vetranio  on one side she saw an enemy who had ruined her she knew not how and who threatened her with she knew not what on the other a parent who had cast her off  for one instant she directed a final look on the room that sad and lonely though it was had still been a home to her and then without a word or a sigh she turned and crouching like a beaten dog fled from the house   during the whole of the scene vetranio had stood so fixed in the helpless astonishment of intoxication as to be incapable of moving or uttering a word  all that took place during the short and terrible interview between father and child utterly perplexed him  he heard no loud violent anger on one side no clamorous petitioning for forgiveness on the other  the stern old man whom antonina had called father and who had been pointed out to him as the most austere christian in rome far from avenging his intrusion on antoninas slumber had voluntarily abandoned his daughter to his licentious will that the anger or irony of so severe a man should inspire such an action as this or that numerian like his servant was plotting to obtain some strange mysterious favour from him by using antonina as a bribe seemed perfectly impossible all that passed before the senator was to his bewildered imagination thoroughly incomprehensible frivolous thoughtless profligate as he might be his nature was not radically base and when the scene of which he had been the astounded witness was abruptly terminated by the flight of antonina the look of frantic misery fixed on him by the unfortunate girl at the moment of her departure almost sobered him for the instant as he stood before the now solitary father gazing vacantly around him with emotions of uncontrollable confusion and dismay  meanwhile a third person was now approaching to join the two occupants of the bedchamber abandoned by its illfated mistress  although in the subterranean retreat to which he had retired on leaving vetranio ulpius had not noticed the silent entrance of the master of the house he had heard through the open doors the sound low though it was of the christians voice  as he rose suspecting all things and prepared for every emergency to ascend to the bedchamber he saw while he mounted the lowest range of stairs a figure in white pass rapidly through the hall and disappear by the principal entrance of the house he hesitated for an instant and looked after it but the fugitive figure had passed so swiftly in the uncertain light of early morning that he was unable to identify it and he determined to ascertain the progress of events now that numerian must have discovered a portion at least of the plot against his daughter and himself by ascending immediately to antoninas apartment whatever might be the consequences of his intrusion at such an hour on her fathers wrath  as soon as the pagan appeared before him a sensible change took place in vetranio  the presence of ulpius in the chamber was a positive relief to the senators perturbed faculties after the mysterious overpowering influence that the moral command expressed in the mere presence of the father and the master of the house at such an hour had exercised over them over ulpius he had an absolute right ulpius was his dependant and he determined therefore to extort from the servant whom he despised an explanation of the mysteries in the conduct of the master whom he feared and the daughter whom he began to doubt  where is antonina he cried starting as if from a trance and advancing fiercely towards the treacherous pagan  she has left the roomshe must have taken refuge with you  with a slow and penetrating gaze ulpius looked round the apartment  a faint agitation was perceptible in his livid countenance but he uttered not a word  the senators face became pale and red with alternate emotions of apprehension and rage  he seized the pagan by the throat his eyes sparkled his blood boiled he began to suspect even then that antonina was lost to him for ever  i ask you again where is she he shouted in a voice of fury  if through this nights work she is lost or harmed i will revenge it on you  is this the performance of your promise  do you think that i will direct your desired restoration of the gods of old for this  if evil comes to antonina through your treachery sooner than assist in your secret projects i would see you and your accursed deities all burning together in the christians hell  where is the girl you slave villain where was your vigilance when you let that man surprise us at our first interview  he turned towards numerian as he spoke  trouble and emergency gift the faculties with a more than mortal penetration  every word that he had uttered had eaten its burning way into the fathers heart  hours of narrative could not have convinced him how fatally he had been deceived more thoroughly than the few hasty expressions he had just heard  no word passed his lipsno action betrayed his misery  he stood before the spoilers of his home changed in an instant from the courageous enthusiast to the feeble helpless heartbroken man  though all the ferocity of his old roman blood had been roused in vetranio as he threatened ulpius the fathers look of cold silent frightful despair froze it in his young veins in an instant his heart was still the impressible heart of youth and struck for the first time in his life with emotions of horror and remorse he advanced a step to offer such explanation and atonement as he best might when the voice of ulpius suspended his intentions and made him pause to listen  she passed me in the hall muttered the pagan doggedly  i did my part in betraying her into your powerit was for you to hinder her in her flight  why did you not strike him to the earth he continued pointing with a mocking smile to numerian when he surprised you  you are wealthy and a noble of rome murder would have been no crime in you  stand back cried the senator thrusting him from the position he had hitherto occupied in the doorway  she may be recovered even yet all rome shall be searched for her  the next instant he disappeared from the room and the master and servant were left together alone  the silence that now reigned in the apartment was broken by distant sounds of uproar and confusion in the streets of the city beneath these ominous noises had arisen with the dawn of day but the different emotions of the occupants of numerians abode had so engrossed them that the turmoil in the outer world had passed unheeded by all  no sooner however had vetranio departed than it caught the attention of ulpius and he advanced to the window  what he there saw and heard was of no ordinary importance for it at once fixed him to the spot where he stood in mute and ungovernable surprise  while ulpius was occupied at the window numerian had staggered to the side of the bed which his illtimed severity had made vacant perhaps for ever  the power of action the capacity to go forth and seek his child himself was entirely suspended in the agony of her loss as the miserable man fell on his knees and in the anguish of his heart endeavoured to find solace in prayer  in the positions they severally occupied the servant and the master long remainedthe betrayer watching at the window the betrayed mourning at his lost daughters bedboth alike silent both alike unconscious of the lapse of time  at length apparently unaware at first that he was not alone in the room numerian spoke  in his low broken tremulous accents none of his adherents would have recognised the voice of the eloquent preacherthe bold chastiser of the vices of the church  the whole nature of the manmoral intellectual physicalseemed fatally and completely changed  she was innocent she was innocent he whispered to himself  and even had she been guilty was it for me to drive her from my doors  my part like my redeemers was to teach repentance and to show mercy accursed be the pride and anger that drove justice and patience from my heart when i beheld her as i thought submitting herself without a struggle or a cry to my dishonour and hers  could i not have imagined her terror could i not have remembered her purity  alas my beloved if i myself have been the dupe of the wicked what marvel is it that you should have been betrayed as well  and i have driven you from me you from whose mouth no word of anger ever dropped  i have thrust you from my bosom you who were the adornment of my age  my death approaches and you will not be by to pardon my heavy offence to close my weary eyes to mourn by my solitary tomb  godoh god  if i am left thus lonely on the earth thou hast punished me beyond what i can bear  he pausedhis emotions for the instant bereft him of speech  after an interval he muttered to himself in a low moaning voicei called her harlot  my pure innocent child  i called her harloti called her harlot   in a paroxysm of despair he started up and looked distractedly around him  ulpius still stood motionless at the window  at the sight of the ruthless pagan he trembled in every limb  all those infirmities of age that had been hitherto spared him seemed to overwhelm him in an instant  he feebly advanced to his betrayers side and addressed him thus  i have lodged you taught you cared for you i have never intruded on your secrets never doubted your word and for all this you have repaid me by plotting against my daughter and deceiving me  if your end was to harm me by assailing my childs happiness and honour you have succeeded if you would banish me from rome if you would plunge me into obscurity to serve some mysterious ambition of your own you may dispose of me as you will  i bow before the terrible power of your treachery  i will renounce whatever you command if you will restore me to my child  i am helpless and miserable i have neither heart nor strength to seek her myself  you who know all things and can dare all dangers may restore her to pardon and bless me if you will remember whoever you really are that you were once helpless and alone and that you are still old like me  remember that i have promised to abandon to you whatever you desire  remember that no womans voice can cheer me no womans heart feel for me now that i am old and lonely but my daughters  i have guessed from the words of the nobleman whom you serve what are the designs you cherish and the faith you profess i will neither betray the one nor assault the other i thought that my labours for the church were more to me than anything on earth but now that through my fault my daughter is driven from her fathers roof i know that she is dearer to me than the greatest of my designs i must gain her pardon i must win back her affection before i die  you are powerful and can recover her  ulpius  ulpius  as he spoke the christian knelt at the pagans feet  it was terrible to see the man of affection and integrity thus humbled before the man of heartlessness and crime  ulpius turned to behold him then without a word he raised him from the ground and thrusting him to the window pointed with flashing eyes to the wide view without  the sun had arisen high in the heaven and beamed in dazzling brilliancy over rome and the suburbs  a vague fearful mysterious desolation seemed to have suddenly overwhelmed the whole range of dwellings beyond the walls  no sounds rose from the gardens no population idled in the streets  the ramparts on the other hand were crowded at every visible point with people of all ranks and the distant squares and amphitheatres of the city itself swarmed like anthills to the eye with the crowds that struggled within them  confused cries and strange wild noises rose at all points from these masses of human beings  the whole of rome seemed the prey of a vast and universal revolt  extraordinary and affrighting as was the scene at the moment when he beheld it it passed unheeded before the eyes of the scarce conscious father  he was blind to all sights but his daughters form deaf to all sounds but her voice and he murmured as he looked vacantly forth upon the wild view before him where is my childwhere is my child  what is your child to me  what are the fortunes of affections of man or woman at such an hour as this cried the pagan as he stood by numerian with features horribly animated by the emotions of fierce delight and triumph that were raging within him at the prospect he beheld  dotard look from this window  listen to those voices  the gods whom i serve the god whom you and your worship would fain have destroyed have risen to avenge themselves at last behold those suburbs they are left desolate  hear those criesthey are from roman lips  while your households puny troubles have run their course this city of apostates has been doomed  in the worlds annals this morning will never be forgotten  the goths are at the gates of rome    chapter 8  the goths  it was no false rumour that had driven the populace of the suburbs to fly to the security of the city walls  it was no illfounded cry of terror that struck the ear of ulpius as he stood at numerians window the name of rome had really lost its pristine terrors the walls of rome those walls which had morally guarded the empire by their renown as they had actually guarded its capital by their strength were deprived at length of their ancient inviolability  an army of barbarians had indeed penetrated for conquest and for vengeance to the city of the world  the achievement which the invasions of six hundred years had hitherto attempted in vain was now accomplished and accomplished by the men whose forefathers had once fled like hunted beasts to their native fastnesses before the legions of the caesarsthe goths were at the gates of rome  and now as his warriors encamped around him as he saw the arrayed hosts whom his summons had gathered together and his energy led on threatening at their doors the corrupt senate who had deceived and the boastful populace who had despised him what emotions stirred within the heart of alaric  as the words of martial command fell from his lips and his eyes watched the movements of the multitudes around him what exalted aspirations what daring resolves grew and strengthened in the mind of the man who was the pioneer of that mighty revolution which swept from one quarter of the world the sway the civilisation the very life and spirit of centuries of ancient rule  high thoughts gathered fast in his mind a daring ambition expanded within himthe ambition not of the barbarian plunderer but of the avenger who had come to punish not of the warrior who combated for combats sake but of the hero who was vowed to conquer and to sway  from the fardistant days when odin was driven from his territories by the romans to the night polluted by the massacre of the hostages in aquileia the hour of just and terrible retribution for gothic wrongs had been delayed through the weary lapse of years and the warning convulsion of bitter strifes to approach at last under him  he looked on the towering walls before him the only invader since hannibal by whom they had been beheld and he felt as he looked that his new aspirations did not deceive him that his dreams of dominion were brightening into proud reality that his destiny was gloriously linked with the overthrow of imperial rome  but even in the moment of approaching triumph the leader of the goths was still wily in purpose and moderate in action  his impatient warriors waited but the word to commence the assault to pillage the city and to slaughter the inhabitants but he withheld it  scarcely had the army halted before the gates of rome when the news was promulgated among their ranks that alaric for purposes of his own had determined to reduce the city by a blockade  the numbers of his forces increased during his march by the accession of thirty thousand auxiliaries were now divided into battalions varying in strength according to the service that was required of them these divisions stretched round the city walls and though occupying separate posts and devoted to separate duties were so arranged as to be capable of uniting at a signal in any numbers on any given point each body of men was commanded by a tried and veteran warrior in whose fidelity alaric could place the most implicit trust and to whom he committed the duty of enforcing the strictest military discipline that had ever prevailed among the gothic ranks  before each of the twelve principal gates a separate encampment was raised multitudes watched the navigation of the tiber in every possible direction with untiring vigilance and not one of the ordinary inlets to rome however apparently unimportant was overlooked by these means every mode of communication between the beleaguered city and the wide and fertile tracts of land around it was effectually prevented  when it is remembered that this elaborate plan of blockade was enforced against a place containing at the lowest possible computation twelve hundred thousand inhabitants destitute of magazines for food within its walls dependent for supplies on its regular contributions from the country without governed by an irresolute senate and defended by an enervated army the horrors that now impended over the besieged romans are as easily imagined as described   among the ranks of the army that now surrounded the doomed city the division appointed to guard the pincian gate will be found at this juncture most worthy of the readers attention  for one of the warriors appointed to its subordinate command was the young chieftain hermanric who had been accompanied by goisvintha through all the toils and dangers of the march since the time when we left him at the italian alps  the watch had been set the tents had been pitched the defences had been raised on the portion of ground selected to occupy every possible approach to the pincian gate as hermanric retired to await by goisvinthas side whatever further commands he might yet be entrusted with by his superiors in the gothic camp  the spot occupied by the young warriors simple tent was on a slight eminence apart from the positions chosen by his comrades eastward of the city gate and overlooking at some distance the deserted gardens of the suburbs and the stately palaces of the pincian hill  behind his temporary dwelling was the open country reduced to a fertile solitude by the flight of its terrified inhabitants and at each side lay one unvarying prospect of military strength and preparation stretching out its animated confusion of soldiers tents and engines of warfare as far as the sight could reach  it was now evening  the walls of rome enshrouded in a rising mist showed dim and majestic to the eyes of the goths the noises in the beleaguered city softened and deepened seeming to be muffled in the growing darkness of the autumn night and becoming less and less audible as the vigilant besiegers listened to them from their respective posts one by one lights broke wildly forth at irregular distances in the gothic camp  harshly and fitfully the shrill call of the signal trumpets rang from rank to rank and through the dim thick air rose in the intervals of the more important noises the clash of heavy hammers and the shout of martial command wherever the preparations for the blockade were still incomplete neither the approach of night nor the pretext of weariness were suffered for an instant to hinder their continued progress alarics indomitable will conquered every obstacle of nature and every deficiency of man darkness had no obscurity that forced him to repose and lassitude no eloquence that lured him to delay  in no part of the army had the commands of the gothic king been so quickly and intelligently executed as in that appointed to watch the pincian gate  the interview of hermanric and goisvintha in the young chieftains tent was consequently uninterrupted for a considerable space of time by any fresh mandate from the headquarters of the camp  in outward appearance both the brother and sister had undergone a change remarkable enough to be visible even by the uncertain light of the torch which now shone on them as they stood together at the door of the tent  the features of goisvinthawhich at the period when we first beheld her on the shores of the mountain lake retained in spite of her poignant sufferings much of the lofty and imposing beauty that had been their natural characteristic in her happier daysnow preserved not the slightest traces of their former attractions  its freshness had withered from her complexion its fulness had departed from her form her eyes had contracted an unvarying sinister expression of malignant despair and her manner had become sullen repulsive and distrustful this alteration in her outward aspect was but the result of a more perilous change in the disposition of her heart  the death of her last child at the very moment when her flight had successfully directed her to the protection of her people had affected her more fatally than all the losses she had previously sustained  the difficulties and dangers that she had encountered in saving her offspring from the massacre the dismal certainty that the child was the only one out of all the former objects of her affection left to her to love the wild sense of triumph that she experienced in remembering that in this single instance her solitary efforts had thwarted the savage treachery of the court of rome had inspired her with feelings of devotion towards the last of her household which almost bordered on insanity  and now that her beloved charge her innocent victim her future warrior had after all her struggles for his preservation pined and died now that she was childless indeed now that roman cruelty had won its end in spite of all her patience all her courage all her endurance every noble feeling within her sunk annihilated at the shock  her sorrow took the fatal form which irretrievable destroys in women all the softer and better emotionsit changed to the despair that asks no sympathy to the grief that holds no communion with tears  less elevated in intellect and less susceptible in disposition the change to sullenness of expression and abruptness of manner now visible in hermanric resulted rather from his constant contemplation of goisvinthas gloomy despair than from any actual revolution in his own character  in truth however many might be the points of outward resemblance now discernible between the brother and sister the difference in degree of their moral positions implied of itself the difference in degree of the inward sorrow of each  whatever the trials and afflictions that might assail him hermanric possessed the healthful elasticity of youth and the martial occupations of manhood to support them  goisvintha could repose on neither  with no employment but bitter remembrance to engage her thoughts with no kindly aspiration no soothing hope to fill her heart she was abandoned irrevocably to the influence of unpartaken sorrow and vindictive despair  both the woman and the warrior stood together in silence for some time at length without taking his eyes from the dusky irregular mass before him which was all that night now left visible of the illfated city hermanric addressed goisvintha thus  have you no words of triumph as you look on the ramparts that your people have fought for generations to behold at their mercy as we now behold them  can a woman of the goths be silent when she stands before the city of rome  i came hither to behold rome pillaged and romans slaughtered what is rome blockaded to me replied goisvintha fiercely  the treasures within that city will buy its safety from our king as soon as the tremblers on the ramparts gain heart enough to penetrate a gothic camp where is the vengeance that you promised me among those distant palaces do i behold you carrying that destruction through the dwellings of rome which the soldiers of yonder city carried through the dwellings of the goths  is it for plunder or for glory that the army is here  i thought in my womans delusion that it was for revenge  dishonour will avenge youfamine will avenge youpestilence will avenge you  they will avenge my nation they will not avenge me  i have seen the blood of gothic women spilt around mei have looked on my childrens corpses bleeding at my feet  will a famine that i cannot see and a pestilence that i cannot watch give me vengeance for this  look here is the helmetcrest of my husband and your brotherthe helmetcrest that was flung to me as a witness that the romans had slain him  since the massacre of aquileia it has never quitted my bosom  i have sworn that the blood which stains and darkens it shall be washed off in the blood of the people of rome  though i should perish under those accursed walls though you in your soulless patience should refuse me protection and aid i widowed weakened forsaken as i am will hold to the fulfilment of my oath  as she ceased she folded the crest in her mantle and turned abruptly from hermanric in bitter and undissembled scorn  all the attributes of her sex in thought expression and manner seemed to have deserted her  the very tones she spoke in were harsh and unwomanly   every word she had uttered every action she had displayed had sunk into the inmost heart had stirred the fiercest passions of the young warrior whom she addressed  the first national sentiment discoverable in the dayspring of the ages of gothic history is the love of war but the second is the reverence of woman  this latter feelingespecially remarkable among so fierce and unsusceptible a people as the ancient scandinavianswas entirely unconnected with those strong attaching ties which are the natural consequence of the warm temperaments of more southern nations for love was numbered with the base inferior passions in the frigid and hardy composition of the warrior of the north  it was the offspring of reasoning and observation not of instinctive sentiment and momentary impulse  in the wild poetical code of the old gothic superstition was one axiom closely and strangely approximating to an important theory in the christian schemethe watchfulness of an omnipotent creator over a finite creature  every action of the body every impulse of the mind was the immediate result in the system of worship among the goths of the direct though invisible interference of the divinities they adored  when therefore they observed that women were more submitted in body to the mysterious laws of nature and temperament and more swayed in mind by the native and universal instincts of humanity than themselves they inferred as an inevitable conclusion that the female sex was more incessantly regarded and more constantly and remarkably influenced by the gods of their worship than the male  acting under this persuasion they committed the study of medicine the interpretation of dreams and in many instances the mysteries of communication with the invisible world to the care of their women the gentler sex became their counsellors in difficulty and their physicians in sicknesstheir companions rather than their mistressesthe objects of their veneration rather than the purveyors of their pleasures  although in after years the national migrations of the goths changed the national temperament although their ancient mythology was exchanged for the worship of christ this prevailing sentiment of their earliest existence as a people never entirely deserted them but with different modifications and in different forms maintained much of its old supremacy through all changes of manners and varieties of customs descending finally to their posterity among the present nations of europe in the shape of that established code of universal courtesy to women which is admitted to be one great distinguishing mark between the social systems of the inhabitants of civilised and uncivilised lands  this powerful and remarkable ascendancy of the woman over the man among the goths could hardly be more strikingly displayed than in the instance of hermanric  it appeared not only in the deteriorating effect of the constant companionship of goisvintha on his naturally manly character but also in the strong influence over his mind of the last words of fury and disdain that she had spoken  his eyes gleamed with anger his cheeks flushed with shame as he listened to those passages in her wrathful remonstrance which reflected most bitterly on himself  she had scarcely ceased and turned to retire into the tent when he arrested her progress and replied in heightened and accusing tones  you wrong me by your words  when i saw you among the alps did i refuse you protection when the child was wounded did i leave him to suffer unaided  when he died did i forsake him to rot upon the earth or abandon to his mother the digging of his grave  when we approached aquileia and marched past ravenna did i forget that the sword hung at my shoulder  was it at my will that it remained sheathed or that i entered not the gates of the roman towns but passed by them in haste was it not the command of the king that withheld me and could i his warrior disobey  i swear it to you the vengeance that i promised i yearn to performbut is it for me to alter the counsels of alaric can i alone assault the city which it is his command that we should blockade  what would you have of me  i would have you remember retorted goisvintha indignantly that romans slew your brother and made me childless  i would have you remember that a public warfare of years on years is powerless to stay one hours craving of private vengeance  i would have you less submitted to your generals wisdom and more devoted to your own wrongs i would have youlike methirst for the blood of the first inhabitant of yonder den of traitors whowhether for peace or for warpasses the precincts of its sheltering walls  she paused abruptly for an answer but hermanric uttered not a word the courageous heart of the young chieftain recoiled at the deliberate act of assassination pressed upon him in goisvinthas veiled yet expressive speech to act with his comrades in taking the city by assault to outdo in the heat of battle the worst horrors of the massacre of aquileia would have been achievements in harmony with his wild disposition and warlike education but to submit himself to goisvinthas projects was a sacrifice that the very peculiarities of his martial character made repugnant to his thoughts emotions such as these he would have communicated to his companion as they passed through his mind but there was something in the fearful and ominous change that had occurred in her disposition since he had met her among the alpsin her frantic unnatural craving for bloodshed and revenge that gave her a mysterious and powerful influence over his thoughts his words and even his actions he hesitated and was silent  have i not been patient continued goisvintha lowering her voice to tones of earnest agitated entreaty which jarred upon hermanrics ear as he thought who was the petitioner and what would be the object of the petition have i not been patient throughout the weary journey from the alps  have i not waited for the hour of retribution even before the defenceless cities that we passed on the march  have i not at your instigation governed my yearning for vengeance until the day that should see you mounting those walls with the warriors of the goths to scourge with fire and sword the haughty traitors of rome has that day come  is it by this blockade that the requital you promised me over the corpse of my murdered child is to be performed remember the perils i dared to preserve the life of that last one of my householdand will you risk nothing to avenge his death  his sepulchre is untended and solitary  far from the dwellings of his people lost in the dawn of his beauty slaughtered in the beginning of his strength lies the offspring of your brothers blood  and the restthe two children who were yet infants the father who was brave in battle and wise in councilwhere are they  their bones whiten on the shelterless plain or rot unburied by the ocean shore  thinkhad they livedhow happily your days would have passed with them in the time of peace how gladly your brother would have gone forth with you to the chase how joyfully his boys would have nestled at your knees to gather from your lips the first lessons that should form them for the warriors life  think of such enjoyments as these and then think that roman swords have deprived you of them all  her voice trembled she ceased for a moment and looked mournfully up into hermanrics averted face  every feature in the young chieftains countenance expressed the tumult that her words had aroused within him he attempted to reply but his voice was powerless in that trying moment  his head drooped upon his heaving breast and he sighed heavily as without speaking he grasped goisvintha by the hand  the object she had pleaded for was nearly attainedhe was fast sinking beneath the tempters wellspread toils  are you silent still she gloomily resumed  do you wonder at this longing for vengeance at this craving for roman blood  i tell you that my desire has arisen within me at promptings from the voices of an unknown world  they urge me to seek requital on the nation who have widowed and bereaved meyonder in their vaunted city from their pampered citizens among their cherished homesin the spot where their shameful counsels take root and whence their ruthless treacheries derive their bloody source  in the book that our teachers worship i have heard it read that the voice of blood crieth from the ground this is the voicehermanric this is the voice that i have heard  i have dreamed that i walked on a shore of corpses by a sea of bloodi have seen arising from that sea my husbands and my childrens bodies gashed throughout with roman wounds  they have called to me through the vapour of carnage that was around themare we yet unavenged  is the sword of hermanric yet sheathed  night after night have i seen this vision and heard those voice and hoped for no respite until the day that saw the army encamped beneath the walls of rome and raising the scaling ladders for the assault  and now after all my endurance how has that day arrived  accursed be the lust of treasure it is more to the warriors and to you than the justice of revenge  listen listen cried hermanric entreatingly  i listen no longer interrupted goisvintha  the tongue of my people is as a strange language in my ears for it talks but of plunder and of peace of obedience of patience and of hope  i listen no longer for the kindred are gone that i loved to listen tothey are all slain by the romans but youand you i renounce   deprived of all power of consideration by the violence of the emotions awakened in his heart by goisvinthas wild revelations of the evil passion that consumed her the young goth shuddering throughout his whole frame and still averting his face murmured in hoarse unsteady accents ask of me what you will  i have no words to deny no power to rebuke youask of me what you will  promise me cried goisvintha seizing the hand of hermanric and gazing with a look of fierce triumph on his disordered countenance that this blockade of the city shall not hinder my vengeance  promise me that the first victim of our righteous revenge shall be the first one that appears before youwhether in war or peaceof the inhabitants of rome  i promise cried the goth  and those two words sealed the destiny of his future life  during the silence that now ensued between goisvintha and hermanric and while each stood absorbed in deep meditation the dark prospect spread around them began to brighten slowly under a soft clear light the moon whose dull broad disk had risen among the evening mists arrayed in gloomy red had now topped the highest of the exhalations of earth and beamed in the wide heaven adorned once more in her pale accustomed hue  gradually yet perceptibly the vapour rolledlayer by layerfrom the lofty summits of the palaces of rome and the high places of the mighty city began to dawn as it were in the soft peaceful mysterious light while the lower divisions of the walls the desolate suburbs and parts of the gothic camp lay still plunged in the dusky obscurity of the mist in grand and gloomy contrast to the prospect of glowing brightness that almost appeared to hover about them from above and around  patches of ground behind the tent of hermanric began to grow partially visible in raised and open positions and the song of the nightingale was now faintly audible at intervals among the solitary and distant trees  in whatever direction it was observed the aspect of nature gave promise of the cloudless tranquil night of the autumnal climate of ancient italy  hermanric was the first to return to the contemplation of the outward world  perceiving that the torch which still burnt by the side of his tent had become useless now that the moon had arisen and dispelled the mists he advanced and extinguished it pausing afterwards to look forth over the plains as they brightened slowly before him  he had been thus occupied but a short time when he thought he discerned a human figure moving slowly over a spot of partially lightened and hilly ground at a short distance from him  it was impossible that this wandering form could be one of his own peoplethey were all collected at their respective posts and his tent he knew was on the outermost boundary of the encampment before the pincian gate  he looked again  the figure still advanced but at too great a distance to allow him a chance of discovering in the uncertain light around him either its nation its sex or its age  his heart misgave him as he remembered his promise to goisvintha and contemplated the possibility that it was some miserable slave abandoned by the fugitives who had quitted the suburbs in the morning who now approached as a last resource to ask mercy and protection from his enemies in the camp  he turned towards goisvintha as the idea crossed his mind and observed that she was still occupied in meditation assured by the sight that she had not yet observed the fugitive figure he again directed his attentionwith an excess of anxiety which he could hardly account forin the direction where he had first beheld it but it was no more to be seen  it had either retired to concealment or was now still advancing towards his tent through a clump of trees that clothed the descent of the hill  silently and patiently he continued to look forth over the landscape and still no living thing was to be seen  at length just as he began to doubt whether his senses had not deceived him the fugitive figure suddenly appeared from the trees hurried with wavering gait over the patch of low damp ground that still separated it from the young goth gained his tent and then with a feeble cry fell helplessly upon the earth at his feet   that cry faint as it was attracted goisvinthas attention  she turned in an instant thrust hermanric aside and raised the stranger in her arms  the light slender form the fair hand and arm hanging motionless towards the ground the long locks of deep black hair heavy with the moisture of the night atmosphere betrayed the wanderers sex and age in an instant  the solitary fugitive was a young girl  signing to hermanric to kindle the extinguished torch at a neighbouring watchfire goisvintha carried the still insensible girl into the tent as the goth silently proceeded to obey her a vague horrid suspicion that he shrunk from embodying passed across his mind  his hand shook so that he could hardly light the torch and bold and vigorous as he was his limbs trembled beneath him as he slowly returned to the tent  when he had gained the interior of his temporary abode the light of his torch illuminated a strange and impressive scene  goisvintha was seated on a rude oaken chest supporting on her knees the form of the young girl and gazing with an expression of the most intense and enthralling interest upon her pale wasted countenance the tattered robe that had hitherto enveloped the fugitive had fallen back and disclosed the white dress which was the only other garment she wore  her face throat and arms had been turned by exposure to the cold to the pure whiteness of marble  her eyes were closed and her small delicate features were locked in a rigid repose  but for her deep black hair which heightened the ghastly aspect of her face she might have been mistaken as she lay in the womans arms for an exquisitely chiseled statue of youth in death  when the figure of the young warrior arrayed in his martial habiliments and standing near the insensible girl with evident emotions of wonder and anxiety was added to the group thus producedwhen goisvinthas tall powerful frame clothed in dark garments and bent over the fragile form and white dress of the fugitive was illuminated by the wild fitful glare of the torchwhen the heightened colour worn features and eager expression of the woman were beheld here shadowed there brightened in close opposition to the pale youthful reposing countenance of the girl such an assemblage of violent lights and deep shades was produced as gave the whole scene a character at once mysterious and sublime  it presented an harmonious variety of solemn colours united by the exquisite artifice of nature to a grand yet simple disposition of form  it was a picture executed by the hand of rembrandt and imagined by the mind of raphael  starting abruptly from her long earnest examination of the fugitive goisvintha proceeded to employ herself in restoring animation to her insensible charge  while thus occupied she preserved unbroken silence a breathless expectation that absorbed all her senses in one direction seemed to have possessed itself of her heart  she laboured at her task with the mechanical unwavering energy of those whose attention is occupied by their thoughts rather than their actions slowly and unwillingly the first faint flush of returning animation dawned in the tenderest delicacy of hue upon the girls colourless cheek  gradually and softly her quickening respiration fluttered a thin lock of hair that had fallen over her face  a little interval more and then the closed peaceful eyes suddenly opened and glance quickly round the tent with a wild expression of bewilderment and terror  then as goisvintha rose and attempted to place her on a seat she tore herself from her grasp looked on her for a moment with fearful intentness and then falling on her knees murmured in a plaintive voice  have mercy upon me  i am forsaken by my fatheri know not why  the gates of the city are shut against me  my habitation in rome is closed to me for ever   she had scarcely spoken these few words before an ominous change appeared in goisvinthas countenance  its former expression of ardent curiosity changed to a look of malignant triumph her eyes fixed themselves on the girls upturned face in glaring steady spellbound contemplation  she gloated over the helpless creature before her as the wild beast gloats over the prey that it has secured  her form dilated a scornful smile appeared on her lips a hot flush rose on her cheeks and ever and anon she whispered softly to herself i knew she was roman aha  i knew she was roman  during this space of time hermanric was silent  his breath came short and thick his face grew pale and his glance after resting for an instant on the woman and the girl travelled slowly and anxiously round the tent  in one corner of it lay a heavy battleaxe  he looked for a moment from the weapon to goisvintha with a vivid expression of horror and then moving slowly across the tent with a firm yet trembling grasp he possessed himself of the arm  as he looked up goisvintha approached him  in one hand she held the bloody helmetcrest while she pointed with the other to the crouching form of the girl  her lips were still parted with their unnatural smile and she whispered softly to the gothremember your promiseremember your kindredremember the massacre of aquileia  the young warrior made no answer  he moved rapidly forward a few steps and signed hurriedly to the young girl to fly by the door but her terror had by this time divested her of all her ordinary powers of perception and comprehension  she looked up vacantly at hermanric and then shuddering violently crept into a corner of the tent  during the short silence that now ensued the goth could hear her shiver and sigh as he stood watching with all the anxiety of apprehension goisvinthas darkening brow  she is romanshe is the first dweller in the city who has appeared before youremember your promiseremember your kindredremember the massacre of aquileia said the woman in fierce quick concentrated tones  i remember that i am a warrior and a goth replied hermanric disdainfully  i have promised to avenge you but it must be on a man that my promise must be fulfilledan armed man who can come forth with weapons in his handa strong man of courage whom i will slay in single combat before your eyes  the girl is too young to die too weak to be assailed  not a syllable that he had spoken had passed unheeded by the fugitive every word seemed to revive her torpid faculties  as he ceased she arose and with the quick instinct of terror ran up to the side of the young goth  then seizing his handthe hand that still grasped the battleaxeshe knelt down and kissed it uttering hurried broken ejaculations as she clasped it to her bosom which the tremulousness of her voice rendered completely unintelligible  did the romans think my children too young to die or too weak to be assailed cried goisvintha  by the lord god of heaven they murdered them the more willingly because they were young and wounded them the more fiercely because they were weak  my heart leaps within me as i look on the girl  i am doubly avenged if i am avenged on the innocent and the youthful  her bones shall rot on the plains of rome as the bones of my offspring rot on the plains of aquileia  shed me her bloodremember your promiseshed me her blood  she advanced with extended arms and gleaming eyes towards the fugitive she gasped for breath her face turned suddenly to a livid paleness the torchlight fell upon her distorted features she looked unearthly at that fearful moment but the divinity of mercy had now braced the determination of the young goth to meet all emergencies  his bright steady eye quailed not for an instant as he encountered the frantic glance of the fury before him  with one hand he barred goisvintha from advancing another step the other he could not disengage from the girl who now clasped and kissed it more eagerly than before   you do this but to tempt me to anger said goisvintha altering her manner with sudden and palpable cunning more ominous of peril to the fugitive than the fury she had hitherto displayed you jest at me because i have failed in patience like a child  but you will shed her bloodyou are honourable and will hold to your promiseyou will shed her blood  and i she continued exultingly seating herself on the oaken chest that she had previously occupied and resting her clenched hands on her knees i will wait to see it  at this moment voices and steps were heard outside the tent  hermanric instantly raised the trembling girl from the ground and supporting her by his arm advanced to ascertain the cause of the disturbance  he was confronted the next instant by an old warrior of superior rank attached to the person of alaric who was followed by a small party of the ordinary soldiery of the camp  among the women appointed by the king to the office of tending for this night those sick and wounded on the march is goisvintha sister of hermanric  if she is here let her approach and follow me said the chief of the party in authoritative tones pausing at the door of the tent  goisvintha rose  for an instant she stood irresolute  to quit hermanric at such a time as this was a sacrifice that wrung her savage heartbut she remembered the severity of alarics discipline she saw the armed men awaiting her and yielded after a struggle to the imperious necessity of obedience to the kings commands  trembling with suppressed anger and bitter disappointment she whispered to hermanric as she passed him  you cannot save her if you would  you dare not commit her to the charge of your companions she is too young and too fair to be abandoned to their doubtful protection  you cannot escape with her for you must remain here on the watch at your post  you will not let her depart by herself for you know that she would perish with cold and privation before the morning rises when i return on the morrow i shall see her in the tent  you cannot escape from your promiseyou cannot forget ityou must shed her blood  the commands of the king said the old warrior signing to his party to depart with goisvintha who now stood with forced calmness awaiting their guidance  will be communicated to the chieftain hermanric on the morrow  remember he continued in a lower tone pointing contemptuously to the trembling girl that the vigilance you have shown in setting the watch before yonder gate will not excuse any negligence your prize there may now cause you to commit  consult your youthful pleasures as you please but remember your duties  farewell  uttering these words in a stern serious tone the veteran departed soon the last sound of the footsteps of his escort died away and hermanric and the fugitive were left alone in the tent  during the address of the old warrior to the chieftain the girl had silently detached herself from her protectors support and retired hastily to the interior of the tent  when she saw that they were left together again she advanced hesitatingly towards the young goth and looked up with an expression of mute inquiry into his face  i am very miserable said she after an interval of silence in soft clear melancholy accents  if you forsake me now i must dieand i have lived so short a time on the earth i have known so little happiness and so little love that i am not fit to die  but you will protect me  you are good and brave strong with weapons in your hands and full of pity  you have defended me and spoken kindly of mei love you for the compassion you have shown me   her language and actions simple as they were were yet so new to hermanric whose experience of her sex had been almost entirely limited to the women of his own stern impassive nation that he could only reply by a brief assurance of protection when the suppliant awaited his answer  a new page in the history of humanity was opening before his eyes and he scanned it in wondering silence   if that woman should return pursued the girl fixing her dark eloquent eyes intently upon the goths countenance take me quickly where she cannot come  my heart grows cold as i look on her  she will kill me if she can approach me again  my fathers anger is very fearful but hers is horriblehorriblehorrible  hush already i hear her coming backlet us goi will follow you wherever you pleasebut let us not delay while there is time to depart  she will destroy me if she sees me now and i cannot die yet  oh my preserver my compassionate defender i cannot die yet  no one shall harm youno on shall approach you tonightyou are secure from all dangers in this tent said the goth gazing on her with undissembled astonishment and admiration  i will tell you why death is so dreadful to me she continued and her voice deepened as she spoke to tones of mournful solemnity strangely impressive in a creature so young  i have lived much alone and have had no companions but my thoughts and the sky that i could look up to and the things on the earth that i could watch  as i have seen the clear heaven and the soft fields and smelt the perfume of flowers and heard the voices of singingbirds afar off i have wondered why the same god who made all this and made me should have made grief and pain and hellthe dread eternal hell that my father speaks of in his church  i never looked at the sunlight or woke from my sleep to look on and to think of the distant stars but i longed to love something that might listen to my joy  but my father forbade me to be happy  he frowned even when he gave me my flowergardenthough god made flowers  he destroyed my lutethough god made music  my life has been a longing in loneliness for the voices of friends  my heart has swelled and trembled within me because when i walked in the garden and looked on the plains and woods and high bright mountains that were round me i knew that i loved them alone  do you know now why i dare not die  it is because i must find first the happiness which i feel god has made for me  it is because i must live to praise this wonderful beautiful world with others who enjoy it as i could it is because my home has been among those who sigh and never among those who smile  it is for this that i fear to die  i must find companions whose prayers are in singing and in happiness before i go to the terrible hereafter that all dread  i dare not die  i dare not die  as she uttered these last words she began to weep bitterly  between amazement and compassion the young goth was speechless  he looked down upon the small soft hand that she had placed on his arm while she spoke and saw that it trembled he pressed it and felt that it was cold and in the first impulse of pity produced by the action he found the readiness of speech which he had hitherto striven for in vain  you shiver and look pale said he a fire shall be kindled at the door of the tent  i will bring you garments that will warm you and food that will give you strength you shall sleep and i will watch that no one harms you  the girl hastily looked up  an expression of ineffable gratitude overspread her sorrowful countenance  she murmured in a broken voice oh how merciful how merciful you are  and then after an evident struggle with herself she covered her face with her hands and again burst into tears  more and more embarrassed hermanric mechanically busied himself in procuring from such of his attendants as the necessities of the blockade left free the supplies of fire food and raiment which he had promised  she received the coverings approached the blazing fuel and partook of the simple refreshment which the young warrior offered her with eagerness  after that she sat for some time silent absorbed in deep meditation and cowering over the fire apparently unconscious of the curiosity with which she was still regarded by the goth  at length she suddenly looked up and observing his eyes fixed on her arose and beckoned him to the seat that she occupied  did you know how utterly forsaken i am said she you would not wonder as you do that i a stranger and a roman have sought you thus i have told you how lonely was my home but yet that home was a refuge and a protection to me until the morning of this long day that is past when i was expelled from it for ever  i was suddenly awakened in my bed bymy father entered in angerhe called me  she hesitated blushed and then paused at the very outset of her narrative  innocent as she was the natural instincts of her sex spoke though in a mysterious yet in a warning tone within her heart abruptly imposing on her motives for silence that she could neither penetrate nor explain she clasped her trembling hands over her bosom as if to repress its heaving and casting down her eyes continued in a lower tone  i cannot tell you why my father drove me from his doors  he has always been silent and sorrowful to me setting me long tasks in mournful books commanding that i should not quit the precincts of his abode and forbidding me to speak to him when i have sometimes asked him to tell me of my mother whom i have lost  yet he never threatened me or drove me from his side until the morning of which i have told you  then his wrath was terrible his eyes were fierce his voice was threatening  he bade me begone and i obeyed him in affright for i thought he would have slain me if i stayed  i fled from the house knowing not where i went and ran through yonder gate which is hard by our abode  as i entered the suburbs i met great crowds all hurrying into rome  i was bewildered by my fears and the confusion all around yet i remember that they called loudly to me to fly to the city ere the gates were closed against the assault of the goths  and others jostled and scoffed at me as they passed by and saw me in the thin night garments in which i was banished from my home  here she paused and listened intently for a few moments  every accidental noise that she heard still awakened in her the apprehension of goisvinthas return  reassured by hermanric and by her own observation of all that was passing outside the tent she resumed her narrative after an interval speaking now in a steadier voice  i thought my heart would burst within me she continued as i tried to escape them  all things whirled before my eyes  i could not speaki could not stopi could not weep  i fled and fled i knew not whither until i sank down exhausted at the door of a small house on the outskirts of the suburbs  then i called for aid but no one was by to hear me  i creptfor i could stand no longerinto the house  it was empty  i looked from the windows  no human figure passed through the silent streets  the roar of a mighty confusion still rose from the walls of the city but i was left to listen to it alone  in the house i saw scattered on the floor some fragments of bread and an old garment i took them both and then rose and departed for the silence of the place was horrible to me and i remembered the fields and the plains that i had once loved to look on and i thought that i might find there the refuge that had been denied to me at rome so i set forth once more and when i gained the soft grass and sat down beside the shady trees and saw the sunlight brightening over the earth my heart grew sad and i wept as i thought on my loneliness and remembered my fathers anger  i had not long remained in my restingplace when i heard a sound of trumpets in the distance and looking forth i saw far off advancing over the plains a mighty multitude with arms that glittered in the sun i strove as i beheld them to arise and return even to those suburbs whose solitude had affrighted me  but my limbs failed me  i saw a little hollow hidden among the trees around  i entered it and there throughout the lonely day i lay concealed  i heard the long tramp of footsteps as your army passed me on the roads beneath and then after those hours of fear came the weary hours of solitude   oh thoselonelylonelylonely hours  i have lived without companions but those hours were more terrible to me than all the years of my former life  i dared not venture to leave my hidingplacei dared not call  alone in the world i crouched in my refuge till the sun went down  then came the mist and the darkness and the cold the bitter winds of night thrilled through and through me  the lonely obscurity around me seemed filled with phantoms whom i could not behold who touched me and rustled over the surface of my skin  they half maddened me  i rose to depart to meet my wrathful father or the army that had passed me or solitude in the cold bright meadowsi cared not whichwhen i discerned the light of your torch the moment ere it was extinguished  dark though it then was i found your tent and now i know that i have found yet morea companion and a friend  she looked up at the young goth as she pronounced these words with the same grateful expression that had appeared on her countenance before but this time her eyes were not dimmed by tears already her dispositionpoor as was the prospect of happiness which now lay before ithad begun to return with an almost infantine facility of change to the restoring influences of the brighter emotions already the short tranquilities of the present began to exert for her their effacing charm over the long agitations of the past despair was unnumbered among the emotions that grew round that childlike heart shame fear and grief however they might overshadow it for a time left no taint of their presence on its bright fine surface tender perilously alive to sensation strangely retentive of kindness as she was by nature the very solitude to which she had been condemned had gifted her young as she was with a martyrs endurance of ill and with a stoics patience under pain  do not mourn for me now she pursued gently interrupting some broken expressions of compassion which fell from the lips of the young goth if you are merciful to me i shall forget all that i have suffered though your nation is at enmity with mine while you remain my friend i fear nothing  i can look on your great stature and heavy sword and bright armour now without trembling  you are not like the soldiers of romeyou are taller stronger more gloriously arrayed  you are like a statue i once saw by chance of a warrior of the greeks  you have a look of conquest and a presence of command  she gazed on the manly and powerful frame of the young warrior clothed as it was in the accoutrements of his warlike nation with an expression of childish interest and astonishment asking him the appellation and use of each part of his equipment as it attracted her attention and ending her inquiries by eagerly demanding his name  hermanric she repeated as he answered her pronouncing with some difficulty the harsh gothic syllableshermanricthat is a stern solemn namea name fit for a warrior and a man  mine sounds worthless after such a name as that  it is only antonina  deeply as he was interested in every word uttered by the girl hermanric could no longer fail to perceive the evident traces of exhaustion that now appeared in the slightest of her actions producing some furs from a corner of the tent he made a sort of rude couch by the side of the fire heaped fresh fuel on the flames and then gently counselled her to recruit her wasted energies by repose there was something so candid in his manner so sincere in the tones of his voice as he made his simple offer of hospitality to the stranger who had taken refuge with him that the most distrustful woman would have accepted with as little hesitation as antonina who gratefully and unhesitatingly laid down on the bed that he had been spreading for her at her feet  as soon as he had carefully covered her with a cloak and rearranged her couch in the position best calculated to insure her all the warmth of the burning fuel hermanric retired to the other side of the fire and leaning on his sword abandoned himself to the new and absorbing reflections which the presence of the girl naturally aroused  he thought not on the duties demanded of him by the blockade he remembered neither the scene of rage and ferocity that had followed his evasion of his reckless promise nor the fierce determination that goisvintha had expressed as she quitted him for the night  the cares and toils to come with the new morning which would oblige him to expose the fugitive to the malignity of her revengeful enemy the thousand contingencies that the difference of their sexes their nations and their lives might create to oppose the continuance of the permanent protection that he had promised to her caused him no forebodings antonina and antonina alone occupied every faculty of his mind and every feeling of his heart  there was a softness and a melody to his ear in her very name   his early life had made him well acquainted with the latin tongue but he had never discovered all its native smoothness of sound and elegance of structure until he had heard it spoken by antonina  word by word he passed over in his mind her varied natural and happy turns of expression recalling as he was thus employed the eloquent looks the rapid gesticulations the changing tones which had accompanied those words and thinking how wide was the difference between this young daughter of rome and the cold and taciturn women of his own nation the very mystery enveloping her story which would have excited the suspicion or contempt of more civilised men aroused in him no other emotions than those of wonder and compassion  no feelings of a lower nature than these entered his heart towards the girl  she was safe under the protection of the enemy and the barbarian after having been lost through the interference of the roman and the senator  to the simple perceptions of the goth the discovery of so much intelligence united to such extreme youth of so much beauty doomed to such utter loneliness was the discovery of an apparition that dazzled and not of a woman who charmed him  he could not even have touched the hand of the helpless creature who now reposed under his tent unless she had extended it to him of her own accord  he could only thinkwith a delight whose excess he was far from estimating himselfon this solitary mysterious being who had come to him for shelter and for aid who had awakened in him already new sources of sensation and who seemed to his startled imagination to have suddenly twined herself for ever about the destinies of his future life  he was still deep in meditation when he was startled by a hand suddenly laid on his arm  he looked up and saw that antonina whom he had imagined to be slumbering on her couch was standing by his side  i cannot sleep said the girl in a low awestruck voice until i have asked you to spare my father when you enter rome  i know that you are here to ravage the city and for aught i can tell you may assault and destroy it tonight  will you promise to warn me before the walls are assailed i will then tell you my fathers name and abode and you will spare him as you have mercifully spared me  he has denied me his protection but he is my father still and i remember that i disobeyed him once when i possessed myself of a lute  will you promise me to spare him  my mother whom i have never seen and who must therefore be dead may love me in another world for pleading for my fathers life  in a few words hermanric quieted her agitation by explaining to her the nature and intention of the gothic blockade and she silently returned to the couch  after a short interval her slow regular breathing announced to the young warrior as he watched by the side of the fire that she had at length forgotten the days heritage of misfortune in the welcome oblivion of sleep    chapter 9  the two interviews  the time is the evening of the first day of the gothic blockade the place is vetranios palace at rome  in one of the private apartments of his mansion is seated its allaccomplished owner released at length from the long sitting convened by the senate on the occasion of the unexpected siege of the city  although the same complete discipline the same elegant regularity and the same luxurious pomp which distinguished the senators abode in times of security still prevail over it in the time of imminent danger which now threatens rich and poor alike in rome vetranio himself appears far from partaking the tranquility of his patrician household  his manner displays an unusual sternness and his face an unwonted displeasure as he sits occupied by his silent reflections and thoroughly unregardful of whatever occurs around him  two ladies who are his companions in the apartment exert all their blandishments to win him back to hilarity but in vain  the services of his expectant musicians are not put into requisition the delicacies on his table remain untouched and even the inestimable kitten of the breed most worshipped by the ancient egyptians gambols unnoticed and unapplauded at his feet  all its wonted philosophical equanimity has evidently departed for the time at least from the senators mind  silencehitherto a stranger to the palace apartmentshad reigned uninterruptedly over them for some time when the freedman carrio dissipated vetranios meditations and put the ladies who were with him to flight by announcing in an important voice that the prefect pompeianus desired a private interview with the senator vetranio  the next instant the chief magistrate of rome entered the apartment he was a short fat undignified man  indolence and vacillation were legibly impressed on his appearance and expression  you saw in a moment that his mind like a shuttlecock might be urged in any direction by the efforts of others but was utterly incapable of volition by itself  but once in his life had the prefect pompeianus been known to arrive unaided at a positive determination and that was in deciding a fierce argument between a bishop and a general regarding the relative merits of two rival ropedancers of equal renown  i have come my beloved friend said the prefect in agitated tones to ask your opinion at this period of awful responsibility for us all on the plan of operations proposed by the senate at the sitting of today  but first he hastily continued perceiving with the unerring instinct of an old gastronome that the inviting refreshments on vetranios table had remained untouched permit me to fortify my exhausted energies by a visit to your everluxurious board  alas my friend when i consider the present fearful scarcity of our provision stores in the city and the length of time that this accursed blockade may be expected to last i am inclined to think that the gods alone know i mean st peter how much longer we may be enabled to give occupation to our digestions and employment to our cooks  i have observed pursued the prefect after an interval speaking with his mouth full of stewed peacock i have observed oh esteemed colleague the melancholy of your manner and your absolute silence during your attendance today at our deliberations  have we in your opinion decided erroneously  it is not impossible  our confusion at this unexpected appearance of the barbarians may have blinded our usual penetration  if by any chance you dissent from our plans i beseech you communicate your objections to me without reserve  i dissent from nothing because i have heard nothing replied vetranio sullenly  i was so occupied by a private matter of importance during my attendance at the sitting of the senate that i was deaf to their deliberations  i know that we are besieged by the gothswhy are they not driven from before the walls  deaf to our deliberations  drive the goths from the walls repeated the prefect faintly  can you think of any private matter at such a moment as this  do you know our danger  do you know that our friends are so astonished at this frightful calamity that they move about like men half awakened from a dream  have you not seen the streets filled with terrified and indignant crowds have you not mounted the ramparts and beheld the innumerable multitudes of pitiless goths surrounding us on all sides intercepting our supplies of provisions from the country and menacing us with a speedy famine unless our hopedfor auxiliaries arrive from ravenna  i have neither mounted the ramparts nor viewed with any attention the crowds in the streets replied vetranio carelessly  but if you have seen nothing yourself you must have heard what others saw persisted the prefect you must know at least that the legions we have in the city are not sufficient to guard more than half the circuit of the walls  has no one informed you that if it should please the leader of the barbarians to change his blockade into an assault it is more than probable that we should be unable to repulse him successfully are you still deaf to our deliberations when your palace may tomorrow be burnt over your head when we may be staved to death when we may be doomed to eternal dishonour by being driven to conclude a peace  deaf to our deliberations when such an unimaginable calamity as this invasion has fallen like a thunderbolt under our very walls you amaze me  you overwhelm me  you horrify me   and in the excess of his astonishment the bewildered prefect actually abandoned his stewed peacock and advanced winecup in hand to obtain a nearer view of the features of his imperturbable host  if we are not strong enough to drive the goths out of italy rejoined vetranio coolly you and the senate know that we are rich enough to bribe them to depart to the remotest confines of the empire  if we have not swords enough to fight we have gold and silver enough to pay  you are jesting  remember our honour and the auxiliaries we still hope for from ravenna said the prefect reprovingly  honour has lost the signification now that it had in the time of the caesars retorted the senator our fighting days are over  we have had heroes enough for our reputation  as for the auxiliaries you still hope for you will have none  while the emperor is safe in ravenna he will care nothing for the worst extremities that can be suffered by the people of rome  but you forget your duties urged the astonished pompeianus turning from rebuke to expostulation  you forget that it is a time when all private interests must be abandoned  you forget that i have come here to ask your advice that i am bewildered by a thousand projects forced on me from all sides for ruling the city successfully during the blockade that i look to you as a friend and a man of reputation to aid me in deciding on a choice out of the varied counsels submitted to me in the senate today  write down the advice of each senator on a separate strip of vellum shake all the strips together in an urn and then let the first you take out by chance be your guide to govern by in the present condition of the city said vetranio with a sneer  oh friend friend it is cruel to jest with me thus cried the prefect in tones of lament would you really persuade me that you are ignorant that what sentinels we have are doubled already on the walls would you attempt to declare seriously to me that you never heard the project of saturninus for reducing imperceptibly the diurnal allowance of provisions  or the recommendation of emilianus that the people should be kept from thinking on the dangers and extremities which now threaten them by being provided incessantly with public amusements at the theatres and hippodromes  do you really mean that you are indifferent to the horrors of our present situation  by the souls of the apostles vetranio i begin to think that you do not believe in the goths  i have already told you that private affairs occupy me at present to the exclusion of public said vetranio impatiently  debate as you chooseapprove what projects you willi withdraw myself from interference in your deliberations   this murmured the repulsed prefect in soliloquy as he mechanically resumed his place at the refreshment table this is the very end and climax of all calamities  now when advice and assistance are more precious than jewels in my estimation i receive neither  i gain from none the wise and saving counsels which as chief magistrate of this imperial city it is my right to demand from all and the man on whom i most depended is the man who fails me most  yet hear me oh vetranio once again he continued addressing the senator if our perils beyond the walls affect you not there is a weighty matter that has been settled within them which must move you  after you had quitted the senate serena the widow of stilicho was accused as her husband was accused before her of secret and treasonable correspondence with the goths and has been condemned as her husband was condemned to suffer the penalty of death  i myself discerned no evidence to convict her but the populace cried out in universal frenzy that she was guilty that she should die and that the barbarians when they heard of the punishment inflicted on their secret adherent would retire in dismay from rome  this also was a moot point of argument on which i vainly endeavoured to decide but the senate and the people were wiser than i and serena was condemned to be strangled tomorrow by the public executioner  she was a woman of good report before this time and is the adopted mother of the emperor  it is now doubted by many whether stilicho her husband was ever guilty of the correspondence with the goths of which he was accused and i on my part doubt much that serena has deserved the punishment of death at our hands  i beseech you vetranio let me be enlightened by your opinion on this one point at least  the prefect waited anxiously for an answer but vetranio neither looked at him nor replied  it was evident that the senator had not listened to a word that he had said  this reception of his final appeal for assistance produced the effect on the petitioner which it was perhaps designed to conveythe prefect pompeianus quitted the room in despair  he had not long departed when carrio again entered the apartment and addressed his master thus  it is grievous for me revered patron to disclose it to you but your slaves have returned unsuccessful from the search  give the description of the girl to a fresh division of them and let them continue their efforts throughout the night not only in the streets but in all the houses of public entertainment in the city she must be in rome and she must be found said the senator gloomily  carrio bowed profoundly and was about to depart when he was arrested at the door by his masters voice  if an old man calling himself numerian should desire to see me said vetranio admit him instantly  she had quitted the room but a short time when i attempted to reclaim her pursued the senator speaking to himself and yet when i gained the open air she was nowhere to be seen  she must have mingled unintentionally with the crowds whom the goths drove into the city and thus have eluded my observation  so young and so innocent  she must be found  she must be found  he paused once more engrossed in deep and melancholy thought  after a long interval he was roused from his abstraction by the sound of footsteps on the marble floor  he looked up  the door had been opened without his perceiving it and an old man was advancing with slow and trembling steps towards his silken couch  it was the bereaved and brokenhearted numerian  where is she  is she found asked the father gazing anxiously round the room as if he had expected to see his daughter there  my slaves still search for her said vetranio mournfully  ah woewoewoe  how i wronged her  how i wronged her cried the old man turning to depart   listen to me ere you go said vetranio gently detaining him  i have done you a great wrong but i will yet atone for it by finding for you your child  while there were women who would have triumphed in my admiration i should not have attempted to deprive you of your daughter remember when you recover herand you shall recover herthat from the time when i first decoyed her into listening to my lute to the night when your traitorous servant led me to her bedchamber she has been innocent in this illconsidered matter  i alone have been guilty  she was scarcely awakened when you discovered her in my arms and my entry into her chamber was as little expected by her as it was by you  i was bewildered by the fumes of wine and the astonishment of your sudden appearance or i should have rescued her from your anger ere it was too late  the events which have passed this morning confused though they were have yet convinced me that i had mistaken you both  i now know that your child was too pure to be an object fitted for my pursuit and i believe that in secluding her as you did however illadvised you might appear you were honest in your design  never in my pursuit of pleasure did i commit so fatal an error as when i entered the doors of your house  in pronouncing these words vetranio but gave expression to the sentiments by which they were really inspired  as we have before observed profligate as he was by thoughtlessness of character and license of social position he was neither heartless nor criminal by nature  fathers had stormed but his generosity had hitherto invariably pacified them  daughters had wept but had found consolation on all previous occasions in the splendour of his palace and the amiability of his disposition  in attempting therefore the abduction of antonina though he had prepared for unusual obstacles he had expected no worse results of his new conquest than those that had followed as yet his gallantries that were past  but whenin the solitude of his own home and in the complete possession of his facultieshe recalled all the circumstances of his attempt from the time when he had stolen on the girls slumbers to the moment when she had fled from the house when he remembered the stern concentrated anger of numerian and the agony and despair of antonina when he thought on the spiritbroken repentance of the deceived father and the fatal departure of the injured daughter he felt as a man who had not merely committed an indiscretion but had been guilty of a crime he became convinced that he had incurred the fearful responsibility of destroying the happiness of a parent who was really virtuous and a child who was truly innocent  to a man the business of whose whole life was to procure for himself a heritage of unalloyed pleasure whose sole occupation was to pamper that refined sensuality which the habits of a life had made the very material of his heart by diffusing luxury and awakening smiles wherever he turned his steps the mere mental disquietude attending the illsuccess of his intrusion into numerians dwelling was as painful in its influence as the bitterest remorse that could have afflicted a more highlyprincipled mind  he now therefore instituted the search after antonina and expressed his contrition to her father from a genuine persuasion that nothing but the completest atonement for the error he had committed could restore to him that luxurious tranquility the loss of which had as he had himself expressed it rendered him deaf to the deliberations of the senate and regardless of the invasion of the goths  tell me he continued after a pause whither has ulpius betaken himself  it is necessary that he should be discovered  he may enlighten us upon the place of antoninas retreat  he shall be secured and questioned  he left me suddenly i saw him as i stood at the window mix with the multitude in the street but i know not whither he is gone replied numerian and a tremor passed over his whole frame as he spoke of the remorseless pagan  again there was a short silence  the grief of the brokenspirited father possessed in its humility and despair a voice of rebuke before which the senator careless and profligate as he was instinctively quailed  for some time he endeavoured in vain to combat the silencing and reproving influence exerted over him by the very presence of the sorrowing man whom he had so fatally wronged  at length after an interval he recovered selfpossession enough to address to numerian some further expressions of consolation and hope but he spoke to ears that listened not  the father had relapsed into his mournful abstraction and when the senator paused he merely muttered to himselfshe is lost  alas she is lost for ever  no she is not lost for ever cried vetranio warmly  i have wealth and power enough to cause her to be sought for to the ends of the earth ulpius shall be secured and questionedimprisoned tortured if it is necessary  your daughter shall be recovered  nothing is impossible to a senator of rome   i knew not that i loved her until the morning when i wronged and banished her continued the old man still speaking to himself  i have lost all traces of my parents and my brothermy wife is parted from me for everi have nothing left but antonina and now too she is gone  even my ambition that i once thought my all in all is no comfort to my soul for i loved italas unconsciously loved itthrough the being of my child  i destroyed her lutei thought her shamelessi drove her from my doors  oh how i wronged herhow i wronged her  remain here and repose yourself in one of the sleeping apartments until my slaves return in the morning  you will then hear without delay of the result of their search tonight said vetranio in kindly and compassionate tones  it grows darkdark groaned the father tottering towards the door but that is nothing daylight itself now looks darkness to me  i must go  i have duties at the chapel to perform  night is repose for youfor me it is tribulation and prayer  he departed as he spoke  slowly he paced along the streets that led to his chapel glancing with penetrating eye at each inhabitant of the besieged city who passed him on his way  with some difficulty he arrived at his destination for rome was still thronged with armed men hurrying backwards and forwards and with crowds of disorderly citizens pouring forth wherever there was space enough for them to assemble the report of the affliction that had befallen him had already gone abroad among his hearers and they whispered anxiously to each other as he entered the plain dimlylighted chapel and slowly mounted the pulpit to open the service by reading the chapter in the bible which had been appointed for perusal that night and which happened to be the fifth of the gospel of st mark  his voice trembled his face was ghastly pale and his hands shook perceptibly as he began but he read on in low broken tones and with evident pain and difficulty until he came to the verse containing these words  my little daughter lieth at the point of death  here he stopped suddenly endeavoured vainly for a few minutes to proceed and then covering his face with his hands sank down in the pulpit and sobbed aloud his sorrowing and startled audience immediately gathered round him raised him in their arms and prepared to conduct him to his own abode  when however they had gained the door of the chapel he desired them gently to leave him and return to the performance of the service among themselves  ever implicitly obedient to his slightest wishes the persons of his little assembly moved to tears by the sight of their teachers suffering obeyed him by retiring silently to their former places  as soon as he found that he was alone he passed the door and whispering to himself i must join those who seek her  i must aid them myself in the searchhe mingled once more with the disorderly citizens who thronged the darkened streets    chapter 10  the rift in the wall  when ulpius suddenly departed from numerians house on the morning of the siege it was with no distinct intention of betaking himself to any particular place or devoting himself to any immediate employment  it was to give vent to his joyto the ecstacy that now filled his heart to burstingthat he sought the open streets  his whole moral being was exalted by that overwhelming sense of triumph which urges the physical nature into action  he hurried into the free air as a child runs on a bright day in the wide fields his delight was too wild to expand under a roof his excess of bliss swelled irrepressibly beyond all artificial limits of space   the goths were in sight  a few hours more and their scaling ladders would be planted against the walls  on a city so weakly guarded as rome their assault must be almost instantaneously successful thirsting for plunder they would descend in infuriated multitudes on the defenceless streets  christians though they were the restraints of religion would in that moment of fierce triumph be powerless with such a nation of marauders against the temptations to pillage churches would be ravaged and destroyed priests would be murdered in attempting the defence of their ecclesiastical treasures fire and sword would waste to its remotest confines the stronghold of christianity and overwhelm in death and oblivion the boldest of christianitys devotees then when the hurricane of ruin and crime had passed over the city when a new people were ripe for another government and another religionthen would be the time to invest the banished gods of old rome with their former rule to bid the survivors of the stricken multitude remember the judgment that their apostacy to their ancient faith had demanded and incurred to strike the very remembrance of the cross out of the memory of man and to reinstate paganism on her throne of sacrifices and under her roof of gold more powerful from her past persecutions more universal in her sudden restoration than in all the glories of her ancient rule  such thoughts as these passed through the pagans toiling mind as unobservant of all outward events he paced through the streets of the beleaguered city  already he beheld the array of the goths preparing the way as the unconscious pioneers of the returning gods for the march of that mighty revolution which he was determined to lead  the warmth of his past eloquence the glow of his old courage thrilled through his heart as he figured to himself the prospect that would soon stretch before hima city laid waste a people terrified a government distracted a religion destroyed  then arising amid this darkness and ruin amid this solitude desolation and decay it would be his glorious privilege to summon an unfaithful people to return to the mistress of their ancient love to rise from prostration beneath a dismantled church and to seek prosperity in temples repeopled and at shrines restored  all remembrance of late events now entirely vanished from his mind numerian vetranio antonina they were all forgotten in this memorable advent of the goths  his slavery in the mines his last visit to alexandria his earlier wanderingseven these so present to his memory until the morning of the siege were swept from its very surface now age solitude infirmityhitherto the mournful sensations which were proofs to him that he still continued to existsuddenly vanished from his perceptions as things that were not and now at length he forgot that he was an outcast and remembered triumphantly that he was still a priest  he felt animated by the same hopes elevated by the same aspirations as in those early days when he had harangued the wavering pagans in the temple and first plotted the overthrow of the christian church  it was a terrible and warning proof of the omnipotent influence that a single idea may exercise over a whole life to see that old man wandering among the crowds around him still enslaved after years of suffering and solitude degradation and crime by the same ruling ambition which had crushed the promise of his early youth  it was an awful testimony to the eternal and mysterious nature of thought to behold that wasted and weakened frame and then to observe how the unassailable mind within still swayed the wreck of body yet left to ithow faithfully the last exhausted resources of failing vigour rallied into action at its fierce commandhow quickly at its mocking voice the sunken eye lightened again with a gleam of hope and the pale thin lips parted mechanically with an exulting smile  the hours passed but he still walked onwhither or among whom he neither knew nor cared  no remorse touched his heart for the destruction that he had wreaked on the christian who had sheltered him no terror appalled his soul at the contemplation of the miseries that he believed to be in preparation for the city from the enemy at its gates the end that had hallowed to him the long series of his former offences and former sufferings now obliterated iniquities just passed and stripped of all their horrors atrocities immediately to come  the goths might be destroyers to others but they were benefactors to him for they were harbingers of the ruin which would be the material of his reform and the source of his triumph it never entered his imagination that as an inhabitant of rome he shared the approaching perils of the citizens and in the moment of the assault might share their doom  he beheld only the new and gorgeous prospect that war and rapine were opening before him  he thought only of the time that must elapse ere his new efforts could be commencedof the orders of the people among whom he should successively make his voice heardof the temples which he should select for restorationof the quarter of rome which should first be chosen for the reception of his daring reform   at length he paused his exhausted energies yielded under the exertions imposed on them and obliged him to bethink himself of refreshment and repose  it was now noon  the course of his wanderings had insensibly conducted him again to the precincts of his old familiar dwellingplace he found himself at the back of the pincian mount and only separated by a strip of uneven woody ground from the base of the city wall  the place was very solitary  it was divided from the streets and mansions above by thick groves and extensive gardens which stretched along the undulating descent of the hill  a short distance to the westward lay the pincian gate but an abrupt turn in the wall and some olive trees which grew near it shut out all view of objects in that direction  on the other side towards the eastward the ramparts were discernible running in a straight line of some length until they suddenly turned inwards at a right angle and were concealed from further observation by the walls of a distant palace and the pine trees of a public garden  the only living figure discernible near this lonely spot was that of a sentinel who occasionally passed over the ramparts above whichsituated as they were between two stations of soldiery one at the pincian gate and the other where the wall made the angle already describedwere untenanted save by the guard within the limits of whose watch they happened to be placed  here for a short space of time the pagan rested his weary frame and aroused himself insensibly from the enthralling meditations which had hitherto blinded him to the troubled aspect of the world around him  he now for the first time heard on all sides distinctly the confused noises which still rose from every quarter of rome  the same incessant strife of struggling voices and hurrying footsteps which had caught his ear in the early morning attracted his attention now but no shrieks of distress no clash of weapons no shouts of fury and defiance were mingled with them although as he perceived by the position of the sun the day had sufficiently advanced to have brought the gothic army long since to the foot of the walls  what could be the cause of this delay in the assault of this ominous tranquillity on the ramparts above him had the impetuosity of the goths suddenly vanished at the sight of rome had negotiations for peace been organised with the first appearance of the invaders  he listened again  no sounds caught his ear differing in character from those he had just heard though besieged the city was evidentlyfrom some mysterious causenot even threatened by an assault  suddenly there appeared from a little pathway near him which led round the base of the wall a woman preceded by a child who called to her impatiently as he ran on hasten mother hasten there is no crowd here  yonder is the gate  we shall have a noble view of the goths  there was something in the address of the child to the woman that gave ulpius a suspicion even then of the discovery that flushed upon him soon after  he rose and followed them  they passed onward by the wall through the olive trees beyond and then gained the open space before the pincian gate  here a great concourse of people had assembled and were suffered in their proper turn to ascend the ramparts in divisions by some soldiers who guarded the steps by which they were approached  after a short delay ulpius and those around him were permitted to gratify their curiosity as others had done before them they mounted the walls and beheld stretched over the ground within and beyond the suburbs the vast circumference of the gothic lines  terrible and almost sublime as was the prospect of that immense multitude seen under the brilliant illumination of the noontide sun it was not impressive enough to silence the turbulent loquacity rooted in the dispositions of the people of rome  men women and children all made their noisy and conflicting observations on the sight before them in every variety of tone from the tremulous accents of terror to the loud vociferations of bravado   some spoke boastfully of the achievements that would be performed by the romans when their expected auxiliaries arrived from ravenna others foreboded in undissembled terror an assault under cover of the night here a group abused in low confidential tones the policy of the government in its relations with the goths  there a company of ragged vagabonds amused themselves by pompously confiding to each other their positive conviction that at that very moment the barbarians must be trembling in their camp at the mere sight of the allpowerful capital of the world  in one direction people were heard noisily speculating whether the goths would be driven from the walls by the soldiers of rome or be honoured by an invitation to conclude a peace with the august empire which they had so treasonably ventured to invade in another the more sober and reputable among the spectators audibly expressed their apprehensions of starvation dishonour and defeat should the authorities of the city be foolhardy enough to venture a resistance to alaric and his barbarian hosts  but wide as was the difference of the particular opinions hazarded among the citizens they all agreed in one unavoidable conviction that rome had escaped the immediate horrors of an assault to be threatenedif unaided by the legions at ravennaby the prospective miseries of a blockade  amid the confusion of voices around him that word blockade alone reached the pagans ear  it brought with it a flood of emotions that overwhelmed him  all that he saw all that he heard connected itself imperceptibly with that expression  a sudden darkness neither to be dissipated nor escaped seemed to obscure his faculties in an instant he struggled mechanically through the crowd descended the steps of the ramparts and returned to the solitary spot where he had first beheld the woman and the child  the city was blockaded  the goths were bent then on obtaining a peace and not on achieving a conquest  the city was blockaded  it was no error of the ignorant multitudehe had seen with his own eyes the tents and positions of the enemy he had heard the soldiers on the wall discoursing on the admirable disposition of alarics forces on the impossibility of obtaining the smallest communication with the surrounding country on the vigilant watch that had been set over the navigation of the tiber  there was no doubt on the matterthe barbarians had determined on a blockade  there was even less uncertainty upon the results which would be produced by this unimaginable policy of the gothsthe city would be saved  rome had not scrupled in former years to purchase the withdrawal of all enemies from her distant provinces and now that the very centre of her glory the very pinnacle of her declining power was threatened with sudden and unexpected ruin she would lavish on the goths the treasures of the whole empire to bribe them to peace and to tempt them to retreat  the senate might possibly delay the necessary concessions from hopes of assistance that would never be realised but sooner or later the hour of negotiation would arrive northern rapacity would be satisfied with southern wealth and in the very moment when it seemed inevitable the ruin from which the pagan revolution was to derive its vigorous source would be diverted from the churches of rome  could the old renown of the roman name have retained so much of its ancient influence as to daunt the hardy goths after they had so successfully penetrated the empire as to have reached the walls of its vaunted capital  could alaric have conceived so exaggerated an idea of the strength of the forces in the city as to despair with all his multitudes of storming it with success it could not be otherwise  no other consideration could have induced the barbarian general to abandon such an achievement as the destruction of rome  with the chance of an assault the prospects of paganism had brightenedwith the certainty of a blockade they sunk immediately into disheartening gloom   filled with these thoughts ulpius paced backwards and forwards in his solitary retreat utterly abandoned by the exaltation of feeling which had restored to his faculties in the morning the longlost vigour of their former youth  once more he experienced the infirmities of his age once more he remembered the miseries that had made his existence one unending martyrdom once more he felt the presence of his ambition within him like a judgment that he was doomed to welcome like a curse that he was created to cherish  to say that his sensations at this moment were those of the culprit who hears the order for his execution when he had been assured of a reprieve is to convey but a faint idea of the fierce emotions of rage grief and despair that now united to rend the pagans heart  overpowered with weariness both of body and mind he flung himself down under the shade of some bushes that clothed the base of the wall above him  as he lay thereso still in his heavy lassitude that life itself seemed to have left himone of the long green lizards common to italy crawled over his shoulder  he seized the animaldoubtful for the moment whether it might not be of the poisonous speciesand examined it  at the first glance he discovered that it was of the harmless order of its race and would have flung it carelessly from him but for something in its appearance which in the wayward irritability of his present mood he felt a strange and sudden pleasure in contemplating  through its exquisitely marked and transparent skin he could perceive the action of the creatures heart and saw that it was beating violently in the agony of fear caused to the animal by its imprisonment in his hand  as he looked on it and thought how continually a being so timid must be thwarted in its humble anxieties in its small efforts in its little journeys from one patch of grass to another by a hundred obstacles which trifles though they might be to animals of a higher species were yet of fatal importance to creatures constituted like itself he began to find an imperfect yet remarkable analogy between his own destiny and that of this small unit of creation  he felt that in its petty sphere the short life of the humble animal before him must have been the prey of crosses and disappointments as serious to it as the more severed and destructive afflictions of which he in his existence had been the victim and as he watched the shadowlike movement of the little fluttering heart of the lizard he experienced a cruel pleasure in perceiving that there were other beings in the creation even down to the most insignificant who inherited a part of his misery and suffered a portion of his despair  ere long however his emotions took a sterner and a darker hue  the sight of the animal wearied him and he flung it contemptuously aside it disappeared in the direction of the ramparts and almost at the same moment he heard a slight sound resembling the falling of several minute particles of brick or light stone which seemed to come from the wall behind him  that such a noise should proceed from so massive a structure appeared unaccountable  he rose and parting the bushes before him advanced close to the surface of the lofty wall  to his astonishment he found that the brickwork had in many places so completely mouldered away that he could move it easily with his fingers  the cause of the trifling noise that he had heard was now fully explained  hundreds of lizards had made their homes between the fissures of the bricks the animal that he had permitted to escape had taken refuge in one of these cavities and in the hurry of its flight had detached several of the loose crumbling fragments that surrounded its hidingplace  not content however with the discovery he had already made he retired a little and looking stedfastly up through some trees which in this particular place grew at the foot of the wall he saw that its surface was pierced in many places by great irregular rifts some of which extended nearly to its whole height  in addition to this he perceived that the mass of the structure at one particular point leaned considerably out of the perpendicular  astounded at what he beheld he took a stick from the ground and inserting it in one of the lowest and smallest of the cracks easily succeeded in forcing it entirely into the wall part of which seemed to be hollow and part composed of the same rotten brickwork which had at first attracted his attention   it was now evident that the whole structure over a breadth of several yards had been either weakly and carelessly built or had at some former period suffered a sudden and violent shock he left the stick in the wall to mark the place and was about to retire when he heard the footstep of the sentinel on the rampart immediately above  suddenly cautious though from what motive he would have been at that moment hardly able to explain he remained in the concealment of the trees and bushes until the guard had passed onward then he cautiously emerged from the place and retiring to some distance fell into a train of earnest and absorbing thought  to account to the reader for the phenomenon which now engrossed the pagans attention it will be necessary to make a brief digression to the history of the walls of rome  the circumference of the first fortifications of the city built by romulus was thirteen miles  the greater part however of this large area was occupied by fields and gardens which it was the object of the founder of the empire to preserve for arable purposes from the incursions of the different enemies by whom he was threatened from without  as rome gradually increased in size its walls were progressively enlarged and altered by subsequent rulers  but it was not until the reign of the emperor aurelian ad 270 that any extraordinary or important change was effected in the defences of the city  that potentate commenced the erection of walls twentyone miles in circumference which were finally completed in the reign of probus ad 276 were restored by belisarius ad 537 and are to be seen in detached portions in the fortifications of the modern city to the present day  at the date of our story then ad 408 the walls remained precisely as they had been constructed in the reigns of aurelian and probus they were for the most part made of brick and in a few places probably a sort of soft sandstone might have been added to the pervading material at several points in their circumference and particularly in the part behind the pincian hill these walls were built in arches forming deep recesses and occasionally disposed in double rows  the method of building employed in their erection was generally that mentioned by vitruvius in whose time it originated as opus reticulatum  the opus reticulatum was composed of small bricks or stones set together on their angles instead of horizontally and giving the surface of a wall the appearance of a sort of solid network this was considered by some architects of antiquity a perishable mode of construction and vitruvius asserts that some buildings where he had seen it used had fallen down  from the imperfect specimens of it which remain in modern times it would be difficult to decide upon its merits that it was assuredly insufficient to support the weight of the bank of the pincian mount which rose immediately behind it in the solitary spot described some pages back is still made evident by the appearance of the wall at that part of the city which remains in modern times bent out of the perpendicular and cracked in some places almost from top to bottom  this ruin is now known to the present race of italians under the expressive title of il muro torto or the crooked wall  we may here observe that it is extremely improbable that the existence of this natural breach in the fortifications of rome was noticed or if noticed regarded with the slightest anxiety or attention by the majority of the careless and indolent inhabitants at the period of the present romance  it is supposed to have been visible as early as the time of aurelian but is only particularly mentioned by procopius an historian of the sixth century who relates that belisarius in strengthening the city against a siege of the goths attempted to repair this weak point in the wall but was hindered in his intended labour by the devout populace who declared that it was under the peculiar protection of st peter and that it would be consequently impious to meddle with it  the general submitted without remonstrance to the decision of the inhabitants and found no cause afterwards to repent of his facility of compliance for to use the translated words of the writer abovementioned during the siege neither the enemy nor the romans regarded this place  it is to be supposed that so extraordinary an event as this gave the wall that sacred character which deterred subsequent rulers from attempting its repair which permitted it to remain crooked and rent through the convulsions of the middle ages and which still preserves it to attest the veracity of historians by appealing to the antiquarian curiosity of the traveller of modern times   we now return to ulpius  it is a peculiarity observable in the characters of men living under the ascendancy of one ruling idea that they intuitively distort whatever attracts their attention in the outer world into a connection more or less intimate with the single object of their mental contemplation  since the time when he had been exiled from the temple the pagans faculties had unconsciously to himself acted solely in reference to the daring design which it was the business of his whole existence to entertain  influenced therefore by this obliquity of moral feeling he had scarcely reflected on the discovery that he had just made at the base of the city wall ere his mind instantly reverted to the ambitious meditations which had occupied it in the morning and the next moment the first dawning conception of a bold and perilous project began to absorb his restless thoughts  he reflected on the peculiarities and position of the wall before him although the widest and most important of the rents which he had observed in it existed too near the rampart to be reached without the assistance of a ladder there were others as low as the ground which he knew by the result of the trial he had already made might be successfully and immensely widened by the most ordinary exertion and perseverance  the interior of the wall if judged by the condition of the surface could offer no insuperable obstacles to an attempt at penetration so partial as to be limited to a height and width of a few feet  the ramparts from their position between two guardhouses would be unencumbered by an inquisitive populace  the sentinel within the limits of whose allotted watch it happened to fall would when night came on be the only human being likely to pass the spot and at such an hour his attention must necessarily be fixedin the circumstances under which the city was now placedon the prospect beyond rather than on the ground below and behind him  it seemed therefore almost a matter of certainty that a cautious man labouring under cover of the night might pursue whatever investigations he pleased at the base of the wall  he examined the ground where he now stood  nothing could be more lonely than its present appearance  the private gardens on the hill above it shut out all communication from that quarter  it could only be approached by the footpath that ran round the pincian mount and along the base of the walls  in the state of affairs now existing in the city it was not probable that any one would seek this solitary place whence nothing could be seen and where little could be heard in preference to mixing with the spiritstirring confusion in the streets or observing the gothic encampment from such positions on the ramparts as were easily attainable to all  in addition to the secresy offered by the loneliness of this patch of ground to whatever employments were undertaken on it was the further advantage afforded by the trees and thickets which covered its lower end and which would effectually screen an intruder during the darkness of night from the most penetrating observation directed from the wall above  reflecting thus he doubted not that a cunning and determined man might with impunity so far widen any one of the inferior breaches in the lower part of the wall as to make a cavity large enough to admit a human figure that should pierce to its outer surface and afford that liberty of departing from the city and penetrating the gothic camp which the closed gates now denied to all the inhabitants alike  to discover the practicability of such an attempt as this was to a mind filled with such aspirations as the pagans to determine irrevocably on its immediate execution  he resolved as soon as night approached to begin his labours on the wall to seekif the breach were made good and the darkness favoured himthe tent of alaric and once arrived there to acquaint the gothic king with the weakness of the materials for defence within the city and dilapidated condition of the fortifications below the pincian mount insisting as the condition of his treachery on an assurance from the barbarian leader which he doubted not would be gladly and instantly accorded of the destruction of the christian churches the pillage of the christian possessions and the massacre of the christian priests   he retired cautiously from the lonely place that had now become the centre of his new hopes and entering the streets of the city proceeded to provide himself with an instrument that would facilitate his approaching labours and food that would give him strength to prosecute his intended efforts unthreatened by the hindrance of fatigue  as he thought on the daring treachery of his project his mornings exultation began to return to him again  all his previous attempts to organise the restoration of paganism sunk into sudden insignificance before his present design his defence of the temple of serapis his conspiracy at alexandria his intrigue with vetranio were the efforts of a man but this projected destruction of the priests the churches and the treasures of a whole city through the agency of a mighty army moved by the unaided machinations of a single individual would be the dazzling achievement of a god  the hours loitered slowly onward  the sun waned in the gorgeous heaven and set surrounded by red and murky clouds  then came silence and darkness  the gothic watchfires flamed one by one into the dusky air the guards were doubled at the different posts  the populace were driven from the ramparts and the fortifications of the great city echoed to no sound now but the tramp of the restless sentinel or the clash of arms from the distant guardhouses that dotted the long line of the lofty walls  it was then that ulpius passing cautiously along the leastfrequented streets gained unnoticed the place of his destination  a thick vapour lay over the lonely and marshy spot  nothing was now visible from it but the dim uncertain outline of the palaces above and the mass so sunk in obscurity that it looked like a dark layer of mist itself of the rifted fortifications  a smile of exultation passed over the pagans countenance as he perceived the shrouding and welcome thickness of the atmosphere  groping his way softly through the thickets he arrived at the base of the wall  for some time he passed slowly along it feeling the width of the different rents wherever he could stretch his hand  at length he paused at one more extensive than the rest drew from its concealment in his garments a thick bar of iron sharpened at one end and began to labour at the breach  chance had led him to the place best adapted to his purpose  the ground he stood on was only encumbered close to the wall by rank weeds and low thickets and was principally composed of damp soft turf  the bricks therefore as he carefully detached them made no greater noise in falling than the slight rustling caused by their sudden contact with the boughs through which they descended  insignificant as this sound was it aroused the apprehension of the wary pagan  he laid down his iron bar and removed the thickets by dragging them up or breaking them at the roots until he had cleared a space of some feet in extent before the base of the wall  he then returned to his toilsome task and with hands bleeding from the wounds inflicted by the thorns he had grasped in removing the thickets continued his labour at the brickwork  he pursued his employment with perfect impunity the darkness covered him from observation no one disturbed him by approaching the solitary scene of his operations and of the two sentinels who were placed near the part of the wall which was the centre of all his exertions one remained motionless at the most distant extremity of his post and the other paced restlessly backwards and forwards on the rampart singing a wild rambling song about war and women and wine which whatever liberty it might allow to his organs of perception effectually hindered the vigilant exercise of his faculties of hearing  brick after brick yielded to the vigorous and welltimed efforts of ulpius  he had already made a cavity in an oblique direction large enough to creep through and was preparing to penetrate still further when a portion of the rotten material of the interior of the wall suddenly yielded in a mass to a chance pressure of his iron bar and slowly sunk down inwards into a bed which judging by such faint sounds as were audible at the moment must have been partly water and partly marshy earth and rotten brickwork  after having first listened to be sure that the slight noise caused by this event had not reached the ears or excited the suspicions of the careless sentinels ulpius crept into the cavity he had made groping his way with his bar until he reached the brink of a chasm the depth of which he could not probe and the breadth of which he could not ascertain   he lingered irresolute the darkness around him was impenetrable he could feel toads and noisome animals crawling over his limbs  the damp atmosphere of the place began to thrill through him to his very bones his whole frame trembled under the excess of his past exertions without light he could neither attempt to proceed nor hope to discover the size and extent of the chasm which he had partially laid open  the mist was fast vanishing as the night advanced it was necessary to arrive at a resolution ere it would be too late  he crept out of the cavity  just as he had gained the open air the sentinel halted over the very spot where the pagan stood and paused suddenly in his song  there was an instants interval of silence during which the inmost soul of ulpius quailed beneath an apprehension as vivid as that which had throbbed in the heart of the despised lizard whose flight had guided him to his discovery at the wall soon however he heard the voice of the soldier calling cheerfully to his fellow sentinel comrade do you see the moon  she is rising to cheer our watch  nothing had been discoveredhe was still safe  but if he stayed at the cavity till the mists faded before the moonlight could he be certain of preserving his security  he felt that he could not  what mattered a night more or a night less to such a project as his months might elapse before the goths retired from the walls  it was better to suffer delay than to risk discovery  he determined to leave the place and to return on the following night provided with a lantern the light of which he would conceal until he entered the cavity  once there it could not be perceived by the sentinels aboveit would guide him through all obstacles preserve him through all dangers  massive as it was he felt convinced that the interior of the wall was in as ruinous a condition as the outside  caution and perseverance were sufficient of themselves to insure to his efforts the speediest and completest success  he waited until the sentinel had again betaken himself to the furthest limits of his watch and then softly gathering up the brushwood that lay round him he concealed with it the mouth of the cavity in the outer wall and the fragments of brickwork that had fallen on the turf beneath  this done he again listened to assure himself that he had been unobserved then stepping with the utmost caution he departed by the path that led round the slope of the pincian hill  strengthpatienceand tomorrow night muttered the pagan to himself as he entered the streets and congregated once more with the citizens of rome    chapter 11  goisvinthas return  it was morning  the sun had risen but his beams were partially obscured by thick heavy clouds which scowled already over the struggling brightness of the eastern horizon  the bustle and animation of the new day gradually overspread the gothic encampment in all directions  the only tent whose curtain remained still closed and round which no busy crowds congregated in discussion or mingled in labour was that of hermanric  by the dying embers of his watchfire stood the young chieftain with two warriors to whom he appeared to be giving some hurried directions  his countenance expressed emotions of anxiety and discontent which though partially repressed while he was in the presence of his companions became thoroughly visible not only in his features but in his manner when they left him to watch alone before his tent   for some time he walked regularly backwards and forwards looking anxiously down the westward lines of the encampment and occasionally whispering to himself a hasty exclamation of doubt and impatience with the first breath of the new morning the delighting meditations which had occupied him by his watchfire during the darkness of the night had begun to subside and now as the hour of her expected return gradually approached the image of goisvintha banished from his mind whatever remained of those peaceful and happy contemplation in which he had hitherto been absorbed  the more he thought on his fatal promiseon the nation of antoninaon his duties to the army and the people to whom he belonged the more doubtful appeared to him his chance of permanently protecting the young roman without risking his degradation as a goth and his ruin as a warrior and the more sternly and ominously ran in his ears the unassailable truth of goisvinthas parting tauntyou must remember your promise you cannot save her if you would  wearied of persisting in deliberations which only deepened his melancholy and increased his doubts bent on sinking in a temporary and delusive oblivion the boding reflections that overcame him in spite of himself by seekingwhile its enjoyment was yet left to himthe society of his illfated charge he turned towards his tent drew aside the thick heavy curtains of skins which closed its opening and approached the rude couch on which antonina was still sleeping  a ray of sunlight fitful and struggling burst at this moment through the heavy clouds and stole into the opening of the tent as he contemplated the slumbering girl  it ran its flowing course up her uncovered hand and arm flew over her bosom and neck and bathed in a bright fresh glow her still and reposing features  gradually her limbs began to move her lips parted gently and half smiled as if in welcome to the greeting of the light her eyes slightly opened then dazzled by the brightness that flowed through their raised lids tremblingly closed again  at length thoroughly awakened she shaded her face with her hands and sitting up on the couch met the gaze of hermanric fixed on her in sorrowful examination  your bright armour and your glorious name and your merciful words have remained with me even in my sleep said she wonderingly and now when i awake i see you before me again  it is a happiness to be aroused by the sun which has gladdened me all my life to look upon you who have given me shelter in my distress  but why she continued in altered and enquiring tones why do you gaze upon me with doubting and mournful eyes  you have slept well and safely said hermanric evasively i closed the opening of the tent to preserve you from the nightdamps but i have raised it now for the air is warming under the rising sun  are you wearied with watching she interrupted rising to her feet and looking anxiously into his face  but he spoke not in reply  his head was turned towards the door of the tent  he seemed to be listening for some expected sound  it was evident that he had not heard her question  she followed the direction of his eyes  the sight of the great city half brightened half darkened as its myriad buildings reflected the light of the sun or retained the shadows of the clouds brought back to her remembrance her last nights petition for her fathers safety  she laid her hand upon her companions arm to awaken his attention and hastily resumed  you have not forgotten what i said to you last night  my fathers name is numerian  he lives on the pincian mount  you will save him hermanricyou will save him  you will remember your promise  the young warriors eyes fell as she spoke and an irrepressible shudder shook his whole frame the last part of antoninas address to him was expressed in the same terms as a past appeal from other lips and in other accents which still clung to his memory  the same demand remember your promise which had been advanced to urge him to bloodshed by goisvintha was now proffered by antonina to lure him to pity  the petition of affection was concluded in the same terms as the petition of revenge  as he thought on both the human pity of the one and the fiendlike cruelty of the other rose in sinister and significant contrast on the mind of the goth realising in all its perils the struggle that was to come when goisvintha returned and dispelling instantaneously the last hopes that he had yet ventured to cherish for the fugitive at his side  no assault of the city is commandedno assault is intended  your fathers life is safe from the swords of the goths he gloomily replied in answer to antoninas last words  the girl moved back from him a few steps as he spoke and looked thoughtfully round the tent the battleaxe that hermanric had secured during the scene of the past evening still lay on the ground in a corner  the sight of it brought back a flood of terrible recollections to her mind  she started violently a sudden change overspread her features and when she again addressed hermanric it was with quivering lips and in almost inarticulate words  i know now why you look on me so gloomily said she that woman is coming back  i was so occupied by my dreams and my thoughts of my father and of you and my hopes for days to come that i had forgotten her when i awoke  but i remember all now  she is coming backi  see it in your sorrowful eyesshe is coming back to murder me  i shall die at the moment when i had such hope in my life  there is no happiness for me  nonenone  the goths countenance began to darken  he whispered to himself several times how can i save her  for a few minutes there was a deep silence broken only by the sobs of antonina  he looked round at her after an interval  she held her hands clasped over her eyes  the tears were streaming through her parted fingers her bosom heaved as if her emotions would burst their way through it in some palpable form and her limbs trembled so that she could scarcely support herself unconsciously as he looked on her he passed his arm round her slender form drew her hands gently from her face and said to her though his heart belied his words as he spoke do not be afraidtrust in me  how can i be calm she cried looking up at him entreatingly i was so happy last night so sure that you could preserve me so hopeful about tomorrowand now i see by your mournful looks i know by your doubting voice that to soothe my anguish you have promised me more than you can perform  the woman who is your companion has a power over us both that it is terrible even to think of  she will return she will withdraw all mercy from your heart she will glare upon me with her fearful eyes she will kill me at your feet  i shall die after all i have suffered and all i have hoped  oh hermanric while there is yet time let us escape  you were not made to shed bloodyou are too merciful  god never made you to destroy  you cannot yearn towards cruelty and woe for you have aided and protected me  let us escape  i will follow you wherever you wish  i will do whatever you ask  i will go with you beyond those far bright mountains behind us to any strange and distant land for there is beauty everywhere there are woods that may be dwelt in and valleys that may be loved on all the surface of this wide great earth  the goth looked sadly on her as she paused but he gave her no answerthe gloom was deepening over his heartthe false words of consolation were silenced on his lips   think how many pleasures we should enjoy how much we might see continued the girl in soft appealing tones  we should be free to wander wherever we pleased we should never be lonely never be mournful never be wearied  i could listen to you day after day while you told me of the country where your people were born  i could sing you sweet songs that i have learned upon the lute  oh how i have wept in my loneliness to lead such a life as this  how i have longed that such freedom and joy might be mine  how i have thought of the distant lands that i would visit of the happy nations that i would discover of the mountain breezes that i would breathe of the shady places that i would repose in of the rivers that i would follow in their course of the flowers i would plant and the fruits i would gather  how i have hoped for such an existence as this  how i have longed for a companion who might enjoy it as i should  have you never felt this joy that i have imagined to myself you who have been free to wander wherever you pleased  let us leave this place and i will teach it to you if you have not  i will be so patient so obedient so happy  i will never be sorrowful never repiningbut let us escapeoh hermanric let us escape while there is yet time  will you keep me here to be slain  can you drive me forth into the world alone remember that the gates of the city and the doors of my home are now closed to me remember that i have no mother and that my father has forsaken me  remember that i am a stranger on the earth which was made for me to be joyful in  think how soon the woman who has vowed that she will murder me will return think how terrible it is to be in the fear of death and while there is time let us departhermanric hermanric if you have pity for me let us depart  she clasped her hands and looked up in his face imploringly  the manner of hermanric had expressed more to her senses sharpened as they were by peril than his words could have conveyed even had he confessed to her the cause of the emotions of doubt and apprehension that oppressed his mind  nothing could more strikingly testify to the innocence of her character and the seclusion of her life than her attempt to combine with her escape from goisvinthas fury the acquisition of such a companion as the goth  but to the forlorn and affectionate girl who saw herselfa stranger to the laws of the social existence of her fellow creaturessuddenly thrust forth friendless into the unfriendly world could the heart have naturally prompted any other desire than anxiety to secure the companion after having discovered the protector  in the guilelessness of her character in her absolute ignorance of humanity of the influence of custom of the adaptation of difference of feeling to difference of sex she vainly imagined that the tranquil existence she had urged on hermanric would suffice for the attainment of her end by presenting the same allurements to him a warrior and a goth that it contained for hera lonely thoughtful visionary girl  and yet so wonderful was the ascendancy that she had acquired by the magic of her presence the freshness of her beauty and the novelty of her manner over the heart of the young chieftain that he who would have spurned from him with contempt any other woman who might have addressed to him such a petition as antoninas looked down sorrowfully at the girl as she ceased speaking and for an instant hesitated in his choice  at that moment when the attention of each was fixed on the other a third person stealthily approached the opening of the tent and beholding them together thus burst into a bitter taunting laugh hermanric raised his eyes instantly but the sound of that harsh unwomanly voice was alleloquent to antoninas senses  she hid her face against the goths breast and murmured breathlesslyshe has returned i must die  i must die  she had returned  she perceived hermanric and antonina in a position which left no doubt that a stronger feeling than the mere wish to protect the victim of her intended revenge had arisen during her absence in the heart of her kinsman  hour after hour while she had fulfilled her duties by the beds of alarics invalided soldiery had she brooded over her projects of vengeance and blood  neither the sickness nor the death which she had beheld around her had possessed an influence powerful enough over the stubborn ferocity which now alone animated her nature to lure it to mercy or awe it to repentance invigorated by delay and enlarged by disappointment the evil passion that consumed her had strengthened its power and aroused the most latent of its energies during the silent vigil that she had just held she had detested the girl on the evening before for her nation she now hated her for herself  what have you to do with the trappings of a gothic warrior she cried in mocking accents pointing at hermanric with a long huntingknife which she held in her hand  why are you here in a gothic encampment go knock at the gates of rome implore her guards on your knees to admit you among the citizens and when they ask you whyshow them the girl there  tell them that you love her that you would wed her that it is nothing to you that her people have murdered your brother and his children  and then when you yourself have begotten sons gothic bastards infected with roman blood be a roman at heart yourself send your children forth to complete what your wifes people left undone at aquileiaby murdering me  she paused and laughed scornfully  then her humour suddenly changed she advanced a few steps and continued in a louder and sterner tone   you have broken your faith you have lied to me you have forgotten your wrongs and mine but you have not yet forgotten my parting words when i left you last night  i told you that she should be slain and now that you have refused to avenge me i will make good my words by killing her with my own hand  if you would defend her you must murder me  you must shed her blood or mine  she stepped forward her towering form was stretched to its highest stature the muscles started into action on her bare arms as she raised them above her head  for one instant she fixed her glaring eyes steadily on the girls shrinking formthe next she rushed up and struck furiously with the knife at her bare neck  as the weapon descended hermanric caught her wrist  she struggled violently to disengage herself from his grasp but in vain  the countenance of the young warrior grew deadly pale as he held her for a few minutes he glanced eagerly round the tent in an agony of bewilderment and despair  the conflicting interests of his duty towards his sister and his anxiety for antoninas preservation filled his heart to distraction  a moment more he hesitated and during that short delay the despotism of custom had yet power enough to prevail over the promptings of pity  he called to the girlwithdrawing his arm which had hitherto been her supportgo have mercy on me go  but she neither heeded nor heard him  she fell on her knees at the womans feet and in a low moaning voice faltered out  what have i done that i deserve to be slain  i never murdered your children i never yet saw a child but i loved it if i had seen your children i should have loved them  if i had preserved to this time the child that i saved from the massacre and you had approached him returned the woman fiercely i would have taught him to strike at you with his little hands when you spoke to him he should have spat upon you for answereven thus  trembling exhausted terrified as she was the girls roman blood rushed over her pale cheeks as she felt the insult  she turned towards hermanric looked up at him appealingly attempted to speak and then sinking lower upon the ground wept bitterly  why do you weep and pray and mouth it at him shrieked goisvintha pointing to hermanric with her disengaged hand  he has neither courage to protect you nor honour to aid me  do you think that i am to be moved by your tears and entreaties  i tell you that your people have slain my husband and my children and that i hate you for that  i tell you that you have lured hermanric into love for a roman and unfaithfulness to me and i will slay you for doing it  i tell you that there is not a living thing of the blood of your country or the name of your nation throughout the length and breadth of this empire that i would not destroy if i had the power  if the very trees on the road hither could have had feeling i would have torn the bark from their stems with my own hands  if a bird native of your skies had flown into my bosom from very tameness and sport i would have crushed it dead at my feet  and do you think that you shall escape  do you think that i will not avenge the deaths of my husband and my children upon you after this  as she spoke she mechanically unclenched her hands  the knife dropped to the ground  hermanric instantly stooped and secured it  for a moment she stood before him released from his grasp motionless and speechless  then starting as if struck by a sudden idea she moved towards the opening of the tent and in tones of malignant triumph addressed him thus  you shall not save her yet  you are unworthy of your nation and your name  i will betray your cowardice and treachery to your brethren in the camp  and she ran to the outside of the tent calling in a loud voice to a group of young warriors who happened to be passing at a short distance  stay stay fritigernathanariccoliassueridwithericfravitta  hasten hitherward  hermanric has a captive in his tenta prisoner whom it will rejoice to see  hitherward  hitherward   the group she addressed contained some of the most turbulent and careless spirits of the whole gothic army  they had just been released from their duties of the past night and were at leisure to comply with goisvinthas request  she had scarcely concluded her address before they turned and hurried eagerly up to the tent shouting to hermanric as they advanced to make his prisoner visible to them in the open air  they had probably expected to be regaled by the ludicrous terror of some roman slave whom their comrade had discovered lurking in the empty suburbs for when they entered the tent and saw nothing but the shrinking figure of the unhappy girl as she crouched on the earth at hermanrics feet they all paused with one accord and looked round on each other in speechless astonishment  behold her cried goisvintha breaking the momentary silence  she is the roman prisoner that your man of valour there has secured for himself  for that trembling child he has forgotten the enmities of his people  she is more to him already than army general or companions you have watched before the city during the night but he has stood sentinel by the maiden of rome hope not that he will share in your toils or mix in your pleasures more  alaric and the warriors have lost his serviceshis future king cringes there at his feet  she had expected to arouse the anger and excite the jealousy of the rough audience she addressed but the result of her envenomed jeers disappointed her hopes  the humour of the moment prompted the goths to ridicule a course infinitely more inimical to antoninas interests with hermanric than menaces or recrimination  recovered from their first astonishment they burst into a loud and universal laugh  mars and venus caught together  but by st  peter i see not vulcan and the net cried fravitta who having served in the armies of rome and acquired a vague knowledge there of the ancient mythology and the modern politics of the empire was considered by his companions as the wit of the battalion to which he was attached  i like her figure growled fritigern a heavy phlegmatic giant renowned for his imperturbable good humour and his prowess in drinking what little there is of it looks so limp that hermanric might pack her into his light baggage and carry her about with him on his shoulders wherever he goes  by which process you would say old sucker of wineskins that he will attain the double advantage of always keeping her to himself and always keeping her warm interrupted colias a ruddy reckless boy of sixteen privileged to be impertinent in consideration of his years  is she orthodox or arian gravely demanded athanaric who piqued himself on his theological accomplishments and his extraordinary piety  what hair she has exclaimed suerid sarcastically  it is as black as the horsehides of a squadron of huns  show us her face  whose tent will she visit next cried witheric with an insolent laugh  mine replied fritigern complacently  what says the chorus of the song  money and wine make beauty mine  i have more of both than any of you  she will come to my tent  during the delivery of these clumsy jests which followed one upon another with instantaneous rapidity the scorn at first expressed in hermanrics countenance became gradually replaced by a look of irrepressible anger  as fritigern spoke he lost all command over himself and seizing his sword advanced threateningly towards the easytempered giant who made no attempt to recede or defend himself but called out soothingly patience man patience  would you kill an old comrade for jesting  i envy you your good luck as a friend not as an enemy   yielding to the necessity of lowering his sword before a defenceless man hermanric was about to reply angrily to fritigern when his voice was drowned in the blast of a trumpet sounding close by the tent  the signal that it gave was understood at once by the group of jesters still surrounding the young goth  they turned and retired without an instants delay  the last of their number had scarcely disappeared when the same veteran who had spoken with hermanric on the departure of goisvintha the evening before entered and thus addressed him  you are commanded to post yourself with the division that now awaits you at a place eastward of your present position which will be shown you by a guide  make ready at onceyou have not an instant to delay  as the words passed the old mans lips hermanric turned and looked on goisvintha  during the presence of the goths in the tent she had sat listening to their rough jeers in suppressed wrath and speechless disdain now she rose and advanced a few steps  but there suddenly appeared an unwonted hesitation in her gait her face was pale she breathed fast and heavily  where will you shelter her now she cried addressing hermanric and threatening the girl with her outstretched hands  abandon her to your companions or leave her to me she is lost either way  i shall triumphtriumph  at this moment her voice sank to an unintelligible murmur she tottered where she stood  it was evident that the long strife of passions during her past night of watching and the fierce and varying emotions of the morning suddenly brought to a crisis as they had been by her exultation when she heard the old warriors fatal message had at length overtasked the energies even of her powerful frame  yet one moment more she endeavoured to advance to speak to snatch the hunting knife from hermanrics hand the next she fell insensible at his feet  goaded almost to madness by the successive trials that he had undergone goisvinthas furious determination to thwart him still present to his mind the scornful words of his companions yet ringing in his ears his inexorable duties demanding his attention without reserve or delay hermanric succumbed at last under the difficulties of his position and despairingly abandoned all further hope of effecting the girls preservation  pointing to some food that lay in a corner of the tent and to the country behind he said to her in broken and gloomy accents furnish yourself with those provisions and fly while goisvintha is yet unable to pursue you  i can protect you no longer  until this moment antonina had kept her face hidden and had remained still crouching on the ground motionless save when a shudder ran through her frame as she listened to the loud coarse jesting of the goths and speechless except that when goisvintha sank senseless to the earth she uttered an exclamation of terror  but now when she heard the sentence of her banishment proclaimed by the very lips which but the evening before had assured her of shelter and protection she rose up instantly cast on the young goth a glance of such speechless misery and despair that he involuntarily quailed before it and then without a tear or a sigh without a look of reproach or a word of entreaty petrified and bowed down beneath a perfect trance of terror and grief she left the tent  hurrying his actions with the reckless energy of a man determined on banishing his thoughts by his employments hermanric placed himself at the head of his troop and marched quickly onwards in an eastward direction past the pincian gate  two of his attendants who happened to enter the tent after his departure observing goisvintha still extended on the earth proceeded to transport her to part of the camp occupied by the women who were attached to the army and then the little sheltering canopy which made the abode of the goth and which had witnessed so large a share of human misery and so fierce a war of human contention in so few hours was left as silent and lonely as the deserted country in which antonina was now fated to seek a refuge and a home    chapter 12  the passage of the wall  a fair night this balbus  all moonlight and no mist  i was posted last evening at the ostian gate and was half choked by the fog  if you were posted last night at the ostian gate you were better placed than you are now  the ramparts here are as lonely as a ruin in the provinces  nothing behind us but the back of the pincian mount nothing before us but the empty suburbs nothing at each side of us but brick and stone nothing at our posts but ourselves  may i be crucified like st peter if i believe that there is another place on the whole round of the walls possessed of such solitary dulness as this  you are a man to find something to complain of if you were lodged in one of the palaces yonder  the place is solitary enough it is true but whether it is dull or not depends on ourselves its most honourable occupants  i for one am determined to promote its joviality by the very praiseworthy exertion of obliging you my discontented friend with an inexhaustible series of those stories for which i may say without arrogance i am celebrated throughout the length and breadth of all the barracks of rome  you may tell as many stories as you please but do not imagine that i will make one of your audience  you are welcome to attend to me or not as you choose  though you do not listen i shall still relate my stories by way of practice  i will address them to the walls or to the air or to the defunct gods and goddesses of antiquity should they happen at this moment to be hovering over the city in a rage as some of the unconverted would have us believe or to our neighbours the goths if they are seized with a sudden desire to quite their encampments and obtain a near view of the fortifications that they are so discreetly unwilling to assault  or these materials for a fit and decent auditory failing me i will tell my stories to the most attentive of all listenersmyself  and the sentinel without further delay opened his budget of anecdotes with the easy fluency of of a man who possessed a wellplaced confidence in the perfection of his capacities for narration determined that his saturnine colleague should hear him though he would not give him his attention he talked in a raised voice pacing briskly backwards and forwards over the space of his allotted limits and laughing with ludicrous regularity and complacency at every jest that he happened to make in the course of his illrewarded narrative  he little thought as he continued to proceed in his tale that its commencement had been welcomed by an unseen hearer with emotions widely different from those which had dictated the observations of the unfriendly companion of his watch  true to his determination ulpius with part of the wages which he had hoarded in numerians service had procured a small lantern from a shop in one of the distant quarters of rome and veiling its light in a piece of coarse thick cloth had proceeded by the solitary pathway to his second nights labour at the wall  he arrived at the breach at the commencement of the dialogue above related and heard with delight the sentinels noisy resolution to amuse his companion in spite of himself the louder and the longer the man talked the less probable was the chance that the pagans labours in the interior of the wall would be suspected or overheard  softly clearing away the brushwood at the entrance of the hole that he had made the night before ulpius crept in as far as he had penetrated on that occasion and then with mingled emotions of expectation and apprehension which affected him so powerfully that he was for the moment hardly master of his actions he slowly and cautiously uncovered his light   his first glance was intuitively directed to the cavity that opened beneath him  he saw immediately that it was less important both in size and depth than he had imagined it to be  the earth at this particular place had given way beneath the foundations of the wall which had sunk down deepening the chasm by their weight into the yielding ground beneath them  a small spring of water probably the first cause of the sinking in the earth had bubbled up into the space in the brickwork which bit by bit and year by year it had gradually undermined  nor did it remain stagnant at this place  it trickled merrily and quietly onwarda tiny rivulet emancipated from one prison in the ground only to enter another in the wall bounded by no grassy banks brightened by no cheerful light admired by no human eye followed in its small course through the inner fissures in the brick by no living thing but a bloated toad or a solitary lizard  yet wending as happily on its way through darkness and ruin as its sisters who were basking in the sunlight of the meadows or leaping in the fresh breezes of the open mountain side  raising his eyes from the little spring ulpius next directed his attention to the prospect above him  immediately over his head the material of the interior of the wall presented a smooth flat hard surface which seemed capable of resisting the most vigorous attempts at its destruction but on looking round he perceived at one side of him and further inwards an appearance of dark dimlydefined irregularity which promised encouragingly for his intended efforts  he descended into the chasm of the rivulet crawled up on a heap of crumbling brickwork and gained a hole above it which he immediately began to widen to admit of his passage through  inch by inch he enlarged the rift crept into it and found himself on a fragment of the bow of one of the foundation arches which though partly destroyed still supported itself isolated from all connection with the part of the upper wall which it had once sustained and which had gradually crumbled away into the cavities below  he looked up  an immense rift soared above him stretching its tortuous ramifications at different points into every part of the wall that was immediately visible  the whole structure seemed at this place to have received a sudden and tremendous wrench  but for the support of the sounder fortifications at each side of it it could not have sustained itself after the shock the pagan gazed aloft into the fearful breaches which yawned above him with ungovernable awe  his small fitful light was not sufficient to show him any of their terminations  they looked as he beheld them in dark relief against the rest of the hollow part of the wall like mighty serpents twining their desolating path right upward to the ramparts above and he himself as he crouched on his pinnacle with his little light by his side was reduced by the wild grandeur the vast solemn gloom of the obscure dusky and fantastic objects around him to the stature of a pigmy  could he have been seen from the ramparts high overhead as he now peered down behind his lantern into the cavities and irregularities below him he would have looked with his flickering light like a mole led by a glowworm  he paused to consider his next movements  in a stationary position the damp coldness of the atmosphere was almost insupportable but he attained a great advantage by his present stillness he could listen undisturbed by the noises made by the bricks which crumbled from under him if he advanced   ere long he heard a thin winding longdrawn sound now louder now softer now approaching now retreating now verging towards shrillness now quickly returning to a faint gentle swell  suddenly this strange unearthly music was interrupted by a succession of long deep rolling sounds which travelled grandly about the fissures above like prisoned thunderbolts striving to escape  utterly ignorant that the first of these noises was occasioned by the night wind winding through the rents in the brick of the outer wall beyond him and the second by the echoes produced in the irregular cavities above by the footfall of the sentries overheadroused by the influence of the place and the mystery of his employment to a pitch of fanatic exaltation which for the moment absolutely unsteadied his reasonfilled with the frantic enthusiasm of his designs and the fearful legends of invisible beings and worlds which made the foundation of his worship ulpius conceived as he listened to the sounds around and above that the gods of antiquity were now in viewless congregation hovering about him and calling to him in unearthly voices and in an unknown tongue to proceed upon his daring enterprise in the full assurance of its near and glorious success  roar and mutter and make your hurricane music in my ears exclaimed the pagan raising his withered hands and addressing in a savage ecstacy his imagined deities  your servant ulpius stops not on the journey that leads him to your repeopled shrines  blood crime danger painpride and honour joy and rest have i strewn like sacrifices at your altars feet  time has whirled past me youth and manhood have lain long since buried in the hidden lethe which is the portion of life age has wreathed his coils over my bodys strength but still i watch by your temples and serve your mighty cause  your vengeance is near monarchs of the world your triumph is at hand  he remained for some time in the same position looking fixedly up into the trackless darkness above him drinking in the sounds whichalternately rising and sinkingstill floated round him the trembling gleam of his lantern fell red and wild upon his livid countenance  his shaggy hair floated in the cold breezes that blew by him  at this moment he would have appeared from a distance like a phantom of fire perishing in a mist of darkness like a gnome in adoration in the bowels of the earth like a forsaken spirit in a solitary purgatory watching for the advent of a glimpse of beauty or a breath of air  at length he aroused himself from his trance trimmed with careful hand his guiding lantern and set forward to penetrate the breadth of the great rift he had just entered  he moved on in an oblique direction several feet now creeping over the tops of the foundation arches now skirting the extremities of protrusions in the ruined brickwork now descending into dark slimy rubbishchoked chasms until the rift suddenly diminished in all directions  the atmosphere was warmer in the place he now occupied he could faintly distinguish patches of dark moss dotted here and there over the uneven surface of the wall and once or twice some blades of long flat grass that grew from a prominence immediately above his head were waved in his face by the wind which he could now feel blowing through the narrow fissure that he was preparing to enlarge  it was evident that he had by this time advanced to within a few feet of the outer extremity of the wall  numerian wanders after his child through the streets muttered the pagan as he deposited his lantern by his side bared his trembling arms and raised his iron bar the slaves of his neighbour the senator are forth to pursue me  on all sides my enemies are out after me but posted here i mock their strictest search  if they would track me to my hidingplace they must penetrate the walls of rome  if they would hunt me down in my lair they must assail me tonight in the camp of the goths  fools let them look to themselves  i seal the doom of their city with the last brick that i tear from their defenceless walls  he laughed to himself as he thrust his bar boldly into the crevice before him  in some places the bricks yielded easily to his efforts in others their resistance was only to be overcome by the exertion of his utmost strength  resolutely and unceasingly he continued his labours now wounding his hands against the jagged surfaces presented by the widening fissure now involuntarily dropping his instrument from ungovernable exhaustion but still working bravely on in defiance of every hindrance that opposed him until he gained the interior of the new rift  as he drew his lantern after him into the cavity that he had made he perceived that unless it was heightened immediately over him he could proceed no further even in a creeping position irritated at this unexpected necessity for more violent exertion desperate in his determination to get through the wall at all hazards on that very night he recklessly struck his bar upwards with all his strength instead of gradually and softly loosening the material of the surface that opposed him as he had done before  a few moments of this labour had scarcely elapsed when a considerable portion of the brickwork consolidated into one firm mass fell with lightning suddenness from above  it hurled him under it prostrate on the foundation arch which had been his support crushed and dislocated his right shoulder and shivered his lantern into fragments  a groan of irrepressible anguish burst from his lips  he was left in impenetrable darkness  the mass of brickwork after it had struck him rolled a little to one side  by a desperate exertion he extricated himself from under itonly to swoon from the fresh anguish caused to him by the effort  for a short time he lay insensible in his cold dark solitude  then reviving after this first shock he began to experience in all their severity the fierce spasms the dull gnawings the throbbing torments that were the miserable consequences of the injury he received  his arm lay motionless by his sidehe had neither strength nor resolution to move any one of the other sound limbs in his body  at one moment his deep sobbing stifled respirations syllabled horrible and halfformed cursesat another his panting breaths suddenly died away within him and then he could hear the blood dripping slowly from his shoulder with dismal regularity into a little pool that it had formed already by his side  the shrill breezes which wound through the crevices in the wall before him were now felt only on his wounded limb  they touched its surface like innumerable splinters of thin sharp ice they penetrated his flesh like rushing sparks struck out of a sea of molten lead  there were moments during the first pangs of this agony when if he had been possessed of a weapon and of the strength to use it he would have sacrificed his ambition for ever by depriving himself of life  but this desire to end his torments with his existence lasted not long gradually the anguish in his body awakened a wilder and stronger distemper in his mind and then the two agonies physical and mental rioted over him together in fierce rivalry divesting him of all thoughts but such as were by their own agency created or aroused  for some time he lay helpless in his misery alternately venting by stifled groans the unalleviated torment of his wounds and lamenting with curses the failure of his enterprise at the very moment of its apparent success  at length the pangs that struck through him seemed to grow gradually less frequent he hardly knew now from what part of his frame they more immediately proceeded insensibly his faculties of thinking and feeling grew blunted then he remained a little while in a mysterious unrefreshing repose of body and mind and then his disordered senses left unguided and unrestrained became the victims of a sudden and terrible delusion  the blank darkness around him appeared after an interval to be gradually dawning into a dull light thick and misty like the reflections on clouds which threaten a thunderstorm at the close of evening  soon this atmosphere seemed to be crossed and streaked with a fantastic trelliswork of white seething vapour  then the mass of brickwork which had struck him down grew visible at his side enlarged to an enormous bulk and endued with a power of selfmotion by which it mysteriously swelled and shrank and raised and depressed itself without quitting for a moment its position near him  and then from its dark and toiling surface there rose a long stream of dusky shapes which twined themselves about the misty trelliswork above and took the prominent and palpable form of human countenances marked by every difference of age and distorted by every variety of suffering   there were infantine faces wreathed about with graveworms that hung round them like locks of filthy hair aged faces dabbled with gore and slashed with wounds youthful faces seamed with livid channels along which ran unceasing tears lovely faces distorted into fixed expressions of raging pain wild malignity and despairing gloom  not one of these countenances exactly resembled the other  each was distinguished by a revolting character of its own  yet however deformed might be their other features the eyes of all were preserved unimpaired  speechless and bodiless they floated in unceasing myriads up to the fantastic trelliswork which seemed to swell its wild proportions to receive them  there they clustered in their goblin amphitheatre and fixed and silently they all glared down without one exception on the pagans face  meanwhile the walls at the side began to gleam out with a light of their own making jagged boundaries to the midway scene of phantom faces  then the rifts in their surfaces widened and disgorged misshapen figures of priests and idols of the old time which came forth in every hideous deformity of aspect mocking at the faces on the trelliswork while behind and over the whole soared shapes of gigantic darkness robed in grim cloudy resemblances of skins such as were worn by the goths and wielding through the quivering vapour mighty and shadowlike weapons of war  from the whole of this ghastly assemblage there rose not the slightest sound a stillness as of a dead and ruined world possessed in all its quarters the appalling scene  the deep echoes of the sentries footsteps and the faint dirging of the melancholy winds were no more  the blood that had as yet dripped from his wound made no sound now in the pagans ear even his own agony of terror was as silent as were the visionary demons who had aroused it days years centuries seemed to pass as he lay gazing up in a trance of horror into his realm of peopled and ghostly darkness  at last nature yielded under the trial the phantom prospect suddenly whirled round him with fearful velocity and his senses sought refuge from the thraldom of their own creation in a deep and welcome swoon  time had moved wearily onward the chiding winds had many times waved the dry locks of his hair to and fro about his brow as if to bid him awaken and arise ere he again recovered his consciousness  once more aroused to the knowledge of his position and the sensation of his wound he slowly raised himself upon his uninjured arm and looked wildly around for the faintest appearance of a gleam of light  but the winding and uneven nature of the track which he had formed to lead him through the wall effectually prevented the moonbeams then floating into the outermost of the cavities that he had made from reaching the place where he now lay not a single object was even faintly distinguishable around him  darkness hemmed him in in rayless and triumphant obscurity on every side  the first agonies of the injury he had received had resolved themselves into one dull heavy unchanging sensation of pain  the vision that had overwhelmed his senses was now in a vast and shadowy form present only to his memory filling the darkness with fearful recollections and not with dismal forms and urging on him a restless headlong yearning to effect his escape from the lonely and unhallowed sepulchre the prison of solitude and death that his own fatal exertions threatened him with should he linger much longer in the caverns of the wall  i must pass from this darkness into lighti must breathe the air of the sky or i shall perish in the damps of this vault he exclaimed in a hoarse moaning voice as he raised himself gradually and painfully into a creeping position and turning round slowly commenced his meditated retreat  his brain still whirled with the emotions that had so lately overwhelmed his mind his right hand hung helplessly by his side dragged after him like a prisoners chain and lacerated by the uneven surface of the ground over which it was slowly drawn assupporting himself on his left arm and creeping forward a few inches at a timehe set forth on his toilsome journey  here he paused bewildered in the darkness there he either checked himself by a convulsive effort from falling headlong into the unknown deeps beneath him or lost the little ground he had gained in labour and agony by retracing his way at the bidding of some unexpected obstacle now he gnashed his teeth in anguish now he cursed in despair now he was breathless with exhaustion but still with an obstinacy that had in it something of the heroic he never failed in his fierce resolution to effect his escape   slowly and painfully moving with the pace and the perseverance of the tortoise hopeless yet determined as a navigator in a strange sea he writhed onward and onward upon his unguided course until he reaped at length the reward of his long suffering by the sudden discovery of a thin ray of moonlight toiling through a crevice in the murky brickwork before him  hardly did the hearts of the magi when the vision of the star in the east first dawned on their eyes leap within them with a more vivid transport than that which animated the heart of ulpius at the moment when he beheld the inspiring and guiding light  yet a little more exertion a little more patience a little more anguish and he stood once again a ghastly and crippled figure before the outer cavity in the wall  it was near daybreak the moon shone faintly in the dull grey heaven a small vaporous rain was sinking from the shapeless clouds the waning night showed bleak and cheerless to the earth but cast no mournful or reproving influence over the pagans mind  he looked round on his solitary lurking place and beheld no human figure in its lonely recesses  he looked up at the ramparts and saw that the sentinels stood silent and apart wrapped in their heavy watchcloaks and supported on their trusty weapons  it was perfectly apparent that the events of his night of suffering and despair had passed unheeded by the outer world  he glanced back with a shudder upon his wounded and helpless limb then his eyes fixed themselves upon the wall  after surveying it with an earnest and defiant gaze he slowly moved the brushwood with his foot against the small cavity in its outer surface  days pass wounds heal chances change muttered the old man departing from his haunt with slow and uncertain steps  in the mines i have borne lashes without a murmuri have felt my chains widening with each succeeding day the ulcers that their teeth of iron first gnawed in my flesh and have yet lived to loosen my fetters and to close my sores  shall this new agony have a power to conquer me greater than the others that are past  i will even yet return in time to overcome the resistance of the wall  my arm is crushed but my purpose is whole    chapter 13  the house in the suburbs  retracing some hours we turn from the rifted wall to the suburbs and the country which its ramparts overlook abandoning the footsteps of the maimed and darklyplotting ulpius our attention now fixes itself on the fortunes of hermanric and the fate of antonina  although the evening had as yet scarcely closed the goth had allotted to the warriors under his command their different stations for the night in the lonely suburbs of the city  this duty performed he was left to the unbroken solitude of the deserted tenement which now served him as a temporary abode  the house he occupied was the last of the wide and irregular street in which it stood it looked towards the wall beneath the pincian mount from which it was separated by a public garden about half a mile in extent  this once wellthronged place of recreation was now totally unoccupied  its dull groves were brightened by no human forms the chambers of its gay summer houses were dark and desolate the booths of its fruit and flowersellers stood vacant on its untrodden lawns melancholy and forsaken it stretched forth as a fertile solitude under the very walls of a crowded city   and yet there was a charm inexpressibly solemn and soothing in the prospect of loneliness that it presented as its flowerbeds and trees were now gradually obscured to the eye in the shadows of the advancing night  it gained in its present refinement as much as it had lost of its former gaiety it had its own simple attraction still though it failed to sparkle to the eye with its accustomed illuminations or to please the ear by the music and laughter which rose from it in times of peace  as he looked forth over the view from the terrace of his new abode the remembrance of the employments of his past and busy hours deserted the memory of the young goth leaving his faculties free to welcome the reflections which night began insensibly to awaken and create  employed under such auspices whither would the thoughts of hermanric naturally stray  from the moonlight that already began to ripple over the topmost trembling leaves of the trees beyond him to the delicate and shadowy flowers that twined up the pillars of the deserted terrace where he now stood every object he beheld connected itself to his vivid and uncultured imagination with the one being of whom all that was beautiful in nature seemed to him the eloquent and befitting type  he thought of antonina whom he had once protected of antonina whom he had afterwards abandoned of antonina whom he had now lost  strong in the imaginative and weak in the reasoning faculties gifted with large moral perception and little moral firmness too easy to be influenced and too difficult to be resolved hermanric had deserted the girls interests from an infirmity of disposition rather than from a determination of will  now therefore when the employments of the day had ceased to absorb his attention now when silence and solitude led his memory back to his mornings abandonment of his helpless charge that act of fatal impatience and irresolution inspired him with the strongest emotions of sorrow and remorse  if during her sojourn under his care antonina had insensibly influenced his heart her image now that he reflected on his guilty share in their parting scene filled all his thoughts at once saddening and shaming him as he remembered her banishment from the shelter of his tent  every feeling which had animated his reflections on antonina on the previous night was doubled in intensity as he thought on her now again he recalled her eloquent words and remembered the charm of her gentle and innocent manner again he dwelt on the beauties of her outward form  each warm expression each varying intonation of voice that had accompanied her petition to him for safety and companionship every persuasion that she had used to melt him now revived in his memory and moved in his heart with steady influence and increasing power  all the hurried and imperfect pictures of happiness which she had drawn to allure him now expanded and brightened until his mind began to figure to him visions that had been hitherto unknown to faculties occupied by no other images than those of rivalry turbulence and strife  scenes called into being by antoninas lightest and hastiest expressions now rose vague and shadowy before his brooding spirit  lovely places of earth that he had visited and forgotten now returned to his recollection idealised and refined as he thought of her  she appeared to his mind in every allurement of action fulfilling all the duties and enjoying all the pleasures that she had proposed to him  he imagined her happy and healthful journeying gaily by his side in the fresh morning with rosy cheek and elastic step he imagined her delighting him by her promised songs enlivening him by her eloquent words in the mellow stillness of evening he imagined her sleeping soft and warm and still in his protecting armsever happy and ever gentle girl in years and woman in capacities at once lover and companion teacher and pupil follower and guide  such she might have been once  what was she now   was she sinking under her loneliness perishing from exposure and fatigue repulsed by the cruel or mocked by the unthinking  to all these perils and miseries had he exposed her and to what end  to maintain the uncertain favour to preserve the unwelcome friendship of a woman abandoned even by the most common and intuitive virtues of her sex whose frantic craving for revenge confounded justice with treachery innocence with guilt helplessness with tyranny whose claims of nation and relationship should have been forfeited in his estimation by the openlyconfessed malignity of her designs at the fatal moment when she had communicated them to him in all their atrocity before the walls of rome  he groaned in despair as he thought on this the most unworthy of the necessities to which the forsaken girl had been sacrificed  soon however his mind reverted from such reflections as these to his own duties and his own renown and here his remorse became partially lightened though his sorrow remained unchanged  wonderful as had been the influence of antoninas presence and antoninas words over the goth they had not yet acquired power enough to smother in him entirely the warlike instincts of his sex and nation or to vanquish the strong and hostile promptings of education and custom  she had gifted him with new emotions and awakened him to new thought she had aroused all the dormant gentleness of his disposition to war against the rugged indifference the reckless energy that teaching and example had hitherto made a second nature to his heart she had wound her way into his mind brightening its dark places enlarging its narrow recesses beautifying its unpolished treasures she had created she had refined during her short hours of communication with him but she had not lured his disposition entirely from its old habits and its old attachments she had not yet stripped off the false glitter from barbarian strife or the pomp from martial renown she had not elevated the inferior intellectual to the height of the superior moral faculties in his inward composition  submitted almost impartially to the alternate and conflicting dominion of the two masters love and duty he at once regretted antonina and yet clung mechanically to his old obedience to those tyrannic requirements of nation and name which had occasioned her loss  oppressed by his varying emotions destitute alike of consolation and advice the very inaction of his present position sensibly depressed him  he rose impatiently and buckling on his weapons sought to escape from his thoughts by abandoning the scene under the influence of which they had been first aroused  turning his back upon the city he directed his steps at random through the complicated labyrinth of streets composing the extent of the deserted suburbs  after he had passed through the dwellings comprised in the occupation of the gothic lines and had gained those situated nearer to the desolate country beyond the scene around him became impressive enough to have absorbed the attention of any man not wholly occupied by other and more important objects of contemplation  the loneliness he now beheld on all sides was not the loneliness of ruinthe buildings near him were in perfect repair it was not the loneliness of pestilencethere were no corpses strewn over the untrodden pavements of the streets it was not the loneliness of seclusionthere were no barred windows and few closed doors it was a solitude of human annihilation  the open halls were unapproached the benches before the wineshops were unoccupied remains of gaudy household wares still stood on the counters of the street booths watched by none bought by none particles of bread and meat treasures fated to become soon of greater value than silver and gold to beleaguered rome rotted here in the open air like garbage upon dunghills childrens toys womens ornaments purses money lovetokens precious manuscripts lay scattered hither and thither in the public ways dropped and abandoned by their different owners in the hurry of their sudden and universal flight  every deserted street was eloquent of darling projects desperately resigned of valued labours miserably deserted of delighting enjoyments irretrievably lost  the place was forsaken even by those household gods of rich and poor its domestic animals  they had either followed their owners into the city or strayed unhindered and unwatched into the country beyond  mansion bath and circus displayed their gaudy pomp and luxurious comfort in vain not even a wandering goth was to be seen near their empty halls for with such a prospect before them as the subjugation of rome the army had caught the infection of its leaders enthusiasm for his exalted task and willingly obeyed his commands for suspending the pillage of the suburbs disdaining the comparatively worthless treasures around them attainable at any time when they felt that the rich coffers of rome herself were now fast opening to their eager hands  voiceless and noiseless unpeopled and unravaged lay the farfamed suburbs of the greatest city of the universe sunk alike in the night of nature the night of fortune and the night of glory  saddening and impressive as was the prospect thus presented to the eyes of the young goth it failed to weaken the powerful influence that his evenings meditations yet held over his mind  as during the hours that were passed the image of the forsaken girl had dissipated the remembrance of the duties he had performed and opposed the contemplation of the commands he was yet to fulfil so it now denied to his faculties any impressions from the lonely scene beheld yet unnoticed which spread around him  still as he passed through the gloomy streets his vain regrets and selfaccusations his natural predilections and acquired attachments ruled over him and contended within him as sternly and as unceasingly as in the first moments when they had arisen with the evening during his sojourn in the terrace of the deserted house  he had now arrived at the extremest boundary of the buildings in the suburbs  before him lay an uninterrupted prospect of smooth shining fields and soft hazy indefinable woods  at one side of him were some vineyards and cottage gardens at the other was a solitary house the outermost of all the abodes in his immediate vicinity  dark and cheerless as it was he regarded it for some time with the mechanical attention of a man more occupied in thought than observationgradually advancing towards it in the moody abstraction of his reflections until he unconsciously paused before the low range of irregular steps which led to its entrance door  startled from its meditations by his sudden propinquity to the object that he had unwittingly approached he now for the first time examined the lonely abode before him with real attention  there was nothing remarkable about the house save the extreme desolateness of its appearance which seemed to arise partly from its isolated position and partly from the unusual absence of all decoration on its external front  it was too extensive to have been the dwelling of a poor man too void of pomp and ornament to have been a mansion of the rich  it might perhaps have belonged to some citizen or foreigner or the middle classsome moody northman some solitary egyptian some scheming jew  yet though it was not possessed in itself of any remarkable or decided character the goth experienced a mysterious almost an eager curiosity to examine its interior  he could assign no cause discover no excuse for the act as he slowly mounted the steps before him  some invisible and incomprehensible magnet attracted him to the dwelling  if his return had been suddenly commanded by alaric himself if evidences of indubitable treachery had lurked about the solitary place at the moment when he thrust open its unbarred door he felt that he must still have proceeded upon his onward course  the next instant he entered the house  the light streamed through the open entrance into the gloomy hall the nightwind rushing upon its track blew shrill and dreary among the stone pillars and in the hidden crevices and untenanted chambers above  not a sign of life appeared not a sound of a footstep was audible not even an article of household use was to be seen  the deserted suburbs rose without like a wilderness and this empty house looked within like a sepulchrevoid of corpses and yet eloquent of death  there was an inexplicable fascination to the eyes of the goth about this vaultlike solitary hall he stood motionless at its entrance gazing dreamily at the gloomy prospect before him until a strong gust of wind suddenly forced the outer door further backwards and at the same moment admitted a larger stream of light  the place was not empty  in a corner of the hall hitherto sunk in darkness crouched a shadowy form  it was enveloped in a dark garment and huddled up into an indefinable and unfamiliar shape  nothing appeared on it as a denoting sign of humanity but one pale hand holding the black drapery together and relieved against it in almost ghastly contrast under the cold light of the moon   vague remembrances of the awful superstitions of his nations ancient worship hurried over the memory of the young goth at the first moment of his discovery of the ghostlike occupant of the hall  as he stood in fixed attention before the motionless figure it soon began to be endowed with the same strange influence over his will that the lonely house had already exerted he advanced slowly towards the crouching form  it never stirred at the noise of his approach  the pale hand still held the mantle over the compressed figure with the same rigid immobility of grasp  brave as he was hermanric shuddered as he bent down and touched the bloodless icy fingers  at that action as if endowed with instant vitality from contact with a living being the figure suddenly started up  then the folds of the dark mantle fell back disclosing a face as pale in hue as the stone pillars around it and the voice of the solitary being became audible uttering in faint monotonous accents these words  he has forgotten and abandoned meslay me if you willi am ready to die  broken untuned as it was there yet lurked in that voice a tone of its old music there beamed in that vacant and heavy eye a ray of its native gentleness  with a sudden exclamation of compassion and surprise the goth stepped forward raised the trembling outcast in his arms and in the impulse of the moment quitting the solitary house stood the next instant on the firm earth and under the starry sky once more united to the charge that he had abandonedto antonina whom he had lost  he spoke to her caressed her entreated her pardon assured her of his future care but she neither answered nor recognised him  she never looked in his face never moved in his arms never petitioned for mercy she gave no sign of life or being saving that she moaned at regular intervals in piteous accentshe has forgotten and abandoned me as if that one simple expression comprised in itself her acknowledgment of the uselessness of her life and her dirge for her expected death  the goths countenance whitened to his very lips  he began to fear that her faculties had sunk under her trials  he hurried on with her with trembling steps towards the open country for he nourished a dreamy intuitive hope that the sight of those woods and fields and mountains which she had extolled to him in her mornings entreaty for protection might aid in restoring her suspended consciousness if she now looked on them  he ran forward until he had left the suburbs at least half a mile behind him and had reached an eminence bounded on each side by high grass banks and clustering woods and commanding a narrow yet various prospect of the valley ground beneath and the fertile plains that extended beyond  here the warrior paused with his burden and seating himself on the bank once more attempted to calm the girls continued bewilderment and terror  he thought not on his sentinels whom he had abandonedon his absence from the suburbs which might be perceived and punished by an unexpected visit at his deserted quarters from his superiors in the camp  the social influence that sways the world the fragile idol at whose shrine pride learns to bow and insensibility to feel the soft grateful influence of yielding nature yet eternal rulethe influence of woman source alike of virtues and crimes of earthly glories and earthly disastershad in this moment of anguish and expectation silenced in him every appeal of duty and overthrown every obstacle of selfish doubt  he now spoke to antonina as alluringly as a woman as gently as a child  he caressed her as warmly as a lover as cheerfully as a brother as kindly as a father hethe rough northern warrior whose education had been of arms and whose youthful aspirations had been taught to point towards strife and bloodshed and gloryeven he was now endowed with the tender eloquence of pity and lovewith untiring skilful carewith calm enduring patience   gently and unceasingly he plied his soothing task and soon to his joy and triumph he beheld the approaching reward of his efforts in the slow changes that became gradually perceptible in the girls face and manner  she raised herself in his arms looked up fixedly and vacantly into his face then round upon the bright quiet landscape then back again more stedfastly upon her companion and at length trembling violently she whispered softly and several times the young goths name glancing at him anxiously and apprehensively as if she feared and doubted while she recognised him  you are bearing me to my deathsaid she suddenly  you who once protected meyou who forsook meyou are luring me into the power of the woman who thirsts for my bloodoh it is horriblehorrible  she paused averted her face and shuddering violently disengaged herself from his arms  after an interval she continued  through the long day and in the beginning of the cold night i have waited in one solitary place for the death that is in store for me  i have suffered all the loneliness of my hours of expectation without complaint i have listened with little dread and no grief for the approach of my enemy who has sworn that she will shed my blood  having none to love me and being a stranger in the land of my own nation i have nothing to live for  but it is a bitter misery to me to behold in you the fulfiller of my doom to be snatched by the hand of hermanric from the heritage of life that i have so long struggled to preserve  her voice had altered as she pronounced these words to an impressive lowness and mournfulness of tone  its quiet saddened accents were expressive of an almost divine resignation and sorrow they seemed to be attuned to a mysterious and untraceable harmony with the melancholy stillness of the nightlandscape  as she now stood looking up with pale calm countenance and gentle tearless eyes into the sky whose moonlight brightness shone softly over her form the virgin watching the approach of her angel messenger could hardly have been adorned with a more pure and simple loveliness than now dwelt over the features of numerians forsaken child  no longer master of his agitation filled with awe grief and despair as he looked on the victim of his heartless impatience hermanric bowed himself at the girls feet and in the passionate utterance of real remorse offered up his supplications for pardon and his assurances of protection and love  all that the reader has already learnedthe bitter selfupbraidings of his evening the sorrowful wanderings of his night the mysterious attraction that led him to the solitary house his joy at once more discovering his lost chargeall these confessions he now poured forth in the simple yet powerful eloquence of strong emotion and true regret  gradually and amazedly as she listened to his words antonina awoke from her abstraction even the expression of his countenance and the earnestness of his manner viewed by the intuitive penetration of her sex wrought with kind and healing influence on her mind  she started suddenly a bright flush flew over her colourless cheeks she bent down and looked earnestly and wistfully into the goths face  her lips moved but her quick convulsive breathing stifled the words that she vainly endeavoured to form  yes continued hermanric rising and drawing her towards him again you shall never mourn never fear never weep more  though you have lost your father and the people of your nation are as strangers to you though you have been threatened and forsaken you shall still be beautifulstill be happy for i will watch you and you shall never be harmed i will labour for you and you shall never want  people and kindredfame and duty i will abandon them all to make atonement to you  its youthful freshness and hope returned to the girls heart as water to the longparched spring when the young warrior ceased  the tears stood in her eyes but she neither sighed nor spoke her frame trembled all over with the excess of her astonishment and delight as she still steadfastly looked on him and still listened intently as he proceeded   fear then no longer for your safetygoisvintha whom you dread is far from us she knows not that we are here she cannot track our footsteps now to threaten or to harm you  remember no more how you have suffered and i have sinned  think only how bitterly i have repented our mornings separation and how gladly i welcome our meeting of tonight  oh antonina you are beautiful with a wondrous loveliness you are young with a perfected and unchildlike youth your words fall upon my ear with the music of a song of the olden time it is like a dream of the spirits that my fathers worshipped when i look up and behold you at my side  an expression of mingled confusion pleasure and surprise flushed the girls halfaverted countenance as she listened to the goth  she rose with a smile of ineffable gratitude and delight and pointed to the prospect beyond as she softly rejoined  let us go a little further onward where the moonlight shines over the meadow below  my heart is bursting in this shadowy place  let us seek the light that is yonder it seems happy like me  they walked forward and as they went she told him again of the sorrows of her past day of her lonely and despairing progress from his tent to the solitary house where he had found her in the night and where she had resigned herself from the first to meet a death that had little horror for her then  there was no thought of reproach no utterance of complaint in this renewal of her melancholy narration it was solely that she might luxuriate afresh in those delighting expressions of repentance and devotion which she knew that it would call forth from the lips of hermanric that she now thought of addressing him once more with the tale of her grief  as they still went onward as she listened to the rude fervent eloquence of the language of the goth as she looked on the deep repose of the landscape and the soft transparency of the night sky her mind ever elastic under the shock of the most violent emotions ever ready to regain its wonted healthfulness and hopenow recovered its old tone and reassumed its accustomed balance  again her memory began to store itself with its beloved remembrances and her heart to rejoice in its artless longings and visionary thoughts  in spite of all her fears and all her sufferings she now walked on blest in a disposition that woe had no shadow to darken long and neglect no influence to warp still as happy in herself even yet as forgetful of her past as hopeful for her future as on that first evening when we beheld her in her fathers garden singing to the music of her lute  insensibly as they proceeded they had diverged from the road had entered a byepath and now stood before a gate which led to a small farm house surrounded by its gardens and vineyards and like the suburbs that they had quitted deserted by its inhabitants on the approach of the goths  they passed through the gate and arriving at the plot of ground in front of the house paused for a moment to look around them  the meadows had been already stripped of their grass and the young trees of their branches by the foragers of the invading army but here the destruction of the little property had been stayed the house with its neat thatched roof and shutters of variegated wood the garden with its small stock of fruit and its carefully tended beds of rare flowers designed probably to grace the feast of a nobleman or the statue of a martyr had presented no allurements to the rough tastes of alarics soldiery  not a mark of a footstep appeared on the turf before the house door the ivy crept in its wonted luxuriance about the pillars of the lowly porch and as hermanric and antonina walked towards the fishpond at the extremity of the garden the few waterfowl placed there by the owners of the cottage came swimming towards the bank as if to welcome in their solitude the appearance of a human form   far from being melancholy there was something soothing and attractive about the loneliness of the deserted farm  its ravaged outhouses and plundered meadows which might have appeared desolate by day were so distanced softened and obscured by the atmosphere of night that they presented no harsh contrast to the prevailing smoothness and luxuriance of the landscape around  as antonina beheld the brightened fields and the shadowed woods here mingled there succeeding each other stretched far onward and onward until they joined the distant mountains that eloquent voice of nature whose audience is the human heart and whose theme is eternal love spoke inspiringly to her attentive senses  she stretched out her arms as she looked with steady and enraptured gaze upon the bright view before her as if she longed to see its beauties resolved into a single and living forminto a spirit human enough to be addressed and visible enough to be adored  beautiful earth she murmured softly to herself thy mountains are the watchtowers of angels thy moonlight is the shadow of god  her eyes filled with bright happy tears she turned to hermanric who stood watching her and continued  have you never thought that light and air and the perfume of flowers might contain some relics of the beauties of eden that escaped with eve when she wandered into the lonely world they glowed and breathed for her and she lived and was beautiful in them  they were united to one another as the sunbeam is united to the earth that it warms and could the sword of the cherubim have sundered them at once when eve went forth did the closed gates shut back in the empty paradise all the beauty that had clung and grown and shone round her  did no ray of her native light steal forth after her into the desolateness of the world  did no print of her lost flowers remain on the bosom they must once have pressed  it cannot be  a part of her possessions of eden must have been spared to her with a part of her life  she must have refined the void air of the earth when she entered it with a breath of the fragrant breezes and gleam of the truant sunshine of her lost paradise  they must have strengthened and brightened and must now be strengthening and brightening with the slow lapse of mortal years until in the time when earth itself will be an eden they shall be made one again with the hidden world of perfection from which they are yet separated  so that even now as i look forth over the landscape the light that i behold has in it a glow of paradise and this flower that i gather a breath of the fragrance that once stole over the senses of my first mother eve  though she paused here as if in expectation of an answer the goth preserved an unbroken silence  neither by nature nor position was he capable of partaking the wild fancies and aspiring thoughts drawn by the influences of the external world from their concealment in antoninas heart  the mystery of his present situation his vague remembrance of the duties he had abandoned the uncertainty of his future fortunes and future fate the presence of the lonely being so inseparably connected with his past emotions and his existence to come so strangely attractive by her sex her age her person her misfortunes and her endowments all contributed to bewilder his faculties  goisvintha the army the besieged city the abandoned suburbs seemed to hem him in like a circle of shadowy and threatening judgments and in the midst of them stood the young denizen of rome with her eloquent countenance and her inspiring words ready to hurry him he knew not whither and able to influence him he felt not how  unconsciously interpreting her companions silence into a wish to change the scene and the discourse antonina after lingering over the view from the garden for a moment longer led the way back towards the untenanted house  they removed the wooden padlock from the door of the dwelling and guided by the brilliant moonlight entered its principal apartment   the homely adornments of the little room had remained undisturbed and dimly distinguishable though they now were gave it to the eyes of the two strangers the same aspect of humble comfort which had probably once endeared it to its exiled occupants  as hermanric seated himself by antoninas side on the simple couch which made the principal piece of furniture in the place and looked forth from the window over the same view that they had beheld in the garden the magic stillness and novelty of the scene now began to affect his slow perceptions as they had already influenced the finer and more sensitive faculties of the thoughtful girl  new hopes and tranquil ideas arose in his young mind and communicated an unusual gentleness to his expression an unusual softness to his voice as he thus addressed his silent companion  with such a home as this with this garden with that country beyond with no warfare no stern teachers no enemy to threaten you with companions and occupations that you lovedtell me antonina would not your happiness be complete  as he looked round at the girl to listen to her reply he saw that her countenance had changed their past expression of deep grief had again returned to her features  her eyes were fixed on the short dagger that hung over the goths breast which seemed to have suddenly aroused in her a train of melancholy and unwelcome thoughts  when she at length spoke it was in a mournful and altered voice and with a mingled expression of resignation and despair  you must leave mewe must be parted again said she the sight of your weapons has reminded me of all that until now i had forgotten of all that i have left in rome of all that you have abandoned before the city walls  once i thought we might have escaped together from the turmoil and the danger around us but now i know that it is better that you should depart alas for my hopes and my happiness i must be left alone once more  she paused for an instant struggling to retain her selfpossession and then continued  yes you must quit me and return to your post before the city for in the day of assault there will be none to care for my father but you until i know that he is safe until i can see him once more and ask him for pardon and entreat him for love i dare not remove from the perilous precincts of rome  return then to your duties and your companions and your occupations of martial renown and do not forget numerian when the city is assailed nor antonina who is left to think on you in the solitary plains  she rose from her place as if to set the example of departing but her strength and resolution both failed her and she sank down again on the couch incapable of making another movement or uttering another word  strong and conflicting emotions passed over the heart of the goth  the language of the girl had quickened the remembrance of his halfforgotten duties and strengthened the failing influence of his old predilections of education and race  both conscience and inclination now opposed his disputing her urgent and unselfish request for a few minutes he remained in deep reflection then he rose and looked earnestly from the window then back again upon antonina and the room they occupied  at length as if animated by a sudden determination he again approached his companion and thus addressed her  it is right that i should return  i will do your bidding and depart for the camp but not till the break of day while you antonina remain in concealment and in safety here  none can come hither to disturb you  the goths will not revisit the fields they have already stripped the husbandman who owns this dwelling is imprisoned in the beleaguered city the peasants from the country beyond dare not approach so near to the invading hosts and goisvintha whom you dread knows not even of the existence of such a refuge as this  here though lonely you will be secure here you can await my return when each succeeding night gives me the opportunity of departing from the camp and here i will warn you beforehand if the city is devoted to an assault  though solitary you will not be abandonedwe shall not be parted one from the other often and often i shall return to look on you and to listen to you and to love you  you will be happier here even in this lonely place than in the former home that you have lost through your fathers wrath   oh  i will willingly remaini will joyfully await you cried the girl raising her beaming eyes to hermanrics face  i will never speak mournfully to you again i will never remind you more of all that i have suffered and all that i have lost  how merciful you were to me when i first saw you in your tenthow doubly merciful you are to me here  i am proud when i look on your stature and your strength and your heavy weapons and know that you are happy in remaining with me that you will succour my father that you will return from your glittering encampments to this farmhouse where i am left to await you  already i have forgotten all that has happened to me of woe already i am more joyful than ever i was in my life before  see i am no longer weeping in sorrow  if there are any tears still on my cheeks they are the tears of gladness that every one welcomestears to sing and rejoice in  she ceased abruptly as if words failed to give expression to her new delight  all the gloomy emotions that had oppressed her but a short time before had now completely vanished and the young fresh heart superior still to despair and woe basked as happily again in its native atmosphere of joy as a bird in the sunlight of morning and spring  then when after an interval of delay their former tranquility had returned to them how softly and lightly the quiet hours of the remaining night flowed onward to the two watchers in the lonely house how gladly the delighted girl disclosed her hidden thoughts and poured forth her innocent confessions to the dweller among other nations and the child of other impressions than her own all the various reflections aroused in her mind by the natural objects she had secretly studied by the mighty imagery of her bible lore by the gloomy histories of saints visions and martyrs sufferings which she had learnt and pondered over by her fathers side were now drawn from their treasured places in her memory and addressed to the ear of the goth  as the child flies to the nurse with the story of its first toy as the girl resorts to the sister with the confession of her first love as the poet hurries to the friend with the plan of his first composition so did antonina seek the attention of hermanric with the first outward revealings enjoyed by her faculties and the first acknowledgment of her emotions liberated from her heart  the longer the goth listened to her the more perfect became the enchantment of her words half struggling into poetry and her voice half gliding into music  as her low still varying tones wound smoothly into his ear his thoughts suddenly and intuitively reverted to her formerly expressed remembrances of her lost lute inciting him to ask her with new interest and animation of the manner of her acquisition of that knowledge of song which she had already assured him that she possessed  i have learned many odes of many poets said she quickly and confusedly avoiding the mention of vetranio which a direct answer to hermanrics question must have produced but i remember none perfectly save those whose theme is of spirits and of other worlds and of the invisible beauty that we think of but cannot see  of the few that i know of these there is one that i first learned and loved most  i will sing it that you may be assured i will not fail to you in my promised art  she hesitated for a moment  sorrowful remembrances of the events that had followed the utterance of the last notes she sang in her fathers garden swelled within her and held her speechless  soon however after a short interval of silence she recovered her selfpossession and began to sing in low tremulous tones that harmonised well with the character of the words and the strain of the melody which she had chosen  the mission of the tear   i      the skies were its birthplacethe tear was the child     of the dark maiden sorrow by young joy beguild     it was born in convulsion twas nurturd in woe     and the world was yet young when it wanderd below   ii      no angelbright guardians watchd over its birth     ere yet it was sufferd to roam upon earth     no spirits of gladness its soft form caressd     sighs mourned round its cradle and hushd it to rest   iii      though joy might endeavour with kisses and wiles     to lure it away to his household of smiles     from the daylight he lived in it turnd in affright     to nestle with sorrow in climates of night   iv      when it came upon earth twas to choose a career     the brightest and best that is left to a tear     to hallow delight and bestow the relief     denied by despair to the fulness of grief   v      few repelld itsome blessd itwherever it came     whether softning their sorrow or soothing their shame     and the joyful themselves though its name they might fear     oft welcomd the calming approach of the tear   vi      years on years have worn onward aswatchd from above     speeds that meek spirit yet on its labour of love     still the exile of heavn it neer shall away     every heart has a home for it roam where it may  for the first few minutes after she had concluded the ode hermanric was hardly conscious that she had ceased and when at length she looked up at him her mute petition for approval had an eloquence which would have been marred to the goth at that moment by the utterance of single word a rapture an inspiration a new life moved within him  the hour and the scene completed what the magic of the song had begun  his expression now glowed with a southern warmth his words assumed a roman fervour  gradually as they discoursed the voice of the girl was less frequently audible  a change was passing over her spirit from the teacher she was now becoming the pupil  as she still listened to the goth as she felt the birth of new feelings within her while he spoke her cheeks glowed her features lightened up her very form seemed to freshen and expand  no intruding thought or awakening remembrance disturbed her rapt attention  no cold doubt no gloomy hesitation appeared in her companions words  the one listened the other spoke with the whole heart the undivided soul  while a worldwide revolution was concentrating its hurricane forces around them while the city of an empire tottered already to its tremendous fall while goisvintha plotted new revenge while ulpius toiled for his revolution of bloodshed and ruin while all these dark materials of public misery and private strife seethed and strengthened around them they could as completely forget the stormy outward world in themselves they could think as serenely of tranquil love the kiss could be given as passionately and returned as tenderly as if the lot of their existence had been cast in the pastoral days of the shepherd poets and the future of their duties and enjoyments was securely awaiting them in a land of eternal peace    chapter 14  the famine  the end of november is approaching  nearly a month has elapsed since the occurrence of the events mentioned in the last chapter yet still the gothic lines stretch round the city walls  rome that we left haughty and luxurious even while ruin threatened her at her gates has now suffered a terrible and warning change  as we approach her again woe horror and desolation have already gone forth to shadow her lofty palaces and to darken her brilliant streets   over pomp that spurned it over pleasure that defied it over plenty that scared it in its secret rounds the spectre hunger has now risen triumphant at last  day by day has the citys insufficient allowance of food been more and more sparingly doled out higher and higher has risen the value of the coarsest and simplest provision the hoarded supplies that pity and charity have already bestowed to cheer the sinking people have reached their utmost limits  for the rich there is still corn in the citytreasure of food to be bartered for treasure of gold  for the poor mans natural nourishment exists no more the season of famines loathsome feasts the first days of the sacrifice of choice to necessity have darkly and irretrievably begun  it is morning  a sad and noiseless throng is advancing over the cold flagstones of the great square before the basilica of st john lateran the members of the assembly speak in whispers the weak are tearfulthe strong are gloomythey all move with slow and languid gait and hold in their arms their dogs or other domestic animals  on the outskirts of the crowd march the enfeebled guards of the city grasping in their rough hands rare favourite birds of gaudy plumage and melodious note and followed by children and young girls vainly and piteously entreating that their favourites may be restored  this strange procession pauses at length before a mighty caldron slung over a great fire in the middle of the square round which stand the city butchers with bare knives and the trustiest men of the roman legions with threatening weapons  a proclamation is then repeated commanding the populace who have no money left to purchase food to bring up their domestic animals to be boiled together over the public furnace for the sake of contributing to the public support  the next minute in pursuance of this edict the dumb favourites of the crowd passed from the owners caressing hand into the butchers ready grasp  the faint cries of the animals starved like their masters mingled for a few moments with the sobs and lamentations of the women and children to whom the greater part of them belonged  for in this the first stage of their calamities that severity of hunger which extinguishes pity and estranges grief was unknown to the populace and though fast losing spirit they had not yet sunk to the depths of ferocious despair which even now were invisibly opening between them a thousand pangs were felt a thousand humble tragedies were acted in the brief moments of separation between guardian and charge  the child snatched its last kiss of the bird that had sung over its bed the dog looked its last entreaty for protection from the mistress who had once never met it without a caress  then came the short interval of agony and death then the steam rose fiercely from the greedy caldron and then the people for a time dispersed the sorrowful to linger near the confines of the fire and the hungry to calm their impatience by a visit to the neighbouring church  the marble aisles of the noble basilica held a gloomy congregation three small candles were alone lighted on the high altar  no sweet voices sang melodious anthems or exulting hymns the monks in hoarse tones and monotonous harmonics chanted the penitential psalms  here and there knelt a figure clothed in mourning robes and absorbed in secret prayer but over the majority of the assembly either blank despondency or sullen inattention universally prevailed  as the last dull notes of the last psalm died away among the lofty recesses of the church a procession of pious christians appeared at the door and advanced slowly to the altar  it was composed both of men and women barefooted clothed in black garments and with ashes scattered over their dishevelled hair  tears flowed from their eyes and they beat their breasts as they bowed their foreheads on the marble pavement of the altar steps   this humble public expression of penitence under the calamity that had now fallen on the city was however confined only to its few really religious inhabitants and commanded neither sympathy nor attention from the heartless and obstinate population of rome  some still cherished the delusive hope of assistance from the court at ravenna others believed that the goths would ere long impatiently abandon their protracted blockade to stretch their ravages over the rich and unprotected fields of southern italy  but the same blind confidence in the lost terrors of the roman name the same fierce and reckless determination to defy the goths to the very last sustained the sinking courage and suppressed the despondent emotions of the great mass of the suffering people from the beggar who prowled for garbage to the patrician who sighed over his new and unwelcome nourishment of simple bread  while the penitents who formed the procession above described were yet engaged in the performance of their unnoticed and unshared duties of penance and prayer a priest ascended the great pulpit of the basilica to attempt the ungrateful task of preaching patience and piety to the hungry multitude at his feet  he began his sermon by retracing the principal occurrences in rome since the beginning of the gothic blockade  he touched cautiously upon the first event that stained the annals of the besieged citythe execution of the widow of the roman general stilicho on the unauthorised suspicion that she had held treasonable communication with alaric and the invading army he noticed lengthily the promises of assistance transmitted from ravenna after the perpetration of that illomened act he spoke admiringly of the skill displayed by the government in making the necessary and immediate reductions in the daily supplies of food he lamented the terrible scarcity which followed too inevitably those seasonable reductions  he pronounced an eloquent eulogium on the noble charity of laeta the widow of the emperor gratian who with her mother devoted the store of provisions obtained by their imperial revenues to succouring at that important juncture the starving and desponding poor  he admitted the new scarcity consequent on the dissipation of laetas stores deplored the present necessity of sacrificing the domestic animals of the citizens condemned the enormous prices now demanded for the last remnants of wholesome food that were garnered up announced it as the firm persuasion of every one that a few days more would bring help from ravenna and ended his address by informing his auditory that as they had suffered so much already they could patiently suffer a little more and that if after this they were so illfated as to sink under their calamities they would feel it a noble consolation to die in the cause of catholic and apostolic rome and would assuredly be canonised as saints and martyrs by the next generation of the pious in the first interval of fertile and restoring peace  flowing as was the eloquence of this oration it yet possessed not the power of inducing one among those whom it addressed to forget the sensation of his present suffering and to fix his attention on the vision of future advantage spread before all listeners by the fluent priest  with the same murmurs of querulous complaint and the same expressions of impotent hatred and defiance of the goths which had fallen from them as they entered the church the populace now departed from it to receive from the city officers the stinted allowance of repugnant food prepared for their hunger from the caldron in the public square  and see already from other haunts in the neighbouring quarter of rome their fellowcitizens press onward at the given signal to meet them round the caldrons sides  the languid sentinel released from duty turns his gaze from the sickening prospect of the gothic camp and hastens to share the public meal the baker starts from sleeping on his empty counter the beggar rises from his kennel in the butchers vacant outhouse the slave deserts his place by the smouldering kitchenfireall hurry to swell the numbers of the guests that are bidden to the wretched feast rapidly and confusedly the congregation in the basilica pours through its lofty gates the priests and penitents retire from the altars foot and in the great church so crowded but a few moments before there now only remains the figure of a solitary man   since the commencement of the service neither addressed nor observed this lonely being has faltered round the circle of the congregation gazing long and wistfully over the faces that met his view  now that the sermon is ended and the last lingerer has quitted the church he turns from the spot whence he has anxiously watched the different members of the departing throng and feebly crouches down on his knees at the base of a pillar that is near him  his eyes are hollow and his cheeks are wan his thin grey hairs are few and fading on his aged head he makes no effort to follow the crowd and partake their sustenance no one is left behind to urge no one returns to lead him to the public meal  though weak and old he is perfectly forsaken in his loneliness perfectly unsolaced in his grief his friends have lost all trace of him his enemies have ceased to fear or to hate him now as he crouches by the pillar alone he covers his forehead with his pale palsied hands his dim eyes fill with bitter tears and such expressions as these are ever and anon faintly audible in the intervals of his heavy sighs  day after day  day after day  and my lost one is not found my loved and wronged one is not restored  antonina antonina  some days after the public distribution of food in the square of st john lateran vetranios favourite freedman might have been observed pursuing his way homeward sadly and slowly to his masters palace  it was not without cause that the pace of the intelligent carrio was funereal and his expression disconsolate  even during the short period that had elapsed since the scene in the basilica already described the condition of the city had altered fearfully for the worse  the famine advanced with giant strides every succeeding hour endued it with new vigour every effort to repel it served but to increase its spreading and overwhelming influence  one after another the pleasures and pursuits of the city declined beneath the dismal oppression of the universal ill until the public spirit in rome became moved alike in all classes by one gloomy inspirationa despairing defiance of the famine and the goths  the freedman entered his masters palace neither saluted nor welcomed by the once obsequious slaves in the outer lodge  neither harps nor singingboys neither womans ringing laughter nor mans bacchanalian glee now woke the echoes in the lonely halls  the pulse of pleasure seemed to have throbbed its last in the joyless being of vetranios altered household  hastening his steps as he entered the mansion carrio passed into the chamber where the senator awaited him  on two couches separated by a small table reclined the lord of the palace and his pupil and companion at ravenna the once sprightly camilla  vetranios open brow had contracted a clouded and severe expression and he neither regarded nor addressed his visitor who on her part remained as silent and as melancholy as himself  every trace of the former characteristics of the gay elegant voluptuary and the lively prattling girl seemed to have completely vanished on the table between them stood a large bottle containing falernian wine and a vase filled with a little watery soup in the middle of which floated a small dough cake sparingly sprinkled with common herbs  as for the usual accompaniments of vetranios luxurious privacy they were nowhere to be seen  poems pictures trinkets lutes all were absent  even the inestimable kitten of the breed most worshipped by the ancient egyptians appeared no more  it had been stolen cooked and eaten by a runaway slave who had already bartered its ruby collar for a lean parrot and the unroasted half of the carcase of a dog  i lament to confess it o estimable patron but my mission has failed observed carrio producing from his cloak several bags of money and boxes of jewels which he carefully deposited on the table the prefect has himself assisted in searching the public and private granaries and has arrived at the conclusion that not a handful of corn is left in the city  i offered publicly in the marketplace five thousand sestertii for a living cock and hen but was told that the race had long since been exterminated and that as money would no longer buy food money was no longer desired by the poorest beggar in rome  there is no more even of the hay i yesterday purchased to be obtained for the most extravagant bribes  those still possessing the smallest supplies of provision guard and hide them with the most jealous care  i have done nothing but obtain for the consumption of the few slaves who yet remain faithful in the house this small store of dogs hides reserved from the public distribution of some days since in the square of the basilica of st john   and the freedman with an air of mingled triumph and disgust produced as he spoke his provision of dirty skins  what supplies have we still left in our possession demanded vetranio after drinking a deep draught of the falernian and motioning his servant to place his treasured burden out of sight  i have hidden in a secure receptacle for i know not how soon hunger may drive the slaves to disobedience rejoined carrio seven bags of hay three baskets stocked with salted horseflesh a sweetmeatbox filled with oats and another with dried parsley the rare indian singing birds are still preserved inviolate in their aviary there is a great store of spices and some bottles of the nightingale sauce yet remain  what is the present aspect of the city interrupted vetranio impatiently  rome is as gloomy as a subterranean sepulchre replied carrio with a shudder  the people congregate in speechless and hungry mobs at the doors of their houses and the corners of the streets the sentinels at the ramparts totter on their posts women and children are sleeping exhausted on the very pavements of the churches the theatres are emptied of actors and audience alike the baths resound with cries for food and curses on the goths thefts are already committed in the open and unguarded shops and the barbarians remain fixed in their encampments unapproached by our promised legions from ravenna neither assaulting us in our weakness nor preparing to raise the blockade our situation grows more and more perilous  i have great hopes in our store of provisions but  cast your hopes to the court at ravenna and your beasts provender to the howling mob cried vetranio with sudden energy  it is now too late to yield if the next few days bring us no assistance the city will be a human shambles  and think you that i who have already lost in this public suspension of social joys my pleasures my employments and my companions will wait serenely for the lingering and ignoble death that must then threaten us all  no it shall never be said that i died starving with the herd like a slave that his master deserts though the plates in my banqueting hall must now be empty my vases and winecups shall yet sparkle for my guests  there is still wine in the cellar and spices and perfumes remain in the larder stores  i will invite my friends to a last feast a saturnalia in a city of famine a banquet of death spread by the jovial labours of silenus and his fauns though the parcae have woven for me the destiny of a dog it is the hand of bacchus that shall sever the fatal thread  his cheeks were flushed his eyes sparkled all the mad energy of his determination appeared in his face as he spoke  he was no longer the light amiable smoothtongued trifler but a moody reckless desperate man careless of every obligation and pursuit which had hitherto influenced the easy surface of his patrician life  the startled camilla who had as yet preserved a melancholy silence ran towards him with affrighted looks and undissembled tears  carrio stared in vacant astonishment on his masters disordered countenance and forgetting his bundle of dogskins suffered them to drop unheeded on the floor  a momentary silence followed which was suddenly interrupted by the abrupt entrance of a fourth person pale trembling and breathless who was no other than vetranios former visitor the prefect pompeianus  i bid you welcome to my approaching feast of brimming winecups and empty dishes cried vetranio pouring the sparkling falernian into his empty glass  the last banquet given in rome ere the city is annihilated will be mine  the goths and the famine shall have no part in my death pleasure shall preside at my last moments as it has presided at my whole life  i will die like sardanapalus with my loves and my treasures around me and the last of my guests who remains proof against our festivity shall set fire to my palace as the kingly assyrian set fire to his   this is no season for jesting exclaimed the prefect staring round him with bewildered eyes and colourless cheeks  our miseries are but dawning as yet  in the next street lies the corpse of a woman andhorrible omena coil of serpents is wreathed about her neck  we have no burialplace to receive her and the thousands who may die like her ere assistance arrives  the city sepulchres outside the walls are in the hands of the goths  the people stand round the body in a trance of horror for they have now discovered a fatal truth we would fain have concealed from them here the prefect paused looked round affrightedly on his listeners and then added in low trembling tones  the citizens are lying dead from famine in the streets of rome    chapter 15  the city and the gods  we return once more to the gothic encampment in the suburbs eastward of the pincian gate and to hermanric and the warriors under his command who are still posted at that particular position on the great circle of the blockade  the movements of the young chieftain from place to place expressed in their variety and rapidity the restlessness that was agitating his mind  he glanced back frequently from the warriors around him to the remote and opposite quarter of the suburbs occasionally directing his eyes towards the western horizon as if anxiously awaiting the approach of some particular hour of the coming night weary at length of pursuing occupations which evidently irritated rather than soothed his impatience he turned abruptly from his companions and advancing towards the city paced slowly backwards and forwards over the waste ground between the suburbs and the walls of rome  at intervals he still continued to examine the scene around him  a more dreary prospect than now met his view whether in earth or sky can hardly be conceived  the dull sunless day was fast closing and the portentous heaven gave promise of a stormy night thick black layers of shapeless cloud hung over the whole firmament save at the western point and here lay a streak of pale yellow light enclosed on all sides by the firm ungraduated irregular edges of the masses of gloomy vapour around it a deep silence hung over the whole atmosphere the wind was voiceless among the steady trees  the stir and action in the being of nature and the life of man seemed enthralled suspended stifled  the air was laden with a burdensome heat and all things on earth animate and inanimate felt the oppression that weighed on them from the higher elements  the people who lay gasping for breath in the faminestricken city and the blades of grass that drooped languidly on the dry sward beyond the walls owned the enfeebling influence alike  as the hours wore on and night stealthily and gradually advanced a monotonous darkness overspread one after another the objects discernible to hermanric from the solitary ground he still occupied soon the great city faded into one vast impenetrable shadow while the suburbs and the low country around them vanished in the thick darkness that gathered almost perceptibly over the earth  and now the sole object distinctly visible was the figure of a weary sentinel who stood on the frowning rampart immediately above the rifted wall and whose drooping figure propped upon his weapon was indicated in hard relief against the thin solitary streak of light still shining in the cold and cloudy wastes of the western sky  but as the night still deepened this one space of light faded contracted vanished and with it disappeared the sentinel and the line of rampart on which he was posted  the rule of the darkness now became universal  densely and rapidly it overspread the whole city with startling suddenness as if the fearful destiny now working its fulfilment in rome had forced the external appearances of the night into harmony with its own woeboding nature   then as the young goth still lingered at his post of observation the long low tremulous absorbing roll of thunder afar off became grandly audible  it seemed to proceed from a distance almost incalculable to be sounding from its cradle in the frozen north to be journeying about its icegirdled chambers in the lonely poles  it deepened rather than interrupted the dreary mysterious stillness of the atmosphere  the lightning too had a summer softness in its noiseless and frequent gleam  it was not the fierce lightning of winter but a warm fitful brightness almost fascinating in its light rapid recurrence tinged with the glow of heaven and not with the glare of hell  there was no windno rain and the air was as hushed as if it slept over chaos in the infancy of a new creation  among the various objects displayed instant by instant by the rapid lightning to the eyes of hermanric the most easily and most distinctly visible was the broad surface of the rifted wall  the large loose stones scattered here and there at its base and the overhanging lid of its broad rampart became plainly though fitfully apparent in the brief moments of their illumination  the lightning had played for some time over that structure of the fortifications and the bare ground that stretched immediately beyond them when the smooth prospect which it thus gave by glimpses to view was suddenly chequered by a flight of birds appearing from one of the lower divisions of the wall and flitting uneasily to and fro at one spot before its surface  as moment after moment the lightning continued to gleam so the black forms of the birds were visible to the practised eye of the gothperceptible yet evanescent as sparks of fire or flakes of snowwhirling confusedly and continually about the spot whence they had evidently been startled by some unimaginable interruption  at length after a lapse of some time they vanished as suddenly as they had appeared with shrill notes of affright which were audible even above the continuous rolling of the thunder and immediately afterwards when the lightning alternated with the darkness there appeared to hermanric in the part of the wall where the birds had been first disturbed a small red gleam like a spark of fire lodged in the surface of the structure  then this was lost a longer obscurity than usual prevailed in the atmosphere and when the goth gazed eagerly through the next succession of flashes they showed him the momentary and doubtful semblance of a human figure standing erect on the stones at the base of the wall  hermanric started with astonishment  again the lightning ceased  in the ardour of his anxiety to behold more he strained his eyes with the vain hope of penetrating the obscurity around him  the darkness seemed interminable  once again the lightning flashed brilliantly out  he looked eagerly towards the wallthe figure was still there  his heart throbbed quickly within him as he stood irresolute on the spot he had occupied since the first peal of thunder had struck upon his ear  were the light and the manone seen but for an instant the other still perceptiblemere phantoms of his erring sight dazzled by the quick recurrence of atmospheric changes through which it had acted or did he indubitably behold a human form and had he really observed a material light  some strange treachery some dangerous mystery might be engendering in the besieged city which it would be his duty to observe and unmask  he drew his sword and at the risk of being observed through the lightning and heard during the pauses in the thunder by the sentinel on the wall resolutely advanced to the very foot of the fortifications of hostile rome  he heard no sound perceived no light observed no figure as after several unsuccessful attempts to reach the place where they stood he at length paused at the loose stones which he knew were heaped at the base of the wall  the next moment he was so close to it that he could pass his swordpoint over parts of its rugged surface  he had scarcely examined thus a space of more than ten yards before his weapon encountered a sharp jagged edge and a sudden presentiment assured him instantly that he had found the spot where he had beheld the momentary light and that he stood on the same stone which had been occupied by the figure of the man   after an instants hesitation he was about to mount higher on the loose stones and examine more closely the irregularity he had just discovered in the wall when a vivid flash of lightning unusually prolonged showed him obstructing at scarcely a yards distance his onward path the figure he had already distantly beheld from the plain behind  there was something inexpressibly fearful in his viewless vicinity during the next moment of darkness to this silent mysterious form so imperfectly shown by the lightning that quivered over its halfrevealed proportions  every pulse in the body of the goth seemed to pause as he stood with ready weapon looking into the gloomy darkness and wafting for the next flash  it came and displayed to him the mans fierce eyes glaring steadily down upon his face another gleam and he beheld his haggard finger placed upon his lip in token of silence a third and he saw the arm of the figure pointing towards the plain behind him and then in the darkness that followed a hot breath played upon his ear and a voice whispered to him through a pause in the rolling of the thunderfollow me  the next instant hermanric felt the momentary contact of the mans body as with noiseless steps he passed him on the stones  it was no time to deliberate or to doubt  he followed close upon the strangers footsteps gaining glimpses of his dark form moving onward before whenever the lightning briefly illuminated the scene until they arrived at a clump of trees not far distant from the houses in the suburbs that were occupied by the goths under his own command  here the stranger paused before the trunk of a tree which stood between the city wall and himself and drew from beneath his ragged cloak a small lantern carefully covered with a piece of cloth which he now removed and holding the light high above his head regarded the goth with a steady and anxious scrutiny  hermanric attempted to address him first but the appearance of the man barely visible though it was by the feeble light of his lantern was so startling and repulsive that the halfformed words died away on his lips  the face of the stranger was of a ghastly paleness his hollow cheeks were seamed with deep wrinkles and his eyes glared with an expression of ferocious suspicion  one of his arms was covered with old bandages stiff with coagulated blood and hung paralysed at his side the hand that held the light trembled so that the lantern containing it vibrated continuously in his unsteady grasp  his limbs were lank and shrivelled almost to deformity and it was with evident difficulty that he stood upright on his feet  every member of his body seemed to be wasting with a gradual death while his expression ardent and forbidding was stamped with all the energy of manhood and all the daring of youth  it was ulpius  the wall was passed  the breach was made good  after a protracted examination of hermanrics countenance and attire the man with an imperious expression strangely at variance with his faltering voice thus addressed him  you are a goth  i am rejoined the young chief and you are  a friend of the goths was the quick answer  an instant of silence followed  the dialogue was then again begun by the stranger  what brought you alone to the base of the ramparts he demanded and an expression of ungovernable apprehension shot from his eyes as he spoke  i saw the appearance of a man in the gleam of the lightning answered hermanric  i approached it to assure myself that my eyes had not deluded me to discover   there is but one man of your nation who shall discover whence i came and what i would obtain interrupted the stranger fiercely that man is alaric your king  surprise indignation and contempt appeared in the features of the goth as he listened to such a declaration from the helpless outcast before him  the man perceived it and motioning him to be silent again addressed him  listen cried he  i have that to reveal to the leader of your forces which will stir the heart of every man in your encampment if you are trusted with the secret after your king has heard it from my lips do you still refuse to guide me to his tent  hermanric laughed scornfully  look on me pursued the man bending forward and fixing his eyes with savage earnestness upon his listeners face  i am alone old wounded weaka stranger to your nationa famished and a helpless man should i venture into your campshould i risk being slain for a roman by your comradesshould i dare the wrath of your imperious ruler without a cause  he paused and then still keeping his eyes on the goth continued in lower and more agitated tones  deny me your help i will wander through your camp till i find your king  imprison me your violence will not open my lips  slay me you will gain nothing by my death  but aid me and to the latest moment of your life you will rejoice in the deed  i have words of terrible import for alarics eara secret in the gaining of which i have paid the penalty thus  he pointed to his wounded arm  the solemnity of his voice the rough energy of his words the stern determination of his aspect the darkness of the night that was round them the rolling thunder that seemed to join itself to their discourse the impressive mystery of their meeting under the city walls all began to exert their powerful and different influences over the mind of the goth changing insensibly the sentiments at first inspired in him by the mans communications he hesitated and looked round doubtfully towards the lines of the camp  there was a long silence which was again interrupted by the stranger  guard me chain me mock at me if you will he cried with raised voice and flashing eyes but lead me to alarics tent  i swear to you by the thunder pealing over our heads that the words i would speak to him will be more precious in his eyes than the brightest jewel he could ravish from the coffers of rome  though visibly troubled and impressed hermanric still hesitated  do you yet delay exclaimed the man with contemptuous impatience stand back  i will pass on by myself into the very heart of your camp i entered on my project alonei will work its fulfilment without help stand back  and he moved past hermanric in the direction of the suburbs with the same look of fierce energy on his withered features which had marked them so strikingly at the outset of his extraordinary interview with the young chieftain   the daring devotion to his purpose the reckless toiling after a dangerous and doubtful success manifested in the words and actions of one so feeble and unaided as the stranger aroused in the goth that sentiment of irrepressible admiration which the union of moral and physical courage inevitably awakens  in addition to the incentive to aid the man thus created an ardent curiosity to discover his secret filled the mind of hermanric and further powerfully inclined him to conduct his determined companion into alarics presencefor by such proceeding only could he hope after the mans firm declaration that he would communicate in the first instance to no one but the king to penetrate ultimately the object of his mysterious errand  animated therefore by such motives as these he called to the stranger to stop and briefly communicated to him his willingness to conduct him instantly to the presence of the leader of the goths  the man intimated by a sign his readiness to accept the offer  his physical powers were now evidently fast failing but he still tottered painfully onward as they moved to the headquarters of the camp muttering and gesticulating to himself almost incessantly  once only did he address his conductor during their progress and then with a startling abruptness of manner and in tones of vehement anxiety and suspicion he demanded of the young goth if he had ever examined the surface of the city wall before that night  hermanric replied in the negative and they then proceeded in perfect silence  their way lay through the line of encampment to the westward and was imperfectly lighted by the flame of an occasional torch or the glow of a distant watchfire  the thunder had diminished in frequency but had increased in volume faint breaths of wind soared up fitfully from the west and already a few raindrops fell slowly to the thirsty earth the warriors not actually on duty at the different posts of observation had retired to the shelter of their tents none of the thousand idlers and attendants attached to the great army appeared at their usual haunts even the few voices that were audible sounded distant and low the nightscene here among the ranks of the invaders of italy was as gloomy and repelling as on the solitary plains before the walls of rome  ere long the stranger perceived that they had reached a part of the camp more thickly peopled more carefully illuminated more strongly fortified than that through which they had already passed and the liquid rushing sound of the waters of the rapid tiber now caught his suspicious and attentive ear  they still moved onward a few yards and then paused suddenly before a tent immediately surrounded by many others and occupied at all its approaches by groups of richlyarmed warriors here hermanric stopped an instant to parley with the sentinel who after a short delay raised the outer covering of the entrance to the tent and the moment after the roman adventurer beheld himself standing by his conductors side in the presence of the gothic king  the interior of alarics tent was lined with skins and illuminated by one small lamp fastened to the centre pole that supported its roof the only articles of furniture in the place were some bundles of furs flung down loosely on the ground and a large rudelycarved wooden chest on which stood a polished human skull hollowed into a sort of clumsy winecup  a thoroughly gothic ruggedness of aspect a stately northern simplicity prevailed over the spacious tent and was indicated not merely in its thick shadows its calm lights and its freedom from pomp and glitter but even in the appearance and employment of its remarkable occupant   alaric was seated alone on the wooden chest already described contemplating with bent brow and abstracted gaze some old runic characters traced upon the carved surface of a brass and silver shield full five feet high which rested against the side of the tent the light of the lamp falling upon the polished surface of the weaponrendered doubly bright by the dark skins behind itwas reflected back upon the figure of the goth chief  it glowed upon his ample cuirass it revealed his firm lips slightly curled by an expression of scornful triumph it displayed the grand muscular formation of his arm which restedclothed in tightlyfitting leatherupon his knee it partly brightened over his short light hair and glittered steadily in his fixed thoughtful manly eyes which were just perceptible beneath the partial shadow of his contracted brow while it left the lower part of his body and his right hand which was supported on the head of a huge shaggy dog couching at his side shadowed almost completely by the thick skins heaped confusedly against the sides of the wooden chest  he was so completely absorbed in the contemplation of the runic characters traced among the carved figures on his immense shield that he did not notice the entry of hermanric and the stranger until the growl of the watchful dog suddenly disturbed him in his occupation  he looked up instantly his quick penetrating glance dwelling for a moment on the young chieftain and then resting steadily and inquiringly on his companions feeble and mutilated form  accustomed to the military brevity and promptitude exacted by his commander in all communications addressed to him by his inferiors hermanric without waiting to be interrogated or attempting to preface or excuse his narrative shortly related the conversation that had taken place between the stranger and himself on the plain near the pincian gate and then waited respectfully to receive the commendation or incur the rebuke of the king as the chance of the moment might happen to decide  after again fixing his eyes in severe scrutiny on the person of the roman alaric spoke to the young warrior in the gothic language thus  leave the man with mereturn to your post and there await whatever commands it may be necessary that i should despatch to you tonight  hermanric immediately departed  then addressing the stranger for the first time and speaking in the latin language the gothic leader briefly and significantly intimated to his unknown visitant that they were now alone  the mans parched lips moved opened quivered his wild hollow eyes brightened till they absolutely gleamed but he seemed incapable of uttering a word his features became horribly convulsed the foam gathered about his lips he staggered forward and would have fallen to the ground had not the king instantly caught him in his strong grasp and placed him on the wooden chest that he had hitherto occupied himself  can a starving roman have escaped from the beleaguered city muttered alaric as he took the skull cup and poured some of the wine it contained down the strangers throat  the liquor was immediately successful in restoring composure to the mans features and consciousness to his mind  he raised himself from the seat dashed off the cold perspiration that overspread his forehead and stood upright before the kingthe solitary powerless old man before the vigorous lord of thousands in the midst of his warriorswithout a tremor in his steady eye or a prayer for protection on his haughty lip  i a roman he began come from rome against which the invader wars with the weapon of famine to deliver the city her people her palaces and her treasures into the hands of alaric the goth  the king started looked on the speaker for a moment and then turned from him in impatience and contempt  i lie not pursued the enthusiast with a calm dignity that affected even the hardy sensibilities of the gothic hero  eye me again  could i come starved shrivelled withered thus from any place but rome since i quitted the city an hour has hardly passed and by the way that i left it the forces of the goths may enter it tonight  the proof of the harvest is in the quantity of the grain not in the tongue of the husbandman  show me your open gates and i will believe that you have spoken truth retorted the king with a rough laugh  i betray the city resumed the man sternly but on one condition grant it me and  i will grant you your life interrupted alaric haughtily   my life cried the roman and his shrunken form seemed to expand and his tremulous voice to grow firm and steady in the very bitterness of his contempt as he spoke  my life  i ask it not of your power  the wreck of my body is scarce strong enough to preserve it to me a single day  i  have no home no loves no friends no possessions  i live in rome a solitary in the midst of the multitude a pagan in a city of apostates  what is my life to me  i cherish it but for the service of the gods whose instruments of vengeance against the nation that has denied them i would make you and your hosts  if you slay me it is a sign to me from them that i am worthless in their cause i shall die content  he ceased  the kings manner as he listened to him gradually lost the bluntness and carelessness that had hitherto characterised it and assumed an attention and a seriousness more in accordance with his high station and important responsibilities  he began to regard the stranger as no common renegade no ordinary spy no shallow impostor who might be driven from his tent with disdain but as a man important enough to be heard and ambitious enough to be distrusted accordingly he resumed the seat from which he had risen during the interview and calmly desired his new ally to explain the condition on the granting of which depended the promised betrayal of the city of rome  the painworn and despondent features of ulpius became animated by a glow of triumph as he heard the sudden mildness and moderation of the kings demand he raised his head proudly and advanced a few steps as he thus loudly and abruptly resumed  assure to me the overthrow of the christian churches the extermination of the christian priests and the universal revival of the worship of the gods and this night shall make you master of the chief city of the empire you are labouring to subvert  the boldness the comprehensiveness the insanity of wickedness displayed in such a proposition and emanating from such a source so astounded the mind of alaric as to deprive him for the moment of speech  the stranger perceiving his temporary inability to answer him broke the silence which ensued and continued  is my condition a hard one  a conqueror is allpowerful he can overthrow the worship as he can overthrow the government of a nation what matters it to you while empire renown and treasure are yours what deities the people adore  is it a great price to pay for an easy conquest to make a change which threatens neither your power your fame nor your wealth  do you marvel that i  desire from you such a revolution as this  i was born for the gods in their service i inherited rank and renown for their cause i have suffered degradation and woe for their restoration i will plot combat die  assure me then by oath that with a new rule you will erect our ancient worship and through my secret inlet to the city i will introduce men enough of the goths to murder with security the sentinels at the guardhouses and open the gates of rome to the numbers of your whole invading forces think not to despise the aid of a man unprotected and unknown the citizens will never yield to your blockade you shrink from risking the dangers of an assault the legions of ravenna are reported on their way hitherward  outcast as i am i tell it to you here in the midst of your campyour speediest assurance of success rests on my discovery and on me  the king started suddenly from his seat  what fool or madman he cried fixing his eyes in furious scorn and indignation on the strangers face prates to me about the legions of ravenna and the dangers of an assault  think you renegade that your city could have resisted me had i chosen to storm it on the first day when i encamped before its walls  know you that your effeminate soldiery have laid aside the armour of their ancestors because their puny bodies are too feeble to bear its weight and that the half of my army here trebles the whole number of the guards of rome  now while you stand before me i have but to command and the city shall be annihilated with fire and sword without the aid of one of the herd of traitors cowering beneath the shelter of its illdefended walls   as alaric spoke thus some invisible agency seemed to crush body and mind the lost wretch whom he addressed  the shock of such an answer as he now heard seemed to strike him idiotic as a flash of lightning strikes with blindness  he regarded the king with a bewildered stare waving his hand tremulously backwards and forwards before his face as if to clear some imaginary darkness off his eyes then his arm fell helpless by his side his head drooped upon his breast and he moaned out in low vacant tones the restoration of the godsthat is the condition of conquestthe restoration of the gods  i come not hither to be the tool of a frantic and forgotten priesthood cried alaric disdainfully  wherever i meet with your accursed idols i will melt them down into armour for my warriors and shoes for my horses i will turn your temples into granaries and cut your images of wood into billets for the watchfires of my hosts  slay me and be silent groaned the man staggering back against the side of the tent and shrinking under the merciless words of the goth like a slave under the lash  i leave the shedding of such blood as yours to your fellow romans answered the king they alone are worthy of the deed  no syllable of reply now escaped the strangers lips and after an interval of silence alaric resumed in tones divested of their former fiery irritation and marked by a solemn earnestness that conferred irresistible dignity and force on every word that he uttered  behold the characters engraven there said he pointing to the shield they trace the curse denounced by odin against the great oppressor rome  once these words made part of the worship of our fathers the worship has long since vanished but the words remain they seal the eternal hatred of the people of the north to the people of the south they contain the spirit of the great destiny that has brought me to the walls of rome  citizen of a fallen empire the measure of your crimes is full  the voice of a new nation calls through me for the freedom of the earth which was made for man and not for romans  the rule that your ancestors won by strength their posterity shall no longer keep by fraud  for two hundred years hollow and unlasting truces have alternated with long and bloody wars between your people and mine remembering this remembering the wrongs of the goths in their settlements in thrace the murder of the gothic youths in the towns of asia the massacre of the gothic hostages in aquileia i comechosen by the supernatural decrees of heavento assure the freedom and satisfy the wrath of my nation by humbling at its feet the power of tyrannic rome  it is not for battle and bloodshed that i am encamped before yonder walls  it is to crush to the earth by famine and woe the pride of your people and the spirit of your rulers to tear from you your hidden wealth and to strip you of your boasted honour to overthrow by oppression the oppressors of the world to deny you the glories of a resistance and to impose on you the shame of a submission  it is for this that i now abstain from storming your city to encircle it with an immovable blockade  as the declaration of his great mission burst thus from the lips of the gothic king the spirit of his lofty ambition seemed to diffuse itself over his outward form  his noble stature his fine proportions his commanding features became invested with a simple primeval grandeur contrasted as he now was with the shrunken figure of the spiritbroken stranger he looked almost sublime   a succession of protracted shuddering ran through the pagans frame but he neither wept nor spoke  the unavailing defence of the temple of serapis the defeated revolution at alexandria and the abortive intrigue with vetranio were now rising on his memory to heighten the horror of his present and worst overthrow  every circumstance connected with his desperate passage through the rifted wall revived fearfully vivid on his mind  he remembered all the emotions of his first nights labour in the darkness all the miseries of his second nights torture under the fallen brickwork all the woe danger and despondency that accompanied his subsequent toilpersevered in under the obstructions of a famineweakened body and a helpless armuntil he passed in delusive triumph the last of the hindrances in the longlaboured breach  one after another these banished recollections returned to his memory as he listened to alarics rebuking wordsreviving past infirmities opening old wounds inflicting new lacerations  but saving the shudderings that still shook his body no outward witness betrayed the inward torment that assailed him  it was too strong for human words too terrible for human sympathyhe suffered it in brute silence monstrous as was his plot the moral punishment of its attempted consummation was severe enough to be worthy of the projected crime  after watching the man for a few minutes more with a glance of pitiless disdain alaric summoned one of the warriors in attendance and having previously commanded him to pass the word to the sentinels authorising the strangers free passage through the encampment he then turned and for the last time addressed him as follows  return to rome through the hole whence reptilelike you emergedand feed your starving citizens with the words you have heard in the barbarians tent  the guard approached led him from the presence of the king issued the necessary directions to the sentinels and left him to himself  once he raised his eyes in despairing appeal to the heaven that frowned over his head but still no word or tear or groan escaped him  he moved slowly on through the thick darkness and turning his back on the city passed careless whither he strayed into the streets of the desolate and dispeopled suburbs    chapter 16  love meetings  who that has looked on a threatening and tempestuous sky has not felt the pleasure of discovering unexpectedly a small spot of serene blue still shining among the stormy clouds  the more unwillingly the eye has wandered over the gloomy expanse of the rest of the firmament the more gladly does it finally rest on the little oasis of light which meets at length its weary gaze and which when it was dispersed over the whole heaven was perhaps only briefly regarded with a careless glance contrasted with the dark and mournful hues around it even that small spot of blue gradually acquires the power of investing the wider and sadder prospect with a certain interest and animation that it did not before possessuntil the mind recognises in the surrounding atmosphere of storm an object adding variety to the viewa spectacle whose mournfulness may interest as well as repel  was it with sensations resembling these applied however rather to the mind than to the eye that the reader perused those pages devoted to hermanric and antonina  does the happiness there described now appear to him to beam through the stormy progress of the narrative as the spot of blue beams through the gathering clouds  did that small prospect of brightness present itself at the time like a garden of repose amid the waste of fierce emotions which encompassed it  did it encourage him when contrasted with what had gone before to enter on the field of gloomier interest which was to follow  if indeed it has thus affected him if he can still remember the scene at the farmhouse beyond the suburbs with emotions such as these he will not now be unwilling to turn again for a moment from the gathering clouds to the spot of bluehe will not deny us an instants digression from ulpius and the city of famine to antonina and the lonely plains  during the period that has elapsed since we left her antonina has remained secure in her solitude happy in her wellchosen concealment the few straggling goths who at rare intervals appeared in the neighbourhood of her sanctuary never intruded on its peaceful limits the sight of the ravaged fields and emptied granaries of the deserted little property sufficed invariably to turn their marauding steps in other directions  day by day ran smoothly and swiftly onwards for the gentle usurper of the abandoned farmhouse  in the narrow round of its gardens and protecting woods was comprised for her the whole circle of the pleasures and occupations of her new life   the simple stores left in the house the fruits and vegetables to be gathered in the garden sufficed amply for her support  the pastoral solitude of the place had in it a quiet dreamy fascination a novelty an unwearying charm after the austere loneliness to which her former existence had been subjected in rome  and when evening came and the sun began to burnish the tops of the western tress then after the calm emotions of the solitary day came the hour of absorbing cares and happy expectationsever the same yet ever delighting and ever new then the rude shutters were carefully closed the open door was shut and barred the small lightnow invisible to the world withoutwas joyfully kindled and then the mistress and author of these preparations resigned herself to await with pleased anxiety the approach of the guest for whose welcome they were designed  and never did she expect the arrival of that treasured companion in vain  hermanric remembered his promise to repair constantly to the farmhouse and performed it with all the constancy of love and all the enthusiasm of youth  when the sentinels under his command were arranged in their order of watching for the night and the trust reposed in him by his superiors exempted his actions from superintendence during the hours of darkness that followed he left the camp passed through the desolate suburbs and gained the dwelling where the young roman awaited himreturning before daybreak to receive the communications regularly addressed to him at that hour by his inferior in the command  thus false to his nation yet true to the new egeria of his thoughts and actionstraitor to the requirements of vengeance and war yet faithful to the interests of tranquility and lovedid he seek night after night antoninas presence  his passion though it denied him to his warrior duties wrought not deteriorating change in his disposition all that it altered in him it altered nobly  it varied and exalted his rude emotions for it was inspired not alone by the beauty and youth that he saw but by the pure thoughts the artless eloquence that he heard  and shethe forsaken daughter the source whence the northern warrior derived those new and higher sensations that had never animated him until nowregarded her protector her first friend and companion as her first love with a devotion which in its mingled and exalted nature may be imagined by the mind but can be but imperfectly depicted by the pen  it was a devotion created of innocence and gratitude of joy and sorrow of apprehension and hope it was too fresh too unworldly to own any upbraidings of artificial shame any selfreproaches of artificial propriety  it resembled in its essence though not in its application the devotion of the first daughters of the fall to their brotherlords  but it is now time that we return to the course of our narrative although ere we again enter on the stirring and rapid present it will be necessary for a moment more to look back in another direction to the eventful past  but it is not on peace beauty and pleasure that our observation now fixes itself it is to anger disease and crimeto the unappeasable and unwomanly goisvintha that we now revert  since the day when the violence of her conflicting emotions had deprived her of consciousness at the moment of her decisive triumph over the scruples of hermanric and the destiny of antonina a raging fever had visited on her some part of those bitter sufferings that she would fain have inflicted on others  part of the time she lay in a raving delirium part of the time in helpless exhaustion but she never forgot whatever the form assumed by her disease the desperate purpose in the pursuit of which she had first incurred it  slowly and doubtfully her vigour at length returned to her and with it strengthened and increased the fierce ambition of vengeance that absorbed her lightest thoughts and governed her most careless actions   report informed her of the new position on the line of blockade on which hermanric was posted and only enumerated as the companions of his sojourn the warriors sent thither under his command but though thus persuaded of the separation of antonina and the goth her ignorance of the girls fate rankled unintermittingly in her savage heart  doubtful whether she had permanently reclaimed hermanric to the interests of vengeance and bloodshed vaguely suspecting that he might have informed himself in her absence of antoninas place of refuge or direction of flight still resolutely bent on securing the death of her victim wherever she might have strayed she awaited with trembling eagerness that day of restoration to available activity and strength which would enable her to resume her influence over the goth and her machinations against the safety of the fugitive girl the time of her final and longexpected recovery was the very day preceding the stormy night we have already described and her first employment of her renewed energy was to send word to the young goth of her intention of seeking him at his encampment ere the evening closed  it was this intimation which caused the inquietude mentioned as characteristic of the manner of hermanric at the commencement of the preceding chapter  the evening there described was the first that saw him deprived through the threatened visit of goisvintha of the anticipation of repairing to antonina as had been his wont under cover of the night for to slight his kinswomans ominous message was to risk the most fatal of discoveries  trusting to the delusive security of her sickness he had hitherto banished the unwelcome remembrance of her existence from his thoughts  but now that she was once more capable of exertion and of crime he felt that if he would preserve the secret of antoninas hidingplace and the security of antoninas life he must remain to oppose force to force and stratagem to stratagem when goisvintha sought him at his post even at the risk of inflicting by his absence from the farmhouse all the pangs of anxiety and apprehension on the lonely girl  absorbed in such reflections as these longing to depart yet determined to remain he impatiently awaited goisvinthas approach until the rising of the storm with its mysterious and allengrossing train of events forced his thoughts and actions into a new channel when however his interviews with the stranger and the gothic king were past and he had returned as he had been bidden to his appointed sojourn in the camp his old anxieties displaced but not destroyed resumed their influence over him  he demanded eagerly of his comrades if goisvintha had arrived in his absence and received the same answer in the negative from each  as he now listened to the melancholy rising of the wind and the increasing loudness of the thunder to the shrill cries of the distant nightbirds hurrying to shelter emotions of mournfulness and awe possessed themselves of his heart  he now wondered that any events however startling however appalling should have had the power to turn his mind for a moment from the dreary contemplations that had engaged it at the close of day  he thought of antonina solitary and helpless listening to the tempest in affright and watching vainly for his longdelayed approach  his fancy arrayed before him dangers plots and crimes robed in all the horrible exaggerations of a dream  even the quick monotonous dripping of the raindrops outside aroused within him dark and indefinable forebodings of ill  the passion that had hitherto created for him new pleasures was now fulfilling the other half of its earthly mission and causing him new pains  as the storm strengthened as the darkness lowered deeper and deeper so did his inquietude increase until at length it mastered the last feeble resistance of his wavering firmness  persuading himself that after having delayed so long goisvintha would now refrain from seeking him until the morrow and that all communications from alaric had they been despatched would have reached him ere this unable any longer to combat his anxiety for the safety of antonina determined to risk the worst possibilities rather than be absent at such a time of tempest and peril from the farmhouse he made a last visit to the stations of the watchful sentinels and quitted the camp for the night    chapter 17  the huns  more than an hour after hermanric had left the encampment a man hurriedly entered the house set apart for the young chieftains occupation  he made no attempt to kindle either light or fire but sat down in the principal apartment occasionally whispering to himself in a strange and barbarous tongue   he had remained but a short time in possession of his comfortless solitude when he was intruded on by a campfollower bearing a small lamp and followed closely by a woman who as he started up and confronted her announced herself as hermanrics kinswoman and eagerly demanded an interview with the goth  haggard and ghastly though it was from recent suffering and long agitation the countenance of goisvintha for it was she appeared absolutely attractive as it was now opposed by the lamplight to the face and figure of the individual she addressed  a flat nose a swarthy complexion long coarse tangled locks of deep black hair a beardless retreating chin and small savage sunken eyes gave a character almost bestial to this mans physiognomy  his broad brawny shoulders overhung a form that was as low in stature as it was athletic in build you looked on him and saw the sinews of a giant strung in the body of a dwarf  and yet this deformed hercules was no solitary error of natureno extraordinary exception to his fellowbeings but the actual type of a whole race stunted and repulsive as himself  he was a hun  this savage people the terror even of their barbarous neighbours living without government laws or religion possessed but one feeling in common with the human racethe instinct of war  their historical career may be said to have begun with their early conquests in china and to have proceeded in their first victories over the goths who regarded them as demons and fled at their approach  the hostilities thus commenced between the two nations were at length suspended by the temporary alliance of the conquered people with the empire and subsequently ceased in the gradual fusion of the interests of each in one animating spiritdetestation of rome  by this bond of brotherhood the goths and the huns became publicly united though still privately at enmityfor the one nation remembered its former defeats as vividly as the other remembered its former victories  with various disasters dissensions and successes they ran their career of battle and rapine sometimes separate sometimes together until the period of our romance when alarics besieging forces numbered among the ranks of their barbarian auxiliaries a body of huns who unwillingly admitted to the title of gothic allies were dispersed about the army in subordinate stations and of whom the individual above described was one of those contemptuously favoured by promotion to an inferior command under hermanric as a gothic chief  an expression of aversion but not of terror passed over goisvinthas worn features as she approached the barbarian and repeated her desire to be conducted to hermanrics presence  for the second time however the man gave her no answer  he burst into a shrill short laugh and shook his huge shoulders in clumsy derision  the womans cheek reddened for an instant and then turned again to livid paleness as she thus resumed  i came not hither to be mocked by a barbarian but to be welcomed by a goth  again i ask you where is my kinsman hermanric  gone cried the hun  and his laughter grew more wild and discordant as he spoke  a sudden tremor ran through goisvinthas frame as she marked the manner of the barbarian and heard his reply  repressing with difficulty her anger and agitation she continued with apprehension in her eyes and entreaty in her tones  whither has he gone  wherefore has he departed  i know that the hour i appointed for our meeting here has long passed but i have suffered a sickness of many weeks and when at evening i prepared to set forth my banished infirmities seemed suddenly to return to me again  i was borne to my bed  but though the woman who succoured me bid me remain and repose i found strength in the night to escape them and through storm and darkness to come hither alonefor i was determined though i should perish for it to seek the presence of hermanric as i had promised by my messengers  you that are the companion of his watch must know whither he is gone  go to him and tell him what i have spoken  i will await his return   his business is secret sneered the hun  he has departed but without telling me whither  how should i that am a barbarian know the whereabouts of an illustrious goth  it is not for me to know his actions but to obey his words  jeer not about your obedience returned goisvintha with breathless eagerness  i say to you again you know whither he is gone and you must tell me for what he has departed  you obey himthere is money to make you obey me  when i said his business was secret i lied not said the hun picking up with avidity the coins she flung to himbut he has not kept it secret from me  the huns are cunning  aha ugly and cunning  suspicion the only refined emotion in a criminal heart half discovered to goisvintha at this moment the intelligence that was yet to be communicated  no word however escaped her while she signed the barbarian to proceed  he has gone to a farmhouse on the plains beyond the suburbs behind us he will not return till daybreak continued the hun tossing his money carelessly in his great horny hands  did you see him go gasped the woman  i tracked him to the house returned the barbarian  for many nights i watched and suspected himtonight i saw him depart  it is but a short time since i returned from following him  the darkness did not delude me the place is on the highroad from the suburbsthe first bypath to the westward leads to its garden gate  i know it  i have discovered his secret  i am more cunning than he  for what did he seek the farmhouse at night demanded goisvintha after an interval during which she appeared to be silently fixing the mans last speech in her memory are you cunning enough to tell me that  for what do men venture their safety and their lives their money and their renown laughed the barbarian  they venture them for women there is a girl at the farmhouse i saw her at the door when the chief went in  he paused but goisvintha made no answer  remembering that she was descended from a race of women who slew their wounded husbands brothers and sons with their own hands when they sought them after battle dishonoured by a defeat remembering that the fire of the old ferocity of such ancestors as these still burnt at her heart remembering all that she had hoped from hermanric and had plotted against antonina estimating in all its importance the shock of the intelligence she now received we are alike unwilling and unable to describe her emotions at this moment  for some time the stillness in the room was interrupted by no sounds but the rolling of the thunder without the quick convulsive respiration of goisvintha and the clinking of the money which the hun still continued to toss mechanically from hand to hand  i shall reap good harvest of gold and silver after tonights work pursued the barbarian suddenly breaking the silence  you have given me money to speakwhen the chief returns and hears that i have discovered him he will give me money to be silent  i shall drink tomorrow with the best men in the army hun though i am  he returned to his seat as he ceased and began beating in monotonous measure with one of his pieces of money on the blade of his sword some chorus of a favourite drinking song while goisvintha standing pale and breathless near the door of the chamber looked down on him with fixed vacant eyes  at length a deep sigh broke from her her hands involuntarily clenched themselves at her side her lips moved with a bitter smile then without addressing another word to the hun she turned and softly and stealthily quitted the room   the instant she was gone a sudden change arose in the barbarians manner  he started from his seat a scowl of savage hatred and triumph appeared on his shaggy brows and he paced to and fro through the chamber like a wild beast in his cage  i shall tear him from the pinnacle of his power at last he whispered fiercely to himself  for what i have told her this night his kinswoman will hate himi knew it while she spoke  for his desertion of his post alaric may dishonour him may banish him may hang him  his fate is at my mercy i shall rid myself nobly of him and his command more than all the rest of his nation i loathe this goth  i will be by when they drag him to the tree and taunt him with his shame as he has taunted me with my deformity here he paused to laugh in complacent approval of his project quickening his steps and hugging himself joyfully in the barbarous exhilaration of his triumph  his secret meditations had thus occupied him for some time longer when the sound of a footstep was audible outside the door  he recognised it instantly and called softly to the person without to approach  at the signal of his voice a man enteredless athletic in build but in deformity the very counterpart of himself  the following discourse was then immediately held between the two huns the newcomer beginning it thus  have you tracked him to the door  to the very threshold  then his downfall is assured  i have seen alaric  we shall trample him under our feetthis boy who has been set over us that are his elders because he is a goth and we are huns  but what of alaric  how did you gain his ear  the goths round his tent scoffed at me as a savage and swore that i was begotten between a demon and a witch  but i remembered the time when these boasters fled from their settlements when our tribes mounted their black steeds and hunted them like beasts  aha their very lips were pale with fear in those days  speak of alaricour time is short interrupted the other fiercely  i answered not a word to their taunts resumed his companion but i called out loudly that i was a gothic ally that i brought messages to alaric and that i had the privilege of audience like the rest my voice reached the ears of the king  he looked forth from his tent and beckoned me in  i saw his hatred of my nation lowering in his eye as we looked on one another but i spoke with submission and in a soft voice i told him how his chieftain whom he had set over us secretly deserted his post i told him how we had seen his favoured warrior for many nights journeying towards the suburbs  how on this night as on others before he had stolen from the encampment and how you had gone forth to track him to his lurkingplace  was the tyrant angered  his cheeks reddened and his eyes flashed and his fingers trembled round the hilt of his sword while i spoke  when i ceased he answered me that i lied  he cursed me for an infidel hun who had slandered a christian chieftain  he threatened me with hanging  i cried to him to send messengers to our quarters to prove the truth ere he slew me  he commanded a warrior to return hither with me  when we arrived the most christian chieftain was nowhere to be beheldnone knew whither he had gone  we turned back again to the tent of the king his warrior whom he honoured spoke the same words to him as the hun whom he despised then the wrath of alaric rose  this very night he cried did i with my own lips direct him to await my commands with vigilance at his appointed post  i would visit such disobedience with punishment on my own son  go take with you others of your troopyour comrade who has tracked him will guide you to his hidingplacebring him prisoner into my tent  such were his words  our companions wait us withoutlest he should escape let us depart without delay   and if he should resist us cried the other leading the way eagerly towards the door what said the king if he should resist us  slay him with your own hands    chapter 18  the farmhouse  as the night still advanced so did the storm increase  on the plains in the open country its violence was most apparent  here no living voices jarred with the dreary music of the elements no flaming torches opposed the murky darkness or imitated the glaring lightning  the thunder pursued uninterruptedly its tempest symphony and the fierce wind joined it swelling into wild harmony when it rushed through the trees as if in their waving branches it struck the chords of a mighty harp  in the small chamber of the farmhouse sat together hermanric and antonina listening in speechless attention to the increasing tumult of the storm  the room and its occupants were imperfectly illuminated by the flame of a smouldering wood fire the little earthenware lamp hung from its usual place in the ceiling but its oil was exhausted and its light was extinct  an alabaster vase of fruit lay broken by the side of the table from which it had fallen unnoticed to the floor  no other articles of ornament appeared in the apartment  hermanrics downcast eyes and melancholy unchanging expressions betrayed the gloomy abstraction in which he was absorbed  with one hand clasped in his and the other resting with her head on his shoulder antonina listened attentively to the alternate rising and falling of the wind  her beauty had grown fresher and more womanlike during her sojourn at the farmhouse  cheerfulness and hope seemed to have gained at length all the share in her being assigned to them by nature at her birth  even at this moment of tempest and darkness there was more of wonder and awe than of agitation and affright in her expression as she sat hearkening with flushed cheek and brightened eye to the progress of the nocturnal storm  thus engrossed by their thoughts hermanric and antonina remained silent in their little retreat until the reveries of both were suddenly interrupted by the snapping asunder of the bar of wood which secured the door of the room the stress of which as it bent under the repeated shocks of the wind the rotten spar was too weak to sustain any longer there was something inexpressibly desolate in the flood of rain wind and darkness that seemed instantly to pour into the chamber through the open door as it flew back violently on its frail hinges antonina changed colour and shuddered involuntarily as hermanric hastily rose and closed the door again by detaching its rude latch from the sling which held it when not wanted for use  he looked round the room as he did so for some substitute for the broken bar but nothing that was fit for the purpose immediately met his eye and he muttered to himself as he returned impatiently to his seat  while we are here to watch it the latch is enough it is new and strong  he seemed on the point of again relapsing into his former gloom when the voice of antonina arrested his attention and aroused him for the moment from his thoughts  is it in the power of the tempest to make you a warrior of a race of heroes thus sorrowful and sad she asked in accents of gentle reproach  even i as i look on these walls that are so eloquent of my happiness and sit by you whose presence makes that happiness can listen to the raging storm and feel no heaviness over my heart  what is there to either of us in the tempest that should oppress us with gloom  does not the thunder come from the same heaven as the sunshine of the summer day you are so young so generous so braveyou have loved and pitied and succoured mewhy should the night language of the sky cast such sorrow and such silence over you  it is not from sorrow that i am silent replied hermanric with a constrained smile but from weariness with much toil in the camp   he stifled a sigh as he spoke  his head returned to its old downcast position  the struggle between his assumed carelessness and his real inquietude was evidently unequal  as she looked fixedly on him with the vigilant eye of affection the girls countenance saddened with his she nestled closer to his side and resumed the discourse in anxious and entreating tones  it is haply the strife between our two nations which has separated us already and may separate us again that thus oppresses you said she but think as i do of the peace that must come and not of the warfare that now is  think of the pleasures of our past days and of the happiness of our present momentsthus united thus living loving hoping for each other and like me you will doubt not of the future that is in preparation for us both  the season of tranquillity may return with the season of spring  the serene heaven will then be reflected on a serene country and a happy people and in those days of sunshine and peace will any hearts among all the glad population be more joyful than ours  she paused a moment  some sudden thought or recollection heightened her colour and caused her to hesitate ere she proceeded  she was about at length to continue when a peal of thunder louder than any which had preceded it burst threateningly over the house and drowned the first accents of her voice  the wind moaned loudly the rain splashed against the door the latch rattled long and sharply in its socket once more hermanric rose from his seat and approaching the fire placed a fresh log of wood upon the dying embers  his dejection seemed now to communicate itself to antonina and as he reseated himself by her side she did not address him again  thoughts dreary and appalling beyond any that had occupied it before were rising in the mind of the goth  his inquietude at the encampment in the suburbs was tranquillity itself compared to the gloom which now oppressed him  all the evaded dues of his nation his family and his calling all the suppressed recollections of the martial occupation he had slighted and the martial enmities he had disowned now revived avengingly in his memory  yet vivid as these remembrances were they weakened none of those feelings of passionate devotion to antonina by which their influence within him had hitherto been overcome  they existed with themthe old recollections with the new emotionsthe stern rebukings of the warriors nature with the anxious forebodings of the lovers heart  and now his mysterious meeting with ulpius goisvinthas unexpected return to health the dreary rising and furious progress of the night tempest began to impress his superstitious mind as a train of unwonted and meaning incidents destined to mark the fatal return of his kinswomans influence over his own actions and antoninas fate  one by one his memory revived with laborious minuteness every incident that had attended his different interviews with the roman girl from the first night when she had strayed into his tent to the last happy evening that he had spent with her at the deserted farmhouse  then tracing further backwards the course of his existence he figured to himself his meeting with goisvintha among the italian alps his presence at the death of her last child and his solemn engagement on hearing her recital of the massacre at aquileia to avenge her on the romans with his own hands  roused by these opposite pictures of the past his imagination peopled the future with images of antonina again endangered afflicted and forsaken with visions of the impatient army spurred at length into ferocious action making universal havoc among the people of rome and forcing him back for ever into their avenging ranks  no decision for resistance or resignation to flight presented itself to his judgment  doubt despair and apprehension held unimpeded sway over his impressible but inactive faculties  the night itself as he looked forth on it was not more dark the wild thunder as he listened to it not more gloomy the name of goisvintha as he thought on it not more ominous of evil than the sinister visions that now startled his imagination and oppressed his weary mind   there was something indescribably simple touching and eloquent in the very positions of hermanric and antonina as they now sat togetherthe only members of their respective nations who were united in affection and peacein the lonely farmhouse  both the girls hands were clasped over hermanrics shoulder and her head rested on them turned from the door towards the interior of the room and so displaying her rich black hair in all its luxuriance  the head of the goth was still sunk on his breast as though he were wrapped in a deep sleep and his hands hung listlessly side by side over the scabbard of his sheathed sword which lay across his knees  the fire flamed only at intervals the fresh log that had been placed on it not having been thoroughly kindled as yet sometimes the light played on the white folds of antoninas dress sometimes over the bright surface of hermanrics cuirass which he had removed and laid by his side on the ground sometimes over his sword and his hands as they rested on it but it was not sufficiently powerful or lasting to illuminate the room the walls and corners of which it left in almost complete darkness  the thunder still pealed from without but the rain and wind had partially lulled  the night hours had moved on more swiftly than our narrative of the events that marked them  it was now midnight  no sound within the room reached antoninas ear but the quick rattling of the doorlatch shaken in its socket by the wind  as one by one the moments journeyed slowly onward it made its harsh music with as monotonous a regularity as though it were moved by their progress and kept pace with their eternal march  gradually the girl found herself listening to this sharp discordant sound with all the attention she could have bestowed at other times on the ripple of a distant rivulet or the soothing harmony of a lute when just as it seemed adapting itself most easily to her senses it suddenly ceased and the next instant a gust of wind like that which had rushed through the open door on the breaking of the rotten bar waved her hair about her face and fluttered the folds of her light loose dress  she raised her head and whispered tremulously to hermanric  the door is open againthe latch has given way  the goth started from his reverie and looked up hastily  at that instant the rattling of the latch recommenced as suddenly as it had ceased and the air of the room recovered its former tranquillity  calm yourself beloved one said hermanric gently your fancy has misled youthe door is safe  he parted back her dishevelled hair caressingly as he spoke  incapable of doubting the lightest word that fell from his lips and hearing no suspicious or unwonted sound in the room she never attempted to justify her suspicions  as she again rested her head on his shoulder a vague misgiving oppressed her heart and drew from her an irrepressible sigh but she gave her apprehensions no expression in words  after listening for a moment more to assure himself of the security of the latch the goth resumed insensibly the contemplations from which he had been disturbed once more his head drooped and again his hands returned mechanically to their old listless position side by side on the scabbard of his sword  the faint fickle flames still rose and fell gleaming here and sinking there the latch sounded sharply in its socket the thunder yet uttered its surly peal but the wind was now subsiding into fainter moans and the rain began to splash faintly and more faintly against the shutters without  to the watchers in the farmhouse nothing was altered to the eye and little to the ear  fatal security  the last few minutes had darkly determined their future destiniesin the loved and cherished retreat they were now no longer alone  they heard no stealthy footsteps pacing round their dwelling they saw no fierce eyes peering into the interior of the farmhouse through a chink in the shutters they marked no dusky figure passing through the softly and quickly opened door and gliding into the darkest corner of the room  yet now as they sat together communing in silence with their young sad hearts the threatening figure of goisvintha stood shrouded in congenial darkness under their protecting roof and in their beloved chamber rising still and silent almost at their very sides  though the fire of her past fever had raged again through her veins and though startling visions of the murders at aquileia had flashed before her mind as the wild lightning before her eyes she had traced her way through the suburbs and along the highroad and down the little path to the farmhouse gate without straying without hesitating  regardless of the darkness and the storm she had prowled about the house had raised the latch had waited for a loud peal of thunder ere she passed the door and had stolen shadowlike into the darkest corner of the room with a patience and a determination that nothing could disturb and now when she stood at the goal of her worst wishes even now when she looked down upon the two beings by whom she had been thwarted and deceived her fierce selfpossession did not desert her her lips quivered over her locked teeth her bosom heaved beneath her drenched garments but neither sighs nor curses not even a smile of triumph or a movement of anger escaped her  she never looked at antonina her eyes wandered not for a moment from hermanrics form  the quickest faintest gleam of firelight that gleamed over it was followed through its fitful course by her eager glance rapid and momentary as itself  soon her attention was fixed wholly upon his hands as they lay over the scabbard of his sword and then slowly and obscurely a new and fatal resolution sprung up within her  the various emotions pictured in her face became resolved into one sinister expression and without removing her eyes from the goth she slowly drew from the bosomfolds of her garment a long sharp knife  the flames alternately trembled into light and subsided into darkness as at first hermanric and antonina yet continued in their old positions absorbed in their thoughts and in themselves and still goisvintha remained unmoved as ever knife in hand watchful steady silent as before  but beneath the concealment of her outward tranquillity raged a contention under which her mind darkened and her heart writhed  twice she returned the knife to its former hidingplace and twice she drew it forth again her cheeks grew paler and paler she pressed her clenched hand convulsively over her bosom and leant back languidly against the wall behind her  no thought of antonina had part in this great strife of secret emotions her wrath had too much of anguish in it to be spent against a stranger and an enemy  after the lapse of a few moments more her strength returnedher firmness was aroused  the last traces of grief and despair that had hitherto appeared in her eyes vanished from them in an instant rage vengeance ferocity lowered over them as she crept stealthily forward to the very side of the goth and when the next gleam of the fire played upon him drew the knife fiercely across the back of his hands the cut was true strong and rapidit divided the tendons from first to lasthe was crippled for life  at that instant the fire touched the very heart of the log that had been laid on it  it crackled gaily it blazed out brilliantly  the whole room was as brightly illuminated as if a christmas festival of ancient england had been preparing within its walls  the warm cheerful light showed the goth the figure of his assassin ere the first cry of anguish had died away on his lips or the first start of irrepressible horror ceased to vibrate through his frame  the cries of his hapless companion as the whole scene of vengeance treachery and mutilation flashed in one terrible instant before her eyes seemed not even to reach his ears  once he looked down upon his helpless hands when the sword rolled heavily from them to the floor then his gaze directed itself immovably upon goisvintha as she stood at a little distance from him with her bloodstained knife silent as himself   there was no furyno defiancenot even the passing distortion of physical suffering in his features as he now looked on her  blank rigid horrortearless voiceless helpless despair seemed to have petrified the expression of his face into an everlasting form unyouthful and unhopefulas if he had been imprisoned from his childhood and a voice was now taunting him with the pleasures of liberty from a grating in his dungeon walls  not even when antonina recovering from her first agony of terror pressed her convulsive kisses on his cold cheek entreating him to look on her did he turn his head or remove his eyes from goisvinthas form  at length the deep steady accents of the womans voice were heard through the desolate silence  traitor in word and thought you may be yet but traitor in deed you never more shall be she began pointing to his hands with her knife those hands that have protected a roman life shall never grasp a roman sword shall never pollute again by their touch a gothic weapon i remembered as i watched you in the darkness how the women of my race once punished their recreant warriors when they fled to them from a defeat  so have i punished you  the arm that served not the cause of sister and sisters childrenof king and kings nationshall serve no other  i am half avenged of the murders at aquileia now that i am avenged on you  go fly with the roman you have chosen to the city of her people  your life as a warrior is at an end  he made her no answer  there are emotions the last of a life which tear back from nature the strongest barriers that custom raises to repress her which betray the lurking existence of the first rude social feeling of the primeval days of a great nation in the breasts of their most distant descendants however widely their acquirements their prosperities or their changes may seem to have morally separated them from their ancestors of old  such were the emotions now awakened in the heart of the goth  his christianity his love his knowledge of high aims and his experience of new ideas sank and deserted him as though he had never known them  he thought on his mutilated hands and no other spirit moved within him but the ancient gothic spirit of centuries back the inspiration of his nations early northern songs and early northern achievementsthe renown of courage and the supremacy of strength  vainly did antonina in the midst of the despair that still possessed her yearn for a word from his lips or a glance from his eyes vainly did her trembling fingers tearing the bandages from her robe stanch the blood on his wounded hands vainly did her voice call on him to fly and summon help from his companions in the camp  his mind was far away brooding over the legends of the battlefields of his ancestors remembering how even in the day of victory they slew themselves if they were crippled in the fray how they scorned to exist for other interests than the interests of strife how they mutilated traitors as goisvintha had mutilated him  such were the objects that enchained his inward faculties while his outward senses were still enthralled by the horrible fascination that existed for him in the presence of the assassin by his side  his very consciousness of his existence though he moved and breathed seemed to have ceased  you thought to deceive me in my sickness you hoped to profit by my death resumed goisvintha returning contemptuously her victims glance  you trusted in the night and the darkness and the storm you were secure in your boldness in your strength in the secrecy of this lurkingplace that you have chosen for your treachery but your stratagems and your expectations have failed you  at aquileia i learnt to be wily and watchful as you  i discovered your desertion of the warriors and the camp i penetrated the paths to your hidingplace i entered it as softly as i once departed from the dwelling where my children were slain  in my just vengeance i have treated you as treacherously as you would have treated me  remember your murdered brother remember the child i put into your arms wounded and received from them dead remember your broken oaths and forgotten promises and make to your nation to your duties and to me the atonementthe last and the only onethat in my mercy i have left in your powerthe atonement of death   again she paused and again no reply awaited her  still the goth neither moved nor spoke and still antoninakneeling unconsciously upon the sword now useless to him for evercontinued to stanch the blood on his hands with a mechanical earnestness that seemed to shut out the contemplation of every other object from her eyes  the tears streamed incessantly down her cheeks but she never turned towards goisvintha never suspended her occupation  meanwhile the fire still blazed noisily on the cheerful hearth but the storm as if disdaining the office of heightening the human horror of the farmhouse scene was rapidly subsiding  the thunder pealed less frequently and less loudly the wind fell into intervals of noiseless calm and occasionally the moonlight streamed in momentary brightness through the ragged edges of the fast breaking clouds  the breath of the still morning was already moving upon the firmament of the stormy night  has life its old magic for you yet continued goisvintha in tones of pitiless reproach  have you forgotten with the spirit of your people the end for which your ancestors lived  is not your sword at your feet is not the knife in my hand  do not the waters of the tiber rolling yonder to the sea offer to you the grave of oblivion that all may seek die then  in your last hour be a goth even to the romans you are worthless now  already your comrades have discovered your desertion will you wait till you are hung for a rebel  will you live to implore the mercy of your enemies or dishonoured and defenceless will you endeavour to escape  you are of the blood of my family but again i say it to youdie  his pale lips trembled he looked round for the first time at antonina but his utterance struggled ineffectually even yet against unyielding despair  he was still silent  goisvintha turned from him disdainfully and approaching the fire sat down before it bending her haggard features over the brilliant flames for a few minutes she remained absorbed in her evil thoughts but no articulate word escaped her and when at length she again abruptly broke the silence it was not to address the goth or to fix her eyes on him as before  still cowering over the fire apparently as regardless of the presence of the two beings whose happiness she had just crushed for ever as if they had never existed she began to recite in solemn measured chanting tones a legend of the darkest and earliest age of gothic history keeping time to herself with the knife that she still held in her hand  the malignity in her expression as she pursued her employment betrayed the heartless motive that animated it almost as palpably as the words of the composition she was repeating  thus she now spoke      the tempestgods pinions oershadow the sky     the waves leap to welcome the storm that is nigh     through the hall of old odin reecho the shocks     that the fierce ocean hurls at his rampart of rocks     as alone on the crags that soar up from the sands     with his virgin siona the young agnar stands     tears sprinkle their dew on the sad maidens cheeks     and the voice of the chieftain sinks low while he speaks      crippled in the fight for ever     numberd with the worse than slain     weak deformd disablednever     can i join the hosts again     with the battle that is

point in the legend she paused and turned suddenly to observe its effect on hermanric  all its horrible application to himself thrilled through his heart  his head drooped and a low groan burst from his lips  but even this evidence of the suffering she was inflicting failed to melt the iron malignity of goisvinthas determination   do you remember the death of agnar she cried  when you were a child i sung it to you ere you slept and you vowed as you heard it that when you were a man if you suffered his wounds you would die his death  he was crippled in a victory yet he slew himself on the day of his triumph you are crippled in your treachery and have forgotten your boys honour and will live in the darkness of your shame  have you lost remembrance of that ancient song  you heard it from me in the morning of your years listen and you shall hear it to the end it is the dirge for your approaching death  she continued      siona mourn notwhere i go     the warriors feel nor pain nor woe     they raise aloft the gleaming steel     their wounds though warm untended heal     their arrows bellow through the air     in showers as they battle there     in mighty cups their wine is pourd

tis time i diefarewellfarewell      he rose with a smile to prepare for the spring     he flew from the rock like a bird on the wing     the sea met her prey with a leap and a roar     and the maid stood alone by the waveriven shore      the winds mutterd deep with a woeboding sound     as she wept oer the footsteps hed left on the ground     and the wild vultures shriekd for the chieftain who spread     their battlefield banquets was laid with the dead  as with a slow and measured emphasis goisvintha pronounced the last lines of the poem she again approached hermanric  but the eyes of the goth sought her no longer  she had calmed the emotions that she had hoped to irritate  of the latter divisions of her legend those only which were pathetic had arrested the lost chieftains attention and the blunted faculties of his heart recovered their old refinement as he listened to them  a solemn composure of love grief and pity appeared in the glance of affection that he now directed on the girls despairing countenance  years of good thoughts an existence of tender cares an eternity of youthful devotion spoke in that rapt momentary eloquent gaze and imprinted on his expression a character ineffably beautiful and calma nobleness above the human and approaching the angelic and divine  intuitively goisvintha followed the direction of his eyes and looked like him on the roman girls face  a lowering expression of hatred replaced the scorn that had hitherto distorted her passionate features mechanically her hand again half raised the knife and the accents of her wrathful voice once more disturbed the sacred silence of affection and grief  is it for the girl there that you would still live she cried sternly i foreboded it coward when i  first looked on you  i prepared for it when i wounded you  i made sure that when my anger again threatened this new ruler of your thoughts and mover of your actions you should have lost the power to divert it from her again think you that because my disdain has delayed it my vengeance on her is abandoned long since i swore to you that she should die and i will hold to my purpose i have punished you i will slay her  can you shield her from the blow tonight as you shielded her in your tent you are weaker before me than a child  she ceased abruptly for at this moment a noise of hurrying footsteps and contending voices became suddenly audible from without  as she heard it a ghastly paleness chased the flush of anger from her cheeks with the promptitude of apprehension she snatched the sword of hermanric from under antonina and ran it through the staples intended to hold the rude bar of the door  the next instant the footsteps sounded on the garden path and the next the door was assailed  the good sword held firm but the frail barrier that it sustained yielded at the second shock and fell inwards shattered to the floor instantly the gap was darkened by human forms and the firelight glowed over the repulsive countenances of two huns who headed the intruders habited in complete armour and furnished with naked swords  yield yourself prisoner by alarics command cried one of the barbarians or you shall be slain as a deserter where you now stand  the goth had risen to his feet as the door was burst in  the arrival of his pursuers seemed to restore his lost energies to deliver him at once from an allpowerful thraldom  an expression of triumph and defiance shone over his steady features when he heard the summons of the hun for a moment he stooped towards antonina as she clung fainting round him  his mouth quivered and his eye glistened as he kissed her cold cheek  in that moment all the hopelessness of his position all the worthlessness of his marred existence all the ignominy preparing for him when he returned to the camp rushed over his mind  in that moment the worst horrors of departure and death the fiercest rackings of love and despair assailed but did not overcome him  in that moment he paid his final tribute to the dues of affection and braced for the last time the fibres of manly dauntlessness and spartan resolve  the next instant he tore himself from the girls arms the old herospirit of his conquering nation possessed every nerve in his frame his eye brightened again gloriously with its lost warriorlight his limbs grew firm his face was calm he confronted the huns with a mien of authority and a smile of disdain and as he presented to them his defenceless breast not the faintest tremor was audible in his voice while he cried in accents of steady command  strike  i yield not  the huns rushed forward with fierce cries and buried their swords in his body  his warm young blood gushed out upon the floor of the dwelling which had been the loveshrine of the heart that shed it without a sigh from his lips or a convulsion on his features he fell dead at the feet of his enemies all the valour of his disposition all the gentleness of his heart all the vigour of his form resolved in one humble instant into a senseless and burdensome mass  antonina beheld the assassination but was spared the sight of the death that followed it  she fell insensible by the side of her young warriorher dress was spotted with his blood her form was motionless as his own  leave him there to rot  his pride in his superiority will not serve him noweven to a grave cried the hun leader to his companions as he dried on the garments of the corpse his reeking sword  and this woman demanded one of his comrades is she to be liberated or secured  he pointed as he spoke to goisvintha  during the brief scene of the assassination the very exercise of her faculties seemed to have been suspended  she had never stirred a limb or uttered a word  the hun recognised her as the woman who had questioned and bribed him at the camp  she is the traitors kinswoman and is absent from the tents without leave he answered  take her prisoner to alaric she will bear us witness that we have done as he commanded us  as for the girl he continued glancing at the blood on antoninas dress and stirring her figure carelessly with his foot she may be dead too for she neither moves nor speaks and may be left like her protector to lie graveless where she is  for us it is time that we departthe king is impatient of delay   as they led her roughly from the house goisvintha shuddered and attempted to pause for a moment when she passed the corpse of the goth death that can extinguish enmities as well as sunder loves rose awful and appealing as she looked her last at her murdered brother and remembered her murdered husband  no tears flowed from her eyes no groans broke from her bosom but there was a pang a last momentary pang of grief and pity at her heart as she murmured while they forced her awayaquileia aquileia have i outlived thee for this  the troops retired for a few minutes silence ruled uninterruptedly over the room where the senseless girl still lay by the side of all that was left to her of the object of her first youthful love but ere long footsteps again approached the farmhouse door and two goths who had formed part of the escort allotted to the hun approached the young chieftains corpse quickly and silently they raised it in their arms and bore it into the garden there they scooped a shallow hole with their swords in the fresh flowerladen turf and having laid the body there they hastily covered it and rapidly departed without returning to the house  these men had served among the warriors committed to hermanrics command  by many acts of frank generosity and encouragement the young chieftain had won their rough attachment  they mourned his fate but dared not obstruct the sentence or oppose the act that determined it at their own risk they had secretly quitted the advancing ranks of their comrades to use the last privilege and obey the last dictate of human kindness and they thought not of the lonely girl as they now left her desolate and hurried away to reassume their appointed stations ere it was too late  the turf lay caressingly round the young warriors form its crushed flowers pressed softly against his cold cheek the fragrance of the new morning wafted its pure incense gently about his simple grave around him flowered the delicate plants that the hand of antonina had raised to please his eye  near him stood the dwelling sacred to the first and last kiss that he had impressed upon her lips and about him on all sides rose the plains and woodlands that had engrossed with her image the devotion of all her dearest thoughts  he lay in his death in the midst of the magic circle of the best joys of his life  it was a fitter burialplace for the earthly relics of that bright and generous spirit than the pit in the carnageladen battlefield or the desolate sepulchres of a northern land    chapter 19  the guardian restored  not long is the newmade grave left unwatched to the solemn guardianship of solitude and night more than a few minutes have scarcely elapsed since it was dug yet already human footsteps press its yielding surface and a human glance scans attentively its small and homely mound  but it is not antonina whom he loved it is not goisvintha through whose vengeance he was lost who now looks upon the earth above the young warriors corpse  it is a stranger an outcast a man lost dishonoured abandonedit is the solitary and ruined ulpius who now gazes with indifferent eyes upon the peaceful garden and the eloquent grave  in the destinies of woe committed to the keeping of the night the pagan had been fatally included the destruction that had gone forth against the body of the young man who lay beneath the earth had overtaken the mind of the old man who stood over his simple grave  the frame of ulpius with all its infirmities was still there but the soul of ferocious patience and unconquerable daring that had lighted it grandly in its ruin was gone  over the long anguish of that woeful life the veil of selfoblivion had closed for ever   he had been dismissed by alaric but he had not returned to the city whither he was bidden  throughout the night he had wandered about the lonely suburbs striving in secret and horrible suffering for the mastery of his mind  there did the overthrow of all his hopes from the goths expand rapidly into the overthrow of the whole intellect that had created his aspirations  there had reason burst the bonds that had so long chained perverted degraded it  at length wandering hither and thither he had dragged the helpless body possessed no longer by the perilous mind to the farmhouse garden in which he now stood gazing alternately at the upturned sods of the chieftains grave and the red gleam of the fire as it glowed from the dreary room through the gap of the shattered door  his faculties were fatally disordered rather than utterly destroyed his penetration his firmness and his cunning were gone but a wreck of memory useless and unmanageablea certain capacity for momentary observation still remained to him  the shameful miscarriage in the tent of alaric which had overthrown his faculties had passed from him as an event that never happened but he remembered fragments of his past existencehe still retained a vague consciousness of the ruling purpose of his whole life  these embryo reflections disconnected and unsustained flitted to and fro over his dark mind as luminous exhalations over a marshrising and sinking harmless and delusive fitful and irregular what he remembered of the past he remembered carelessly viewing it with as vacant a curiosity as if it were the visionary spectacle of another mans struggles and misfortunes and hopes acting under it as under a mysterious influence neither the end nor the reason of which he cared to discover  for the future it was to his thoughts a perfect blank for the present it was a jarring combination of bodily weariness and mental repose  he shuddered as he stood shelterless under the open heaven  the cold that he had defied in the vaults of the rifted wall pierced in the farmhouse garden his limbs which had resisted repose on the hard journey from rome to the camp of the goths now trembled so that he was fain to rest them on the ground  for a short time he sat glaring with vacant and affrighted eyes upon the open dwelling before him as though he longed to enter it but dare not  at length the temptation of the ruddy firelight seemed to vanquish his irresolution he rose with difficulty and slowly and hesitatingly entered the house  he had advanced thieflike but a few steps he had felt but for a moment the welcome warmth of the fire when the figure of antonina still extended insensible upon the floor caught his eye he approached it with eager curiosity and raising the girl on his arm looked at her with a long and rigid scrutiny  for some moments no expression of recognition passed his lips or appeared on his countenance as with a mechanical doting gesture of fondness he smoothed her dishevelled hair over her forehead  while he was thus engaged while the remains of the gentleness of his childhood were thus awfully revived in the insanity of his age a musical string wound round a small piece of gilt wood fell from its concealment in her bosom he snatched it from the groundit was the fragment of her broken lute which had never quitted her since the night when in her innocent grief she had wept over it in her maiden bedchamber  small obscure insignificant as it was this little token touched the fibre in the pagans shattered mind which the alleloquent form and presence of its hapless mistress had failed to reach his memory flew back instantly to the garden on the pincian mount and to his past duties in numerians household but spoke not to him of the calamities he had wreaked since that period on his confiding master  his imagination presented to him at this moment but one imagehis servitude in the christians abode and as he now looked on the girl he could regard himself but in one lightas the guardian restored  what does she with her music here he whispered apprehensively this is not her fathers house and the garden yonder looks not from the summit of the hill  as he curiously examined the room the red spots on the floor suddenly attracted his attention  a panic a frantic terror seemed instantly to overwhelm him  he rose with a cry of horror and still holding the girl on his arm hurried out into the garden trembling and breathless as if the weapon of an assassin had scared him from the house   the shock of her rough removal the sudden influence of the fresh cold air restored antonina to the consciousness of life at the moment when ulpius unable to support her longer laid her against the little heap of turf which marked the position of the young chieftains grave  her eyes opened wildly their first glance fixed upon the shattered door and the empty room  she rose from the ground advanced a few steps towards the house then paused rigid breathless silent and turning slowly faced the upturned turf  the grave was alleloquent of its tenant  his cuirass which the soldiers had thought to bury with the body that it had defended in former days had been overlooked in the haste of the secret interment and lay partly imbedded in the broken earth partly exposed to viewa simple monument over a simple grave  her tearless dilated eyes looked down on it as though they would number each blade of grass each morsel of earth by which it was surrounded  her hair waved idly about her cheeks as the light wind fluttered it but no expression passed over her face no gestures escaped her limbs  her mind toiled and quivered as if crushed by a fiery burden but her heart was voiceless and her body was still  ulpius had stood unnoticed by her side  at this moment he moved so as to confront her and she suddenly looked up at him  a momentary expression of bewilderment and suspicion lightened the heavy vacancy of despair which had chased their natural and feminine tenderness from her eyes but it disappeared rapidly  she turned from the pagan knelt down by the grave and pressed her face and bosom against the little mound of turf beneath her  no voice comforted her no arm caressed her as her mind now began to penetrate the mysteries to probe the darkest depths of the long nights calamities  unaided and unsolaced while the few and waning stars glimmered from their places in the sky while the sublime stillness of tranquillised nature stretched around her she knelt at the altar of death and raised her soul upward to the great heaven above her charged with its sacred offering of human grief  long did she thus remain and when at length she arose from the ground when approaching the pagan she fixed on him her tearless dreary eyes he quailed before her glance as his dull faculties struggled vainly to resume the old informing power that they had now for ever lost nothing but the remembrance aroused by his first sight of the fragment of the lute lived within even yet as he whispered to her in low entreating tones  come homecome home  your father may return before uscome home  as the words home and fatherthose household gods of the hearts earliest existencestruck upon her ears a change flashed with electric suddenness over the girls whole aspect  she raised her wan hands to the sky all her womans tenderness repossessed itself of her heart and as she again knelt down over the grave her sobs rose audibly through the calmed and fragrant air  with hermanrics corpse beneath her with the bloodsprinkled room behind her with a hostile army and a faminewasted city beyond her it was only through that flood of tears that healing passion of gentle emotions that she rose superior to the multiplied horrors of her situation at the very moment when her faculties and her life seemed sinking under them alike  fully freely bitterly she wept on the kindly and parent earththe patient friendly ground that once bore the light footsteps of the first of a race not created for death that now holds in its sheltering arms the loved ones whom in mourning we lay there to sleep that shall yet be bound to the farthermost of its depths when the sunbright presence of returning spirits shines over its renovated frame and love is resumed in angel perfection at the point where death suspended it in mortal frailness  come homeyour father is awaiting youcome home repeated the pagan vacantly moving slowly away as he spoke   at the sound of his voice she started up and clasping his arm with her trembling fingers to arrest his progress looked affrightedly into his seared and listless countenance  as she thus gazed on him she appeared for the first time to recognise him  fear and astonishment mingled in her expression with grief and despair as she sunk at his feet moaning in tones of piercing entreaty  o ulpiusif ulpius you arehave pity on me and take me to my father my father my father  in all the lonely world there is nothing left to me but my father  why do you weep to me about your broken lute answered ulpius with a dull unmeaning smile it was not i that destroyed it  they have slain him she shrieked distractedly heedless of the pagans reply  i saw them draw their swords on him  see his blood is on memeantonina whom he protected and loved  look there that is a gravehis gravei know it  i have never seen him since he is downdown there under the flowers i grew to gather for him  they slew him and when i knew it not they have buried himor youyou have buried him  you have hidden him under the cold garden earth  he is goneah gone gonefor ever gone  and she flung herself again with reckless violence on the grave  after looking steadfastly on her for a moment ulpius approached and raised her from the earth  come he cried angrily the night grows onyour father waits  the walls of rome shut me from my father  i shall never see my father nor hermanric again she cried in tones of bitter anguish remembering more perfectly all the miseries of her position and struggling to release herself from the pagans grasp  the walls of rome  at those words the mind of ulpius opened to a flow of dark remembrances and lost the visions that had occupied it until that moment  he laughed triumphantly  the walls of rome bow to my arm he cried in exulting tones i pierced them with my good bar of iron  i wound through them with my bright lantern  spirits roared on me and struck me down and grinned upon me in the thick darkness but i passed the wall  the thunder pealed around me as i crawled along the winding rifts but i won my way through them  i came out conquering on the other side  come come come come  we will return  i know the track even in the darkness i can outwatch the sentinels  you shall walk in the pathway that i have broken through the bricks  the girls features lost for a moment their expression of grief and grew rigid with horror as she glanced at his fiery eyes and felt the fearful suspicion of his insanity darkening over her mind  she stood powerless trembling unresisting in his grasp without attempting to delude him into departure or to appease him into delay  why did i make my passage through the wall muttered the pagan in a low awestruck voice suddenly checking himself as he was about to step forward  why did i tear down the strong brickwork and go forth into the dark suburbs  he paused and for a few moments struggled with his purposeless and disconnected thoughts but a blank a darkness an annihilation overwhelmed alaric and the gothic camp which he vainly endeavoured to disperse  he sighed bitterly to himselfit is gone and still grasping antonina by the hand drew her after him to the garden gate  leave me she shrieked as he passed onward into the pathway that led to the highroad  oh be merciful and leave me to die where he has died  peace or i will rend you limb by limb as i rent the stones from the wall when i passed through it he whispered to her in fierce accents as she struggled to escape him  you shall return with me to rome you shall walk in the track that i have made in the rifted brickwork   terror anguish exhaustion overpowered her weak efforts  her lips moved partly in prayer and partly in ejaculation but she spoke in murmurs only as she mechanically suffered the pagan to lead her onward by the hand  they paced on under the waning starlight over the cold lonely road and through the dreary and deserted suburbsa fearful and discordant pair  coldly obediently impassively as if she were walking in a dream the spiritbroken girl moved by the side of her scarcehuman leader  disjointed exclamation alternating horribly between infantine simplicity and fierce wickedness poured incessantly from the pagans lips but he never addressed himself further to his terrorstricken companion  so wending rapidly onward they gained the gothic lines and here the madman slackened his pace and paused beastlike to glare around him as he approached the habitations of men  still not opposed by antonina whose faculties of observation were petrified by her terror into perfect inaction even here within reach of the doubtful aid of the enemies of her people the pagan crept forward through the loneliest places of the encampment and guided by the mysterious cunning of his miserable race eluded successfully the observation of the drowsy sentinels  never bewildered by the darknessfor the moon had gone downalways led by the animal instinct coexistent with his disease he passed over the waste ground between the hostile encampment and the city and arrived triumphant at the heap of stones that marked his entrance to the rifted wall  for one moment he stopped and turning towards the girl pointed proudly to the dark low breach he was about to penetrate  then drawing her halffainting form closer to his side looking up attentively to the ramparts and stepping as noiselessly as though turf were beneath his feet he entered the dusky rift with his helpless charge  as they disappeared in the recesses of the wall nightthe stormy the eventful the fatalreached its last limit and the famished sentinel on the fortifications of the besieged city roused himself from his dreary and absorbing thoughts for he saw that the new day was dawning in the east    chapter 20  the breach repassed  slowly and mournfully the sentinel at the rifted wall raised his eyes towards the eastern clouds as they brightened before the advancing dawn desolate as was the appearance of the dull misty daybreak it was yet the most welcome of all the objects surrounding the starving soldier on which he could fix his languid gaze  to look back on the city behind him was to look back on the dreary charnelhouse of famine and death to look down on the waste ground without the walls was to look down on the dead body of the comrade of his watch who maddened by the pangs of hunger which he had suffered during the night had cast himself from the rampart to meet a welcome death on the earth beneath famished and despairing the sentinel crouched on the fortifications which he had now neither strength to pace nor care to defend yearning for the food that he had no hope to obtain as he watched the grey daybreak from his solitary post  while he was thus occupied the gloomy silence of the scene was suddenly broken by the sound of falling brickwork at the inner base of the wall followed by faint entreaties for mercy and deliverance which rose on his ear strangely mingled with disjointed expression of defiance and exultation from a second voice  he slowly turned his head and looking down saw on the ground beneath a young girl struggling in the grasp of an old man who was hurrying her onward in the direction of the pincian gate   for one moment the girls eye met the sentinels vacant glance and she renewed with a last effort of strength and a greater vehemence of supplication her cries for help but the soldier neither moved nor answered  exhausted as he was no sight could affect him now but the sight of food  like the rest of the citizens he was sunk in a heavy stupor of starvationselfish reckless brutalised no disasters could depress no atrocities rouse him  famine had torn asunder every social tie had withered every human sympathy among his besieged fellowcitizens and he was famishing like them  at the moment when the dawn had first appeared could he have looked down by some mysterious agency to the interior foundations of the wall from the rampart on which he kept his weary watch such a sight must then have presented itself as would have aroused even his sluggish observation to rigid attention and involuntary surprise  winding upward and downward among jagged masses of ruined brickwork now lost amid the shadows of dreary chasms now prominent over the elevations of rising arches the dark irregular passages broken by ulpius in the rotten wall would then have presented themselves to his eyes not stretching forth in dismal solitude not peopled only by the reptiles native to the place but traced in all their mazes by human forms  then he would have perceived the fierce resolute pagan moving through darkness and obstacles with a sure solemn progress drawing after him like a dog devoted to his will the young girl whose hapless fate had doomed her to fall into his power  her halffainting figure might have been seen sometimes prostrate on the higher places of the breach while her fearful guide descended before her into a chasm beyond and then turned to drag her after him to a darker and a lower depth yet sometimes bent in supplication when her lips moved once more with a last despairing entreaty and her limbs trembled with a final effort to escape from her captors relentless grasp  while still through all that opposed him the same fierce tenacity of purpose would have been invariably visible in every action of ulpius constantly confirming him in his mad resolution to make his victim the follower of his progress through the wall ever guiding him with a strange instinct through every hindrance and preserving him from every danger in his path until it brought him forth triumphant with his prisoner still in his power again free to tread the desolate streets and mingle with the faminestricken citizens of rome  and now when after peril and anguish she once more stood within the city of her home what hope remained to antonina of obtaining her last refuge under her fathers roof and deriving her solitary consolation from the effort to regain her fathers love  with the termination of his passage through the breach in the wall had ended every recollection associated with it in the pagans shattered memory  a new blank now pervaded his lost faculties desolate as that which had overwhelmed them in the night when he first stood in the farmhouse garden by the young chieftains grave  he moved onward unobservant unthinking without aim or hope driven by a mysterious restlessness forgetting the very presence of antonina as she followed him but still mechanically grasping her hand and dragging her after him he knew not whither  and she on her part made no effort more for deliverance  she had seen the sentinel unmoved by her entreaties she had seen the walls of her fathers house receding from her longing eyes as ulpius pitilessly hurried her father and farther from its distant door and she lost the last faint hope of restoration the last lingering desire of life as the sense of her helplessness now weighed heaviest on her mind  her heart was full of her young warrior who had been slain and of her father from whom she had parted in the hour of his wrath as she now feebly followed the pagans steps and resigned herself to a speedy exhaustion and death in her utter despair   they turned from the pincian gate and gained the campus martius and here the aspect of the besieged city and the condition of its doomed inhabitants were fully and fearfully disclosed to view on the surface of the noble area once thronged with bustling crowds passing to and fro in every direction as their various destinations or caprices might lead them not twenty moving figures were now discernible  these few who still retained their strength or the resolution to pace the greatest thoroughfare of rome stalked backwards and forwards incessantly their hollow eyes fixed on vacancy their wan hands pressed over their mouths each separate distrustful and silent fierce as imprisoned madmen restless as spectres disturbed in a place of tombs  such were the citizens who still moved over the campus martius and besetting their path wherever they turned lay the gloomy numbers of the dying and the deadthe victims already stricken by the pestilence which had now arisen in the infected city and joined the famine in its work of desolation and death  around the public fountains where the water still bubbled up as freshly as in the summertime of prosperity and peace the poorer population of beleaguered rome had chiefly congregated to expire  some still retained strength enough to drink greedily at the margin of the stone basins across which others lay deadtheir heads and shoulders immersed in the waterdrowned from lack of strength to draw back after their first draught  children mounted over the dead bodies of their parents to raise themselves to the fountains brim parents stared vacantly at the corpses of their children alternately floating and sinking in the water into which they had fallen unsuccoured and unmourned  in other parts of the place at the open gates of the theatres and hippodromes in the unguarded porticoes of the palaces and the baths lay the discoloured bodies of those who had died ere they could reach the fountainsof women and children especiallysurrounded in frightful contrast by the abandoned furniture of luxury and the discarded inventions of viceby gilded couchesby inlaid tablesby jewelled cornicesby obscene picture and statuesby brilliantly framed gaudily tinted manuscripts of licentious songs still hanging at their accustomed places on the lofty marble walls  farther on in the bystreets and the retired courts where the corpse of the tradesman was stretched on his empty counter where the soldier of the city guard dropped down overpowered ere he reached the limit of his rounds where the wealthy merchant lay pestilencestricken upon the last hoards of repulsive food which his gold had procured the assassin and the robber might be seennow greedily devouring the offal that lay around them now falling dead upon the bodies which they had rifled but the moment before  over the whole prospect far and near wherever it might extend whatever the horrors by which it might be occupied was spread a blank supernatural stillness  not a sound arose the living were as silent as the dead crime suffering despair were all voiceless alike the trumpet was unheard in the guardhouse the bell never rang from the church even the thick misty rain that now descended from the black and unmoving clouds and obscured in cold shadows the outlines of distant buildings and the pinnacle tops of mighty palaces fell noiseless to the ground  the sky had no wind the earth no echoesthe pervading desolation appalled the eye the vast stillness weighed dull on the earit was a scene as of the lastleft city of an exhausted world decaying noiselessly into primeval chaos  through this atmosphere of darkness and death along these paths of pestilence and famine unregarding and unregarded the pagan and his prisoner passed slowly onward towards the quarter of the city opposite the pincian mount  no ray of thought even yet brightened the dull faculties of ulpius still he walked forward vacantly and still he was followed wearily by the fastfailing girl  sunk in her mingled stupor of bodily weakness and mental despair she never spoke never raised her head never looked forth on the one side or the other  she had now ceased even to feel the strong cold grasp of the pagans hand  shadowy visions of spheres beyond the world arrayed in enchanting beauty and people with happy spirits in their old earthly forms where a long deathless existence moved smoothly and dreamily onward without mark of time or taint of woe were opening before her mind  she lost all memory of afflictions and wrongs all apprehension of danger from the madman at whose mercy she remained and thus she still moved feebly onward as the will of ulpius guided her with no observation of her present peril and no anxiety for her impending fate   they passed the grand circular structure of the pantheon entered the long narrow streets leading to the banks of the river and finally gained the margin of the tiberhard by the little island that still rises in the midst of its waters  here for the first time the pagan paused mechanically in his course and vacantly directed his dull dreamy eyes on the prospect before him where the walls stretching abruptly outward from their ordinary direction enclosed the janiculum hill as it rose with its irregular mass of buildings on the opposite bank of the river  at this sudden change from action to repose the overtasked energies which had hitherto gifted the limbs of antonina with an unnatural power of endurance abruptly relaxed  she sank down helpless and silent her head drooped towards the hard ground as towards a welcome pillow but found no support for the pagans iron grasp of her hand remained unyielding as ever  infirm though he was he appeared at this moment to be unconscious that his prisoner was now hanging at his side  every association connected with her every recollection of his position with her in her fathers house had vanished from his memory  a darker blindness seemed to have sunk over his bodily perceptions his eyes rolled slowly to and fro over the prospect before him but regarded nothing his panting breaths came thick and fast his shrunk chest heaved as if some deep dread agony were pent within itit was evident that a new crisis in his insanity was at hand  at this moment one of the bands of maraudersthe desperate criminals of famine and plaguewho still prowled through the city appeared in the street  their trembling hands sought their weapons and their haggard faces brightened when they first discerned the pagan and the girl but as they approached nearer they saw enough in the figures of the two at a glance to destroy their hopes of seizing on them either plunder or food  for an instant they stood by their intended victims as if debating whether to murder them only for murders sake when the appearance of two women stealthily quitting a house farther on in the street carrying a basket covered by some tattered garments attracted their attention  they turned instantly to follow the bearers of the basket and again ulpius and antonina were left alone on the rivers bank  the appearance of the assassins had been powerless as every other sight or event in the city in arousing the faculties of ulpius  he had neither looked on them nor fled from them when they surrounded him but now when they were gone he slowly turned his head in the direction by which they had departed  his gaze wandered over the wet flagstones of the street over two corpses stretched on them at a little distance over the figure of a female slave who lay forsaken near the wall of one of the houses exerting her last energies to drink from the turbid rainwater which ran down the kennel by her side and still his eyes remained unregardful of all that they encountered the next object which by chance attracted his vacant attention was a deserted temple this solitary building fixed him immediately in contemplationit was destined to open a new and a warning scene in the dark tragedy of his closing life  in his course through the city he had passed unheeded many temples far more prominent in situation far more imposing in structure than this it was a building of no remarkable extent or extraordinary beauty  its narrow porticoes and dark doorway were more fitted to repel than to invite the eye but it had one attraction powerful above all glories of architecture and all grandeur of situation to arrest in him those wandering faculties whose sterner and loftier aims were now suspended for ever it was dedicated to serapisto the idol which had been the deity of his first worship and the inspiration of his last struggle for the restoration of his faith  the image of the god with the threeheaded monster encircled by a serpent obedient beneath his hand was carved over the portico   what flood of emotions rushed into the vacant mind of ulpius at the instant when he discerned the longloved wellknown image of the egyptian god there was nothing for some moments outwardly visible in him to betray  his moral insensibility appeared but to be deepened as his gaze was now fixed with rigid intensity on the temple portico thus he continued to remain motionless as if what he saw had petrified him where he stood when the clouds which had been closing in deeper and deeper blackness as the morning advanced and which still charged with electricity were gathering to revive the storm of the past night burst abruptly into a loud peal of thunder over his head  at that warning sound as if it had been the supernatural signal awaited to arouse him as if in one brief moment it awakened every recollection of all that he had resolutely attempted during the night of thunder that was past he started into instant animation  his countenance brightened his form expanded he dropped the hand of antonina raised his arm aloft towards the wrathful heaven in frantic triumph then staggering forwards fell on his knees at the base of the temple steps  whatever the remembrances of his passage through the wall at the pincian hill and of the toil and peril succeeding it which had revived when the thunder first sounded in his ear they now vanished as rapidly as they had arisen and left his wandering memory free to revert to the scenes which the image of serapis was most fitted to recall recollections of his boyish enjoyments in the temple at alexandria of his youths enthusiasm of the triumphs of his early manhoodall disjointed and wayward yet all bright glorious intoxicatingflashed before his shattered mind  tears the first that he had shed since his happy youth flowed quickly down his withered cheeks  he pressed his hot forehead he beat his parched hand in ecstasy on the cold wet steps beneath him  he muttered breathless ejaculations he breathed strange murmurs of endearment he humbled himself in his rapturous delight beneath the walls of the temple like a dog that has discovered his lost master and fawns affectionately at his feet  criminal as he was his joy in his abasement his glory in his miserable isolation from humanity was a doom of degradation pitiable to behold  after an interval his mood changed  he rose to his feet his trembling limbs strengthened with a youthful vigour as he ascended the temple steps and gained its doorway  he turned for a moment and looked forth over the street ere he entered the hallowed domain of his distempered imagination  to him the cloudy sky above was now shining with the radiance of the sunbright east  the deathladen highways of rome as they stretched before him were beautiful with lofty trees and populous with happy figures and along the dark flagstones beneath where still lay the corpses which he had no eye to see he beheld already the priests of serapis with his revered guardian his beloved macrinus of former days at their head advancing to meet and welcome him in the hall of the egyptian god  visions such as these passed gloriously before the pagans eyes as he stood triumphant on the steps of the temple and brightened to him with a noonday light its dusky recesses when after his brief delay he turned from the street and disappeared through the doorway of the sacred place  the rain poured down more thickly than before the thunder once aroused now sounded in deep and frequent peals as antonina raised herself from the ground and looked around her in momentary expectation that the dreaded form of ulpius must meet her eyes  no living creature was visible in the street  the forsaken slave still reclined near the wall of the house where she had first appeared when the pagan gained the approaches to the temple but she now lay there dead  no fresh bands of robbers appeared in sight  an uninterrupted solitude prevailed in all directions as far as the eye could reach  at the moment when ulpius had relinquished his grasp of her hand antonina had sunk to the ground helpless and resigned but not exhausted beyond all power of sensation or all capacity for thought while she lay on the cold pavement of the street her mind still pursued its visions of a speedy death and a tranquil lifeindeath to succeed it in a future state  but as minute after minute elapsed and no harsh voice sounded in her ear no pitiless hand dragged her from the ground no ominous footsteps were audible around her a change passed gradually over her thoughts the instinct of selfpreservation slowly revived within her and as she raised herself to look forth on the gloomy prospect the chances of uninterrupted flight and present safety presented by the solitude of the street aroused her like a voice of encouragement like an unexpected promise of help   her perception of outer influences returned she felt the rain that drenched her garments she shuddered at the thunder sounding over her head she marked with horror the dead bodies lying before her on the stones  an overpowering desire animated her to fly from the place to escape from the desolate scene around even though she should sink exhausted by the effort in the next street slowly she aroseher limbs trembled with a premature infirmity but she gained her feet  she tottered onward turning her back on the river passed bewildered between long rows of deserted houses and arrived opposite a public garden surrounding a little summerhouse whose deserted portico offered both concealment and shelter  here therefore she took refuge crouching in the darkest corner of the building and hiding her face in her hands as if to shut out all view of the dreary though altered scenes which spread before her eyes  woeful thoughts and recollections now moved within her in bewildering confusion  all that she had suffered since ulpius had dragged her from the farmhouse in the suburbsthe night pilgrimage over the plainthe fearful passage through the wallrevived in her memory mingled with vague ideas now for the first time aroused of the plague and famine that were desolating the city and with sudden apprehensions that goisvintha might still be following her knife in hand through the lonely streets while passively prominent over all these varying sources of anguish and dread the scene of the young chieftains death lay like a cold weight on her heavy heart  the damp turf of his grave seemed still to press against her breast his last kiss yet trembled on her lips she knew though she dared not look down on them that the spots of his blood yet stained her garments  whether she strove to rise and continue her flight whether she crouched down again under the portico resigned for one bitter moment to perish by the knife of goisvinthaif goisvintha were near to fall once more into the hands of ulpiusif ulpius were tracking her to her retreatthe crushing sense that she was utterly bereaved of her beloved protectorthat the friend of her brief days of happiness was lost to her for everthat hermanric who had preserved her from death had been murdered in his youth and his strength by her side never deserted her since the assassination in the farmhouse she was now for the first time alone and now for the first time she felt the full severity of her affliction and knew how dark was the blank which was spread before every aspiration of her future life  enduring almost eternal as the burden of her desolation seemed now to have become it was yet to be removed ere long by feelings of a tenderer mournfulness and a more resigned woe  the innate and innocent fortitude of disposition which had made her patient under the rigour of her youthful education and hopeful under the trials that assailed her on her banishment from her fathers house which had never deserted her until the awful scenes of the past night of assassination and death rose in triumphant horror before her eyes and which even then had been suspended but not destroyedwas now destined to regain its healing influence over her heart  as she still cowered in her lonely refuge the final hope the yearning dependence on a restoration to her fathers presence and her fathers love that had moved her over the young chieftains grave and had prompted her last effort for freedom when ulpius had dragged her through the passage in the rifted wall suddenly revived   once more she arose and looked forth on the desolate city and the stormy sky but now with mild and unshrinking eyes  her recollections of the past grew tender in their youthful grief her thoughts for the future became patient solemn and serene  images of her first and her lastleft protector of her old familiar home of her garden solitude on the pincian mount spread beautiful before her imagination as restingplaces to her weary heart  she descended the steps of the summerhouse with no apprehension of her enemies no doubt of her resolution for she knew the beacon that was now to direct her onward course  the tears gathered full in her eyes as she passed into the garden but her step never faltered her features never lost their combined expression of tranquil sorrow and subdued hope  so she once more entered the perilous streets and murmuring to herself my father my father as if in those simple words lay the hand that was to guide and the providence that was to preserved her she began to trace her solitary way in the direction of the pincian mount  it was a spectacletouching beautiful even sublimeto see this young girl but a few hours freed by perilous paths and by criminal hands from scenes which had begun in treachery only to end in death now passing resolute and alone through the streets of a mighty city overwhelmed by all that is poignant in human anguish and hideous in human crime  it was a noble evidence of the strong power over the world and the worlds perils with which the simplest affection may arm the frailest beingto behold her thus pursuing her way superior to every horror of desolation and death that clogged her path unconsciously discovering in the softly murmured name of father which still fell at intervals from her lips the pure purpose that sustained herthe steady heroism that ever held her in her doubtful course  the storms of heaven poured over her headthe crimes and sufferings of rome darkened the paths of her pilgrimage but she passed firmly onward through all like a ministering spirit journeying along earthly shores in the bright inviolability of its merciful mission and its holy thoughtslike a ray of light living in the strength of its own beauty amid the tempest and obscurity of a stranger sphere  once more she entered the campus martius  again she passed the public fountains still unnaturally devoted to serve as beds for the dying and as sepulchres for the dead again she trod the dreary highways where the stronger among the famished populace yet paced hither and thither in ferocious silence and unsocial separation  no word was addressed hardly a look was directed to her as she pursued her solitary course she was desolate among the desolate forsaken among others abandoned like herself  the robber when he passed her by saw that she was worthless for the interests of plunder as the poorest of the dying citizens around him the patrician loitering feebly onward to the shelter of his palace halls avoided her as a new suppliant among the people for the charity which he had not to bestow and quickened his pace as she approached him in the street  unprotected yet unmolested hurrying from her loneliness and her bitter recollections to the refuge of her fathers love as she would have hurried when a child from her first apprehension of ill to the refuge of her fathers arms she gained at length the foot of the pincian hillat length ascended the streets so often trodden in the tranquil days of old  the portals and outer buildings of vetranios palace as she passed them presented a striking and ominous spectacle  within the lofty steel railings which protected the building the faminewasted slaves of the senator appeared reeling and tottering beneath full vases of wine which they were feebly endeavouring to carry into the interior apartments  gaudy hangings drooped from the balconies garlands of ivy were wreathed round the statues of the marble front  in the midst of the besieged city and in impious mockery of the famine and pestilence which were wasting it hut and palace to its remotest confines were proceeding in this devoted dwelling the preparations for a triumphant feast  unheedful of the startling prospect presented by vetranios abode her eyes bent but in one absorbing direction her steps hurrying faster and faster with each succeeding instant antonina approached the home from which she had been exiled in fear and to which she was returning in woe  yet a moment more of strong exertion of overpowering anticipation and she reached the garden gate  she dashed back the heavy hair matted over her brows by the rain she glanced rapidly around her she beheld the window of her bedchamber with the old simple curtain still hanging at its accustomed place she saw the wellremembered trees the carefully tended flowerbeds now drooping mournfully beneath the gloomy sky  her heart swelled within her her breath seemed suddenly arrested in her bosom as she trod the garden path and ascended the steps beyond  the door at the top was ajar  with a last effort she thrust it open and stood once moreunaided and unwelcomed yet hopeful of consolation of pardon of lovewithin her first and last sanctuary the walls of her home     chapter 21  father and child  forsaken as it appears on an outward view during the morning of which we now write the house of numerian is yet not tenantless  in one of the sleeping apartments stretched on his couch with none to watch by its side lies the master of the little dwelling  we last beheld him on the scene mingled with the famishing congregation in the basilica of st john lateran still searching for his child amid the confusion of the public distribution of food during the earlier stages of the misfortunes of besieged rome  since that time he has toiled and suffered much and now the day of exhaustion long deferred the hours of helpless solitude constantly dreaded have at length arrived  from the first periods of the siege while all around him in the city moved gloomily onward through darker and darker changes while famine rapidly merged into pestilence and death while human hopes and purposes gradually diminished and declined with each succeeding day he alone remained ever devoted to the same labour ever animated by the same objectthe only one among all his fellowcitizens whom no outward event could influence for good or evil for hope or fear  in every street of rome at all hours among all ranks of people he was still to be seen constantly pursuing the same hopeless search when the mob burst furiously into the public granaries to seize the last supplies of corn hoarded for the rich he was ready at the doors watching them as they came out  when rows of houses were deserted by all but the dead he was beheld within passing from window to window as he sought through each room for the treasure that he had lost  when some few among the populace in the first days of the pestilence united in the vain attempt to cast over the lofty walls the corpses that strewed the street he mingled with them to look on the rigid faces of the dead  in solitary places where the parent not yet lost to affection strove to carry his dying child from the desert roadway to the shelter of a roof where the wife still faithful to her duties received her husbands last breath in silent despairhe was seen gliding by their sides and for one brief instant looking on them with attentive and mournful eyes wherever he went whatever he beheld he asked no sympathy and sought no aid  he went his way a pilgrim on a solitary path an unregarded expectant for a boon that no others would care to partake  when the famine first began to be felt in the city he seemed unconscious of its approachhe made no effort to procure beforehand the provision of a few days sustenance if he attended the first public distributions of food it was only to prosecute his search for his child amid the throng around him  he must have perished with the first feeble victims of starvation had he not been met during his solitary wanderings by some of the members of the congregation whom his piety and eloquence had collected in former days  by these persons who entreaties that he would suspend his hopeless search he always answered with the same firm and patient denial his course was carefully watched and his wants anxiously provided for  out of every supply of food which they were enabled to collect his share was invariably carried to his abode  they remembered their teacher in the hour of his dejection as they had formerly reverenced him in the day of his vigour they toiled to preserve his life as anxiously as they had laboured to profit by his instructions they listened as his disciples once they served him as his children now  but over these as over all other offices of human kindness the famine was destined gradually and surely to prevail  the provision of food garnered up by the congregation ominously lessened with each succeeding day  when the pestilence began darkly to appear the numbers of those who sought their afflicted teacher at his abode or followed him through the dreary streets fatally decreased   then as the nourishment which had supported and the vigilance which had watched him thus diminished so did the hardtasked energies of the unhappy father fail him faster and faster  each morning as he arose his steps were more feeble his heart grew heavier within him his wanderings through the city were less and less resolute and prolonged at length his powers totally deserted him the lastleft members of his congregation as they approached his abode with the lastleft provision of food which they possessed found him prostrate with exhaustion at his garden gate  they bore him to his couch placed their charitable offering by his side and leaving one of their number to protect him from the robber and the assassin they quitted the house in despair  for some days the guardian remained faithful to his post until his sufferings from lack of food overpowered his vigilance  dreading that in his extremity he might be tempted to take from the old mans small store of provision what little remained he fled from the house to seek sustenance however loathsome in the public streets and thenceforth numerian was left defenceless in his solitary abode  he was first beheld on the scenes which these pages present a man of austere purpose of unwearied energy a valiant reformer who defied all difficulties that beset him in his progress a triumphant teacher leading at his will whoever listened to his words a father proudly contemplating the future position which he destined for his child  far different did he now appear  lost to his ambition broken in spirit helpless in body separated from his daughter by his own act he lay on his untended couch in a deathlike lethargy  the cold wind blowing through his opened window awakened no sensations in his torpid frame the cup of water and the small relics of coarse food stood near his hand but he had no vigilance to discern them  his open eyes looked steadfastly upward and yet he reposed as one in a deep sleep or as one already devoted to the tomb save when at intervals his lips moved slowly with a long and painfully drawn breath or a fever flush tinged his hollow cheek with changing and momentary hues  while thus in outward aspect appearing to linger between life and death his faculties yet remained feebly vital within him  aroused by no external influence and governed by no mental restraint they now created before him a strange waking vision palpable as an actual event  it seemed to him that he was reposing not in his own chamber but in some mysterious world filled with a twilight atmosphere inexpressibly soothing and gentle to his aching sight  through this mild radiance he could trace at long intervals shadowy representations of the scenes through which he had passed in search of his lost child  the gloomy streets the lonely houses abandoned to the unburied dead which he had explored alternately appeared and vanished before him in solemn succession and ever and anon as one vision disappeared ere another rose he heard afar off a sound as of gentle womanly voices murmuring in solemn accents the search has been made in penitence in patience in prayer and has not been pursued in vain  the lost shall returnthe beloved shall yet be restored  thus as it had begun the vision long continued  now the scenes through which he had wandered passed slowly before his eyes now the soft voices murmured pityingly in his ear  at length the first disappeared and the last became silent then ensued a long vacant interval and then the grey tranquil light brightened slowly at one spot out of which he beheld advancing towards him the form of his lost child  she came to his side she bent lovingly over him he saw her eyes with their old patient childlike expression looking sorrowfully down upon him  his heart revived to a sense of unspeakable awe and contrition to emotions of yearning love and mournful hope his speech returned he whispered tremulously child child i repented in bitter woe the wrong that i did to thee i sought thee in my loneliness on earth through the long day and the gloomy night  and now the merciful god has sent thee to pardon me  i loved thee i wept for thee   his voice died within him for now his outward sensations quickened he felt warm tears falling on his cheeks he felt embracing arms clasped round him he heard tenderly repeated father speak to me as you were wont love me father and forgive me as you loved and forgave me when i was a little child  the sound of that wellremembered voicewhich had ever spoken kindly and reverently to him  which had last addressed him in tones of despairing supplication which he had hardly hoped to hear again on earthpenetrated his whole being like awakening music in the dead silence of night  his eyes lost their vacant expression he raised himself suddenly on the couch he saw that what had begun as a vision had ended as a reality that his dream had proved the immediate forerunner of its own fulfilment that his daughter in her bodily presence was indeed restored and his head drooped forward and he trembled and wept upon her bosom in the overpowering fulness of his gratitude and delight  for some moments antonina calming with the resolute heroism of affection her own thronging emotions of awe and affright endeavoured to soothe and support her fastfailing parent  her horror almost overwhelmed her as she thought that now when through grief and peril she was at last restored to him he might expire in her arms but even yet her resolution did not fail her  the last hope of her brief and bitter life was now the hope of reviving her father and she clung to it with the tenacity of despair  she calmed her voice while she spoke to him she entreated him to remember that his daughter had returned to watch over him to be his obedient pupil as in days of old  vain effort  even while the words passed her lips his arms which had been pressed over her relaxed his head grew heavier on her bosom  in the despair of the moment she tore herself from him and looked round to seek the help that none were near to afford  the cup of water the last provision of food attracted her eye with quick instinct she caught them up  hope success salvation lay in those miserable relics  she pressed the food into his mouth she moistened his parched lips his dry brow with the water  during one moment of horrible suspense she saw him still insensible then the vital functions revived his eyes opened again and fixed faminestruck on the wretched nourishment before him  he devoured it ravenously he drained the cup of water to its last drop he sank back again on the couch but now the torpid blood moved once more in his veins his heart beat less and less feebly  he was saved she saw it as she bent over himsaved by the lost child in the hour of her return  it was a sensation of ecstatic triumph and gratitude which no woeful remembrances had power to embitter in its bright sudden birth  she knelt down by the side of the couch almost crushed by her own emotions  over the grave of the young warrior she had raised her heart to heaven in agony and grief and now by her fathers side she poured forth her whole soul to her creator in trembling ejaculations of thankfulness and hope  thusthe one slowly recovering whatever of life and vigour yet continued in his weakened frame the other still filled with her allabsorbing emotions of gratitudethe father and daughter long remained and now as morning waned towards noon the storm began to subside gradually and solemnly the vast thunderclouds rolled asunder and the bright blue heaven beyond appeared through their fantastic rifts  the lessening raindrops fell light and silvery to the earth and breeze and sunshine were wafted at fitful intervals over the plaguetainted atmosphere of rome  as yet subdued by the shadows of the floating clouds the dawning sunbeams glittered softly through the windows of numerians chamber  they played warm and reviving over his worn features like messengers of resurrection and hope from their native heaven  life seemed to expand within him under their fresh and gentle ministering  once more he raised himself and turned towards his child and now his heart throbbed with a healthful joy and his arms closed round her not in the helplessness of infirmity but in the welcome of love  his words when he spoke to her fell at first almost inarticulately from his lipsthey were mingled together in confused phrases of tenderness contrition thanksgiving  all the native enthusiasm of his disposition all the latent love for his child which had for years been suppressed by his austerity or diverted by his ambition now at last burst forth  trembling and silent in his arms antonina vainly endeavoured to return his caresses and to answer his words of welcome  now for the first time she knew how deep was her fathers affection for her she felt how foreign to his real nature had been his assumed severity in their intercourse of former days and in the quick flow of new feelings and old recollections produced by the delighting surprise of the discovery she found herself speechless  she could only listen eagerly breathlessly while he spoke  his words faltering and confused though they were were words of endearment which she had never heard from him before they were words which no mother had ever pronounced beside her infant bed and they sank divinely consoling over her heart as messages of pardon from an angels lips  gradually numerians voice grew calmer  he raised his daughter in his arms and bent wistfully on her face his attentive and pitying eyes returned returned he murmured while he gazed on her never again to depart  returned beautiful and patient kinder and more tender than ever  love me and pardon me antonina  i sought for you in bitter loneliness and despair  think not of me as what i was but as what i am  there were days when you were an infant when i had no thought but how to cherish and delight you and now those days have come again  you shall read no gloomy taskbooks you shall never be separated from me more you shall play sweet music on the lute you shall be all garlanded with flowers which i will provide for you  we will find friends and glad companions we will bring happiness with us wherever we are seen gods blessing goes forth from children like youit has fallen upon meit has raised me from the dead  my antonina shall teach me to worship as i once taught her  she shall pray for me in the morning and pray for me at night and when she thinks not of it when she sleeps i shall come softly to her bedside and wait and watch over her so that when she opens her eyes they shall open on methey are the eyes of my child who has been restored to methere is nothing on earth that can speak to me like them of happiness and peace  he paused for a moment and looked rapturously on her face as it was turned towards him  his features partially saddened while he gazed and taking her long hair still wet and dishevelled from the rain in his hands he pressed it over his lips over his face over his neck then when he saw that she was endeavouring to speak when he beheld the tears that were now filling her eyes he drew her closer to him and hurriedly continued in lower tones  hush hush  no more grief no more tears  tell me not whither you have wanderedspeak not of what you have suffered for would not every word be a reproach to me  and you have come to pardon and not to reproach  let not the recollection that it was i who cast you off be forced on me from your lips let us remember only that we are restored to each other let us think that god has accepted my penitence and forgiven me my sin in suffering my child to return  or if we must speak of the days of separation that are past speak to me of the days that found you tranquil and secure rejoice me by telling me that it was not all danger and woe in the bitter destiny which my guilty anger prepared for my own child  say to me that you met protectors as well as enemies in the hour of your flightthat all were not harsh to you as i wasthat those of whom you asked shelter and safety looked on your face as on a petition for charity and kindness from friends whom they loved tell me only of your protectors antonina for in that there will be consolation and you have come to console  as he waited for her reply he felt her tremble on his bosom he saw the shudder that ran over her frame  the despair in her voice though she only pronounced in answer to him the simple words there was oneand then ceased unable to proceedpenetrated coldly to his heart  is he not at hand he hurriedly resumed  why is he not here  let us seek him without delay  i must humble myself before him in my gratitude  i must show him that i was worthy that my antonina should be restored   he is dead she gasped sinking down in the arms that embraced her as the recollections of the past night again crowded in all their horror on her memory  they murdered him by my side  o father father he loved me he would have reverenced and protected you  may the merciful god receive him among the blessed angels and honour him among the holy martyrs cried the father raising his tearful eyes in supplication  may his spirit if it can still be observant of the things of earth know that his name shall be written on my heart with the name of my child that i will think on him as on a beloved companion and mourn for him as a son that has been taken from me  he ceased and looked down on antonina whose features were still hidden from him  each felt that a new bond of mutual affection had been created between them by what each had spoken but both now remained silent  during this interval the thoughts of numerian wandered from the reflections which had hitherto occupied him  the few mournful words which his daughter had spoken had been sufficient to banish its fulness of joy from his heart and to turn him from the happy contemplation of the present to the dark recollections of the past  vague doubts and fears now mingled with his gratitude and hope and involuntarily his thoughts reverted to what he would fain have forgotten for everto the morning when he had driven antonina from her home  baseless apprehensions of the return of the treacherous pagan and his profligate employer with the return of their victimdespairing convictions of his own helplessness and infirmity rose startlingly in his mind  his eyes wandered vacantly round the room his hands closed trembling over his daughters form then suddenly releasing her he arose as one panicstricken and exclaiming the doors must be securedulpius may be nearthe senator may return endeavoured to cross the room  but his strength was unequal to the effort he leaned back for support against the wall and breathlessly repeating secure the doorsulpius ulpius he motioned to antonina to descend  she trembled as she obeyed him  remembering her passage through the breach in the wall and her fearful journey through the streets of rome she more than shared her fathers apprehensions as she descended the stairs  the door remained half open as she had left it when she entered the house  ere she hurriedly closed and barred it she cast a momentary glance on the street beyond  the gaunt figures of the slaves still moved wearily to and fro amid the mockery of festal preparation in vetranios palace and here and there a few ghastly figures lay on the ground contemplating them in languid amazement over all other parts of the street the deadly tranquillity of plague and famine still prevailed  hurriedly ascending the steps antonina hastened to assure her father that she had obeyed his commands and that they were now secure from all intrusion from without  but during her brief absence a new and more ominous prospect of calamity had presented itself before the old mans mind  as she entered the room she saw that he had returned to his couch and that he was holding before him the little wooden bowl which had contained his last supply of food and which was now empty he addressed not a word to her when he heard her enter his features were rigid with horror and despair as he looked down on the empty bowl he muttered vacantly it was the last provision that remained and it was i that exhausted it  the beasts of the forest carry food to their young and i have taken the last morsel from my child   in an instant the utter desolateness of their situationforgotten in the first joy of their meetingforced itself with appalling vividness upon antoninas mind  she endeavoured to speak of comfort and hope to her father but the fearful realities of the famine in the city now rose palpably before her and suspended the vain words of solace on her lips in the midst of still populous rome within sight of those surrounding plains where the creative sun ripened hour by hour the vegetation of the teeming earth where field and granary displayed profusely their abundant stores the father and daughter now looked on each other as helpless to replace their exhausted provision of food as if they had been abandoned on the raft of the shipwrecked in an unexplored sea or banished to a lonely island whose inland products were withered by infected winds and around whose arid shores ran such destroying waters as seethe over the cities of the plain  the silence which had long prevailed in the room the bitter reflections which still held the despairing father and the patient daughter speechless alike were at length interrupted by a hollow and melancholy voice from the street pronouncing in the form of a public notice these words  i publius dalmatius messenger of the roman senate proclaim that in order to clear the streets from the dead three thousand sestertii will be given by the prefect for every ten bodies that are cast over the walls  this is the true decree of the senate  the voice ceased but no sound of applause no murmur of popular tumult was heard in answer then after an interval it was once more faintly audible as the messenger passed on and repeated the decree in another street and then the silence again sank down over all things more awfully pervading than before  every word of the proclamation when repeated in the distance as when spoken under his window had clearly reached numerians ears  his mind already sinking in despair was riveted on what he had heard from the woeboding voice of the herald with a fascination as absorbing as that which rivets the eye of the traveller already giddy on the summit of a precipice upon the spectacle of the yawning gulfs beneath  when all sound of the proclamation had finally died away the unhappy father dropped the empty bowl which he had hitherto mechanically continued to hold before him and glancing affrightedly at his daughter groaned to himself  the corpses are to be cast over the wallsthe dead are to be flung forth to the winds of heaventhere is no help for us in the city o god godshe may dieher body may be cast away like the rest and i may live to see it  he rose suddenly from the couch his reason seemed for a moment to be shaken as he tottered to the window crying food foodi will give my house and all it contains for a morsel of food  i have nothing to support my own childshe will starve before me by tomorrow if i have no food  i am a citizen of romei demand help from the senate  food food  in tones declining lower and lower he continued to cry thus from the window but no voice answered him either in sympathy or derision  of all the peoplenow increased in numberscollected in the street before vetranios palace no one turned even to look on him  for days and days past such fruitless appeals as his had been heard and heard unconcernedly at every hour and in every street of romenow ringing through the heavy air in the shrieks of delirium now faintly audible in the last faltering murmurs of exhaustion and despair  thus vainly entreating help and pity from a populace who had ceased to give the one or to feel the other numerian might long have remained but now his daughter approached his side and drawing him gently towards his couch said in tender and solemn accents  remember father that god sent the ravens to feed elijah and replenished the widows cruse he will not desert us for he has restored us to each other and has sent me hither not to perish in the famine but to watch over you   god has deserted the city and all that it contains he answered distractedly  the angel of destruction has gone forth into our streets and death walks in his shadow  on this day when hope and happiness seemed opening before us both our little household has been doomed  the young and the old the weary and the watchful they strew the streets alikethe famine has mastered them allthe famine will master usthere is no help no escape  i who would have died patiently for my daughters safety must now die despairing leaving her friendless in the wide dreary perilous world in the dismal city of anguish of horror of deathwhere the enemy threatens without and hunger and pestilence waste within  o antonina you have returned to me but for a little time the day of our second separation draws near  for a few moments his head drooped and his sobs choked his utterance then he once more rose painfully to his feet  heedless of antoninas entreaties he again endeavoured to cross the room only again to find his feeble powers unequal to sustain him  as he fell back panting upon a seat his eyes assumed a wild unnatural expressiondespair of mind and weakness of body had together partially unhinged his faculties when his daughter affrightedly approached to soothe and succour him he impatiently waved her back and began to speak in a dull hoarse monotonous voice pressing his hand firmly over his brow and directing his eyes backwards and forwards incessantly on object after object in every part of the room  listen child listen he hastily began  i tell you there is no food in the house and no food in romewe are besiegedthey have taken from us our granaries in the suburbs and our fields on the plainsthere is a great famine in the citythose who still eat eat strange food which men sicken at when it is named  i would seek even this but i have no strength to go forth into the byways and force it from others at the point of the sword  i am old and feeble and heartbrokeni shall die first and leave fatherless my good kind daughter whom i sought for so long and whom i loved as my only child  he paused for an instant not to listen to the words of encouragement and hope which antonina mechanically addressed to him while he spoke but to collect his wandering thoughts to rally his failing strength his voice acquired a quicker tone and his features presented a sudden energy and earnestness of expression as if some new project had flashed across his mind when after an interval he continued thus  but though my child shall be bereaved of me though i shall die in the hour when i most longed to live for her i must not leave her helpless i will send her among my congregation who have deserted me but who will repent when they hear that i am dead and will receive antonina among them for my sake  listen to thislisten listen  you must tell them to remember all that i once revealed to them of my brother from whom i parted in my boyhoodmy brother whom i have never seen since he may yet be alive he may be foundthey must search for him for to you he would be father to the fatherless and guardian to the unguardedhe may now be in rome he may be rich and powerfulhe may have food to spare and shelter that is good against all enemies and strangers  attend child to my words  in these latter days i have thought of him much i have seen him in dreams as i saw him for the last time in my fathers house he was happier and more beloved than i was and in envy and hatred i quitted my parents and parted from him you have heard nothing of this but you must hear it now that when i am dead you may know you have a protector to seek  so i received in anger my brothers farewell and fled from my homethose days were well remembered by me once but all things grow dull on my memory now long years of turmoil and change passed on and i never met him and men of many nations were my companions but he was not among them then much affliction fell upon me and i repented and learnt the fear of god and went back to my fathers house  since that years have passedi know not how many  i could have told them when i spoke of my former life to himto my friend when we stood near st peters ere the city was besieged looking on the sunset and speaking of the early days of our companionship but now my very remembrance fails me the famine that threatens us with separation and death casts darkness over my thoughts yet hear me hear me patientlyfor your sake i must continue  not now fathernot now  at another time on a happier day murmured antonina in tremulous entreating tones   my home when i arrived to look on it was gone pursued the old man sadly neither heeding nor hearing her  other houses were built where my fathers house had stood no man could tell me of my parents and my brother then i returned and my former companions grew hateful in my eyes i left them and they followed me with persecution and scornlisten listeni set forth secretly in the night with you to escape them and to make perfect my reformation where they should not be near to hinder it and we travelled onward many days until we came to rome and i made my abode there  but i feared that my companions whom i abhorred might discover and persecute me again and in the new city of my dwelling i called myself by another name than the name that i bore thus i knew that all trace of me would be lost and that i should be kept secure from men whom i thought on only as enemies now  go child go quicklybring your tablets and write down the names that i shall tell you for so you will discover your protector when i am gone  say not to him that you are the child of numerianhe knows not the name say that you are the daughter of cleander his brother who died longing to be restored to him  writewrite carefully cleanderthat was the name my father gave to me that was the name i bore until i fled from my evil companions and changed it dreading their pursuit  cleander write and remember cleander  i have seen in visions that my brother shall be discovered  he will not be discovered to me but he will be discovered to you  your tabletsyour tabletswrite his name with mineit is  he stopped abruptly  his mental powers fluctuating between torpor and animationshaken but not overpowered by the trials which had assailed themsuddenly rallied and resuming somewhat of their accustomed balance became awakened to a sense of their own aberration  his vague revelations of his past life which the reader will recognise as resembling his communications on the same subject to the fugitive landowner previously related now appeared before him in all their incongruity and uselessness  his countenance fellhe sighed bitterly to himself  my reason begins to desert memy judgment which should guide my childmy resolution which should uphold her both fail me how should my brother since childhood lost to me be found by her against the famine that threatens us i offer but vain words  already her strength declines her face that i loved to look on grows wan before my eyes  god have mercy upon usgod have mercy upon us  he returned feebly to his couch his head declined on his bosom sometimes a low groan burst from his lips but he spoke no more  deep as was the prostration under which he had now fallen it was yet less painful to antonina to behold it than to listen to the incoherent revelations which had fallen from his lips but the moment before and which in her astonishment and affright she had dreaded might be the awful indications of the overthrow of her fathers reason  as she again placed herself by his side she trembled to feel that her own weariness was fast overpowering her but she still struggled with her rising despairstill strove to think only of capacity for endurance and chances of relief  the silence in the room was deep and dismal while they now sat together the faint breezes at long intervals drowsily rose and fell as they floated through the open window the fitful sunbeams alternately appeared and vanished as the clouds rolled upward in airy succession over the face of heaven  time moved sternly in its destined progress and nature varied tranquilly through its appointed limits of change and still no hopes no saving projects nothing but dark recollections and woeful anticipations occupied antoninas mind when just as her weary head was drooping towards the ground just as sensation and fortitude and grief itself seemed declining into a dreamless and deadly sleep a last thought void of discernible connection or cause rose suddenly within heranimating awakening inspiring  she started up  the garden fatherthe garden she cried breathlessly  remember the food that grows in our garden below be comforted we have provision left yetgod has not deserted us  he raised his face while she spoke his features assumed a deeper mournfulness and hopelessness of expression he looked upon her in ominous silence and laid his trembling fingers on her arm to detain her when she hurriedly attempted to quit the room   do not forbid me to depart she anxiously pleaded  to me every corner in the garden is known for it was my possession in our happier daysour last hopes rest in the garden and i must search through it without delay  bear with me she added in low and melancholy tonesbear with me dear father in all that i would now do  i have suffered since we parted a bitter affliction which clings dark and heavy to all my thoughtsthere is no consolation for me but the privilege of caring for your welfaremy only hope of comfort is in the employment of aiding you  the old mans hand had pressed heavier on her arm while she addressed him but when she ceased it dropped from her and he bent his head in speechless submission to her entreaty  for one moment she lingered looking on him silent as himself the next she left the apartment with hasty and uncertain steps  on reaching the garden she unconsciously took the path leading to the bank where she had once loved to play secretly upon her lute and to look on the distant mountains reposing in the warm atmosphere which summer evenings shed over their blue expanse  how eloquent was this little plot of ground of the quiet events now for ever gone byof the joys the hopes the happy occupations which rise with the day that chronicles them and pass like that day never to return the samewhich the memory alone can preserve as they were and the heart can never resume but in a changed form divested of the presence of the companion of the incident of the departed moment which formed the charm of the past and makes the imperfection of the present  tender and thronging were the remembrances which the surrounding prospect called up as the sad mistress of the garden looked again on her little domain  she saw the bank where she could never more sit to sing with a renewal of the same feelings which had once inspired her music she saw the drooping flowers that she could never restore with the same childlike enjoyment of the task which had animated her in former hours  young though she still was the emotions of the youthful days that were gone could never be revived as they had once existed as waters they had welled up and as waters they had flowed forth never to return to their source  thoughts of these former yearsof the young warrior who lay cold beneath the heavy earthof the desponding father who mourned hopeless in the room abovegathered thick at her heart as she turned from her flowerbedsnot as in other days to pour forth her happiness to the music of her lute but to search laboriously for the sustenance of life  at first as she stooped over those places in the garden where she knew that fruits and vegetables had been planted by her own hand her tears blinded her  she hastily dashed them away and looked eagerly around  alas others had reaped the field from which she had hoped abundance in the early days of the famine numerians congregation had entered the garden and gathered for him whatever it contained its choicest and its homeliest products were alike exhausted withered leaves lay on the barren earth and naked branches waved over them in the air  she wandered from path to path searching amid the briars and thistles which already cast an aspect of ruin over the deserted place she explored its most hidden corners with the painful perseverance of despair but the same barrenness spread around her wherever she turned on this once fertile spot which she had entered with such joyful faith in its resources there remained but a few poor decayed roots dropped and forgotten amid tangled weeds and faded flowers  she saw that they were barely sufficient for one scanty meal as she collected them and returned slowly to the house  no words escaped her no tears flowed over her cheeks when she reascended the stepshope fear thought sensation itself had been stunned within her from the first moment when she had discovered that in the garden as in the house the inexorable famine had anticipated the last chances of relief  she entered the room and still holding the withered roots advanced mechanically to her fathers side  during her absence his mental and bodily faculties had both yielded to wearied naturehe lay in a deep heavy sleep   her mind experienced a faint relief when she saw that the fatal necessity of confessing the futility of the hopes she had herself awakened was spared her for a while  she knelt down by numerian and gently smoothed the hair over his brow then she drew the curtain across the window for she feared even that the breeze blowing through it might arouse him  a strange secret satisfaction at the idea of devoting to her father every moment of the time and every particle of the strength that might yet be reserved for her a ready resignation to death in dying for himoverspread her heart and took the place of all other aspirations and all other thoughts  she now moved to and fro through the room with a cautious tranquillity which nothing could startle she prepared her decayed roots for food with a patient attention which nothing could divert  lost through the aggravated miseries of her position to recent grief and present apprehension she could still instinctively perform the simple offices of the woman and the daughter as she might have performed them amid a peaceful nation and a prosperous home  thus do the firstborn affections outlast the exhaustion of all the stormy emotions all the aspiring thoughts of after years which may occupy but which cannot absorb the spirit within us thus does their friendly and familiar voice when the clamour of contending passions has died away in its own fury speak again serene and sustaining as in the early time when the mind moved secure within the limits of its native simplicity and the heart yet lay happy in the pure tranquillity of its first repose  the last scanty measure of food was soon prepared it was bitter and unpalatable when she tasted itlife could barely be preserved even in the most vigorous by provision so wretched but she set it aside as carefully as if it had been the most precious luxury of the most abundant feast  nothing had changed during the interval of her solitary employmenther father yet slept the gloomy silence yet prevailed in the street  she placed herself at the window and partially drew aside the curtain to let the warm breezes from without blow over her cold brow  the same ineffable resignation the same unnatural quietude which had sunk down over her faculties since she had entered the room overspread them still  surrounding objects failed to impress her attention recollections and forebodings stagnated in her mind  a marble composure prevailed over her features  sometimes her eyes wandered mechanically from the morsels of food by her side to her sleeping father as her one vacant idea of watching for his service till the feeble pulses of life had throbbed their last alternately revived and declined but no other evidences of bodily existence or mental activity appeared in her  as she now sat in the halfdarkened room by the couch on which her father reposedher features pale calm and rigid her form enveloped in cold white draperythere were moments when she looked like one of the penitential devotees of the primitive church appointed to watch in the house of mourning and surprised in her saintly vigil by the advent of death  time flowed onthe monotonous hours of the day waned again towards night and plague and famine told their lapse in the fated highways of rome  for father and child the sand in the glass was fast running out and neither marked it as it diminished  the sleeper still reposed and the guardian by his side still watched but now her weary gaze was directed on the street unconsciously attracted by the sound of voices which at length rose from it at intervals and by the light of the torches and lamps which appeared in the great palace of the senator vetranio as the sun gradually declined in the horizon and the fiery clouds around were quenched in the vapours of the advancing night steadily she looked upon the sight beneath and before her but even yet her limbs never moved no expression relieved the blank solemn peacefulness of her features  meanwhile the soft brief twilight glimmered over the earth and showed the cold moon poised solitary in the starless heaven then the stealthy darkness arose at her pale signal and closed slowly round the city of death    chapter 22  the banquet of famine  of all prophecies none are perhaps so frequently erroneous as those on which we are most apt to venture in endeavouring to foretell the effect of outward events on the characters of men  in no form of our anticipations are we more frequently baffled than in such attempts to estimate beforehand the influence of circumstance over conduct not only in others but also even in ourselves  let the event but happen and men whom we view by the light of our previous observation of them act under it as the living contradictions of their own characters  the friend of our daily social intercourse in the progress of life and the favourite hero of our historic studies in the progress of the page astonish exceed or disappoint our expectations alike  we find it as vain to foresee a cause as to fix a limit for the arbitrary inconsistencies in the dispositions of mankind  but though to speculate upon the future conduct of others under impending circumstances be but too often to expose the fallacy of our wisest anticipations to contemplate the nature of that conduct after it has been displayed is a useful subject of curiosity and may perhaps be made a fruitful source of instruction  similar events which succeed each other at different periods are relieved from monotony and derive new importance from the evervarying effects which they produce on the human character  thus in the great occurrence which forms the foundation of our narrative we may find little in the siege of rome looking at it as a mere event to distinguish it remarkably from any former siege of the citythe same desire for glory and vengeance wealth and dominion which brought alaric to her walls brought other invaders before him  but if we observed the effect of the gothic descent upon italy on the inhabitants of her capital we shall find ample matter for novel contemplation and unbounded surprise  we shall perceive as an astonishing instance of the inconsistencies of the human character the spectacle of a whole people resolutely defying an overwhelming foreign invasion at their very doors just at the period when they had fallen most irremediably from the highest position of national glory to the lowest depths of national degradation resisting an allpowerful enemy with inflexible obstinacy for the honour of the roman name which they had basely dishonoured or carelessly forgotten for ages past  we shall behold men who have hitherto laughed at the very name of patriotism now starving resolutely in their countrys cause who stopped at no villainy to obtain wealth now hesitating to employ their illgotten gains in the purchase of the most important of all gratificationstheir own security and peace  instances of the unimaginable effect produced by the event of the siege of rome on the characters of her inhabitants might be drawn from all classes from the lowest to the highest from patrician to plebeian but to produce them here would be to admit too long an interruption in the progress of the present narrative  if we are to enter at all into detail on such a subject it must be only in a case clearly connected with the actual requirements of our story and such a case may be found at this juncture in the conduct of the senator vetranio under the influence of the worst calamities attending the blockade of rome by the goths  who it may be asked knowing the previous character of this man his frivolity of disposition his voluptuous anxiety for unremitting enjoyment and ease his horror of the slightest approaches of affliction or pain would have imagined him capable of rejecting in disdain all the minor chances of present security and future prosperity which his unbounded power and wealth might have procured for him even in a faminestricken city and rising suddenly to the sublime of criminal desperation in the resolution to abandon life as worthless the moment it had ceased to run in the easy current of all former years  yet to this determination had he now arrived and still more extraordinary in this determination had he found others of his own patrician order to join him   the reader will remember his wild announcement of his intended orgie to the prefect pompeianus during the earlier periods of the siege that announcement was now to be fulfilled  vetranio had bidden his guests to the banquet of famine  a chosen number of the senators of the great city were to vindicate their daring by dying the revellers that they had lived by resigning in contempt all prospect of starving like the common herd on a lessening daily pittance of loathsome food by making their triumphant exit from a fettered and ungrateful life drowned in floods of wine and lighted by the fires of the wealthiest palace of rome  it had been intended to keep this frantic determination a profound secret to let the mighty catastrophe burst upon the remaining inhabitants of the city like a prodigy from heaven but the slaves intrusted with the organisation of the suicide banquet had been bribed to their tasks with wine and in the carelessness of intoxication had revealed to others whatever they heard within the palace walls  the news passed from mouth to mouth  there was enough in the prospect of beholding the burning palace and the drunken suicide of its desperate guests to animate even the stagnant curiosity of a famishing mob  on the appointed evening the people dragged their weary limbs from all quarters of the city towards the pincian hill  many of them died on the way  many lost their resolution to proceed to the end of their journey and took shelter sullenly in the empty houses on the road many found opportunities for plunder and crime as they proceeded which tempted them from their destination but many persevered in their purposethe living dragging the dying along with them the desperate driving the cowardly before them in malignant sport until they gained the palace gates  it was by their voices as they reached her ear from the street that the fastsinking faculties of antonina had been startled though not revived and there on the broad pavement lay these citizens of a fallen citya congregation of pestilence and crimea starving and an awful band  the moon brightened by the increasing darkness now clearly illuminated the street and revealed in a narrow space a various and impressive scene  one side of the roadway in which stood vetranios palace was occupied along each extremity as far as the eye could reach at night by the groves and outbuildings attached to the senators mansion the palace grounds at the higher and farther end of the streetlooking from the pincian gatecrossed it by a wide archway and then stretched backward until they joined the trees of the little garden of numerians abode in a line with this house but separated from it by a short space stood a long row of buildings let out floor by floor to separate occupants and towering to an unwieldy altitude for in ancient rome as in modern london in consequence of the high price of land in an overpopulated city builders could only secure space in a dwelling by adding inconveniently to its height  beyond these habitations rose the trees surrounding another patrician abode and beyond that the houses took a sudden turn and nothing more was visible in a straight line but the dusky indefinite objects of the distant view   the whole appearance of the street before vetranios mansion had it been unoccupied by the repulsive groups now formed in it would have been eminently beautiful at the hours of which we now write  the nobly symmetrical frontage of the palace itself with its graceful succession of long porticoes and colossal statues contrasted by the picturesquely irregular appearance of the opposite dwelling of numerian and the lofty houses by its side the soft indistinct masses of foliage running parallel along the upper ends of the street terminated and connected by the archway garden across the road on which was planted a group of tall pinetrees rising in gigantic relief against the transparent sky the brilliant light streaming across the pavement from vetranios gailycurtained windows immediately opposed by the tranquil moonlight which lit the more distant viewformed altogether a prospect in which the natural and the artificial were mingled together in the most exquisite proportionsa prospect whose ineffable poetry and beauty might on any other night have charmed the most careless eye and exalted the most frivolous mind  but now overspread as it was by groups of people gaunt with famine and hideous with disease startled as it was at gloomy intervals by contending cries of supplication defiance and despairits brightest beauties of nature and art appeared but to shine with an aspect of bitter mockery around the human misery which their splendour disclosed  upwards of a hundred peoplemostly of the lowest orderswere congregated before the senators devoted dwelling  some few among them passed slowly to and fro in the street their figures gliding shadowy and solemn through the light around them but the greater number lay on the pavement before the wall of numerians dwelling and the doorways of the lofty houses by its side  illuminated by the full glare of the light from the palace windows these groups huddled together in the distorted attitudes of suffering and despair assumed a fearful and unearthly appearance  their shrivelled faces their tattered clothing their wan forms here prostrate there halfraised were bathed in a steady red glow  high above them at the windows of the tall houses now tenanted in every floor by the dead appeared a few figures the mercenary guardians of the dying within  bending forward to look out upon the palace oppositetheir haggard faces showing pale in the clear moonlight  sometimes their voices were heard calling in mockery to the mass of people below to break down the strong steel gates of the palace and tear the full winecup from its masters lips sometimes those beneath replied with execrations which rose wildly mingled with the wailing of women and children the moans of the plaguestricken and the supplications of the famished to the slaves passing backwards and forwards behind the palace railings for charity and help  in the intervals when the tumult of weak voices was partially lulled there was heard a dull regular beating sound produced by those who had found dry bones on their road to the palace and were pounding them on the pavement in sheltered places for food  the wind which had been refreshing during the day had changed at sunset and now swept up slowly over the street in hot faint gusts plagueladen from the east particles of the ragged clothing on some prostrate forms lying most exposed in its course waved slowly to and fro as it passed like banners planted by death on the yielding defences of the citadel of life  it wound through the open windows of the palace hot and mephitic as if tainted with the breath of the foul and furious words which it bore onward into the banquetinghall of the senators reckless guests  driven over such scenes as now spread beneath it it derived from them a portentous significance it seemed to blow like an atmosphere exuded from the furnacedepths of centre earth breathing sinister warnings of some deadly convulsion in the whole fabric of nature over the thronged and dismal street  such was the prospect before the palace and such the spectators assembled in ferocious anxiety to behold the destruction of the senators abode  meanwhile within the walls of the building the beginning of the fatal orgie was at hand  it had been covenanted by the slaves who during the calamities in the besieged city had relaxed in their accustomed implicit obedience to their master with perfect impunity that as soon as the last labours of preparation were completed they should be free to consult their own safety by quitting the devoted palace  already some of the weakest and most timid of their numbers might be seen passing out hastily into the gardens by the back gates like engineers who had fired a train and were escaping ere the explosion burst forth  those among the menials who still remained in the palace were for the greater part occupied in drinking from the vases of wine which had been placed before them to preserve to the last moment their failing strength   the mockery of festivity had been extended even to their dressesgreen liveries girt with cherrycoloured girdles arrayed their wasted forms they drank in utter silence  not the slightest appearance of revelry or intoxication prevailed among their ranks  confusedly huddled together as if for mutual protection they ever and anon cast quick glances of suspicion and apprehension upon some six or eight of the superior attendants of the palace who walked backwards and forwards at the outer extremity of the hall occupied by their comrades and occasionally advancing along the straight passages before them to the front gates of the building appeared to be exchanging furtive signals with some of the people in the street  reports had been vaguely spread of a secret conspiracy between some of the principal of the slaves and certain chosen ruffians of the populace to murder all the inmates of the palace seize on its treasures and opening the city gates to the goths escape with their booty during the confusion of the pillage of rome  nothing had as yet been positively discovered but the few attendants who kept ominously apart from the rest were unanimously suspected by their fellows who now watched them over their winecups with anxious eyes  different as was the scene among the slaves still left in the palace from the scene among the people dispersed in the street the one was nevertheless in its own degree as gloomily suggestive of some great impending calamity as the other  the grand banquetinghall of the palace prepared though it now was for festivity wore a changed and melancholy aspect  the massive tables still ran down the whole length of the noble room surrounded by luxurious couches as in former days but not a vestige of food appeared upon their glittering surfaces  rich vases flasks and drinkingcups all filled with wine alone occupied the festal board above hanging low from the ceiling burnt ten large lamps corresponding to the number of guests assembled as the only procurable representatives of the hundreds of revellers who had feasted at vetranios expense during the brilliant nights that were now passed for ever  at the lower end of the room beyond the grand door of entrance hung a thick black curtain apparently intended to conceal mysteriously some object behind it  before the curtain burnt a small lamp of yellow glass raised upon a high gilt pole and around and beneath it heaped against the side walls and over part of the table lay a various and confused mass of rich objects all of a nature more or less inflammable and all besprinkled with scented oils  hundreds of yards of gorgeously variegated hangings rolls upon rolls of manuscripts gaudy dresses of all colours toys utensils innumerable articles of furniture formed in rare and beautifully inlaid woods were carelessly flung together against the walls of the apartment and rose high towards its ceiling  on every part of the tables not occupied by the vases of wine were laid gold and jewelled ornaments which dazzled the eye by their brilliancy while in extraordinary contrast to the magnificence thus profusely displayed there appeared in one of the upper corners of the hall an old wooden stand covered by a coarse cloth on which were placed one or two common earthenware bowls containing what my be termed a mash of boiled bran and salted horseflesh  any repulsive odour which might have arisen from this strange compound was overpowered by the various perfumes sprinkled about the room which mingling with the hot breezes wafted through the windows from the street produced an atmosphere as oppressive and debilitating in spite of its artificial allurements to the sense of smell as the air of a dungeon or the vapours of a marsh  remarkable as was the change in the present appearance of the banquetinghall it was but the feeble reflection of the alteration for the worse in the aspect of the host and his guests  vetranio reclined at the head of the table dressed in a scarlet mantle  an embroidered towel with purple tassels and fringes connected with rings of gold fell over his breast and silver and ivory bracelets were clasped round his arms  but of the former man the habiliments were all that remained his head was bent forward as if with the weakness of age his emaciated arms seemed barely able to support the weight of the ornaments which glittered on them his eyes had contracted a wild unsettled expression and a deadly paleness overspread the once plump and jovial cheeks which so many mistresses had kissed in mercenary rapture in other days  both in countenance and manner the elegant voluptuary of our former acquaintance at the court of ravenna was entirely and fatally changed of the other eight patricians who lay on the couches around their altered hostsome wild and reckless some gloomy and imbecileall had suffered in the ordeal of the siege the famine and the pestilence like him  such were the members of the assemblage represented from the ceiling by nine of the burning lamps  the tenth and last lamp indicated the presence of one more guest who reclined a little apart from the rest   this man was humpbacked his gaunt bony features were repulsively disproportioned to his puny frame which looked doubly contemptible enveloped as it was in an ample tawdry robe  sprung from the lowest ranks of the populace he had gradually forced himself into the favour of his superiors by his skill in coarse mimicry and his readiness in ministering to the worst vices of all who would employ him  having lost the greater part of his patrons during the siege finding himself abandoned to starvation on all sides he had now as a last resource obtained permission to participate in the banquet of famine to enliven it by a final exhibition of his buffoonery and to die with his masters as he had lived with themthe slave the parasite and the imitator of the lowest of their vices and the worst of their crimes  at the commencement of the orgie little was audible beyond the clash of the winecups the low occasional whispering of the revellers and the confused voices of the people without floating through the window from the street  the desperate compact of the guests now that its execution had actually begun awed them at first in spite of themselves  at length when there was a lull of all soundswhen a temporary calm prevailed over the noises outsidewhen the winecups were emptied and left for a moment ere they were filled againvetranio feebly rose and announcing with a mocking smile that he was about to speak a funeral oration over his friends and himself pointed to the wall immediately behind him as to an object fitted to awaken the astonishment or the hilarity of his moody guests  against the upper part of the wall were fixed various small statues in bronze and marble all representing the owner of the palace and all hung with golden plates  beneath these appeared the rentroll of his estates written in various colours on white vellum and beneath that scratched on the marble in faint irregular characters was no less an object than his own epitaph composed by himself  it may be translated thus       stop spectator      if thou has reverently cultivated the pleasures of the taste      pause amid these illustrious ruins of what was once      a palace      and peruse with respect on this stone      the epitaph of vetranio a senator      he was the first man who invented a successful      nightingale sauce      his bold and creative genius added much      and would have added more to      the art of cookery      but alas for the interests of science      he lived in the days when the gothic barbarians besieged      the imperial city      famine left him no matter for gustatory experiment      and pestilence deprived him of cooks to enlighten      opposed at all points by the force of adverse circumstances      finding his life of no further use to the culinary      interests of rome      he called his chosen friends together to assist him      conscientiously drank up every drop of wine remaining      in his cellars      lit the funeral pile of himself and his guests      in the banquetinghall of his own palace      and died as he had lived      the patriotic cato      of his countrys gastronomy  behold cried vetranio pointing triumphantly to the epitaphbehold in every line of those eloquent letters at once the seal of my resolute adherence to the engagement that unites us here and the foundation of my just claim to the reverence of posterity on the most useful of the arts which i exercised for the benefit of my species  read friends brethren fellowmartyrs of glory and as you read rejoice with me over the hour of our departure from the desecrated arena no longer worthy the celebration of the games of life  yet ere the feast proceeds hear me while i speaki make my last oration as the arbiter of our funeral sports as the host of the banquet of famine   who would sink ignobly beneath the slow superiority of starvation or perish under the quickly glancing steel of the barbarian conquerors sword when such a death as ours is offered to the choicewhen wine flows bright to drown sensation in oblivion and a palace and its treasures furnish alike the scene of the revel and the radiant funeral pile  the mighty philosophers of indiathe inspired gymnosophistsdied as we shall die  calanus before alexander zamarus in the presence of augustus lit the fires that consumed them  let us follow their glorious example  no worms will prey upon our bodies no hired mourners will howl discordant at our funerals  purified in the radiance of primeval fire we shall vanish triumphant from enemies and friendsa marvel to the earth a vision of glory to the gods themselves  is it a day more or a day less of life that is now of importance to us no it is only towards the easiest and the noblest death that our aspirations can turn  among our number there is now not one whom the care of existence can further occupy  here at my right hand reclines my estimable comrade of a thousand former feasts furius balburius placidus who when we sailed on the lucrine lake was wont to complain of intolerable hardship if a fly settled on the gilded folds of his umbrella who languished for a land of cimmerian darkness if a sunbeam penetrated the silken awnings of his gardenterrace and who now wrangles for a mouthful of horseflesh with the meanest of his slaves and would exchange the richest of his country villas for a basket of dirty bread  o furius balburius placidus of what further use is life to thee  there at my left i discern the changed though still expressive countenance of the resolute thascius he who chastised a slave with a hundred lashes if his warm water was not brought immediately at his command he whose serene contempt for every member of the human species by himself once ranked him among the greatest of human philosophers even he now wanders through his palace unserved and fawns upon the plebeian who will sell him a measure of wretched bran  oh admired friend oh rightly reasoning thascius say is there anything in rome which should delay thee on thy journey to the elysian fields  farther onward at the table drinking largely while i speak i behold o marcus moecius moemmius thy once plump and jovial formthou in former days accustomed to rejoice in the length of thy name because it enabled thy friends to drink the more in drinking a cup to each letter of it tell me what banquetinghall is now open to thee but thisand thus desolate in the city of thy social triumphs what should disincline thee to make of our festal solemnity thy last revel on earth  thou too facetious hunchback prince of parasites unscrupulous reburrus where but at this banquet of famine will thy buffoonery now procure for thee a draught of reviving wine  thy masters have abandoned thee to thy native dunghill  no more shalt thou wheedle for them when they borrow or bully for them when they pay  no more charges of poisoning or magic shalt thou forge to imprison their troublesome creditors  oh officious sycophant thy occupations are no more  drink while thou canst and then resign thy carcass to congenial mire  and you my five remaining friends whomlittle desirous of further delayi will collectively address think on the days when the suspicion of an infectious malady in any one of your companions was sufficient to separate you from the dearest of them when the slaves who came to you from their palaces underwent long ceremonies of ablution before they approached your presence and remembering this reflect that most perhaps all of us now meet here plaguetainted already and then say of what advantage is it to languish for a life which is yours no longer  no my friends my brethren of the banquet feeling that when life is worthless it is folly to live you cannot shrink from the lofty resolution by which we are bound you cannot pause on our joyful journey of departure from the scenes of earthi wrong you even by a doubt  let me now rather ask your attention for a worthier subjectthe enumeration of the festal ceremonies by which the progress of the banquet will be marked  that task concluded that last ceremony of my last welcome to you these halls duly performed i join you once more in your final homage to the deity of our social livesthe god of wine   it is not unknown to youlearned as you are in the jovial antiquities of the tablethat it was among some of the ancients a custom for a masterspirit of philosophy to presidethe teacher as well as the guestat their feasts  this usage it has been my care to revive and as this four meeting is unparalleled in its heroic design so it was my ambition to bid to it one unparalleled either as a teacher or a guest fired by an original idea unobserved of my slaves aided only by my singingboy the faithful glyco i have succeeded in placing behind that black curtain such an associate of our revels as you have never feasted with before whose appearance at the fitting moment must strike you irresistibly with astonishment and whose discoursenot of human wisdom onlywill be inspired by the midnight secrets of the tomb  by my side on this parchment lies the formulary of questions to be addressed by reburrus when the curtain is withdrawn to the oracle of the mysteries of other spheres  before you behold in those vases all that remains of my once wellstocked cellars and all that is provided for the palates of my guests we sit at the banquet of famine and no coarser sustenance than inspiring wine finds admittance at the bacchanalian board  yet should any among us in his last moments be feeble enough to pollute his lips with nourishment alone worthy of the vermin of the earth let him seek the wretched and scanty table type of the wretched and scanty food that covers it placed yonder in obscurity behind me  there will he find in all barely sufficient for one mans poorest meal the last morsels of the vilest nourishment left in the palace  for me my resolution is fixedit is only the generous winecup that shall now approach my lips  above me are the ten lamps answering to the number of my friends here assembled  one after another as the wine overpowers us those burning images of life will be extinguished in succession by the guests who remain proof against our draughts and the last of these lighting this torch at the last lamp will consummate the banquet and celebrate its glorious close by firing the funeral pile of my treasures heaped yonder against my palace walls  if my powers fail me before yours swear to me that whoever among you is able to lift the cup to his lips after it has dropped from the hands of the rest will fire the pile swear it by your lost mistresses your lost friends your lost treasuresby your own lives devoted to the pleasures of wine and the purification of fire  as with flashing eyes and flushed countenance vetranio sank back on his couch his companions inflamed with the wine they had already drunk arose cup in hand and turned towards him  their voices discordantly mingled pronounced the oath together then as they resumed their former positions their eyes all turned towards the black curtain in ardent expectation  they had observed the sinister and sarcastic expression of vetranios eye as he spoke of his concealed guest they knew that the hunchback reburrus possessed among his other powers of buffoonery the art of ventriloquism and they suspected the presence of some hideous or grotesque image of a heathen god or demon in the hidden recess which the jugglery of the parasite was to gift with the capacity of speech blasphemous comments upon life death and immortality were eagerly awaited the general impatience for the withdrawal of the curtain was perceived by vetranio who waving his hand for silence authoritatively exclaimed  the hour has not yet arrived  more draughts must be drunk more libations poured out ere the mystery of the curtain is revealed  ho glyco he continued turning towards the singingboy who had silently entered the room the moment is yours  tune your lyre and recite my last ode which i have addressed to you  let the charms of poetry preside over the feast of death  the boy advanced trembling his once ruddy face was colourless and haggard his eyes were fixed with a look of rigid terror on the black curtain his features palpably expressed the presence within him of some secret and overwhelming recollection which had crushed all his other faculties and perceptions  steadily almost guiltily averting his face from his masters countenance he stood by vetranios couch a frail and fallen being a mournful spectacle of perverted docility and degraded youth  still true however to the duties of his vocation he ran his thin trembling fingers over the lyre and mechanically preluded the commencement of the ode  but during the silence of attention which now prevailed the confused noises from the people in the street penetrated more distinctly into the banquetingroom and at this moment high above them allhoarse raving terrible rose the voice of one man  tell me not it cried of perfumes wafted from the palacefoul vapours flow from itsee they sink suffocating over methey bathe sky and earth and men who move around us in fierce green light  then other voices of men and women shrill and savage broke forth in interruption togetherpeace davus you awake the dead about you hide in the darkness you are plaguestruck your skin is shrivelled your gums are toothless  when the palace is fired you shall be flung into the flames to purify your rotten carcass  sing cried vetranio furiously observing the shudders that ran over the boys frame and held him speechless  strike the lyre as timotheus struck it before alexander  drown in melody the barking of the curs who wait for our offal in the street  feebly and interruptedly the terrified boy began the wild continuous noises of the moaning voices from without sounding their awful accompaniment to the infidel philosophy of his song as he breathed it forth in faint and faltering accents  it ran thus  to glyco      ah glyco why in flowrs arrayd     those festive wreaths less quickly fade     than brieflyblooming joy     those highprized friends who share your mirth     are counterfeits of brittle earth     false coind in deaths alloy      the bliss your notes could once inspire     when lightly oer the godlike lyre     your nimble fingers passd     shall spring the same from others skill     when youre forgot the music still     the player shall outlast      the suntouchd cloud that mounts the sky     that brightly glows to warm the eye     then fades we know not where     is image of the little breath     of lifeand then the doom of death     that you and i must share      helpless to make or mar our birth     we blindly grope the ways of earth     and live our paltry hour     sure that when life has ceased to please     to die at will in stoic ease     is yielded to our powr      who timely wise would meanly wait     the dull delay of tardy fate     when lifes delights are shorn     no  when its outer gloss has flown     lets fling the tarnishd bauble down     as lightly as twas worn  a health to glyco  a deep draught to a singer from heaven come down upon earth cried the guests seizing their winecups as the ode was concluded and draining them to the last drop  but their drunken applause fell noiseless upon the ear to which it was addressed  the boys voice as he sang the final stanza of the ode had suddenly changed to a shrill almost an unearthly tone then suddenly sank again as he breathed forth the last few notes and now as his dissolute audience turned towards him with approving glances they saw him standing before them cold rigid and voiceless  the next instant his fixed features were suddenly distorted his whole frame collapsed as if torn by an internal spasmhe fell back heavily to the floor  those around approached him with unsteady feet and raised him in their arms his soul had burst the bonds of vice in which others had entangled it the voice of death had whispered to the slave of the great despot crimebe free  we have heard the note of the swan singing its own funeral hymn said the patrician placidus looking in maudlin pity from the corpse of the boy to the face of vetranio which presented for the moment an involuntary expression of grief and remorse   our miracle of beauty and boygod of melody has departed before us to the elysian fields muttered the hunchback reburrus in harsh sarcastic accents  then during the short silence that ensued the voices from the street joined on this occasion to a noise of approaching footsteps on the pavement became again distinctly audible in the banquetinghall news news cried these fresh auxiliaries of the horde already assembled before the palace keep together you who still care for your lives  solitary citizens have been lured by strange men into desolate streets and never seen again  jars of newly salted flesh which there were no beasts left in the city to supply have been found in a butchers shop  keep together  keep together  no cannibals among the mob shall pollute the body of my poor boy cried vetranio rousing himself from his short lethargy of grief  ho thascius marcus you who can yet stand let us bear him to the funeral pile  he has died firsthis ashes shall be first consumed  the two patricians arose as the senator spoke and aided him in carrying the body to the lower end of the room where it was laid across the table beneath the black curtain and between the heaps of drapery and furniture piled up against each of the walls  then as his guests reeled back to their places vetranio remaining by the side of the corpse and seizing in his unsteady hands a small vase of wine exclaimed in tones of fierce exultation  the hour has comethe banquet of famine has endedthe banquet of death has begun  a health to the guest behind the curtain  filldrinkbehold  he drank deeply from the vase as he ceased and drew aside the black drapery above him  a cry of terror and astonishment burst from the intoxicated guests as they beheld in the recess now disclosed to view the corpse of an aged woman clothed in white and propped up on a high black throne with the face turned towards them and the arms artificially supported stretched out as if in denunciation over the banquetingtable  the lamp of yellow glass which burnt high above the body threw over it a lurid and flickering light the eyes were open the jaw had fallen the long grey tresses drooped heavily on either side of the white hollow cheeks  behold cried vetranio pointing to the corpsebehold my secret guest  who so fit as the dead to preside at the banquet of death compelling the aid of glyco shrouded by congenial night seizing on the first corpse exposed before me in the street i have set up there unsuspected by all the proper idol of our worship and philosopher at our feast  another health to the queen of the fatal revelsto the teacher of the mysteries of worlds unseenrescued from rotting unburied to perish in the consecrated flames with the senators of rome a healtha health to the mighty mother ere she begin the mystic revelations  filldrink  fired by their hosts example recovered from their momentary awe already inflamed by the mad recklessness of debauchery the guests started from their couches and with bacchanalian shouts answered vetranios challenge  the scene at this moment approached the supernatural  the wild disorder of the richly laden tables the wine flowing over the floor from overthrown vases the great lamps burning bright and steady over the confusion beneath the fierce gestures the disordered countenances of the revellers as they waved their jewelled cups over their heads in frantic triumph and then the gloomy and terrific prospect at the lower end of the hallthe black curtain the light burning solitary on its high pole the dead boy lying across the festal table the living master standing by his side and like an evil spirit pointing upward in mockery to the whiterobed corpse of the woman as it towered above all in its unnatural position with its skinny arms stretched forth with its ghastly features appearing to move as the faint and flickering light played over themproduced together such a combination of scarceearthly objects as might be painted but cannot be described it was an embodiment of a sorcerers visionan apocalypse of sin triumphing over the worlds last relics of mortality in the vaults of death   to your task reburrus cried vetranio when the tumult was lulled to your questions without delay  behold the teacher with whom you are to hold commune  peruse carefully the parchment in your hand question and question loudlyyou speak to the apathetic dead  for some time before the disclosure of the corpse the hunchback had been seated apart at the end of the banquetinghall opposite the blackcurtained recess conning over the manuscript containing the list of questions and answers which formed the impious dialogue he was to hold by the aid of his powers of ventriloquism with the violated dead  when the curtain was withdrawn he had looked up for a moment and had greeted the appearance of the sight behind it with a laugh of brutal derision returning immediately to the study of his blasphemous formulary which had been confided to his care  at the moment when vetranios commands were addressed to him he arose reeled down the apartment towards the corpse and opening the dialogue as he approached it began in loud jeering tones  speak miserable relict of decrepit mortality  he paused as he uttered the last word and gaining a point of view from which the light of the lamp fell full upon the solemn and stony features of the corpse looked up defiantly at it  in an instant a frightful change passed over him the manuscript dropped from his hand his deformed frame shrank and tottered a shrill cry of recognition burst from his lips more like the yell of a wild beast than the voice of a man  the next moment when the guests started up to question or deride him he turned slowly and faced them  desperate and drunken as they were his look awed them into utter silence  his face was deathlike in hue as the face of the corpse above himthick drops of perspiration trickled down it like rainhis dry glaring eyes wandered fiercely over the startled countenances before him and as he extended towards them his clenched hands he muttered in a deep gasping whisper  who has done this  my mother  my mother  as these few wordsof awful import though of simple formfell upon the ears of those whom he addressed such of them as were not already sunk in insensibility looked round on each other almost sobered for the moment and all speechless alike  not even the clash of the winecups was now heard at the banquetingtablenothing was audible but the sound still fitfully rising and falling of the voices of terror ribaldry and anguish from the street and the hoarse convulsive accents of the hunchback still uttering at intervals his fearful identification of the dead body above him  my  mother  my mother  at length vetranio who was the first to recover himself addressed the terrified and degraded wretch before him in tones which in spite of himself betrayed as he began an unwonted tremulousness and restraint what reburrus he cried are you already drunken to insanity that you call the first dead body which by chance i encountered in the street and by chance brought hither your mother was it to talk of your mother whom dead or alive we neither know nor care for that you were admitted here son of obscurity and inheritor of rags what are your plebeian parents to us he continued refilling his cup and lashing himself into assumed anger as he spoke to your dialogue without delay or you shall be flung from the windows to mingle with your rabbleequals in the street   neither by word nor look did the hunchback answer the senators menaces for him the voice of the living was stifled in the presence of the dead  the retribution that had gone forth against him had struck his moral as a thunderbolt might have stricken his physical being  his soul strove in agony within him as he thought on the awful fatality which had set the dead mother in judgment on the degraded sonwhich had directed the hand of the senator unwittingly to select the corpse of the outraged parent as the object for the infidel buffoonery of the reckless child at the very close of his impious career  his past life rose before him for the first time like a foul vision like a nightmare of horror impurity and crime  he staggered up the room groping his way along the wall as if the darkness of midnight had closed round his eyes and crouched down by the open window  beneath him rose the evil and ominous voices from the street around him spread the pitiless array of his masters before him appeared the denouncing vision of the corpse  he would have remained but a short time unmolested in his place of refuge but for an event which now diverted from him the attention of vetranio and his guests  drinking furiously to drown all recollection of the catastrophe they had just witnessed three of the revellers had already suffered the worst consequences of an excess which their weakened frames were illfitted to bear  one after another at short intervals they fell back senseless on their couches and one after another as they succumbed the three lamps burning nearest to them were extinguished  the same speedy termination to the debauch seemed to be in reserve for the rest of their companions with the exception of vetranio and the two patricians who reclined at his right hand and his left  these three still preserved the appearance of selfpossession but an ominous change had already overspread their countenances  the expression of wild joviality of fierce recklessness had departed from their wild features they silently watched each other with vigilant and suspicious eyes each in turn as he filled his winecup significantly handled the torch with which the last drinker was to fire the funeral pile  as the numbers of their rivals decreased and the flame of lamp after lamp was extinguished the fatal contest for a suicide supremacy assumed a present and powerful interest in which all other purposes and objects were forgotten  the corpse at the foot of the banquetingtable and the wretch cowering in his misery at the window were now alike unheeded in the bewildered and brutalised minds of the guests one sensation alone remainedthe intensity of expectation which precedes the result of a deadly strife  but ere longawakening the attention which might otherwise never have been arousedthe voice of the hunchback was heard as the spirit of repentance now moved within him uttering in wild moaning tones a strange confession of degradation and sinaddressed to none proceeding independent of consciousness or will from the depths of his stricken soul  he half raised himself and fixed his sunken eyes upon the dead body as these words dropped from his lips  it was the last time that i beheld her alive when she approached melonely and feeble and poorin the street beseeching me to return to her in the days of her old age and her solitude and to remember how she had loved me in my childhood for my very deformity how she had watched me throughout the highways of rome that none should oppress or deride me the tears ran down her cheeks she knelt to me on the hard pavement and i who had deserted her for her poverty to make myself a slave in palaces among the accursed rich flung down money to her as to a beggar who wearied me and passed on  she died desolate her body lay unburied and i knew it not  the son who had abandoned the mother never saw her more until she rose before him thereavenging horrible lifelessa sight of death never to leave him  woe woe to the accursed in his deformity and the accursed of his mothers corpse  he paused and fell back again to the ground grovelling and speechless the tyrannic thascius regarding him with a scowl of drunken wrath seized an empty vase and poising it in his unsteady hand prepared to hurl it at the hunchbacks prostrate form when again a single crya womansrising above the increasing uproar in the street rang shrill and startling through the banquetinghall the patrician suspended his purpose as he heard it mechanically listening with the halfstupid halfcunning attention of intoxication  help help shrieked the voice beneath the palace windowshe follows me stillhe attacked my dead child in my arms  as i flung myself down upon it on the ground i saw him watching his opportunity to drag it by the limbs from under mefamine and madness were in his eyesi drove him backi fledhe follows me stillsave us save us   at this instant her voice was suddenly stifled in the sound of fierce cries and rushing footsteps followed by an appalling noise of heavy blows directed at several points against the steel railings before the palace doors  between the blows which fell slowly and together at regular intervals the infuriated wretches whose last exertions of strength were strained to the utmost to deal them could be heard shouting breathlessly to each other  strike harder strike harder the back gates are guarded against us by our comrades admitted to the pillage of the palace instead of us  you who would share the booty strike firm the stones are at your feet the gates of entrance yield before you  meanwhile a confused sound of trampling footsteps and contending voices became audible from the lower apartments of the palace  doors were violently shut and openedshouts and execrations echoed and reechoed along the lofty stone passages leading from the slaves waitingrooms to the grand staircase treachery betrayed itself as openly within the building as violence still proclaimed itself in the assault on the gates outside  the chief slaves had not been suspected by their fellows without a cause the bands of pillage and murder had been organised in the house of debauchery and death the chosen adherents from the street had been secretly admitted through the garden gates and had barred and guarded them against further intrusionanother doom than the doom they had impiously prepared for themselves was approaching the devoted senators at the hands of the slaves whom they had oppressed and the plebeians whom they had despised  at the first sound of the assault without and the first intimation of the treachery within vetranio thascius and marcus started from their couches the remainder of the guests incapable either of thought or action lay in stupid insensibility awaiting their fate  these three men alone comprehended the peril that threatened them and maddened with drink defied in their ferocious desperation the death that was in store for them  hark they approach the rabble revolted from our rule cried vetranio scornfully to take the lives that we despise and the treasures that we have resigned  the hour has come i go to fire the pile that involves in one common destruction our assassins and ourselves  hold exclaimed thascius snatching the torch from his hand the entrance must first be defended or ere the flames are kindled the slaves will be here  whatever is movablecouches tables corpseslet us hurl them all against the door  as he spoke he rushed towards the blackcurtained recess to set the example to his companions by seizing the corpse of the woman but he had not passed more than half the length of the apartment when the hunchback who had followed him unheeded sprang upon him from behind and with a shrill cry fastening his fingers on his throat hurled him torn and senseless to the floor  who touches the body that is mine shrieked the deformed wretch rising from his victim and threatening with his bloodstained hands vetranio and marcus as they stood bewildered and uncertain for the moment whether first to avenge their comrade or to barricade the doorthe son shall rescue the mother  i go to bury her  atonement  atonement  he leaped upon the table as he spoke tore asunder with resistless strength the cords which fastened the corpse to the throne seized it in his arms and the next instant gained the door  uttering fierce inarticulate cries partly of anguish and partly of defiance he threw it open and stepped forward to descend when he was met at the head of the stairs by the band of assassins hurrying up with drawn swords and blazing torches to their work of pillage and death  he stood before themhis deformed limbs set as firmly on the ground as if he were preparing to descend the stairs at one leapwith the corpse raised high on his breast its unearthly features were turned towards them its bare arms were still stretched forth as they had been extended over the banquetingtable its grey hair streamed back and mingled with his own under the fitful illumination of the torches which played red and wild over him and his fearful burden the dead and the living looked joined to each other in one monstrous form   huddled together motionless on the stairs their shouts of vengeance and fury frozen on their lips the assassins stood for one moment staring mechanically with fixed spellbound eyes upon the hideous bulwark opposing their advance on the victims whom they had expected so easily to surprise  the next instant a superstitious panic seized them as the hunchback suddenly moved towards them to descend the corpse seemed to their terrorstricken eyes to be on the eve of bursting its way through their ranks  ignorant of its introduction into the palace imagining it in the revival of their slavish fears to be the spectral offspring of the magic incantations of the senators above they turned with one accord and fled down the stairs  the sound of their cries of fear grew fainter and fainter in the direction of the garden as they hurried through the secret gates at the back of the building  then the heavy regular tamp of the hunchbacks footsteps as he paced the solitary corridors after them bearing his burden of death became audible in awful distinctness then that sound also died away and was lost and nothing more was heard in the banquetingroom save the sharp clang of the blows still dealt against the steel railings from the street  but now these grew rare and more rare in their recurrence the strong metal resisted triumphantly the utmost efforts of the exhausted rabble who assailed it  as the minutes moved on the blows grew rapidly fainter and fewer soon they diminished to three struck at long intervals soon to one followed by deep execrations of despair and after that a great silence sank down over the palace and the street where such strife and confusion had startled the nightechoes but a few moments before  in the banquetinghall this rapid succession of eventsthe marvels of a few minutespassed before vetranio and marcus as visions beheld by their eyes but neither contained nor comprehended by their minds stolid in their obstinate recklessness stupefied by the spectacle of the startling perilsmenacing yet harmless terrifying though transitorywhich surrounded them neither of the senators moved a muscle or uttered a word from the period when thascius had fallen beneath the hunchbacks attack to the period when the last blow against the palace railings and the last sound of voices from the street had ceased in silence  then the wild current of drunken exultation suspended within them during this brief interval flowed once more doubly fierce in its old course insensible the moment after they had passed away to the warning and terrific scenes they had beheld each now looked round on the other with a glance of triumphant levity hark cried vetranio the mob without feeble and cowardly to the last abandon their puny efforts to force my palace gates behold our banquetingtables still sacred from the intrusion of the revolted menials driven before my guest from the dead like a flock of sheep before a single dog  say o marcus did i not well to set the corpse at the foot of our banquetingtable  what marvels has it not effected borne before us by the frantic reburrus as a banner of the hosts of death against the cowardly slaves whose fit inheritance is oppression and whose sole sensation is fear  see we are free to continue and conclude the banquet as we had designed  the gods themselves have interfered to raise us in security above our fellowmortals whom we despise  another health in gratitude to our departed guest the instrument of our deliverance under the auspices of omnipotent jove  as vetranio spoke marcus alone out of all the revellers answered his challenge  these twothe lastremaining combatants of the strifehaving drained their cups to the health proposed passed slowly down each side of the room looking contemptuously on their prostrate companions and extinguishing every lamp but the two which burnt over their own couches  then returning to the upper end of the tables they resumed their places not to leave them again until the fatal rivalry was finally decided and the moment of firing the pile had actually arrived  the torch lay between them the last vases of wine stood at their sides not a word escaped the lips of either to break the deep stillness prevailing over the palace  each fixed his eyes on the other in stern and searching scrutiny and cup for cup drank in slow and regular alternation  the debauch which had hitherto presented a spectacle of brutal degradation and violence now that it was restricted to two men onlyeach equally unimpressed by the scenes of horror he had beheld each vying with the other for the attainment of the supreme of depravityassumed an appearance of hardly human iniquity it became a contest for a satanic superiority of sin  for some time little alteration appeared in the countenances of either of the suiciderivals but they had now drunk to that final point of excess at which wine either acts as its own antidote or overwhelms in fatal suffocation the pulses of life  the crisis in the strife was approaching for both and the first to experience it was marcus vetranio as he watched him observed a dark purple flush overspreading his face hitherto pale almost colourless  his eyes suddenly dilated he panted for breath  the vase of wine when he strove with a last effort to fill his cup from it rolled from his hand to the floor  the stare of death was in his face as he halfraised himself and for one instant looked steadily on his companion the moment after without word or groan he dropped backward over his couch  the contest of the night was decided  the host of the banquet and the master of the palace had been reserved to end the one and to fire the other  a smile of malignant triumph parted vetranios lips as he now arose and extinguished the last lamp burning besides his own  that done he grasped the torch  his eyes as he raised it wandered dreamily over the array of his treasures and the forms of his dead or insensible fellowpatricians around him to be consumed by his act in annihilating fire  the sensation of his solemn nightsolitude in his fated palace began to work in vivid and varying impressions on his mind which was partially recovering some portion of its wonted acuteness under the bodily reaction now produced in him by the very extravagance of the nights excess  his memory began to retrace confusedly the scenes with which the dwelling that he was about to destroy had been connected at distant or at recent periods  at one moment the pomp of former banquets the jovial congregation of guests since departed or dead revived before him at another he seemed to be acting over again his secret departure from his dwelling on the night before his last feast his stealthy return with the corpse that he had dragged from the street his toil in setting it up in mockery behind the black curtain and inventing the dialogue to be spoken before it by the hunchback now his thoughts reverted to the minutest circumstances of the confusion and dismay among the members of his household when the first extremities of the famine began to be felt in the city and now without visible connection or cause they turned suddenly to the morning when he had hurried through the most solitary paths in his grounds to meet the betrayer ulpius at numerians garden gate  once more the image of antoninaso often present to his imagination since the original was lost to his eyesgrew palpable before him  he thought of her as listening at his knees to the sound of his lute as awakening bewildered and terrified in his arms as flying distractedly before her fathers wrath as now too surely lying dead in her beauty and her innocence amid the thousand victims of the famine and the plague  these and other reflections while they crowded in whirlwind rapidity on his mind wrought no alteration in the deadly purpose which they suspended  his delay in lighting the torch was the unconscious delay of the suicide secure in his resolution ere he lifts the poison to his lipswhen life rises before him as a thing that is past and he stands for one tremendous moment in the dark gap between the present and the futureno more the pilgrim of timenot yet the inheritor of eternity  so in the dimly lighted hall surrounded by the victims whom he had hurried before him to their doom stood the lonely master of the great palace and so spoke within him the mysterious voices of his last earthly thoughts  gradually they sank and ceased and stillness and vacancy closed like dark veils over his mind  starting like one awakened from a trance he once more felt the torch in his hand and once more the expression of fierce desperation appeared in his eyes as he lit it steadily at the lamp above him  the dew was falling pure to the polluted earth the light breezes sang their low daybreak anthem among the leaves to the power that bade them forth night had expired and morning was already born of it as vetranio with the burning torch in his hand advanced towards the funeral pile   he had already passed the greater part of the length of the room when a faint sound of footsteps ascending a private staircase which led to the palace gardens and communicated with the lower end of the banquetinghall by a small door of inlaid ivory suddenly attracted his attention he hesitated in his deadly purpose listening to the slow regular approaching sound which feeble though it was struck mysteriously impressive upon his ear in the dreary silence of all things around him holding the torch high above his head as the footsteps came nearer he fixed his eyes in intense expectation upon the door  it opened and the figure of a young girl clothed in white stood before him  one moment he looked upon her with startled eyes the next the torch dropped from his hand and smouldered unheeded on the marble floor  it was antonina  her face was overspread with a strange transparent paleness her once soft round cheeks had lost their girlish beauty of form her expression ineffably mournful hopeless and subdued threw a simple spiritual solemnity over her whole aspect  she was changed awfully changed to the profligate senator from the being of his former admiration but still there remained in her despairing eyes enough of the old look of gentleness and patience surviving through all anguish and dread to connect her even as she was now with what she had been she stood in the chamber of debauchery and suicide between the funeral pile and the desperate man who was vowed to fire it a feeble helpless creature yet powerful in the influence of her presence at such a moment and in such a form as a saving and reproving spirit armed with the omnipotence of heaven to mould the purposes of man  awed and astounded as if he beheld an apparition from the tomb vetranio looked upon this young girlwhom he had loved with the least selfish passion that ever inspired him whom he had lamented as long since lost and dead with the sincerest grief he had ever felt whom he now saw standing before him at the very moment ere he doomed himself to death altered desolate supplicatingwith emotions which held him speechless in wonder and even in dread  while he still gazed upon her in silence he heard her speaking to him in low melancholy imploring accents which fell upon his ear after the voices of terror and desperation that had risen around him throughout the night like tones never addressed to it before  numerian my father is sinking under the famine she began if no help is given to him he may die even before sunrise  you are rich and powerful i have come to you having nothing now but his life to live for to beg sustenance for him  she paused overpowered for the moment and bent her eyes wistfully on the senators face  then seeing that he vainly endeavoured to answer her her head drooped upon her breast and her voice sank lower as she continued  i have striven for patience under much sorrow and pain through the long night that is past my eyes were heavy and my spirit was faint i could have rendered up my soul willingly in my loneliness and feebleness to god who gave it but that it was my duty to struggle for my life and my fathers now that i was restored to him after i had lost all beside  i could not think or move or weep as looking forth upon your palace i watched and waited through the hours of darkness  but as morning dawned the heaviness at my heart was lightened i remembered that the palace i saw before me was yours and though the gates were closed i knew that i could reach it through your garden that joins to my fathers land  i had none in rome to ask mercy of but you so i set forth hastily ere my weakness should overpower me remembering that i had inherited much misery at your hands but hoping that you might pity me for what i had suffered when you saw me again  i came wearily through the garden it was long before i found my way hither will you send me back as helpless as i came  you first taught me to disobey my father in giving me the lute will you refuse to aid me in succouring him now  he is all that i have left in the world  have mercy upon himhave mercy upon me   again she looked up in vetranios face  his trembling lips moved but still no sound came from them  the expression of confusion and awe yet prevailed over his features as he pointed slowly towards the upper end of the banquetingtable  to her this simple action was eloquent beyond all power of speech she turned her feeble steps instantly in the direction he had indicated  he watched her by the light of the single lamp that still burnt passingstrong in the shielding inspiration of her good purposeamid the bodies of his suicide companions without pausing on her way having gained the upper end of the room she took from the table a flask of wine and from the wooden stand behind it the bowl of offal disdained by the guests at the fatal banquet returning immediately to the spot where vetranio still stood  here she stopped for a moment as if about to speak once more but her emotions overpowered her  from the sources which despair and suffering had dried up the longprisoned tears once more flowed forth at the bidding of gratitude and hope she looked upon the senator silent as himself and her expression at that instant was destined to remain on his memory while memory survived then with faltering and hasty steps she departed by the way she had come and in the great palace which his evil supremacy over the wills of others had made a hideous charnelhouse he was once more left alone  he made no effort to follow or detain her as she left him  the torch still smouldered beside him on the floor but he never stooped to take it up he dropped down on a vacant couch stupefied by what he had beheld  that which no entreaties no threats no fierce violence of opposition could have effected in him the appearance of antonina had producedit had forced him to pause at the very moment of the execution of his deadly design  he remembered how from the very first day when he had seen her she had mysteriously influenced the whole progress of his life how his ardour to possess her had altered his occupations and even interrupted his amusements how all his energy and all his wealth had been baffled in the attempt to discover her when she fled from her fathers house how the first feeling of remorse that he had ever known had been awakened within him by his knowledge of the share he had had in producing her unhappy fate  recalling all this reflecting that had she approached him at an earlier period she would have been driven back affrighted by the drunken clamour of his companions and had she arrived at a later would have found his palace in flames thinking at the same time of her sudden presence in the banquetinghall when he had believed her to be dead when her appearance at the moment before he fired the pile was most irresistible in its supernatural influence over his actionsthat vague feeling of superstitious dread which exists intuitively in all mens minds which had never before been aroused in his thrilled through him  his eyes were fixed on the door by which she had departed as if he expected her to return  her destiny seemed to be portentously mingled with his own his life seemed to move his death to wait at her bidding  there was no repentance no moral purification in the emotions which now suspended his bodily faculties in inaction he was struck for the time with a mental paralysis  the restless moments moved onward and onward and still he delayed the consummation of the ruin which the nights debauch had begun  slowly the tender daylight grew and brightened in its beauty warmed the cold prostrate bodies in the silent hall and dimmed the faint glow of the wasting lamp no black mist of smoke no red glare of devouring fire arose to quench its fair lustre no roar of flames interrupted the murmuring morning tranquillity of nature or startled from their heavy repose the exhausted outcasts stretched upon the pavement of the street still the noble palace stood unshaken on its firm foundations still the adornments of its porticoes and its statues glittered as of old in the rays of the rising sun and still the hand of the master who had sworn to destroy it as he had sworn to destroy himself hung idly near the torch which lay already extinguished in harmless ashes at his feet    chapter 23  the last efforts of the besieged  we return to the street before the palace  the calamities of the siege had fallen fiercely on those who lay there during the night  from the turbulent and ferocious mob of a few hours since not even the sound of a voice was now heard  some surprised in a paroxysm of hunger by exhaustion and insensibility lay with their hands half forced into their mouths as if in their ravenous madness they had endeavoured to prey upon their own flesh  others now and then wearily opened their languid eyes upon the street no longer regardful in the present extremity of their sufferings of the building whose destruction they had assembled to behold but watching for a fancied realisation of the visions of richly spread tables and speedy relief called up before them as if in mockery by the delirium of starvation and disease  the sun had as yet but slightly risen above the horizon when the attention of the few among the populace who still preserved some perception of outward events was suddenly attracted by the appearance of an irregular processioncomposed partly of citizens and partly of officers of the senate and headed by two menwhich slowly approached from the end of the street leading into the interior of the city  this assembly of persons stopped opposite vetranios palace and then such members of the mob who watched them as were not yet entirely abandoned by hope heard the inspiring news that the procession they beheld was a procession of peace and that the two men who headed it were the spaniard basilius a governor of a province and johannes the chief of the imperial notariesappointed ambassadors to conclude a treaty with the goths  as this intelligence reached them men who had before appeared incapable of the slightest movement now rose painfully yet resolutely to their feet and crowded round the two ambassadors as round two angels descended to deliver them from bondage and death  meanwhile some officers of the senate finding the front gates of the palace closed against them proceeded to the garden entrance at the back of the building to obtain admission to its owner  the absence of vetranio and his friends from the deliberations of the government had been attributed to their disgust at the obstinate and unavailing resistance offered to the goths  now therefore when submission had been resolved upon it had been thought both expedient and easy to recall them peremptorily to their duties  in addition to this motive for seeking the interior of the palace the servants of the senate had another errand to perform there  the widely rumoured determination of vetranio and his associates to destroy themselves by fire in the frenzy of a last debauchdisbelieved or disregarded while the more imminent perils of the city were under considerationbecame a source of some apprehension and anxiety to the acting members of the roman council now that their minds were freed from part of the responsibility which had weighed on them by their resolution to treat for peace  accordingly the persons now sent into the palace were charged with the duty of frustrating its destruction if such an act had been really contemplated as well as the duty of recalling its inmates to their appointed places in the senatehouse  how far they were enabled at the time of their entrance into the banquetinghall to accomplish their double mission the reader is well able to calculate  they found vetranio still in the place which he had occupied since antonina had quitted him  startled by their approach from the stupor which had hitherto weighed on his faculties the desperation of his purpose returned he made an effort to tear from its place the lamp which still feebly burned and to fire the pile in defiance of all opposition  but his strength already taxed to the utmost failed him  uttering impotent threats of resistance and revenge he fell swooning and helpless into the arms of the officers of the senate who held him back one of them was immediately dismissed while his companions remained in the palace to communicate with the leaders of the assembly outside his report concluded the two ambassadors moved slowly onward separating themselves from the procession which had accompanied them and followed only by a few chosen attendantsa mournful and a degraded embassy sent forth by the people who had once imposed their dominion their customs and even their language on the eastern and western worlds to bargain with the barbarians whom their fathers had enslaved for the purchase of a disgraceful peace   on the departure of the ambassadors all the spectators still capable of the effort repaired to the forum to await their return and were joined there by members of the populace from other parts of the city it was known that the first intimation of the result of the embassy would be given from this place and in the eagerness of their anxiety to hear it in the painful intensity of their final hopes of deliverance even death itself seemed for a while to be arrested in its fatal progress through the ranks of the besieged  in silence and apprehension they counted the tardy moments of delay and watched with sickening gaze the shadows lessening and lessening as the sun gradually rose in the heavens to the meridian point  at length after an absence that appeared of endless duration the two ambassadors reentered rome neither of them spoke as they hurriedly passed through the ranks of the people but their looks of terror and despair were alleloquent to every beholdertheir mission had failed  for some time no member of the government appeared to have resolution enough to come forward and harangue the people on the subject of the unsuccessful embassy  after a long interval however the prefect pompeianus himself urged partly by the selfish entreaties of his friends and partly by the childish love of display which still adhered to him through all his present anxieties and apprehensions stepped into one of the lower balconies of the senatehouse to address the citizens beneath him  the chief magistrate of rome was no longer the pompous and portly personage whose intrusion on vetranios privacy during the commencement of the siege has been described previously  the little superfluous flesh still remaining on his face hung about it like an illfitting garment his tones had become lachrymose the oratorical gestures with which he was wont to embellish profusely his former speeches were all abandoned nothing remained of the original man but the bombast of his language and the impudent complacency of his selfapplause which now appeared in contemptible contrast to his crestfallen demeanour and his disheartening narrative of degradation and defeat  men of rome let each of you exercise in his own person the heroic virtues of a regulus or a cato the prefect began  a treaty with the barbarians is out of our power  it is the scourge of the empire alaric himself who commands the invading forces  vain were the dignified remonstrances of the grave basilius futile was the persuasive rhetoric of the astute johannes addressed to the slaughtering and vainglorious goth  on their admission to his presence the ambassadors anxious to awe him into a capitulation enlarged with sagacious and commendable patriotism on the expertness of the romans in the use of arms their readiness for war and their vast numbers within the city walls  i blush to repeat the barbarians reply  laughing immoderately he answered the thicker the grass the easier it is to cut  still undismayed the ambassadors changing their tactics talked indulgently of their willingness to purchase a peace  at this proposal his insolence burst beyond all bounds of barbarous arrogance i will not relinquish the siege he cried until i have delivered to me all the gold and silver in the city all the household goods in it and all the slaves from the northern countries  what then o king will you leave us asked our amazed ambassadors  your lives answered the implacable goth  hearing this even the resolute basilius and the wise johannes despaired  they asked time to communicate with the senate and left the camp of the enemy without further delay  such was the end of the embassy such the arrogant ferocity of the barbarian foe  here the prefect paused from sheer weakness and want of breath  his oration however was not concluded  he had disheartened the people by his narrative of what had occurred to the ambassadors he now proceeded to console them by his relation of what had occurred to himself when after an interval he thus resumed   but even yet o citizens of rome it is not time to despair  there is another chance of deliverance still left to us and that chance has been discovered by me  it was my lot during the absence of the ambassadors to meet with certain men of tuscany who had entered rome a few days before the beginning of the siege and who spoke of a project for relieving the city which they would communicate to the prefect alone ever anxious for the public welfare daring all treachery from strangers for advantage of my office i accorded to these men a secret interview they told me of a startling and miraculous event  the town of neveia lying as you well know in the direct road of the barbarians when they marched upon rome was protected from their pillaging bands by a tempest of thunder and lightning terrible to behold  this tempest arose not as you may suppose from an accidental convulsion of the elements but was launched over the heads of the invaders by the express interference of the tutelary deities of the town invocated by the inhabitants who returned in their danger to the practice of their ancient manner of worship  so said the men of tuscany and such pious resources as those employed by the people of neveia did they recommend to the people of rome  for my part i acknowledge to you that i have faith in their project  the antiquity of our former worship is still venerable in my eyes  the prayers of the priests of our new religion have wrought no miraculous interference in our behalf  let us therefore imitate the example of the inhabitants of neveia and by the force of our invocations hurl the thunders of jupiter on the barbarian camp  let us trust for deliverance to the potent interposition of the gods whom our fathers worshippedthose gods who now perhaps avenge themselves for our desertion of their temples by our present calamities  i go without delay to propose to the bishop innocentius and to the senate the public performance of solemn ceremonies of sacrifice at the capitol  i leave you in the joyful assurance that the gods appeased by our returning fidelity to our altars will not refuse the supernatural protection which they accorded to the people of a provincial town to the citizens of rome  no sounds either of applause or disapprobation followed the prefects notable proposal for delivering the city from the besiegers by the public apostasy of the besieged  as he disappeared from their eyes the audience turned away speechless  an universal despair now overpowered in them even the last energies of discord and crime they resigned themselves to their doom with the gloomy indifference of beings in whom all mortal sensations all human passions good or evil were extinguished  the prefect departed on his illomened expedition to propose the practice of paganism to the bishop of a christian church but no profitable effort for relief was even suggested either by the government or the people  and so this day drew in its turn towards a closemore mournful and more disastrous more fraught with peril misery and gloom than the days that had preceded it  the next morning dawned but no preparations for the ceremonies of the ancient worship appeared at the capitol  the senate and the bishop hesitated to incur the responsibility of authorising a public restoration of paganism the citizens hopeless of succour heavenly or earthly remained unheedful as the dead of all that passed around them  there was one man in rome who might have succeeded in rousing their languid energies to apostasy but where and how employed was he  now when the opportunity for which he had laboured resolutely though in vain through a long existence of suffering degradation and crime had gratuitously presented itself more tempting and more favourable than even he in his wildest visions of success had ever dared to hopewhere was ulpius  hidden from mens eyes like a foul reptile in his lurkingplace in the deserted templenow raving round his idols in the fury of madness now prostrate before them in idiot adorationweaker for the interests of his worship at the crisis of its fate than the weakest child crawling famished through the streetsthe victim of his own evil machinations at the very moment when they might have led him to triumphthe object of that worst earthly retribution by which the wicked are at once thwarted doomed and punished here as hereafter through the agency of their own sins   three more days passed  the senate their numbers fast diminishing in the pestilence occupied the time in vain deliberations or in moody silence  each morning the weary guards looked forth from the ramparts with the fruitless hope of discerning the longpromised legions from ravenna on their way to rome and each morning devastation and death gained ground afresh among the hapless besieged  at length on the fourth day the senate abandoned all hope of further resistance and determined on submission whatever might be the result it was resolved that another embassy composed of the whole acting senate and followed by a considerable train should proceed to alaric that one more effort should be made to induce him to abate his ruinous demands on the conquered and that if this failed the gates should be thrown open and the city and the people abandoned to his mercy in despair  as soon as the procession of this last roman embassy was formed in the forum its numbers were almost immediately swelled in spite of opposition by those among the mass of the people who were still able to move their languid and diseased bodies and who in the extremity of their misery had determined at all hazards to take advantage of the opening of the gates and fly from the city of pestilence in which they were immured careless whether they perished on the swords of the goths or languished unaided on the open plains  all power of enforcing order had long since been lost the few soldiers gathered about the senators made one abortive effort to drive the people back and then resigned any further resistance to their will  feebly and silently the spiritbroken assembly now moved along the great highways so often trodden to the roar of martial music and the shouts of applauding multitudes by the triumphal processions of victorious rome and from every street as it passed on the wasted forms of the people stole out like spectres to join it  among these as the embassy approached the pincian gate were two hurrying forth to herd with their fellowsufferers on whose fortunes in the fallen city our more particular attention has been fixed  to explain their presence on the scene if such an explanation be required it is necessary to digress for a moment from the progress of events during the last days of the siege to the morning when antonina departed from vetranios palace to return with her succour of food and wine to her fathers house  the reader is already acquainted from her own short and simple narrative with the history of the closing hours of her mournful night vigil by the side of her sinking parent and with the motives which prompted her to seek the palace of the senator and entreat assistance in despair from one whom she only remembered as the profligate destroyer of her tranquility under her fathers roof it is now therefore most fitting to follow her on her way back through the palace gardens  no living creature but herself trod the grassy paths along which she hastened with faltering stepsthose paths which she dimly remembered to have first explored when in former days she ventured forth to follow the distant sounds of vetranios lute  in spite of her vague heavy sensations of solitude and grief this recollection remained painfully present to her mind unaccountably mingled with the dark and dreary apprehension which filled her heart as she hurried onward until she once more entered her fathers dwelling and then as she again approached his couch every other feeling became absorbed in a faint overpowering fear lest after all her perseverance and success in her errand of filial devotion she might have returned too late   the old man still livedhis weary eyes opened gladly on her when she aroused him to partake of the treasured gifts from the senators banqueting table  the wretched food which the suicideguests had disdained and the simple flask of wine which they would have carelessly quaffed at one draught were viewed both by parent and child as the saving and invigorating sustenance of many days  after having consumed as much as they dared of their precarious supply the remainder was carefully husbanded  it was the last sign and promise of life to which they lookedthe humble yet precious store in which alone they beheld the earnest of their security for a few days longer from the pangs of famine and the separation of death  and now with their small provision of food and wine set like a beacon of safety before their sight a deep dreamlike serenitythe sleep of the oppressed and wearied facultiesarose over their minds under its mysterious and tranquilising influence all impressions of the gloom and misery in the city of the fatal evidences around them of the duration of the siege faded away before their perceptions as dim retiring objects which the eye loses in vacancy  gradually as the day of the first unsuccessful embassy declined their thoughts began to flow back gently to the world of bygone events which had crumbled into oblivion beneath the march of time her first recollections of her earliest childhood revived in antoninas memory and then mingled strangely with tearful remembrances of the last words and looks of the young warrior who had expired by her side and with calm solemn thoughts that the beloved spirit emancipated from the sphere of shadows might now be hovering near the quiet gardengrave where her bitterest tears of loneliness and affliction had been shed or moving around heran invisible and blessed presenceas she sat at her fathers feet and mourned their earthly separation  in the emotions thus awakened there was nothing of bitterness or agonythey calmed and purified the heart through which they moved she could now speak to the old man for the first time of her days of absence from him of the brief joys and long sorrows of her hours of exile without failing in her melancholy tale  sometimes her father listened to her in sorrowful and speechless attention or spoke when she paused of consolation and hope as she had heard him speak among his congregation while he was yet strong in his resolution to sacrifice all things for the reformation of the church  sometimes resigning himself to the influence of his thoughts as they glided back to the times that were gone he again revealed to her the changing events of his past lifenot as before with unsteady accents and wandering eyes but now with a calmness of voice and a coherence of language which forbade her to doubt the strange and startling narrative that she heard  once more he spoke of the image of his lost brother as he had parted from him in his boyhood still present to his mind of the country that he had quitted in after years of the name that he had changedfrom cleander to numerianto foil his former associates if they still pursued him and of the ardent desire to behold again the companion of his first home which now when his daughter was restored to him when no other earthly aspiration but this was unsatisfied remained at the close of his life the last longing wish of his heart  such was the communion in which father and daughter passed the hours of their short reprieve from the judgment of famine pronounced against the city of their sojourn so did they live as it were in a quiet interval of existence in a tranquil pause between the toil that is over and the toil that is to come in the hard labour of life  but the term to these short days of repose after long suffering and grief was fast approaching  the little hoard of provision diminished as rapidly as the stores that had been anxiously collected before it and on the morning of the second embassy to alaric the flask of wine and the bowl of food were both emptied  the brief dream of security was over and gone the terrible realities of the struggle for life had begun again  where or to whom could they now turn for help  the siege still continued the food just exhausted was the last food that had been left on the senators table to seek the palace again would be to risk refusal perhaps insult as the result of a second entreaty for aid where all power of conferring it might now but too surely be lost such were the thoughts of antonina as she returned the empty bowl to its former place but she gave them no expression in words   she saw with horror that the same expression of despair almost of frenzy which had distorted her fathers features on the day of her restoration to him now marked them again  once more he tottered towards the window murmuring in his bitter despondency against the delusive security and hope which had held him idle for the interests of his child during the few days that were past  but as he now looked out on the beleaguered city he saw the populace hastening along the gloomy street beneath as rapidly as their wearied limbs would carry them to join the embassy  he heard them encouraging each other to proceed to seize the last chance of escaping through the open gates from the horrors of famine and plague and caught the infection of the recklessness and despair which had seized his fellowsufferers from one end of rome to the other  turning instantly he grasped his daughters hand and drew her from the room commanding her to come forth with him and join the citizens in their flight ere it was too late  startled by his words and actions she vainly endeavoured as she obeyed to impress her father with the dread of the goths which her own bitter experience taught her to feel now that her only protector among them lay cold in the grave  with numerian as with the rest of the people all apprehension all doubt all exercise of reason was overpowered by the one eager idea of escaping from the fatal precincts of rome  so they mingled with the throng herding affrightedly together in the rear of the embassy and followed in their ranks as best they might  the sun shone down brightly from the pure blue sky the wind bore into the city the sharp threatening notes of the trumpets from the gothic camp as the pincian gate was opened to the ambassadors and their train with one accord the crowd instantly endeavoured to force their way out after them in a mass but they now moved in a narrow space and were opposed by a large reinforcement of the city guard  after a short struggle they were overpowered and the gates were closed  some few of the strongest and the foremost of their numbers succeeded in following the ambassadors the greater part however remained on the inner side of the gate pressing closely up to it in their impatience and despair like prisoners awaiting their deliverance or preparing to force their escape  among these feeblest amid the most feeble were numerian and antonina hemmed in by the surrounding crowd and shut out either from flight from the city or a return to home    chapter 24  the grave and the camp  while the second and last embassy from the senate proceeds towards the tent of the gothic king while the streets of rome are deserted by all but the dead and the living populace crowd together in speechless expectation behind the barrier of the pincian gate an opportunity is at length afforded of turning our attention towards a scene from which it has been long removed  let us now revisit the farmhouse in the suburbs and look once more on the quiet garden and on hermanrics grave  the tranquility of the bright warm day is purest around the retired path leading to the little dwelling here the fragrance of wild flowers rises pleasantly from the waving grass the lulling monotonous hum of insect life pervades the light steady air the sunbeams intercepted here and there by the clustering trees fall in irregular patches of brightness on the shady ground and saving the birds which occasionally pass overhead singing in their flight no living creature appears on the quiet scene until gaining the wicketgate which leads into the farmhouse garden we look forth upon the prospect within  there following the small circular footpath which her own persevering steps have day by day already traced appears the form of a solitary woman pacing slowly about the mound of grassy earth which marks the grave of the young goth   for some time she proceeds on her circumscribed round with as much undeviating mechanical regularity as if beyond that narrow space rose a barrier which caged her from ever setting foot on the earth beyond at length she pauses in her course when it brings her nearest to the wicket advances a few steps towards it then recedes and recommences her monotonous progress and then again breaking off on her round finally succeeds in withdrawing herself from the confines of the grave passes through the gate and following the path to the highroad slowly proceeds towards the eastern limits of the gothic camp  the fixed ghastly unfeminine expression on her features marks her as the same woman whom we last beheld as the assassin at the farmhouse but beyond this she is hardly recognisable again  her formerly powerful and upright frame is bent and lean her hair waves in wild white locks about her shrivelled face all the rude majesty of her form has departed there is nothing to show that it is still goisvintha haunting the scene of her crime but the savage expression debasing her countenance and betraying the evil heart within unsubdued as ever in its yearning for destruction and revenge  since the period when we last beheld her removed in the custody of the huns from the dead body of her kinsman the farmhouse had been the constant scene of her pilgrimage from the camp the chosen refuge where she brooded in solitude over her fierce desires  scorning to punish a woman whom he regarded as insane for an absence from the tents of the goths which was of no moment wither to the army or to himself alaric had impatiently dismissed her from his presence when she was brought before him  the soldiers who had returned to bury the body of their chieftain in the garden of the farmhouse found means to inform her secretly of the charitable act which they had performed at their own peril but beyond this no further intercourse was held with her by any of her former associates  all her actions favoured their hasty belief that her faculties were disordered and others shunned her as she shunned them  her daily allowance of food was left for her to seek at a certain place in the camp as it might have been left for an animal too savage to be cherished by the hand of man  at certain periods she returned secretly from her wanderings to take it  her shelter for the night was not the shelter of her people before the walls of rome her thoughts were not their thoughts  widowed childless friendless the assassin of her last kinsman she moved apart in her own secret world of bereavement desolation and crime  yet there was no madness no remorse for her share in accomplishing the fate of hermanric in the dark and solitary existence which she now led from the moment when the young warrior had expiated with his death his disregard of the enmities of his nation and the wrongs of his kindred she thought of him only as of one more victim whose dishonour and ruin she must live to requite on the romans with roman blood and matured her schemes of revenge with a stern resolution which time and solitude and bodily infirmity were all powerless to disturb   she would pace for hours and hours together in the still night and in the broad noonday round and round the warriors grave nursing her vengeful thoughts within her until a ferocious anticipation of triumph quickened her steps and brightened her watchful eyes  then she would enter the farmhouse and drawing the knife from its place of concealment in her garments would pass its point slowly backwards and forwards over the hearth on which she had mutilated hermanric with her own hand and from which he had advanced without a tremor to meet the swordpoints of the huns sometimes when darkness had gathered over the earth she would standa boding and menacing apparitionupon the grave itself and chaunt moaning to the moaning wind fragments of obscure northern legends whose hideous burden was ever of anguish and crime of torture in prison vaults and death by the annihilating swordmingling with them the gloomy story of the massacre at aquileia and her fierce vows of vengeance against the households of rome  the forager on his late return past the farmhouse to the camp heard the harsh droning accents of her voice and quickened his onward step the venturesome peasant from the country beyond approaching under cover of the night to look from afar on the gothic camp beheld her form shadowy and threatening as he neared the garden and fled affrighted from the place  neither stranger nor friend intruded on her dread solitude  the foul presence of cruelty and crime violated undisturbed the scenes once sacred to the interests of tenderness and love once hallowed by the sojourn of youth and beauty  but now the farmhouse garden is left solitary the haunting spirit of evil has departed from the grave the footsteps of goisvintha have traced to their close the same paths from the suburbs over which the young goth once eagerly hastened on his night journey of love and already the walls of rome risedark near and hatefulbefore her eyes  along these now useless bulwarks of the fallen city she wanders as she has often wandered before watching anxiously for the first opening of the longclosed gates  let us follow her on her way  her attention was now fixed only on the broad ramparts while she passed slowly along the gothic tents towards the encampment at the pincian gate  arrived there she was aroused for the first time from her apathy by an unwonted stir and confusion prevailing around her she looked towards the tent of alaric and beheld before it the wasted and crouching forms of the followers of the embassy awaiting their sentence from the captain of the northern hosts  in a few moments she gathered enough from the words of the goths congregated about this part of the camp to assure her that it was the pincian gate which had given egress to the roman suppliants and which would therefore in all probability be the entrance again thrown open to admit their return to the city remembering this she began to calculate the numbers of the conquered enemy grouped together before the kings tent and then mentally added to them those who might be present at the interview proceeding withinmechanically withdrawing herself while thus occupied nearer and nearer to the waste ground before the city walls  gradually she turned her face towards rome  she was realising a daring purpose a fatal resolution long cherished during the days and nights of her solitary wanderings  the ranks of the embassy she muttered in a deep thoughtful tone are thickly filled  where there are many there must be confusion and haste they march together and know not their own numbers they mark not one more or one less among them  she stopped  strange and dark changes of colour and expression passed over her ghastly features she drew from her bosom the bloody helmetcrest of her husband which had never quitted her since the day of his death her face grew livid under an awful expression of rage ferocity and despair as she gazed on it  suddenly she looked up at the cityfierce and defiant as if the great walls before her were mortal enemies against whom she stood at bay in the deathstruggle  the widowed and the childless shall drink of thy blood she cried stretching out her skinny hand towards rome though the armies of her nation barter their wrongs with thy people for bags of silver and gold i have pondered on it in my solitude and dreamed of it in my dreams i have sworn that i would enter rome and avenge my slaughtered kindred alone among thousands  now now i will hold to my oath thou bloodstained city of the coward and the traitor the enemy of the defenceless and the murderer of the weak thou who didst send forth to aquileia the slayers of my husband and the assassins of my children i wait no longer before thy walls  this day will i mingle daring all things with thy returning citizens and penetrate amid romans the gates of rome  through the day will i lurk cunning and watchful in thy solitary haunts to steal forth on thee at nights a secret minister of death  i will watch for thy young and thy weak once in unguarded places i will prey alone in the thick darkness upon thy unprotected lives i will destroy thy children as their fathers destroyed at aquileia the children of the goths  thy rabble will discover me and arise against me they will tear me in pieces and trample my mangled body on the pavement of the streets but it will be after i have seen the blood that i have sworn to shed flowing under my knife  my vengeance will be complete and torments and death will be to me as guests that i welcome and as deliverers whom i await  again she pausedthe wild triumph of the fanatic on the burning pile was flashing in her facesuddenly her eyes fell once more upon the stained helmetcrest then her expression changed again to despair and her voice grew low and moaning when she thus resumed   i am weary of my life when the vengeance is done i shall be delivered from this prison of the earthin the world of shadows i shall see my husband and my little ones will gather round my knees again the living have no part in me i yearn towards the spirits who wander in the halls of the dead  for a few minutes more she continued to fix her tearless eyes on the helmetcrest  but soon the influence of the evil spirit revived in all its strength she raised her head suddenly remained for an instant absorbed in deep thought then began to retrace her steps rapidly in the direction by which she had come  sometimes she whispered softly i must be doing ere the time fail me my face must be hidden and my garments changed  yonder among the houses i must search and search quickly  sometimes she reiterated her denunciations of vengeance her ejaculations of triumph in her frantic project  at the recapitulation of these the remembrance of antonina was aroused and then a bloodthirsty superstition darkened her thoughts and threw a vague and dreamy character over her speech  when she spoke now it was to murmur to herself that the victim who had twice escaped her might yet be alive that the supernatural influences which had often guided the old goths on the day of retribution might still guide her might still direct the stroke of her destroying weaponthe last stroke ere she was discovered and slainstraight to the girls heart  thoughts such as thesewandering and obscurearose in close quick succession within her but whether she gave them expression in word and action or whether she suppressed them in silence she never wavered or halted in her rapid progress  her energies were braced to all emergencies and her strong will suffered them not for an instant to relax  she gained a retired street in the deserted suburbs and looking round to see that she was unobserved entered on of the houses abandoned by its inhabitants on the approach of the besiegers  passing quickly through the outer halls she stopped at length in one of the sleeping apartments and here she found among other possessions left behind in the flight the store of wearing apparel belonging to the owner of the room  from this she selected a roman robe upper mantle and sandalsthe most common in colour and texture that she could findand folding them up into the smallest compass hid them under her own garments  then avoiding all those whom she met on her way she returned in the direction of the kings tent but when she approached it branched off stealthily towards rome until she reached a ruined building halfway between the city and the camp  in this concealment she clothed herself in her disguise drawing the mantle closely round her head and face and from this pointcalm vigilant determined her hand on the knife beneath her robe her lips muttering the names of her murdered husband and childrenshe watched the highroad to the pincian gate  there for a short time let us leave her and enter the tent of alaric while the senate yet plead before the arbiter of the empire for mercy and peace  at the moment of which we write the embassy had already exhausted its powers of intercession apparently without moving the leader of the goths from his first pitiless resolution of fixing the ransom of rome at the price of every possession of value which the city contained there was a momentary silence now in the great tent  at one extremity of it congregated in a close and irregular group stood the wearied and brokenspirited members of the senate supported by such of their attendants as had been permitted to follow them at the other appeared the stately forms of alaric and the warriors who surrounded him as his council of war  the vacant space in the middle of the tent was strewn with martial weapons separating the representatives of the two nations one from the other and thus accidentally yet palpably typifying the fierce hostility which had sundered in years past and was still to sunder for years to come the people of the north and the people of the south  the gothic king stood a little in advance of his warriors leaning on his huge heavy sword  his steady eye wandered from man to man among the brokenspirited senators contemplating with cold and cruel penetration all that suffering and despair had altered for the worse in their outward appearance  their soiled robes their wan cheeks their trembling limbs were each marked in turn by the cool sarcastic examination of the conquerors gaze  debased and humiliated as they were there were some among the ambassadors who felt the insult thus silently and deliberately inflicted on them the more keenly for their very helplessness  they moved uneasily in their places and whispered among each other in low and bitter accents  at length one of their number raised his downcast eyes and broke the silence  the old roman spirit which long years of voluntary frivolity and degradation had not yet entirely depraved flushed his pale wasted face as he spoke thus  we have entreated we have offered we have promisedmen can do no more  deserted by our emperor and crushed by pestilence and famine nothing is now left to us but to perish in unavailing resistance beneath the walls of rome  it was in the power of alaric to win everlasting renown by moderation to the unfortunate of an illustrious nation but he has preferred to attempt the spoiling of a glorious city and the subjugation of a suffering people  yet let him remember though destruction may sate his vengeance and pillage enrich his hoards the day of retribution will yet come  there are still soldiers in the empire and heroes who will lead them confidently to battle though the bodies of their countrymen lie slaughtered around them in the streets of pillaged rome  a momentary expression of wrath and indignation appeared on alarics features as he listened to this bold speech but it was almost immediately replaced by a scornful smile of derision  what ye have still soldiers before whom the barbarian must tremble for his conquests he cried where are they  are they on their march or in ambush or hiding behind strong walls or have they lost their way on the road to the gothic camp  ha here is one of them he exclaimed advancing towards an enfeebled and disarmed guard of the senate who quailed beneath his fierce glance fight man he loudly continued fight while there is yet time for imperial rome  thy sword is gonetake mine and be a hero again  with a rough laugh echoed by the warriors behind him he flung his ponderous weapon as he spoke towards the wretched object of his sarcasm the hilt struck heavily against the mans breast he staggered and fell helpless to the ground  the laugh was redoubled among the goths but now their leader did not join in it  his eye glowed in triumphant scorn as he pointed to the prostrate roman exclaiming  so does the south fall beneath the sword of the north  so shall the empire bow before the rule of the goth  say as ye look on these romans before us are we not avenged of our wrongs  they die not fighting on our swords they live to entreat our pity as children that are in terror of the whip   he paused  his massive and noble countenance gradually assumed a thoughtful expression  the ambassadors moved forward a few stepsperhaps to make a final entreaty perhaps to depart in despair but he signed with his hand in command to them to be silent and remain where they stood the marauders thirst for present plunder and the conquerors lofty ambition of future glory now stirred in strong conflict within him  he walked to the opening of the tent and thrusting aside its curtain of skins looked out upon rome in silence the dazzling majesty of the temples and palaces of the mighty city as they towered before him gleaming in the rays of the unclouded sunlight fixed him long in contemplation  gradually dreams of a future dominion amid those unrivalled structures which now waited but his word to be pillaged and destroyed filled his aspiring soul and saved the city from his wrath  he turned again toward the shrinking ambassadorsin a voice and look superior to them as a being of a higher sphereand spoke thus  when the gothic conqueror reigns in italy the palaces of her rulers shall be found standing for the places of his sojourn  i will ordain a lower ransom i will spare rome  a murmur arose among the warriors behind him  the rapine and destruction which they had eagerly anticipated was denied them for the first time by their chief  as their muttered remonstrances caught his ear alaric instantly and sternly fixed his eyes upon them and repeating in accents of deliberate command i will ordain a lower ransom i will spare rome steadily scanned the countenances of his ferocious followers  not a word of dissent fell from their lips not a gesture of impatience appeared in their ranks they preserved perfect silence as the king again advanced towards the ambassadors and continued  i fix the ransom of the city at five thousand pounds of gold at thirty thousand pounds of silver  here he suddenly ceased as if pondering further on the terms he should exact  the hearts of the senate lightened for a moment by alarics unexpected announcement that he would moderate his demands sank within them again as they thought on the tribute required of them and remembered their exhausted treasury  but it was no time now to remonstrate or to delay and they answered with one accord ignorant though they were of the means of performing their promise the ransom shall be paid  the king looked at them when they spoke as if in astonishment that men whom he had deprived of all freedom of choice ventured still to assert it by intimating their acceptance of terms which they dared not decline the mocking spirit revived within him while he thus gazed on the helpless and humiliated embassy and he laughed once more as he resumed partly addressing himself to the silent array of the warriors behind him  the gold and silver are but the first dues of the tribute my army shall be rewarded with more than the wealth of the enemy  you men of rome have laughed at our rough bearskins and our heavy armour you shall clothe us with your robes of festivity  i will add to the gold and silver of your ransom four thousand garments of silk and three thousand pieces of scarlet cloth  my barbarians shall be barbarians no longer  i will make patricians epicures romans of them  the members of the illfated embassy looked up as he paused in mute appeal to the mercy of the triumphant conqueror but they were not yet to be released from the crushing infliction of his rapacity and scorn  hold he cried i will have moremore still  you are a nation of feasterswe will rival you in your banquets when we have stripped you of your banqueting robes  to the gold the silver the silk and the cloth i will add yet morethree thousand pounds weight of pepper your precious merchandise bought from far countries with your lavish wealthsee that you bring it hither with the rest of the ransom to the last grain  the flesh of our beasts shall be seasoned for us like the flesh of yours  he turned abruptly from the senators as he pronounced the last words and began to speak in jesting tones and in the gothic language to the council of warriors around him  some of the ambassadors bowed their heads in silent resignation others with the utter thoughtlessness of men bewildered by all that they had seen and heard during the interview that was now close unhappily revived the recollection of the broken treaties of former days by mechanically inquiring in the terms of past formularies what security the besiegers would require for the payment of their demands   security cried alaric fiercely instantly relapsing as they spoke into his sterner mood  behold yonder the future security of the goths for the faith of rome and flinging aside the curtain of the tent he pointed proudly to the long lines of his camp stretching round all that was visible of the walls of the fallen city  the ambassadors remembered the massacre of the hostages of aquileia and the evasion of the payment of tributemoney promised in former days and were silent as they looked through the opening of the tent  remember the conditions of the ransom pursued alaric in warning tones remember my security that the ransom shall be quickly paid  so shall you live for a brief space in security and feast and be merry again while your territories yet remain to you  go  i have spokenit is enough  he withdrew abruptly from the senators and the curtain of the tent fell behind them as they passed out  the ordeal of the judgment was over the final sentence had been pronounced the time had already arrived to go forth and obey it  the news that terms of peace had been at last settled filled the romans who were waiting before the tent with emotions of delight equally unalloyed by reflections on the past or forebodings for the future barred from their reckless project of flying to the open country by the goths surrounding them in the camp shut out from retreating to rome by the gates through which they had rashly forced their way exposed in their helplessness to the brutal jeers of the enemy while they waited in a long agony of suspense for the close of the perilous interview between alaric and the senate they had undergone every extremity of suffering and had yielded unanimously to despair when the intelligence of the concluded treaty sounded like a promise of salvation in their ears  none of the apprehensions aroused in the minds of their superiors by the vastness of the exacted tribute now mingled with the unreflecting ecstasy of their joy at the prospect of the removal of the blockade they arose to return to the city from which they had fled in dismay with cries of impatience and delight  they fawned like dogs upon the ambassadors and even upon the ferocious goths  on their departure from rome they had mechanically preserved some regularity in their progress but now they hurried onward without distinction of place or discipline of marchsenators guards plebeians all were huddled together in the disorderly equality of a mob  not one of them in their newborn security marked the ruined building on the highroad not one of them observed the closelyrobed figure that stole out from it to join them in their rear and then with stealthy footstep and shrouded face soon mingled in the thickest of their ranks the attention of the ambassadors was still engrossed by their forebodings of failure in collecting the ransom the eyes of the people were fixed only on the pincian gate their ears were open to no sounds but their own ejaculations of delight  not one disguised stranger only but many might now have joined them in their tumultuous progress alike unquestioned and unobserved  so they hastily reentered the city where thousands of heavy eyes were strained to look on them and thousands of attentive ears drank in their joyful news from the gothic camp  then were heard in all directions the sounds of hysterical weeping and idiotic laughter the low groans of the weak who died victims of their sudden transport and the confused outbursts of the strong who had survived all extremities and at last beheld their deliverance in view  still silent and serious the ambassadors now slowly penetrated the throng on their way back to the forum and as they proceeded the crowd gradually dispersed on either side of them  enemies friends and strangers all whom the ruthless famine had hitherto separated in interests and sympathies were now united together as one family by the expectation of speedy relief   but there was one among the assembly that was now separating who stood alone in her unrevealed emotions amid the rejoicing thousands around her  the women and children in the throng as preoccupied by their own feeling they unheedfully passed her by saw not the eager ferocious attention in her eyes as she watched them steadily till they were out of sight  within their gates the stranger and the enemy waited for the treacherous darkness of night and waited unobserved where she had first stood when the thick crowd hemmed her in there she still continued to stand after they slowly moved past her and space grew free  yet beneath this outward calm and silence lurked the wildest passions that ever raged against the weak restraint of human will even the firm selfpossession of goisvintha was shaken when she found herself within the walls of rome  no glance of suspicion had been cast upon her not one of the crowd had approached to thrust her back when she passed through the gates with the heedless citizens around her  shielded from detection as much by the careless security of her enemies as by the stratagem of her disguise she stood on the pavement of rome as she had vowed to stand afar from the armies of her peoplealone as an avenger of blood  it was no dream no fleeting deceitful vision  the knife was under her hand the streets stretched before her the living beings who thronged them were romans the hours of the day were already on the wane the approach of her vengeance was as sure as the approach of darkness that was to let it loose  a wild exultation quickened in her the pulses of life while she thought on the dread projects of secret assassination and revenge which now opposed her a solitary woman in deadly enmity against the defenceless population of a whole city  as her eyes travelled slowly from side to side over the moving throng as she thought on the time that might still elapse ere the discovery and deaththe martyrdom in the cause of bloodwhich she expected and defied would overtake her her hands trembled beneath her robe and she reiterated in whispers to herself  husband children brotherthere are five deaths to avenge  remember aquileia  remember aquileia  suddenly as she looked from group to group among the departing people her eyes became arrested by one object she instantly stepped forwards then abruptly restrained herself and moved back where the crowd was still thick gazing fixedly ever in the same direction  she saw the victim twice snatched from her handsat the camp and in the farmhousea third time offered to her grasp in the streets of rome  the chance of vengeance last expected was the chance that had first arrived  a vague oppressing sensation of awe mingled with the triumph at her hearta supernatural guidance seemed to be directing her with fell rapidity through every mortal obstacle to the climax of her revenge  she screened herself behind the people she watched the girl from the most distant point but concealment was now vaintheir eyes had met the robe had slipped aside when she suddenly stepped forward and in that moment antonina had seen her  numerian moving slowly with his daughter through the crowd felt her hand tighten round his and saw her features stiffen into sudden rigidity but the change was only for an instant  ere he could speak she caught him by the arm and drew him forward with convulsive energy then in accents hardly articulate low breathless unlike her wonted voice he heard her exclaim as she struggled on with him she is therethere behind us to kill me as she killed him  home home  exhausted already through long weakness and natural infirmity by the rough contact of the crowd bewildered by antoninas looks and actions and by the startling intimation of unknown peril conveyed to him in her broken exclamations of affright numerians first impulse as he hurried onward by her side led him to entreat protection and help from the surrounding populace  but even could he have pointed out to them the object of his dread amid that motley throng of all nations the appeal he now made would have remained unanswered   of all the results of the frightful severity of privation suffered by the besieged none were more common than those mental aberrations which produced visions of danger enemies and death so palpable as to make the persons beholding them implore assistance against the hideous creation of their own delirium  accordingly most of those to whom the entreaties of numerian were addressed passed without noticing them some few carelessly bid him remember that there were no enemies now that the days of peace were approaching and that a meal of good food which he might soon expect to enjoy was the only help for a famished man  no one in that period of horror and suffering which was now drawing to a close saw anything extraordinary in the confusion of the father and the terror of the child  so they pursued their feeble flight unprotected and the footsteps of goisvintha followed them as they went  they had already commenced the ascent of the pincian hill when antonina stopped abruptly and turned to look behind her  many people yet thronged the street below but her eyes penetrated among them sharpened by peril and instantly discerned the ample robe and the tall form still at the same distance from them and pausing as they had paused for one moment the girls eyes fixed in the wild helpless stare of terror on her fathers face but the next that mysterious instinct of preservation which is coexistent with the instinct of fearwhich gifts the weakest animal with cunning to improve its flight and takes the place of reason reflection and resolve when all are banished from the mindwarned her against the fatal error of permitting the pursuer to track her to her home  not there not there she gasped faintly as numerian endeavoured to lead her up the ascent  she will see us as we enter the doorsthrough the streets  oh father if you would save me we may lose her in the streetsthe guards the people are there  back back  numerian trembled as he marked the terror in her looks and gestures but it was vain to question or oppose her  nothing short of force could restrain herno commands or entreaties could draw from her more than the same breathless exclamation  onward father onward if you would save me  she was insensible to every sensation but fear incapable of any other exertion than flight  turning and winding hurrying forward ever at the same rapid pace they passed unconsciously along the intricate streets that led to the river side and still the avenger tracked the victim constant as the shadow to the substance steady vigilant unwearied as a bloodhound on a hot scent  and now even the sound of the fathers voice ceased to be audible in the daughters ears she no longer felt the pressure of his hand no longer perceived his very presence at her side  at length frail and shrinking she again paused and looked back  the street they had reached was very tranquil and desolate  two slaves were walking at its further extremity  while they were in sight no living creature appeared in the roadway behind but as soon as they had passed away a shadow stole slowly forward over the pavement of a portico in the distance and the next moment goisvintha appeared in the street  the sun glared down fiercely over her dark figure as she stopped and for an instant looked stealthily around her  she moved to advance and antonina saw no more  again she turned to renew her hopeless flight and again her fatherperceiving only as the mysterious cause of her dread a solitary woman who though she followed attempted not to arrest or even to address themprepared to accompany her to the last in despair of all other chances of securing her safety  more and more completely did her terror now enchain her faculties as she still unconsciously traced her rapid way through the streets that led to the tiber  it was not numerian not rome not daylight in a great city that was before her eyes  it was the storm the assassination the night at the farmhouse that she now lived through over again   still the quick flight and the ceaseless pursuit were continued as if neither were ever to have an end but the close of the scene was nevertheless already at hand  during the interval of the passage through the streets numerians mind had gradually recovered from its first astonishment and alarm at length he perceived the necessity of instant and decisive action while there was yet time to save antonina from sinking under the excess of her own fears  though a vague awful foreboding of disaster and death filled his heart his resolution to penetrate at once at all hazards the dark mystery of impending danger indicated by his daughters words and actions did not fail him for it was aroused by the only motive powerful enough to revive all that suffering and infirmity had not yet destroyed of the energy of his former daysthe preservation of his child  there was something of the old firmness and vigour of the intrepid reformer of the church in his dim eyes as he now stopped and enclosing antonina in his arms arrested her instantly in her flight  she struggled to escape but it was faintly and only for a moment her strength and consciousness were beginning to abandon her  she never attempted to look back she felt in her heart that goisvintha was still behind and dared not to verify the frightful conviction with her eyes her lips moved but they expressed an altered and a vain petition hermanric  o hermanric was all they murmured now  they had arrived at the long street that ran by the banks of the tiber the people had either retired to their homes or repaired to the forum to be informed of the period when the ransom would be paid  no one but goisvintha was in sight as numerian looked around him and she after having carefully viewed the empty street was advancing towards them at a quickened pace  for an instant the father looked on her steadily as she approached and in that instant his determination was formed  a flight of steps at his feet led to the narrow doorway of a small temple the nearest building to him  ignorant whether goisvintha might not be secretly supported by companions in her ceaseless pursuit he resolved to secure this place for antonina as a temporary refuge at least while standing before it he should oblige the woman to declare her purpose if she followed them even there  in a moment he had begun the ascent of the steps with the exhausted girl by his side  arrived at the summit he guided her before him into the doorway and stopped on the threshold to look round again goisvintha was nowhere to be seen  not duped by the womans sudden disappearance into the belief that she had departed from the streetpersisting in his resolution to lead his daughter to a place of repose where she might most immediately feel herself secure and might therefore most readily recover her selfpossession numerian drew antonina with him into the temple  he lingered there for a moment ere he departed to watch the street from the portico outside  the light in the building was dimit was admitted only from a small aperture in the roof and through the narrow doorway where it was intercepted by the overhanging bulk of the outer portico a crooked pile of dark heavylooking substances on the floor rose high towards the ceiling in the obscure interior  irregular in form flung together one over the other in strange disorder for the most part dusky in hue yet here and there gleaming at points with a metallic brightness these objects presented a mysterious indefinite and startling appearance it was impossible on a first view of their confused arrangement to discover what they were or to guess for what purpose they could have been pile together on the floor of a deserted temple  from the moment when they had first attracted numerians observation his attention was fixed on them and as he looked a faint thrill of suspicionvague inexplicable without apparent cause or objectstruck chill to his heart   he had moved a step forward to examine the hidden space at the back of the pile when his further advance was instantly stopped by the appearance of a man who walked forth from it dressed in the floating purpleedged robe and white fillet of the pagan priests  before either father or daughter could speak even before they could move to depart he stepped up to them and placing his hand on the shoulder of each confronted them in silence  at the moment when the stranger approached numerian raised his hand to thrust him back and in so doing fixed his eyes on the mans countenance as a ray of light from the doorway floated over it instantly his arm remained outstretched and rigid then it dropped to his side and the expression of horror on the face of the child became reflected as it were on the face of the parent  neither moved under the hand of the dweller in the temple when he laid it heavily on each and both stood before him speechless as himself    chapter 25  the temple and the church  it was ulpius  the pagan was changed in bearing and countenance as well as in apparel  he stood more firm and upright a dull tawny hue overspread his face his eyes so sunken and lustreless in other days were now distended and bright with the glare of insanity  it seemed as if his bodily powers had renewed their vigour while his mental faculties had declined towards their ruin  no human eye had ever beheld by what foul and secret means he had survived through the famine on what unnatural sustenance he had satisfied the cravings of inexorable hunger but there in his gloomy shelter the madman and the outcast had lived and moved and suddenly and strangely strengthened after the people of the city had exhausted all their united responses lavished in vain all their united wealth and drooped and died by thousands around him  his grasp still lay heavy on the father and daughter and still both confronted himsilent as if deathstruck by his gaze motionless as if frozen at his touch  his presence was exerting over them a fatal fascination  the power of action suspended in antonina as she entered their illchosen refuge was now arrested in numerian also but with him no thought of the enemy in the street had any part at this moment in the resistless influence which held him helpless before the enemy in the temple  it was a feeling of deeper awe and darker horror  for now as he looked upon the hideous features of ulpius as he saw the forbidden robe of priesthood in which the pagan was arrayed he beheld not only the traitor who had successfully plotted against the prosperity of his household but the madman as wellthe moral leper of the whole human familythe living body and the dead soulthe disinherited of that divine light of life which it is the awful privilege of mortal man to share with the angels of god  he still clasped antonina to his side but it was unconsciously  to all outward appearance he was helpless as his helpless child when ulpius slowly removed his grasp from their shoulders separated them and locking the hand of each in his cold bony fingers began to speak  his voice was deep and solemn but his accents in their hard unvarying tone seemed to express no human emotion  his eyes far from brightening as he spoke relapsed into a dull vacant insensibility the connection between the action of speech and the accompanying and explaining action of look which is observable in all men seemed lost in him  it was fearful to behold the deathlike face and to listen at the same moment to the living voice  lo the votaries come to the temple murmured the pagan  the good servants of the mighty worship gather at the voice of the priest  in the far provinces where the enemies of the gods approach to profane the sacred groves behold the scattered people congregating by night to journey to the shrine of serapis  adoring thousands kneel beneath the lofty porticoes while within in the secret hall where the light is dim where the air quivers round the breathing deities on their pedestals of gold the high priest ulpius reads the destinies of the future that are unrolled before his eyes like a book   as he ceased and still holding the hands of his captives looked on them fixedly as ever his eyes brightened and dilated again but they expressed not the slightest recognition either of father or daughter the delirium of his imagination had transported him to the temple at alexandria the days were revived when his glory had risen to its culminating point when the christians trembled before him as their fiercest enemy and the pagans surrounded him as their last hope  the victims of his former and forgotten treachery were but as two among the throng of votaries allured by the fame of his eloquence by the triumphant notoriety of his power to protect the adherents of the ancient creed  but it was not always thus that his madness declared itself  there were moments when it rose to appalling frenzy  then he imagined himself to be again hurling the christian assailants from the topmost walls of the besieged temple in that past time when the image of serapis was doomed by the bishop of alexandria to be destroyed  his yells of fury his frantic execrations of defiance were heard afar in the solemn silence of pestilencestricken rome  those who during the most fatal days of the gothic blockade dropped famished on the pavement before the little temple as they endeavoured to pass it on their onward way presented a dread reality of death to embody the madmans visions of battle and slaughter  as these victims of famine lay expiring in the street they heard above them his raving voice cursing them for christians triumphing over them as defeated enemies destroyed by his hand exhorting his imaginary adherents to fling the slain above on the dead below until the bodies of the besiegers of the temple were piled as barriers against their living comrades round its walls  sometimes his frenzy gloried in the fancied revival of the foul and sanguinary ceremonies of pagan superstition  then he bared his arms and shouted aloud for the sacrifice he committed dark and nameless atrocitiesfor now again the dead and the dying lay before him to give substance to the shadow of his evil thoughts and plague and hunger were as creatures of his will and slew the victim for the altar ready to his hands  at other times when the raving fit had passed away and he lay panting in the darkest corner of the interior of the temple his insanity assumed another and a mournful form  his voice grew low and moaning the wreck of his memorywandering and uncontrollablefloated back far back on the dark waters of the past and his tongue uttered fragments of words and phrases that he had murmured at his fathers kneesfarewell childish wishes that he had breathed in his mothers earinnocent anxious questions which he had addressed to macrinus the high priest when he first entered the service of the gods at alexandria his boyish reveriesthe gentleness of speech and poetry of thought of his first youthful days were now by the unsearchable and arbitrary influences of his disease revived in his broken words renewed in his desolate old age of madness and crime breathed out in unconscious mockery by his lips while the foam still gathered about them and the last flashes of frenzy yet lightened in his eyes  this unnatural calmness of language and vividness of memory this treacherous appearance of thoughtful melancholy selfpossession would often continue through long periods uninterrupted but sooner or later the sudden change came the deceitful chain of thought snapped asunder in an instant the word was left half uttered the wearied limbs started convulsively into renewed action and as the dream of violence returned and the dream of peace vanished the madman rioted afresh in his fury and journeyed as his visions led him round and round his temple sanctuary and hither and thither when the night was dark and death was busiest in rome among the expiring in deserted houses and the lifeless in the silent streets   but there were other later events in his existence that never revived within him  the old familiar image of the idol serapis which had drawn him into the temple when he reentered rome absorbed in itself and in its associated remembrances all that remained active of his paralysed faculties  his betrayal of his trust in the house of numerian his passage through the rifted wall his crushing repulse in the tent of alaric never for a moment occupied his wandering thoughts the clouds that hung over his mind might open to him parting glimpses of the toils and triumphs of his early career but they descended in impenetrable darkness on all the afterdays of his dreary life  such was the being to whose will by a mysterious fatality the father and child were now submitted such the existencesolitary hopeless loathsomeof their stern and wily betrayer of other days  since he had ceased speaking the cold deathlike grasp of his hand had gradually strengthened and he had begun to look slowly and inquiringly round him from side to side  had this change marked the approaching return of his raving paroxysm the lives of numerian and antonina would have been sacrificed the next moment but all that it now denoted was the quickening of the lofty and obscure ideas of celebrity and success of priestly honour and influence of the splendour and glory of the gods which had prompted his last words  he moved suddenly and drew the victims of his dangerous caprice a few steps farther into the interior of the temple then led them close up to the lofty pile of objects which had first attracted numerians eyes on entering the building  kneel and adore cried the madman fiercely replacing his hands on their shoulders and pressing them to the groundyou stand before the gods in the presence of their high priest  the girls head sank forward and she hid her face in her hands but her father looked up tremblingly at the pile  his eyes had insensibly become more accustomed to the dim light of the temple and he now saw more distinctly the objects composing the mass that rose above him  hundreds of images of the gods in gold silver and woodmany in the latter material being larger than life canopies vestments furniture utensils all of ancient pagan form were heaped together without order or arrangement on the floor to a height of full fifteen feet  there was something at once hideous and grotesque in the appearance of the pile  the monstrous figures of the idols with their rude carved draperies and symbolic weapons lay in every wild variety of position and presented every startling eccentricity of line more especially towards the higher portions of the mass where they had evidently been flung up from the ground by the hand that had raised the structure  the draperies mixed among the images and the furniture were here coiled serpentlike around them and there hung down towards the ground waving slow and solemn in the breezes that wound through the temple doorway the smaller objects of gold and silver scattered irregularly over the mass shone out from it like gleaming eyes while the pile itself seen in such a place under a dusky light looked like some vast misshapen monsterthe gloomy embodiment of the bloodiest superstitions of paganism the growth of damp airs and teeming ruin of shadow and darkness of accursed and infected solitude  even in its position as well as in the objects of which it was composed the pile wore an ominous and startling aspect its crooked outline expanding towards the top was bent over fearfully in the direction of the doorway it seemed as if a single hand might sway it in its uncertain balance and hurl it instantly in one solid mass to the floor  many toilsome hours had passed away long secret labour had been expended in the erection of this weird and tottering structure but it was all the work of one hand  night after night had the pagan entered the deserted temples in the surrounding streets and pillaged them of their contents to enrich his favoured shrine  the removal of the idols from their appointed places which would have been sacrilege in any meaner man was in his eyes the dread privilege of the high priest alone   he had borne heavy burdens and torn asunder strong fastenings and journeyed and journeyed again for hours together over the same gloomy streets without loitering in his task he had raised treasures and images one above another he had strengthened the base and heightened the summit of this precious and sacred heap  he had repaired and rebuilt whenever it crumbled and fell this new babel that he longed to rear to the olympus of the temple roof with a resolute patience and perseverance that no failure or fatigue could overcome  it was the dearest purpose of his dreamy superstition to surround himself with innumerable deities as well as to assemble innumerable worshippers to make the sacred place of his habitation a mighty pantheon as well as a point of juncture for the scattered congregations of the pagan world  this was the ambition in which his madness expanded to the fiercest fanaticism and as he now stood erect with his captives beneath him his glaring eyes looked awestruck when he fixed them on his idols he uplifted his arms in solemn ecstatic triumph and in low tones poured forth his invocations wild intermingled and fragmentary as the barbarous altar which his solitary exertions had reared  whatever was the effect on numerian of his savage and confused ejaculations they were unnoticed even unheard by antonina for now while the madmans voice softened to an undertone and while she hid all surrounding objects from her eyes her senses were awakened to sounds in the temple which she had never remarked before  the rapid current of the tiber washed the foundation walls of one side of the building within which the clear lulling bubble of the water was audible with singular distinctness  but besides this another and a shriller sound caught the ear  on the summit of the temple roof still remained several rows of little gilt bells originally placed there partly with the intention of ornamenting this portion of the outer structure partly in order that the noise they produced when agitated by the wind might scare birds from settling in their flight on the consecrated edifice  the sounds produced by these bells were silvery and high pitched now when the breeze was strong they rang together merrily and continuously now when it fell their notes were faint separate and irregular almost plaintive in their pure metallic softness  but however their tone might vary under the capricious influences of the wind it seemed always wonderfully mingled within the temple with the low eternal bubbling of the river which filled up the slightest pauses in the pleasant chiming of the bells and ever preserved its gentle and monotonous harmony just audible beneath them  there was something in this quaint unwonted combination of sounds as they were heard in the vaulted interior of the little building strangely simple attractive and spiritual the longer they were listened to the more completely did the mind lose the recollection of their real origin and gradually shape out of them wilder and wilder fancies until the bells as they rang their small peal seemed like happy voices of a heavenly stream borne lightly onward on its airy bubbles and ever rejoicing over the gliding current that murmured to them as it ran  spite of the peril of her position and of the terror which still fixed her speechless and crouching on the ground the effect on antonina of the strange mingled music of the running water and the bells was powerful enough when she first heard it to suspend all her other emotions in a momentary wonder and doubt  she withdrew her hands from her face and glanced round mechanically to the doorway as if she imagined that the sounds proceeded from the street  when she looked the declining sun gliding between two of the outer pillars which surrounded the temple covered with a bright glow the smooth pavement before the entrance  a swarm of insects flew drowsily round and round in the warm mellow light their faint monotonous humming deepened rather than interrupted the perfect silence prevailing over all things without   but a change was soon destined to appear in the repose of the quiet vacant scene hardly a minute had elapsed while antonina still looked on it before she saw stealing over the sunny pavement a dark shadow the same shadow that she had last beheld when she stopped in her flight to look behind her in the empty street  at first it slowly grew and lengthened then it remained stationary then it receded and vanished as gradually as it had advanced and then the girl heard or fancied that she heard a faint sound of footsteps retiring along the lateral colonnades towards the river side of the building  a low cry of horror burst from her lips as she sank back towards her father but it was unheeded  the voice of ulpius had resumed in the interval its hollow loudness of tone he had raised numerian from the ground his strong cold grasp which seemed to penetrate to the old mans heart which held him motionless and helpless as if by a fatal spell was on his arm  hear it hear it cried the pagan waving his disengaged hand as if he were addressing a vast concourse of peoplei advance this man to be one of the servants of the high priest  he has travelled from a far country to the sacred shrine he is docile and obedient before the altar of the gods the lot is cast for his future life his dwelling shall be in the temple to the day of his death  he shall minister before me in white robes and swing the smoking censer and slay the sacrifice at my feet  he stopped  a dark and sinister expression appeared in his eyes as the word sacrifice passed his lips he muttered doubtingly to himselfthe sacrificeis it yet the hour of the sacrificeand looked round towards the doorway  the sun still shone gaily on the outer pavement the insects still circled slowly in the mellow light no shadow was now visible no distant footsteps were heard there was nothing audible but the happy music of the bubbling water and the chiming silvery bells  for a few moments the madman looked out anxiously towards the street without uttering a word or moving a muscle  the raving fit was nearly possessing him again as the thought of the sacrifice flashed over his darkened mind but once more its approach was delayed  he slowly turned his head in the direction of the interior of the temple  the sun is still bright in the outer courts he murmured in an undertone the hour of the sacrifice is not yet  come he continued in a louder voice shaking numerian by the arm  it is time that the servant of the temple should behold the place of the sacrifice and sharpen the knife for the victim before sunset  arouse thee bondman and follow me  as yet numerian had neither spoken nor attempted to escape  the preceding events though some space has been occupied in describing them passed in so short a period of time that he had not hitherto recovered from the first overwhelming shock of the meeting with ulpius but now awed though he still was he felt that the moment of the struggle for freedom had arrived  leave me and let us departthere can be no fellowship between us again he exclaimed with the reckless courage of despair taking the hand of antonina and striving to free himself from the madmans grasp but the effort was vain ulpius tightened his hold and laughed in triumph  what the servant of the temple is in terror of the high priest and shrinks from walking in the place of the sacrifice he cried  fear not bondman  the mighty one who rules over life and death and time and futurity deals kindly with the servant of his choice  onward onward to the place of darkness and doom where i alone am omnipotent and all others are creatures who tremble and obey to thy lesson learner by sunset the victim must be crowned  he looked round on numerian for an instant as he prepared to drag him forward and their eyes met  in the fierce command of his action and the savage exultation of his glance the father saw repeated in a wilder form the very attitude and expression which he had beheld in the pagan on the morning of the loss of his child  all the circumstances of that miserable hourthe vacant bedchamberthe banished daughterthe triumph of the betrayerthe anguish of the betrayedrushed over his mind and rose up before it vivid as a pictured scene before his eyes   he struggled no more the powers of resistance in mind and body were crushed alike  he made an effort to remove antonina from his side as if in forgetfulness of the hidden enemy without he designed to urge her flight through the open door while the madmans attention was yet distracted from her  but beyond this last exertion of the strong instinct of paternal love every other active emotion seemed dead within him  vainly had he striven to disentangle the child from the fate that might be in store for the parent  to her the dread of the dark shadow on the pavement was superior to all other apprehensions  she now clung more closely to her father and tightened her clasp round his hand  so when the pagan advanced into the interior of the temple it was not numerian alone who followed him to the place of sacrifice but antonina as well  they moved to the back of the pile of idols  behind it appeared a high partition of gilt and inlaid wood reaching to the ceiling and separating the outer from the inner part of the temple  a low archway passage protected by carved gates similar to those at the front of the building had been formed in the partition and through this ulpius and his prisoners now passed into the recess beyond  this apartment was considerably smaller than the first hall of the temple which they had just left  the ceiling and the floor both sloped downwards together and here the rippling of the waters of the tiber was more distinctly audible to them than in the outer division of the building  at the moment when they entered it the place was very dark the pile of idols intercepted even the little light that could have been admitted through its narrow entrance but the dense obscurity was soon dissipated dragging numerian after him to the left side of the recess ulpius drew back a sort of wooden shutter and a vivid ray of sunlight immediately streamed in through a small circular opening pierced in this part of the temple  then there became apparent at the lower end of the apartment a vast yawning cavity in the wall high enough to admit a man without stooping but running downwards almost perpendicularly to some lower region which it was impossible to see for no light shot upwards from this precipitous artificial abyss in the darkness of which the eye was lost after it had penetrated to the distance of a few feet only from the opening  at the base of the confined space thus visible appeared the commencement of a flight of steps evidently leading far downwards into the cavity  on the abruptly sloping walls which bounded it on all sides were painted in the brilliant hues of ancient fresco representations of the deities of the mythologyall in the attitude of descending into the vault and all followed by figures of nymphs bearing wreaths of flowers beautiful birds and other similar adjuncts of the votive ceremonies of paganism  the repulsive contrast between the bright colours and graceful forms presented by the frescoes and the perilous and gloomy appearance of the cavity which they decorated increased remarkably the startling significance in the character of the whole structure  its past evil uses seemed ineradicably written over every part of it as past crime and torment remain ineradicably written on the human face the mind imbibed from it terrifying ideas of deadly treachery of secret atrocities of frightful refinements of torture which no uninitiated eye had ever beheld and no human resolution had ever been powerful enough to resist  but the impressions thus received were not produced only by what was seen in and around this strange vault but by what was heard there besides  the wind penetrated the cavity at some distance and through some opening that could not be beheld and was apparently intercepted in its passage for it whistled upwards towards the entrance in shrill winding notes sometimes producing another and nearer sound resembling the clashing of many small metallic substances violently shaken together  the noise of the wind as well as the bubbling of the current of the tiber seemed to proceed from a greater distance than appeared compatible with the narrow extent of the back part of the temple and the proximity of the river to its low foundation walls   it was evident that the vault only reached its outlet after it had wound backwards underneath the building in some strange complication of passages or labyrinth of artificial caverns which might have been built long since as dungeons for the living or as sepulchres for the dead  the place of the sacrificeaha the place of the sacrifice cried the pagan exultingly as he drew numerian to the entrance of the cavity and solemnly pointed into the darkness beneath  the father gazed steadily into the chasm never turning now to look on antonina never moving to renew the struggle for freedom  earthly loves and earthly hopes began to fade away from his hearthe was praying the solemn words of christian supplication fell in low murmuring sounds from his lips in the place of idolatry and bloodshed and mingled with the incoherent ejaculations of the madman who kept him captive and who now bent his glaring eyes on the darkness of the vault half forgetful in the gloomy fascination which it exercised even over him of the prisoners whom he held at its mouth  the single ray of light admitted from the circular aperture of the wall fell wild and fantastic over the widelydiffering figures of the three as they stood so strangely united together before the abyss that opened beneath them  the shadows were above and the shadows were around there was no light in the illomened place but the one vivid ray that streamed over the gaunt figure of ulpius as he still pointed into the darkness over the rigid features of numerian praying in the bitterness of expected death and over the frail youthful form of antonina as she nestled trembling at her fathers side  it was an unearthly and a solemn scene  meanwhile the shadow which the girl had observed on the pavement before the doorway of the temple now appeared there again but not to retire as before  for the instant after goisvintha stealthily entered the outer apartment of the building left vacant by its first occupants she passed softly around the pile of idols looked into the inner recess of the temple and saw the three figures standing together in the ray of light gloomy and motionless before the mouth of the cavity  her first glance fixed on the pagan whom she instinctively doubted and dreaded whose purpose in keeping captive the father and daughter she could not divine her next was directed on antonina  the girls position was a guarded one still holding her fathers hand she was partly protected by his body and stood unconsciously beneath the arm of ulpius as it was raised while he grasped numerians shoulder  marking this and remembering that antonina had twice escaped her already goisvintha hesitated for a moment and then with cautious step and lowering brow began to retire again towards the doorway of the building  not yetnot yet the time she muttered as she resumed her former lurkingplace they stand where the light is over themthe girl is watched and shieldedthe two men are still on either side of her not yet the moment of the blow the stroke of the knife must be sure and safe  sure for this time she must die by my hand  safe for i have other vengeance to wreak besides the vengeance on her  i who have been patient and cunning since the night when i escaped from aquileia will be patient and cunning still  if she passes the door i slay her as she goes out if she remains in the temple  at the last word goisvintha paused and gazed upward the setting sun threw its fiery glow over her haggard face her eye brightened fiercely in the full light as she looked  the darkness is at hand she continued the night will be thick and black in the dim halls of the temple i shall see her when she shall not see methe darkness is coming the vengeance is sure  she closed her lips and with fatal perseverance continued to watch and wait as she had resolutely watched and waited already  the roman and the goth the opposite in sex nation and fate the madman who dreamed of the sanguinary superstitions of paganism before the temple altar and the assassin who brooded over the chances of bloodshed beneath the temple portico were now united in a mysterious identity of expectation uncommunicated and unsuspected by eitherthe hour when the sun vanished from the heaven was the hour of the sacrifice for both                                  there is now a momentary pause in the progress of events  occurrences to be hereafter related render it necessary to take advantage of this interval to inform the reader of the real nature and use of the vault in the temple wall the external appearance of which we have already described  the marking peculiarity in the construction of the pagan religion may be most aptly compared to the marking peculiarity in the construction of the pagan temples  both were designed to attract the general eye by the outward effect only which was in both the false delusive reflection of the inward substance  in the temple the people as they worshipped beneath the long colonnades or beheld the lofty porticoes from the street were left to imagine the corresponding majesty and symmetry of the interior of the structure and were not admitted to discover how grievously it disappointed the brilliant expectations which the exterior was so well calculated to inspire how little the dark narrow halls of the idols the secret vaults and gloomy recesses within fulfilled the promise of the long flights of steps the broad extent of pavement the massive sunbrightened pillars without  so in the religion the votary was allured by the splendour of processions by the pomp of auguries by the poetry of the superstition which peopled his native woods with the sportive dryads and the fountains from which he drank with their guardian naiads which gave to mountain and lake to sun and moon and stars to all things around and above him their fantastic allegory or their gracious legend of beauty and love  but beyond this his first acquaintance with his worship was not permitted to extend here his initiation concluded  he was kept in ignorance of the dark and dangerous depths which lurked beneath this smooth and attractive surface he was left to imagine that what was displayed was but the prelude to the future discovery of what was hidden of beauty in the rites of paganism he was not admitted to behold the wretched impostures the loathsome orgies the hideous incantations the bloody human sacrifices perpetrated in secret which made the foul real substance of the fair exterior form  his first sight of the temple was not less successful in deceiving his eye than his first impression of the religion in deluding his mind  with these hidden and guilty mysteries of the pagan worship the vault before which ulpius now stood with his captives was intimately connected  the human sacrifices offered among the romans were of two kinds those publicly and those privately performed  the first were of annual recurrence in the early years of the republic were prohibited at a later date were revived by augustus who sacrificed his prisoners of war at the altar of julius caesar and were afterwardsthough occasionally renewed for particular purposes under some subsequent reignswholly abandoned as part of the ceremonies of paganism during the later periods of the empire  the sacrifices perpetrated in private were much longer practised  they were connected with the most secret mysteries of the mythology were concealed from the supervision of government and lasted probably until the general extinction of heathen superstition in italy and the provinces  many and various were the receptacles constructed for the private immolation of human victims in different parts of the empirein its crowded cities as well as in its solitary woodsand among all one of the most remarkable and the longest preserved was the great cavity pierced in the wall of the temple which ulpius had chosen for his solitary lurkingplace in rome   it was not merely as a place of concealment for the act of immolation and for the corpse of the victim that the vault had been built  a sanguinary artifice had complicated the manner of its construction by placing in the cavity itself the instrument of the sacrifice by making it as it were not merely the receptacle but the devourer also of its human prey  at the bottom of the flight of steps leading down into it the top of which as we have already observed was alone visible from the entrance in the temple recess was fixed the image of a dragon formed in brass  the body of the monster protruding opposite the steps almost at a right angle from the wall was moved in all directions by steel springs which communicated with one of the lower stairs and also with a sword placed in the throat of the image to represent the dragons tongue  the walls around the steps narrowed so as barely to admit the passage of the human body when they approached the dragon  at the slightest pressure on the stair with which the spring communicated the body of the monster bent forward and the sword instantly protruded from its throat at such a height from the steps as ensure that it should transfix in a vital part the person who descended  the corpse then dropping by its own weight off the sword fell through a tunnelled opening beneath the dragon running downward in an opposite direction to that taken by the steps above and was deposited on an iron grating washed by the waters of the tiber which ran under the arched foundations of the temple  the grating was approached by a secret subterranean passage leading from the front of the building by which the sacrificing priests were enabled to reach the dead body to fasten weights to it and opening the grating to drop it into the river never to be beheld again by mortal eyes  in the days when this engine of destruction was permitted to serve the purpose for which the horrible ingenuity of its inventors had constructed it its principal victims were young girls  crowned with flowers and clad in white garments they were lured into immolating themselves by being furnished with rich offerings and told that the sole object of their fatal expedition down the steps of the vault was to realise the pictures adorning its walls which we have described a few pages back by presenting their gifts at the shrine of the idol below  at the period of which we write the dragon had for many yearssince the first prohibitions of paganismceased to be fed with its wonted prey  the scales forming its body grew gradually corroded and loosened by the damp and when moved by the wind which penetrated to them from beneath whistling up in its tortuous course through the tunnel that ran in one direction below and the vault of the steps that ascended in another above produced the clashing sound which has been mentioned as audible at intervals from the mouth of the cavity  but the springs which moved the deadly apparatus of the whole machine being placed within it under cover continued to resist the slow progress of time and of neglect and still remained as completely fitted as ever to execute the fatal purpose for which they had been designed  the ultimate destiny of the dragon of brass was the destiny of the religion whose bloodiest superstitions it embodied  it fell beneath the resistless advance of christianity  shortly after the date of our narrative the interior of the building beneath which it was placed having suffered from an accident which will be related farther on the exterior was dismantled in order that its pillars might furnish materials for a church  the vault in the wall was explored by a monk who had been present at the destruction of other pagan temples and who volunteered to discover its contents  with a torch in one hand and an iron bar in the other he descended into the cavity sounding the walls and the steps before him as he proceeded  for the first and the last time the sword protruded harmless from the monsters throat when the monk pressed the fatal stair before stepping on it with his iron bar the same day the machine was destroyed and cast into the tiber where its victims had been thrown before it in former years                                   some minutes have elapsed since we left the father and daughter standing by the pagans side before the mouth of the vault and as yet there appears no change in the several positions of the three  but already while ulpius still looks down steadfastly into the cavity at his feet his voice as he continues to speak grows louder and his words become more distinct  fearful recollections associated with the place are beginning to stir his weary memory to lift the darkness of oblivion from his idle thoughts  they go down far down there he abruptly exclaimed pointing into the black depths of the vault and never arise again to the light of the upper earth  the great destroyer is watchful in his solitude beneath and looks through the darkness for their approach  hark the hissing of his breath is like to the clash of weapons in a deadly strife  at this moment the wind moved the loose scales of the dragon  during an instant ulpius remained silent listening to the noise they produced for the first time an expression of dread appeared on his face  his memory was obscurely reviving the incidents of his discovery of the deadly machinery in the vault when he first made his sojourn in the temple whenfilled with the confused remembrance of the mysterious rites and incantations the secret sacrifices which he had witnessed and performed at alexandriahe had found and followed the subterranean passage which led to the iron grating beneath the dragon as the wind lulled again and the clashing of the metal ceased with it he began to give these recollections expression in words uttering them in slow solemn accents to himself  i have seen the destroyer the invisible has revealed himself to me he murmured  i stood on the iron bars the restless waters toiled and struggled beneath my feet as i looked up into the place of darkness  a voice called to me get light and behold me from above  get light get light  sun and moon and stars gave no light there but lamps burnt in the city in the houses of the dead when i walked by them in the nighttime and the lamp gave light when sun and moon and stars gave none from the top steps i looked down and saw the powerful one in his golden brightness and approached not but watched and listened in fear  the voice againthe voice was heard againsacrifice to me in secret as thy brethren sacrifice  give me the living where the living are and the dead where the dead  the air came up cold and the voice ceased and the lamp was like sun and moon and starsit gave no light in the place of darkness  while he spoke the loose metal again clashed in the vault for the wind was strengthening as the evening advanced  hark the signal to prepare the sacrifice cried the pagan turning abruptly to numerian listen bondman the living and the dead are within our reach  the breath of the invisible strikes them in the street and in the house they stagger in the highways and drop at the temple steps  when the hour comes we shall go forth and find them  under my hand they go down into the cavern beneath  whether they are hurled dead or whether they go down living they fall through to the iron bars where the water leaps and rejoices to receive them  it is mine to sacrifice them above and thine to wait for them below to lift the bars and give them to the river to be swallowed up  the dead drop down first the living that are slain by the destroyer follow after  here he paused suddenly  now for the first time his eye rested on antonina whose very existence he seemed hitherto to have forgotten  a revolting smile of mingled cunning and satisfaction instantly changed the whole character of his countenance as he gazed on her and then looked round significantly to the vault  here is one he whispered to numerian taking her by the arm  keep her captivethe hour is near  numerian had hitherto stood unheedful while he spoke but when he touched antonina the bare action was enough to arouse the father to resistancehopeless though it wasonce more  he shook off the grasp of ulpius from the girls arm and drew back with herbreathless vigilant desperateto the sidewall behind him  the madman laughed in proud approval  my bondman obeys me and seizes the captive he cried he remembers that the hour is near and loosens not his hold  come he continued come out into the hall beyondit is time that we watch for more victims for the sacrifice till the sun goes down  the destroyer is mighty and must be obeyed   he walked to the entrance leading into the first apartment of the temple and then waited to be followed by numerian who now for the first time separated from ulpius remained stationary in the position he had last occupied and looked eagerly around him  no chance of escape presented itself the mouth of the vault on one side and the passage through the partition on the other were the only outlets to the place there was no hope but to follow the pagan into the great hall of the temple to keep carefully at a distance from him and to watch the opportunity of flight through the doorway the street so desolate when last beheld might now afford more evidence that it was inhabited citizens guards might be passing by and might be summoned into the templehelp might be at hand  as he moved forward with antonina such thoughts passed rapidly through the fathers mind unaccompanied at the moment by the recollection of the stranger who had followed them from the pincian gate or of the apathy of the famished populace in aiding each other in any emergency seeing that he was followed as he had commanded ulpius passed on before them to the pile of idols but a strange and sudden alteration appeared in his gait  he had hitherto walked with the step of a manyoung strong and resolute of purpose now he dragged one limb after the other as slowly and painfully as if he had received a mortal hurt  he tottered with more than the infirmity of his age his head dropped upon his breast and he moaned and murmured inarticulately in low longdrawn cries  he had advanced to the side of the pile halfway towards the doorway of the temple when numerian who had watched with searching eyes the abrupt change in his demeanour forgetting the dissimulation which might still be allimportant abandoned himself to his first impulse and hurriedly pressing forward with antonina attempted to pass the pagan and escape  but at the moment ulpius stopped in his slow progress reeled threw out his hands convulsively and seizing numerian by the arm staggered back with him against the sidewall of the temple  the fingers of the tortured wretch closed as if they were never to be unlocked againclosed as if with the clutch of death with the last frantic grasp of a drowning man  for days and nights past he had toiled incessantly under the relentless tyranny of his frenzy building up higher and higher his altar of idols and pouring forth his invocations before his gods in the place of the sacrifice and now at the moment when he was most triumphant in his ferocious activity of purpose when his fancied bondman and his fancied victim were most helpless at his commandnow when his strained faculties were strung to their highest pitch the longdeferred paroxysm had seized him which was the precursor of his repose of the only repose granted by his awful fatea change the mournful change already described in the form of his insanity  for at those rare periods when he slept his sleep was not unconsciousness not rest  it was a trance of hideous dreamshis tongue spoke his limbs moved when he slumbered as when he woke  it was only when his visions of the pride the power the fierce conflicts and daring resolutions of his maturer years gave place to his dim quiet waking dreams of his boyish days that his wasted faculties reposed and his body rested with them in the motionless languor of perfect fatigue then if words were still uttered by his lips they were as murmurs of an infanthappy sleep for the innocent phrases of his childhood which they then revived seemed for a time to bring with them the innocent tranquillity of his childhood as well  go gofly while you are yet free cried numerian dropping the hand of antonina and pointing to the door  but for the second time the girl refused to move forward a step  no horror no peril in the temple could banish for an instant her remembrance of the night at the farmhouse in the suburbs she kept her head turned towards the vacant entrance fixed her eyes on it in the unintermitting watchfulness of terror and whispered affrightedly goisvintha  goisvintha when her father spoke   the clasp of the pagans fingers remained fixed and deathlike as at first he leaned back against the wall as still as if life and action had for ever departed from him  the paroxysm had passed away his face distorted but the moment before was now in repose but it was a repose that was awful to look on  tears rolled slowly from his halfclosed eyes over his seamed and wrinkled cheekstears which were not the impressive expression of mental anguish for a vacant and unchanging smile was on his lips but the mere mechanical outburst of the physical weakness that the past crisis of agony had left behind it not the slightest appearance of thought or observation was perceptible in his features his face was the face of an idiot  numerian who had looked on him for an instant shuddered and averted his eyes recoiling from the sight before him  but a more overpowering trial of his resolution was approaching which he could not avoid  ere long the voice of ulpius grew audible once more but now its tones were weak piteous almost childish and the words they uttered were quiet words of love and gentleness which dropping from such lips and pronounced in such a place were fearful to hear  the temple and all that was in it vanished from his sight as from his memory  swayed by the dread and supernatural influences of his disease the madman passed back in an instant over the dark valley of lifes evil pilgrimage to the longquitted precincts of his boyish home  while in bodily presence he stood in the place of his last crimes the outcast of reason and humanity in mental consciousness he lay in his mothers arms as he had lain there ere yet he had departed to the temple at alexandria and his heart communed with her heart and his eyes looked on her as they had looked before his fathers fatal ambition had separated for ever parent and child  mothercome back mother he whispered  i was not asleep  i saw you when you came in and sat by my bedside and wept over me when you kissed me  come back and sit by me still  i am going away far away and may never hear your voice again  how happy we should be mother if i stayed with you always  but it is my fathers will that i should go to the temple in another country and live there to be a priest and his will must be obeyed  i may never return but we shall not forget one another  i shall remember your words when we used to talk together happily and you shall still remember mine  hardly had the first sentence been uttered by ulpius when antonina felt her fathers whole frame suddenly tremble at her side  she turned her eyes from the doorway on which they had hitherto been fixed and looked on him  the pagans hand had fallen from his arm  he was free to depart to fly as he had longed to fly but a few minutes before and yet he never stirred  his daughter touched him spoke to him but he neither moved nor answered  it was not merely the shock of the abrupt transition in the language of ulpius from the ravings of crime to the murmurs of loveit was not merely astonishment at hearing from him in his madness revelations of his early life which had never passed his lips during his days of treacherous servitude in the house on the pincian hill that thus filled numerians inmost soul with awe and struck his limbs motionless  there was more in all that he heard than this  the words seemed as words that had doomed him at once and for ever  his eyes directed full on the face of the madman were dilated with horror and his deep gasping convulsive breathings mingled heavily during the moment of silence that ensued with the chiming of the bells above and the bubbling of the water belowthe lulling music of the temple playing its happy evening hymn at the pleasant close of day  we shall remember motherwe shall remember continued the pagan softly and be happy in our remembrances  my brother who loves me not will love you when i am gone  you will walk in my little garden and think on me as you look at the flowers that we have planted and watered together in the evening hours when the sky was glorious to behold and the earth was all quiet around us listen mother and kiss me  when i go to the far country i will make a garden there like my garden here and plant the same flowers that we have planted here and in the evening i will go out and give them water at the hour when you go out to give my flowers water at home and so though we see each other no more it will yet be as if we laboured together in the garden as we labour now   the girl still fixed her eager gaze on her father  his eyes presented the same rigid expression of horror but he was now wiping off with his own hand mechanically as if he knew it not the foam which the paroxysms had left round the madmans lips and amid the groans that burst from him she could hear such words as lord godmercy lord god  thou who hast thus restored him to methus worse than deadmercy mercy  the light on the pavement beneath the portico of the temple was fading visiblythe sun had gone down  for the third time the madman spoke but his tones were losing their softness they were complaining plaintive unutterably mournful his dreams of the past were already changing  farewell brotherfarewell for years and years he cried  you have not given me the love that i gave you  the fault was not mine that our father loved me the best and chose me to be sent to the temple to be a priest at the altar of the gods  the fault was not mine that i partook not in your favoured sports and joined not the companions whom you sought it was our fathers will that i should not live as you lived and i obeyed it you have spoken to me in anger and turned from me in disdain but farewell again cleanderfarewell in forgiveness and in love  he might have spoken more but his voice was drowned in one long shriek of agony which burst from numerians lips and echoed discordantly through the hall of the temple and he sank down with his face to the ground at the pagans feet  the dark and terrible destiny was fulfilled  the enthusiast for the right and the fanatic for the wrong the man who had toiled to reform the church and the man who had toiled to restore the temple the master who had received and trusted the servant in his home and the servant who in that home had betrayed the masters trustthe two characters separated hitherto in the sublime disunion of good and bad now struck together in tremendous contact as brethren who had drawn their life from one source who as children had been sheltered under the same roof  not in the hours when the good christian succoured the then forsaken pagan wandering homeless in rome was the secret disclosed no chance word of it was uttered when the deceiver told the feigned relation of his life to the benefactor whom he was plotting to deceive or when on the first morning of the siege the machinations of the servant triumphed over the confidence of the master it was reserved to be revealed in the words of delirium at the closing years of madness when he who discovered it was unconscious of all that he spoke and his eyes were blinded to the true nature of all that he saw when earthly voices that might once have called him back to repentance to recognition and to love were become to him as sounds that have no meaning when by a ruthless and startling fatality it was on the brother who had wrought for the true faith that the whole crushing weight of the terrible disclosure fell unpartaken by the brother who had wrought for the false  but the judgments pronounced in time go forth from the tribunal of that eternity to which the mysteries of life tend and in which they shall be revealedneither waiting on human seasons nor abiding by human justice but speaking to the soul in the language of immortality which is heard in the world that is now and interpreted in the world that is to come  lost for an instant even the recollection that goisvintha might still be watching her opportunity from without calling despairingly on her father and vainly striving to raise him from the ground antonina remembered not in the overwhelming trial of the moment the revelations of numerians past life that had been disclosed to her in the days when the famine was at its worst in rome  the name of cleander which she had then heard her father pronounce as the name that he had abandoned when he separated himself from the companions of his sinful choice passed unheeded by her when the pagan unconsciously uttered it  she saw the whole scene but as a fresh menace of danger as a new vision of terror more ominous of ill than all that had preceded it   thick as was the darkness in which the lulling and involuntary memories of the past had enveloped the perceptions of ulpius the fathers piercing cry of anguish seemed to have penetrated it with a sudden ray of light  the madmans halfclosed eyes opened instantly and fixed dreamily at first on the altar of idols  he waved his hands to and fro before him as if he were parting back the folds of a heavy veil that obscured his sight but his wayward thoughts did not resume as yet their old bias towards ferocity and crime  when he spoke again his speech was still inspired by the visions of his early lifebut now of his early life in the temple at alexandria  his expressions were more abrupt more disjointed than before yet they continued to display the same evidence of the mysterious instinctive vividness of recollection which was the result of the sudden change in the nature of his insanity his language wandered still as if the words came from him undesignedly and unconsciously over the events of his boyish introduction to the service of the gods and though confusing them in order still preserved them in substance as they have been already related in the history of his apprenticeship to the temple  now he was in imagination looking down once more from the summit of the temple of serapis on the glittering expanse of the nile and the wide country around it and now he was walking proudly through the streets of alexandria by the side of his uncle macrinus the high priest  now he was wandering at night in curiosity and awe through the gloomy vaults and subterranean corridors of the sacred place and now he was listening well pleased to the kindly greeting the inspiring praises of macrinus during their first interview  but at this point and while dwelling on this occasion his memory became darkened again it vainly endeavoured to retrace the circumstances attending the crowning evidence of the high priests interest in his pupil and anxiety to identify him completely with his new protector and his new duties which had been displayed when he conferred on the trembling boy the future distinction of one of his own names  and here let it be remembered as a chief link in the mysterious chain of fatalities which had united to keep the brothers apart as brethren after they had met as men that both had from widely different causes abandoned in afterlife the names which they bore in their fathers house that while one by his own act and for his own purpose transformed himself from cleander the associate of the careless and the criminal to numerian the preacher of the gospel and reformer of the church the other had to quote the words of the fourth chapter become from the boy emilius the student ulpius by the express and encouraging command of his master macrinus the high priest  while the pagan still fruitlessly endeavoured to revive the events connected with the change in his designation on his arrival in alexandria and chafing under the burden of oblivion that weighed upon his thoughts attempted for the first time to move from the wall against which he had hitherto leaned while antonina still strove in vain to recall her father to the recollection of the terrible exigencies of the moment as he crouched prostrate at the madmans feetthe doorway of the temple was darkened once more by the figure of goisvintha  she stood on the threshold a gloomy and indistinct form in the fading light looking intently into the deeply shadowed interior of the building as she marked the altered positions of the father and daughter she uttered a suppressed ejaculation of triumph but while the sound passed her lips she heard or thought she heard a noise in the street behind  even now her vigilance and cunning her deadly calculating resolution to await in immovable patience the fitting time for striking the blow deliberately and with impunity did not fail her turning instantly she walked to the top step of the temple and stood there for a few moments watchfully surveying the open space before her   but in those few moments the scene in the building changed once more the madman while he still wavered between relapsing into the raving fit and continuing under the influence of the tranquil mood in which he had been prematurely disturbed caught sight of goisvintha when her approach suddenly shadowed the entrance to the temple  her presence momentary though it was was for him the presence of a figure that had not appeared before that had stood in a strange position between the shade within and the faint light without it was a new object presented to his eyes while they were straining to recover such imperfect faculties of observation as had been their wont and it ascendancy over him was instantaneous and allpowerful  he started bewildered like a deep sleeper suddenly awoke violent shudderings ran for a moment over his frame then it strengthened again with its former unnatural strength the demon raged within him in renewed fury as he tore his robe which numerian held as he lay at his feet from the feeble grasp that confined it and striding up to the pile of idols stretched out his hands in solemn deprecation  the high priest has slept before the altar of the gods he cried loudly but they have been patient with their wellbeloved their thunder has not struck him for his crime  now the servant returns to his servicethe rites of serapis begin  numerian still remained prostrate spiritbroken he slowly clasped his hands together on the floor and his voice was now to be heard still supplicating in low and stifled accents as if in unceasing prayer lay his last hope of preserving his own reason  god  thou art the god of mercy be merciful to him he murmured  thou acceptest of repentance grant repentance to him  if at any time i have served thee without blame let the service be counted to him let the vials of thy wrath be poured out on me  hark the trumpet blows for the sacrifice interrupted the raving voice of the pagan as he turned from the altar and extended his arms in frenzied inspiration  the roar of music and the voice of exultation soar upward from the highest mountaintops  the incense smokes and in and out and round and round the dancers whirl about the pillars of the temple  the ox for the sacrifice is without spot his horns are gilt the crown and fillet adorn his head  the priest stands before him naked from the waist upwards he heaves the libation out of the cup the blood flows over the altar up up tear forth with reeking hands the heart while it is yet warm futurity is before you in the quivering entrails look on them and read read  while he spoke goisvintha had entered the temple  the street was still desolate no help was at hand  not advancing at once she concealed herself near the door behind a projection in the pile of idols watching from it until ulpius in the progress of his frenzy should turn away from antonina whom he stood fronting at this instant  but she had not entered unperceived antonina had seen her again and now the bitterness of death when the young die unprotected in their youth came over the girl and she cried in a low wailing voice as she knelt by numerians side  i must die father i must die as hermanric died  look up at me and speak to me before i die  her father was still praying he heard nothing for his heart was bleeding in atonement at the shrine of his boyish home and his soul still communed with its maker  the voice that followed hers was the voice of ulpius  oh beautiful are the gardens round the sacred altars and lofty the trees that embower the glittering shrines he exclaimed rapt and ecstatic in his new visions  lo the morning breaks and the spirits of light are welcomed by a sacrifice  the sun goes down behind the mountain and the beams of evening tremble on the victim beneath the knife of the adoring priest  the moon and stars shine high in the firmament and the genii of nights are saluted in the still hours with blood  as he paused the lament of antonina was continued in lower and lower tones  i must die father i must die  and with it murmured the supplicating accents of numerian  god of mercy deliver the helpless and forgive the afflicted  lord of judgment deal gently with thy servants who have sinned while mingling with both in discordant combination the strange music of the temple still poured on its lulling soundthe rippling of the running waters and the airy chiming of the bells   worshipemperors armies nations glorify and worship me shouted the madman in thundertones of triumph and command as his eye for the first time encountered the figure of numerian prostrate at his feet worship the demigod who moves with the deities through spheres unknown to man  i have heard the moans of the unburied who wander on the shores of the lake of the deadworship  i have looked on the river whose black current roars and howls in its course through the caves of everlasting nightworship  i have seen the furies lashed by serpents on their wrinkled necks and followed them as they hurled their torches over the pining ghosts  i have stood unmoved in the hurricanetumult of hellworship worship worship  he turned round again towards the altar of idols calling upon his gods to proclaim his deification and at the moment when he moved goisvintha sprang forward  antonina was kneeling with her face turned from the door as the assassin seized her by her long hair and drove the knife into her neck the moaning accents of the girl bewailing her approaching fate closed in one faint groan she stretched out her arms and fell forward over her fathers body  in the ferocious triumph of the moment goisvintha raised her arm to repeat the stroke but at that instant the madman looked round  the sacrificethe sacrifice he shouted leaping at one spring like a wild beast at her throat  she struck ineffectually at him with the knife as he fastened his long nails in her flesh and hurled her backwards to the floor  then he yelled and gibbered in frantic exultation set his foot on her breast and spat on her as she lay beneath him  the contact of the girls body when she fellthe short but terrible tumult of the attack that passed almost over himthe shrill deafening cries of the madman awoke numerian from his trance of despairing remembrance aroused him in his agony of supplicating prayer  he looked up  the scene that met his eyes was one of those scenes which crush every faculty but the faculty of mechanical actionbefore which thought vanishes from mens minds utterance is suspended on their lips expression is paralysed on their faces  the coldness of the tomb seemed breathed over numerians aspect by the contemplation of the terrible catastrophe  his eyes were glassy and vacant his lips parted and rigid even the remembrance of the discovery of his brother seemed lost to him as he stooped over his daughter and bound a fragment of her robe round her neck  the mute soulless ghastly stillness of death looked settled on his features as unconscious now of weakness or age he rose with her in his arms stood motionless for one moment before the doorway and looked slowly round on ulpius then he moved forward with heavy regular steps  the pagans foot was still on goisvinthas breast as the father passed him his gaze was still fixed on her but his cries of triumph were calmed he laughed and muttered incoherently to himself  the moon was rising soft faint and tranquil over the quiet street as numerian descended the temple steps with his daughter in his arms and after an instants pause of bewilderment and doubt instinctively pursued his slow funereal course along the deserted roadway in the direction of home soon as he advanced he beheld in the moonlight down the long vista of the street at its termination a little assemblage of people walking towards him with calm and regular progress as they came nearer he saw that one of them held an open book that another carried a crucifix and that others followed these two with clasped hands and drooping heads  and then after an interval the fresh breezes that blew towards him bore onward these words slowly and reverently pronounced  know therefore that god exacteth of thee less than thine iniquity deserveth  canst thou by searching find out god  canst thou find out the almighty to perfection  then the breeze fell the words grew indistinct but the procession still moved forward  as it came nearer and nearer the voice of the reader was again plainly heard  if iniquity be in thy hand put it far away and let not wickedness dwell in thy tabernacles  for then shalt thou lift up thy face without spot yea thou shalt be steadfast and shalt not fear  because thou shalt forget thy misery and remember it as waters that pass away  and thine age shall be clearer than the noonday thou shalt shine forth thou shalt be as the morning  the reader stopped and closed the book for now numerian had met the members of the little procession and they looked on him standing voiceless before them in the clear moonlight with his daughters head drooping over his shoulder as he carried her in his arms  there were some among those who gathered round him whose features he would have recognised at another time as the features of the surviving adherents of his former congregation  the assembly he had met was composed of the few sincere christians in rome who had collected on the promulgation of the news that alaric had ratified terms of peace to make a pilgrimage through the city in the hopeless endeavour by reading from the bible and passing exhortation to awaken the reckless populace to a feeling of contrition for their sins and of devout gratitude for their approaching deliverance from the horrors of the siege  but now when numerian confronted them neither by word nor look did he express the slightest recognition of any who surrounded him  to all the questions addressed to him he replied by hurried gestures that none could comprehend  to all the promises of help and protection heaped upon him in the first outbreak of the grief and pity of his adherents of other days he answered but by the same dull vacant glance  it was only when they relieved him of his burden and gently prepared to carry the senseless girl among them back to her fathers house that he spoke and then in faint entreating tones he besought them to let him hold her hand as they went so that he might be the first to feel her pulse beatif it yet moved  they turned back by the way they had comea sorrowful and slowmoving procession  as they passed on the reader again opened the sacred book and then these words rose through the soothing and heavenly tranquillity of the first hours of night  behold happy is the man whom god correcteth  therefore despise not thou the chastening of the almighty  for he maketh sore and bindeth up  he woundeth and his hands make whole    chapter 26  retribution  as in the progress of life each man pursues his course with the passions good and evil set as it were on either side of him and viewing their results in the actions of his fellowmen finds his attention while still attracted by the spectacle of what is noble and virtuous suddenly challenged by the opposite display of what is mean and criminalso in the progress of this narrative which aims to be the reflection of life the reader who has journeyed with us thus far and who may now be inclined to follow the little procession of christian devotees to walk by the side of the afflicted father and to hold with him the hand of his illfated child is yet in obedience to the conditions of the story required to turn back for awhile to the contemplation of its darker passages of guilt and terrorhe must enter the temple again but he will enter it for the last time  the scene before the altar of idols was fast proceeding to its fatal climax   the pagans frenzy had exhausted itself in its own furyhis insanity was assuming a quieter and a more dangerous form his eye grew cunning and suspicious a stealthy deliberation and watchfulness appeared in all his actions  he now slowly lifted his foot from goisvinthas breast and raised his hands at the same time to strike her back if she should attempt to escape  seeing that she lay senseless from her fall he left her retired to one of the corners of the temple took from it a rope that lay there and returning bound her arms behind her at the hands and wrists  the rope cut deep through the skinthe pain restored her to her senses she suffered the sharp agony in her own body in the same place where she had inflicted it on the young chieftain at the farmhouse beyond the suburbs  the minute after she felt herself dragged along the ground farther into the interior of the building the madman drew her up to the iron gates of the passage through the partition and fastening the end of the rope to them left her there  this part of the temple was enveloped in total darknessher assailant addressed not a word to hershe could not obtain even a glimpse of his form but she could hear him still laughing to himself in hoarse monotonous tones that sounded now near and now distant again  she abandoned herself as lostprematurely devoted to the torment and death that she had anticipated but as yet her masculine resolution and energy did not decline  the very intensity of the anguish she suffered from the bindings at her wrists producing a fierce bodily effort to resist it strengthened her ironstrung nerves  she neither cried for help nor appealed to the pagan for pity the gloomy fatalism which she had inherited from her savage ancestors sustained her in a suicidepride  ere long the laughter of ulpius while he moved slowly hither and thither in the darkness of the temple was overpowered by the sound of her voicedeep groaning but yet steadyas she uttered her last wordswords poured forth like the wild dirges the fierce deathsongs of the old goths when they died deserted on the bloody battlefield or were cast bound into deep dungeons a prey to the viper and the asp thus she spoke  i swore to be avenged while i went forth from aquileia with the child that was killed and the child that was wounded while i climbed the high wall in the nighttime and heard the tumult of the beating waves near the bank where i buried the dead while i wandered in the darkness over the naked heath and through the lonely forest while i climbed the pathless sides of the mountains and made my refuge in the cavern by the waters of the dark lake  i swore to be avenged while the warriors approached me on their march and the roaring of the trumpets and the clash of the armour sounded in my ears while i greeted my kinsman hermanric a mighty chieftain at the kings side among the invading hosts while i looked on my last child dead like the rest and knew that he was buried afar from the land of his people and from the others that the romans had slain before him  i swore to be avenged while the army encamped before rome and i stood with hermanric looking on the great walls in the misty evening while the daughter of the roman was a prisoner in our tent and i eyed her as she lay on my knees while for her sake my kinsman turned traitor and withheld my hand from the blow while i passed unseen into the lonely farmhouse to deal judgment on him with my knife while i saw him die the death of a deserter at my feet and knew that it was a roman who had lured him from his people and blinded him to the righteousness of revenge  i swore to be avenged while i walked round the grave of the chieftain who was the last of my race while i stood alone out of the army of my people in the city of the slayers of my babes while i  tracked the footsteps of the roman who had twice escaped me as she fled through the street while i watched and was patient among the pillars of the temple and waited till the sun went down and the victim was unshielded for the moment to strike   i swore to be avenged and my oath has been fulfilledthe knife that still bleeds drops with her blood the chief vengeance has been wreaked the rest that were to be slain remain for others and not for me  for now i go to my husband and my children now the hour is near at hand when i shall herd with their spirits in the twilight world of shadows and make my longabiding place with them in the valley of eternal repose  the destinies have willed itit is enough  her voice trembled and grew faint as she pronounced the last words the anguish of the fastenings at her wrists was at last overpowering her sensesconquering in spite of all resistance her stubborn endurance for a little while yet she spoke at intervals but her speech was fragmentary and incoherent  at one moment she still gloried in her revenge at another she exulted in the fancied contemplation of the girls body still lying before her and her hands writhed beneath their bonds in the effort to repossess themselves of the knife and strike again  but soon all sounds ceased to proceed from her lips save the loud thick irregular breathings which showed that she was yet conscious and yet lived  meanwhile the madman had passed into the inner recess of the temple and had drawn the shutter over the opening in the wall through which light had been admitted into the place when numerian and antonina first entered it  even the black chasm formed by the mouth of the vault of the dragon now disappeared with all other objects in the thick darkness  but no obscurity could confuse the senses of ulpius in the temple whose every corner he visited in his restless wanderings by night and by day alike  led as if by a mysterious penetration of sight he traced his way unerringly to the entrance of the vault knelt down before it and placing his hands on the first of the steps by which it was descended listened breathless and attentive to the sounds that rose from the abysslistened rapt and unmoving a formidable and unearthly figurelike a magician waiting for a voice from the oracles of helllike a spirit of night looking down into the midcaverns of the earth and watching the mysteries of subterranean creation the giant pulses of action and heat which are the lifesprings of the rolling world  the fitful wind whistled up wild and plaintive the river chafed and bubbled through the iron grating below the loose scales of the dragon clashed as the night breezes reached them  and these sounds were still to him as the language of his gods which filled him with a fearful rapture and inspired him in the terrible degradation of his being as with a new soul  he listened and listened yet fragments of wild fanciesthe vain yearnings of the disinherited mind to recover its divine birthright of boundless thoughtnow thrilled through him and held him still and speechless where he knelt  but at length through the gloomy silence of the recess he heard the voice of goisvintha raised once more and in hoarse wild tones calling aloud for light and help  the agony of pain and suspense the awful sense of darkness and stillness of solitary bondage and slow torment had at last effected that which no open peril no common menace of violent death could have produced  she yielded to fear and despairsank prostrate under a paralysing superstitious dread  the misery that she had inflicted on others recoiled in retribution on herself as she now shuddered under the consciousness of the first emotions of helpless terror that she had ever felt  ulpius instantly rose from the vault and advanced straight through the darkness to the gates of the partition but he passed his prisoner without stopping for an instant and hastening into the outer apartment of the temple began to grope over the floor for the knife which the woman had dropped when he bound her  he was laughing to himself once more for the evil spirit was prompting him to a new project tempting him to a pitiless refinement of cruelty and deceit  he found the knife and returning with it to goisvintha cut the rope that confined her wrists  then she became silent when the first sharpness of her suffering was assuaged he whispered softly in her ear follow me and escape   bewildered and daunted by the darkness and mystery around her she vainly strained her eyes to look through the obscurity as ulpius drew her on into the recess  he placed her at the mouth of the vault and here she strove to speak but low inarticulate sounds alone proceeded from her powerless utterance  still there was no light still the burning gnawing agony at her wrists relieved but for an instant when the rope was cut continued and increased and still she felt the presence of the unseen being at her side whom no darkness could blind and who bound and loosed at his arbitrary will  by nature fierce resolute and vindictive under injury she was a terrible evidence of the debasing power of crime as she now stood enfeebled by the weight of her own avenging guilt upraised to crush her in the hour of her pride by the agency of darkness whose perils the innocent and the weak have been known to brave by suspense whose agony they have resisted by pain whose infliction they have endured in patience  go down far down the steep steps and escape whispered the madman in soft beguiling tones the darkness above leads to the light below go down far down  he quitted his hold of her as he spoke  she hesitated shuddered and drew back but again she was urged forward and again she heard the whisper the darkness above leads to the light below  go down far down  despair gave the firmness to proceed and dread the hope to escape her wounded arms trembled as she now stretched them out and felt for the walls of the vault on either side of her  the horror of death in utter darkness from unseen hands and the last longing aspiration to behold the light of heaven once more were at their strongest within her as she began slowly and cautiously to tread the fatal stairs  while she descended the pagan dropped into his former attitude at the month of the vault and listened breathlessly  minutes seemed to elapse between each step as she went lower and lower down  suddenly he heard her pause as if panicstricken in the darkness and her voice ascended to him groaning light light oh where is the light  he rose up and stretched out his hands to hurl her back if she should attempt to return but she descended again  twice he heard her heavy footfall on the stepsthen there was an interval of deep silencethen a sharp grinding clash of metal echoed piercingly through the vault followed by the noise of a dull heavy fall faintly audible far beneathand then the old familiar sounds of the place were heard again and were not interrupted more  the sacrifice to the dragon was achieved                                  the madman stood on the steps of the sacred building and looked out on the street shining before him in the bright italian moonlight  no remembrance of numerian and antonina and of the earlier events in the temple remained within him  he was pondering imperfectly in vague pride and triumph over the sacrifice that he had offered up at the shrine of the dragon of brass  thus secretly exulting he now remained inactive  absorbed in his wandering meditations he delayed to trace the subterranean passages leading to the iron grating where the corpse of goisvintha lay washed by the waters as they struggled onward through the bars and waiting but his hand to be cast into the river where all past sacrifices had been engulphed before it  his tall solitary figure was lit by the moonlight streaming through the pillars of the portico his loose robes waved slowly about him in the wind as he stood firm and erect before the door of the temple he looked more like the spectral genius of departed paganism than a living man  but lifeless though he seemed his quick eye was still on the watch still directed by the restless suspicion of insanity minute after minute quietly elapsed and as yet nothing was presented to his rapid observation but the desolate roadway and the high gloomy houses that bounded it on either side  it was soon however destined to be attracted by objects which startled the repose of the tranquil street with the tumult of action and life   he was still gazing earnestly on the narrow view before him vaguely imagining to himself the while goisvinthas fatal descent into the vault and thinking triumphantly of her dead body that now lay on the grating beneath it when a red glare of torchlight thrown wildly on the moonbrightened pavement whose purity it seemed to stain caught his eye  the light appeared at the end of the street leading from the more central portion of the city and ere long displayed clearly a body of forty or fifty people advancing towards the temple  the pagan looked eagerly on them as they came nearer and nearer  the assembly was composed of priests soldiers and citizensthe priests bearing torches the soldiers carrying hammers crowbars and other similar tools or bending under the weight of large chests secured with iron fastenings close to which the populace walked as if guarding them with jealous care  this strange procession was preceded by two men who were considerably in advance of ita priest and soldier  an expression of impatience and exultation appeared on their pale faminewasted countenances as they approached the temple with rapid steps  ulpius never moved from his position but fixed his piercing eyes on them as they advanced  not vainly did he now stand watchful and menacing before the entrance of his gloomy shrine  he had seen the first degradations heaped on fallen paganism and he was now to see the last  he had immolated all his affections and all his hopes all his faculties of body and mind his happiness in boyhood his enthusiasm in youth his courage in manhood his reason in old age at the altar of his gods and now they were to exact from him in their defence lonely criminal maddened as he already was in their cause more than all this  the decree had gone forth from the senate which devoted to legalised pillage the treasures in the temples of rome  rulers of a people impoverished by former exactions and comptrollers only of an exhausted treasury the government of the city had searched vainly among all ordinary resources for the means of paying the heavy ransom exacted by alaric as the price of peace  the one chance of meeting the emergency that remained was to strip the pagan temples of the mass of jewelled ornaments and utensils the costly robes the idols of gold and silver which they were known to contain and which under that mysterious hereditary influence of superstition whose power it is the longest labour of truth to destroy had remained untouched and respected alike by the people and the senate after the worship that they represented had been interdicted by the laws and abandoned by the nation  this last expedient for freeing rome from the blockade was adopted almost as soon as imagined  the impatience of the starved populace for the immediate collection of the ransom allowed the government little time for the tedious preliminaries of deliberation  the soldiers were provided at once with the necessary implements for the task imposed on them certain chosen members of the senate and the people followed them to see that they honestly gathered in the public spoil and the priests of the christian churches volunteered to hallow the expedition by their presence and led the way with their torches into every secret apartment of the temples where treasure might be contained at the close of the day immediately after it had been authorised this strange search for the ransom was hurriedly commenced  already much had been collected votive offerings of price had been snatched from the altars where they had so long hung undisturbed hidden treasurechests of sacred utensils had been discovered and broken open idols had been stripped of their precious ornaments and torn from their massive pedestals and now the procession of goldseekers proceeding along the banks of the tiber had come in sight of the little temple of serapis and were hastening forward to empty it in its turn of every valuable that it contained  the priest and the soldier calling to their companions behind to hurry on had now arrived opposite the temple steps and saw confronting them in the pale moonlight from the eminence on which he stood the weird and solitary figure of ulpiusthe apparition of a pagan in the gorgeous robes of his priesthood bidden back from the tombs to stay the hand of the spoiler before the shrine of his gods  the soldier dropped his weapon to the ground and trembling in every limb refused to proceed but the priest a tall stern emaciated man went on defenceless and undaunted  he signed himself solemnly with the cross as he slowly ascended the steps fixed his unflinching eyes on the madman who glared back on him in return and called aloud in a harsh steady voice  man or demon in the name of christ whom thou deniest stand back  for an instant as the priest approached him the pagan averted his eyes and looked on the concourse of people and the armed soldiers rapidly advancing  his fingers closed round the hilt of goisvinthas knife which he had hitherto held loosely in his hand as he exclaimed in low concentrated tones aha the siegethe siege of serapis the priest now standing on the same step with him stretched out his arm to thrust him back and at that moment received the stroke of the knife  he staggered lifted his hand again to sign his forehead with the cross and as he raised it rolled back dead on the pavement of the street  the soldier standing motionless with superstitious terror a few feet from the corpse called to his companions for help  hurling his bloody weapon at them in defiance as they ran in confusion to the base of the temple steps ulpius entered the building and locked and chained the gates  then the assembled people thronging round the corpse of the priest heard the madman shouting in his frenzy as if to a great body of adherents round him to pour down the molten lead and the scorching sand to hurl back every scaling ladder planted against the walls to massacre each prisoner who was seized mounting the ramparts to the assault and as they looked up to the building from the street they saw at intervals through the bars of the closed gates the figure of ulpius passing swift and shadowy his arms extended his long grey hair and white robes streaming behind him as he rushed round and round the temple reiterating his wild pagan warcries as he went  the enfeebled superstitious populace trembled while they gazeda spectre driven on a whirlwind would not have been more terrible to their eyes  but the priest among the crowd roused to fury by the murder of one of their own body revived the courage of those around them  even the shouts of ulpius were now overpowered by the sound of their voices raised to the highest pitch promising heavenly and earthly rewardssalvation money absolution promotionto all who would follow them up the steps and burst their way into the temple  animated by the words of the priests and growing gradually confident in their own numbers the boldest in the throng seized a piece of timber lying by the river side and using it as a batteringram assailed the gate but they were weakened with famine they could gain little impetus from the necessity of ascending the temple steps to the attack the iron quivered as they struck it but hinge and lock remained firm alike  they were preparing to renew the attempt when a tremendous shocka crash as if the whole heavy roof of the building had fallen indrove them back in terror to the street  recalled by the sight of the armed men the priests and the attendant crowd of people who were advancing to invade his sanctuary to the days when he had defended the great temple of serapis at alexandria against enemies similar in appearance though far superior in numbers persuaded in the revival of these the most sanguinary visions of his insanity that he was still resisting the christian fanatics supported by his adherents in his sacred fortress of former years the pagan displayed none of his accustomed cunning and care in moving through the darkness around him  he hurried hither and thither encouraging his imaginary followers and glorying in his dreams of slaughter and success forgetful in his frenzy of all that the temple contained   as he pursued his wild course round and round the altar of idols his robe became entangled and was torn by the projecting substances at one corner of it  the whole overhanging mass tottered at the moment but did not yet fall  a few of the smaller idols however at the outside dropped to the ground and with them an image of serapis which they happened partially to supporta heavy monstrous figure carved lifesize in wood and studded with gold silver and precious stonesfell at the pagans feet  but this was allthe outer materials of the perilous structure had been detached only at one point the pile itself still remained in its place  the madman seized the image of serapis in his arms and passed blindly onward with it through the passage in the partition into the recess beyond  at that instant the shock of the first attack on the gates resounded through the building  shouting as he heard it a sally a sally men of the temple the gods and the high priest lead you on and still holding the idol before him he rushed straight forward to the entrance and struck in violent collision against the backward part of the pile  the illbalanced topheavy mass of images and furniture of many temples swayed parted and fell over against the gates and the wall on either side of them  maimed and bleeding struck down by the lower part of the pile as it was forced back against the partition when the upper part fell the fury of ulpius was but increased by the crashing ruin around him  he struggled up again into an erect position mounted on the top of the fallen massnow spread out at the sides over the floor of the building but confined at one end by the partition and at the other by the opposite wall and the gatesand still clasping the image of serapis in his arms called louder and louder to the men of the temple to mount with him the highest ramparts and pour down on the besiegers the molten lead  the priests were again the first men to approach the gates of the building after the shock that had been heard within it  the struggle for the possession of the temple had assumed to them the character of a holy warfare against heathenism and magica sacred conflict to be sustained by the church for the sake of her servant who had fallen a martyr at the outset of the strife  strong in their fanatical boldness they advanced with one accord close to the gates  some of the smaller images of the fallen pile had been forced through the bars behind which appeared the great idols the broken masses of furniture the long robes and costly hangings all locked together in every wild variety of positiona chaos of distorted objects heaped up by an earthquake above and further inward the lower part of the pagans robe was faintly discernible through the upper interstices in the gate as he stood commanding on the summit of his prostrate altar with his idol in his arms  the priests felt an instant conviction of certain triumph when they discerned the cause of the shock that had been heard within the temple one of their number snatched up a small image that had fallen through to the pavement where he stood and holding it before the people below exclaimed exultingly  children of the church the mystery is revealed  idols more precious than this lie by hundreds on the floor of the temple  it is no demon but a man one man who still defies us withina robber who would defraud the romans of the ransom of their livesthe pillage of many temples is around him  remember now that the nearer we came to this place the fewer were the spoils of idolatry that we gathered in the treasure which is yours the treasure which is to free you from the famine has been seized by the assassin of our holy brother it is there scattered at his feet  to the gates  to the gates again absolution for all their sins to the men who burst in the gates  again the mass of timber was taken up again the gates were assailed and again they stood firmthey were now strengthened barricaded by the fallen pile  it seemed hopeless to attempt to break them down without a reinforcement of men without employing against them the heaviest missiles the strongest engines of war   the people gave vent to a cry of fury as they heard from the temple the hollow laughter of the madman triumphing in their defeat  the words of the priest in allaying their superstitious fears had aroused the deadly passions that superstition brings forth  a few among the throng hurried to the nearest guardhouse for assistance but the greater part pressed closely round the templesome pouring forth impotent execrations against the robber of the public spoil some joining the priests in calling on him to yield  but the clamour lasted not long it was suddenly and strangely stilled by the voice of one man in the crowd calling loudly to the rest to fire the temple  the words were hardly spoken ere they were repeated triumphantly on all sides  fire the temple cried the people ferociously  burn it over the robbers head  a furnacea furnace to melt down the gold and silver ready to our hands  fire the temple  fire the temple  those who were most active among the crowd which was now greatly increased by stragglers from all parts of the city entered the houses behind them and returned in a few minutes with every inflammable substance that they could collect in their hands  a heap of fuel two or three feet in height was raised against the gates immediately and soldiers and people pressed forward with torches to light it  but the priest who had before spoken waved them back  wait he cried the fate of his body is with the people but the fate of his soul is with the church  then turning to the temple he called solemnly and sternly to the madman thy hour is come  repent confess and save thy soul  slay on slay on answered the raving voice from within  slay till not a christian is left  victory serapis  see they drop from our wallsthey writhe bleeding on the earth beneath us  there is no worship but the worship of the gods  slay  slay on  light cried the priest  his damnation be on his own head anathema  maranatha  let him die accursed  the dry fuel was fired at once at all pointsit was an anticipation of an auto da fe a burning of a heretic in the fifth century  as the flames rose the people fell back and watched their rapid progress the priests standing before them in a line stretched out their hands in denunciation against the temple and repeated together the awful excommunication service of the roman church                                  the fire at the gates had communicated with the idols inside  it was no longer on his prostrate altar but on his funeral pile that ulpius now stood and the image that he clasped was the stake to which he was bound  a red glare dull at first was now brightening and brightening below him flames quick and noiseless rose and fell and rose again at different points illuminating the interior of the temple with fitful and changing light  the grim swarthy forms of the idols seemed to sway and writhe like living things in torment as fire and smoke alternately displayed and concealed them  a deadly stillness now overspread the face and form of the pagan as he looked down steadfastly on the deities of his worship engendering his destruction beneath him  his cheekthe cheek which had rested in boyhood on his mothers bosomwas pressed against the gilded breast of the god serapis his taskmaster in lifehis pillow in death  i rise  i rise to the world of light with my deities whom i have served he murmured the brightness of their presence is like a flaming fire the smoke of their breath pours forth around me like the smoke of incense  i minister in the temples of the clouds and the glory of eternal sunlight shines round me while i adore  i rise  i rise  the smoke whirled in black volumes over his head the fierce voice of the fastspreading fire roared on him the flames leapt up at his feethis robes kindled burst into radiant light as the pile yawned and opened under him                                   time had passed  the strife between the temple and the church was ended  the priests and the people had formed a wider circle round the devoted building all that was inflammable in it had been burnt smoke and flame now burst only at intervals through the gates and gradually both ceased to appear  then the crowd approached nearer to the temple and felt the heat of the furnace they had kindled as they looked in  the iron gates were red hotfrom the great mass behind still glowing bright in some places and heaving and quivering with its own heat a thin transparent vapour rose slowly to the stone roof of the building now blackened with smoke  the priests looked eagerly for the corpse of the pagan  they saw two dark charred objects closely united together lying in a chasm of ashes near the gate at a spot where the fire had already exhausted itself but it was impossible to discern which was the man and which was the idol  the necessity of providing means for entering the temple had not been forgotten while the flames were raging  proper implements for forcing open the gates were now at hand and already the mob began to dip their buckets in the tiber and pour water wherever any traces of the fire remained soon all obstacles were removed the soldiers crowded into the building with spades in their hands trampled on the black watery mire of cinders which covered what had once been the altar of idols and throwing out into the street the refuse ashes and the stone images which had remained unconsumed dug in what was left as in a new mine for the gold and silver which the fire could not destroy  the pagan had lived with his idols had perished with his idolsand now where they were cast away there he was cast away with them  the soldiers as they dug into fragments the black ruins of his altar mingled him in fragments with it  the people as they cast the refuse thrown out to them into the river cast what remained of him with what remained of his gods  and when the temple was deserted when the citizens had borne off all the treasure they could collect when nothing but a few heaps of dust was left of all that had been burnt the nightwind blew away before it the ashes of ulpius with the ashes of the deities that ulpius had served    chapter 27  the vigil of hope  a new prospect now opens before us  the rough paths through which we have hitherto threaded our way grow smoother as we approach their close rome so long dark and gloomy to our view brightens at length like a landscape when the rain is past and the first rays of returning sunlight stream through the parting clouds  some days have elapsed and in those days the temples have yielded all their wealth the conquered romans have bribed the triumphant barbarians to mercy the ransom of the fallen city has been paid  the gothic army is still encamped round the walls but the gates are opened markets for food are established in the suburbs boats appear on the river and waggons on the highroads laden with provisions and proceeding towards rome  all the hidden treasure kept back by the citizens is now bartered for food the merchants who hold the market reap a rich harvest of spoil but the hungry are filled the weak are revived every one is content  it is the end of the second day since the free sale of provisions and the liberty of egress from the city have been permitted by the goths the gates are closed for the night and the people are quietly returning laden with their supplies of food to their homes  their eyes no longer encounter the terrible traces of the march of pestilence and famine through every street the corpses have been removed and the sick are watched and sheltered  rome is cleansed from her pollutions and the virtues of household life begin to revive wherever they once existed  death has thinned every family but the survivors again assemble together in the social hall  even the veriest criminals the lowest outcasts of the population are united harmlessly for a while in the general participation of the first benefits of peace   to follow the citizens to their homes to trace in their thoughts words and action the effect on them of their deliverance from the horrors of the blockade to contemplate in the people of a whole city now recovering as it were from a deep swoon the varying forms of the first reviving symptoms in all classes in good and bad rich and poorwould afford matter enough in itself for a romance of searching human interest for a drama of the passions moving absorbingly through strange intricate and contrasted scenes  but another employment than this now claims our care  it is to an individual and not to a divided source of interest that our attention turns we relinquish all observations on the general mass of the populace to revert to numerian and antonina aloneto penetrate once more into the little dwelling on the pincian hill  the apartment where the father and daughter had suffered the pangs of famine together during the period of the blockade presented an appearance far different from that which it had displayed on the occasion when they had last occupied it  the formerly bare walls were now covered with rich thick hangings and the simple couch and scanty table of other days had been exchanged for whatever was most luxurious and complete in the household furniture of the age  at one end of the room three women attended by a little girl were engaged in preparing some dishes of fruit and vegetables at the other two men were occupied in low earnest conversation occasionally looking round anxiously to a couch placed against the third side of the apartment on which antonina lay extended while numerian watched by her in silence the point of goisvinthas knife had struck deep but as yet the fatal purpose of the assassination had failed  the girls eyes were closed her lips were parted in the languor of suffering one of her hands lay listless on her fathers knee  a slight expression of pain melancholy in its very slightness appeared on her pale face and occasionally a longdrawn quivering breath escaped hernatures last touching utterance of its own feebleness the old man as he sat by her side fixed on her a wistful inquiring glance  sometimes he raised his hand and gently and mechanically moved to and fro the long locks of her hair as they spread over the head of the couch but he never turned to communicate with the other persons in the roomhe sat as if he saw nothing save his daughters figure stretched before him and heard nothing save the faint fluttering sound of her breathing close at his ear  it was now dark and one lamp hanging from the ceiling threw a soft equal light over the room  the different persons occupying it presented but little evidence of health and strength in their countenances to contrast them in appearance with the wounded girl all had undergone the wasting visitation of the famine and all were pale and languid like her  a strange indescribable harmony prevailed over the scene  even the calmness of absorbing expectation and trembling hope expressed in the demeanour of numerian seemed reflected in the actions of those around him in the quietness with which the women pursued their employment in the lower and lower whispers in which the men continued their conversation  there was something pervading the air of the whole apartment that conveyed a sense of the solemn unworldly stillness which we attach to the abstract idea of religion  of the two men cautiously talking together one was the patrician vetranio the other a celebrated physician of rome  both the countenance and manner of the senator gave melancholy proof that the orgie at his palace had altered him for the rest of his life he looked what he was a man changed for ever in constitution and character  a fixed expression of anxiety and gloom appeared in his eyes his emaciated face was occasionally distorted by a nervous involuntary contraction of the muscles it was evident that the paralysing effect of the debauch which had destroyed his companions would remain with him to the end of his existence  no remnant of his careless selfpossession his easy patrician affability appeared in his manner as he now listened to his companions conversation years seemed to have been added to his life since he had headed the table at the banquet of famine   yes said the physician a cold calm man who spoke much but pronounced all his words with emphatic deliberationyes as i have already told you the wound in itself was not mortal  if the blade of the knife had entered near the centre of the neck she must have died when she was struck but it passed outwards and backwards the large vessels escaped and no vital part has been touched  and yet you persist in declaring that you doubt her recovery exclaimed vetranio in low mournful tones  i do pursued the physician  she must have been exhausted in mind and body when she received the blowi have watched her carefully i know it  there is nothing of the natural health and strength of youth to oppose the effects of the wound  i have seen the old die from injuries that the young recover because life in them was losing its powers of resistance she is in the position of the old  they have died before me and she will die before me  i shall lose allall sighed vetranio bitterly to himself  the resources of our art are exhausted continued the other nothing remains but to watch carefully and wait patiently  the chances of life or death will be decided in a few hours they are equally balanced now  i shall lose allall repeated the senator mournfully as if he heeded not the last words  if she dies said the physician speaking in warmer tones for he was struck with pity in spite of himself at the spectacle of vetranios utter dejection if she dies you can at least remember that all that could be done to secure her life has been done by you  her father helpless in his lethargy and his age was fitted only to sit and watch her as he has sat and watched her day after day but you have spared nothing forgotten nothing  whatever i have asked for that you have provided the hangings round the room and the couch that she lies on are yours the first fresh supplies of nourishment from the newlyopened markets were brought here from you i told you that she was thinking incessantly of what she had suffered that it was necessary to preserve her against her own recollections that the presence of women about her might do good that a child appearing sometimes in the room might soothe her fancy might make her look at what was passing instead of thinking of what had passedyou found them and sent them  i have seen parents less anxious for their children lovers for their mistresses than you for this girl  my destiny is with her interrupted vetranio looking round superstitiously to the frail form on the couch  i know nothing of the mysteries that the christians call their faith but i believe now in the soul i believe that one soul contains the fate of another and that her soul contains the fate of mine  the physician shook his head derisively  his calling had determined his philosophyhe was as ardent a materialist as epicurus himself  listen said vetranio since i first saw her a change came over my whole being it was as if her life was mingled with mine  i had no influence over her save an influence for ill  i loved her and she was driven defenceless from her home  i sent my slaves to search rome night and day i exerted all my power i lavished my wealth to discover her and for the first time in this one effort i failed in what i had undertaken  i felt that through me she was lostdead  days passed on life weighed weary on me the famine came  you know in what way i determined that my career should close the rumour of the banquet of famine reached you as it reached others  it did replied the physician  and i see before me in your face he added after a momentary pause the havoc which that illomened banquet has worked  my friend be advisedabandon for ever the turmoil of your roman palace and breathe in tranquillity the air of a country home  the strength you once had is gone never to returnif you would yet live husband what is still left   hear me pursued vetranio in low gloomy tones  i stood alone in my doomed palace the friends whom i had tempted to their destruction lay lifeless around me the torch was in my hand that was to light our funeral pile to set us free from the loathsome world  i approached triumphantly to kindle the annihilating flames when she stood before meshe whom i had sought as lost and mourned as dead  a strong hand seemed to wrench the torch from me it dropped to the ground  she departed again but i was powerless to take it up her look was still before me her face her figure she herself appeared ever watching between the torch and me  lowerspeak lower interrupted the physician looking on the senators agitated features with unconcealed astonishment and pity you retard your own recoveryyou disturb the girls repose by discourse such as this  the officers of the senate continued vetranio sadly resuming his gentler tones when they entered the palace found me still standing on the place where we had met  days passed on again i stood looking out upon the street and thought of my companions whom i had lured to their death and of my oath to partake their fate which i had never fulfilled  i would have driven my dagger to my heart but her face was yet before me my hands were bound  in that hour i saw her for the second time saw her carried past mewounded assassinated  she had saved me once she had saved me twice i knew that now the chance was offered me after having wrought her ill to work her good after failing to discover her when she was lost to succeed in saving her when she was dying after having survived the deaths of my friends at my own table to survive to see life restored under my influence as well as destroyed  these were my thoughts these are my thoughts stillthoughts felt only since i saw her  do you know now why i believe that her soul contains the fate of mine  do you see me weakened shattered old before my time my friends lost my fresh feelings of youth gone for ever and can you not now comprehend that her life is my lifethat if she dies the one good purpose of my existence is blightedthat i lose all i have henceforth to live forall all  as he pronounced the concluding words the girls eyes half unclosed and turned languidly towards her father  she made an effort to lift her hand caressingly from his knee to his neck but her strength was unequal even to this slight action  the hand was raised only a few inches ere it sank back again to its old position a tear rolled slowly over her cheek as she closed her eyes again but she never spoke  see said the physician pointing to her the current of life is at its lowest ebb  if it flows again it must flow tonight  vetranio made no answer he dropped down on the seat near him and covered his face with his robe  the physician beholding the senators situation and reflecting on the strange hurriedlyuttered confession which had just been addressed to him began to doubt whether the scenes through which his patron had lately passed had not affected his brain  philosopher though he was the man of science had never observed the outward symptoms of the first working of good and pure influences in elevating a degraded mind he had never watched the denoting signs of speech and action which mark the progress of mental revolution while the old nature is changing for the new such objects of contemplation existed not for him  he gently touched vetranio on the shoulder rise said he and let us depart those are around her who can watch her best  nothing remains for us but to wait and hope  with the earliest morning we will return  he delivered a few farewell directions to one of the women in attendance and then accompanied by the senator who without speaking again mechanically rose to follow him quitted the room  after this the silence was only interrupted by the sound of an occasional whisper and of quick light footsteps passing backwards and forwards  then the cooling reviving draughts which had been prepared for the night were poured ready into the cups and the women approached numerian as if to address him but he waved his hand impatiently when he saw them and then they too in their turn departed to wait in an adjoining apartment until they should be summoned again   nothing changed in the manner of the father when he was left alone in the chamber of sickness which the lapse of a few hours might convert into the chamber of death  he sat watching antonina and touching the outspread locks of her hair from time to time as had been his wont it was a fair starry night the fresh air of the soft winter climate of the south blew gently over the earth the great city was sinking fast into tranquillity calling voices were sometimes heard faintly from the principal streets and the distant noises of martial music sounded cheerily from the gothic camp as the sentinels were posted along the line of watch but soon these noises ceased and the stillness of rome was as the stillness round the couch of the wounded girl  day after day and night after night since the assassination in the temple numerian had kept the same place by his daughters side  each hour as it passed found him still absorbed in his long vigil of hope his life seemed suspended in its onward course by the one influence that now enthralled it  at the brief intervals when his bodily weariness overpowered him on his melancholy watch it was observed by those around him that even in his short dreaming clumbers his face remained ever turned in the same direction towards the head of the couch as if drawn thither by some irresistible attraction by some powerful ascendancy felt even amid the deepest repose of sensation the heaviest fatigue of the overlaboured mind and worn sinking heart he held no communication save by signs with the friends about him he seemed neither to hope to doubt nor to despair with them all his faculties were strung up to vibrate at one point only and were dull and unimpressible in every other direction  but twice had he been heard to speak more than the fewest simplest words  the first time when antonina uttered the name of goisvintha on the recovery of her senses after her wound he answered eagerly by reiterated declarations that there was nothing henceforth to fear for he had seen the assassin dead under the pagans foot on leaving the temple  the second time when mention was incautiously made before him of rumours circulated through rome of the burning of an unknown pagan priest hidden in the temple of serapis with vast treasures around him the old man was seen to start and shudder and heard to pray for the soul that was now waiting before the dread judgmentseat to murmur about a vain restoration and a discovery made too late to mourn over horror that thickened round him over hope fruitlessly awakened and bereavement more terrible than mortal had ever suffered before to entreat that the child the last left of all might be sparedwith many words more which ran on themes like these and which were counted by all who listened to them but as the wanderings of a mind whose higher powers were fatally prostrated by feebleness and grief  one long hour of the night had already passed away since parent and child had been left together and neither word nor movement had been audible in the melancholy room  but as the second hour began the girls eyes unclosed again and she moved painfully on the couch accustomed to interpret the significance of her slightest actions numerian rose and brought her one of the reviving draughts that had been left ready for use  after she had drunk when her eyes met her fathers fixed on her in mute and mournful inquiry her lips closed and formed themselves into an expression which he remembered they had always assumed when as a little child she used silently to hold up her face to him to be kissed  the miserable contrast between what she was now and what she had been them was beyond the passive endurance the patient resignation of the spiritbroken old man the empty cup dropped from his hands he knelt down by the side of the couch and groaned aloud  o father father cried the weak plaintive voice above him  i am dying  let us remember that our time to be together here grows shorter and shorter and let us pass it as happily as we can  he raised his head and looked up at her vacant and wistful forlorn already as if the deathparting was over   i have tried to live humbly and gratefully she sighed faintly  i have longed to do more good on the earth than i have done  yet you will forgive me now father as you have always forgiven me  you have been patient with me all my life more patient than i have ever deserved but i had no mother to teach me to love you as i ought to teach me what i know now when my death is near and time and opportunity are mine no longer  hush hush whispered the old man affrightedly you will live  god is good and knows that we have suffered enough  the curse of the last separation is not pronounced against us  live live  father said the girl tenderly we have that within us which not death itself can separate  in another world i shall still think of you when you think of me  i shall see you even when i am no more here when you long to see me  when you go out alone and sit under the trees on the garden bank where i used to sit when you look forth on the far plains and mountains that i used to look on  when you read at night in the bible that we have read in together and remember antonina as you lie down sorrowful to rest then i shall see you then you will feel that i am looking on you  you will be calm and consoled even by the side of my grave for you will think not of the body that is beneath but of the spirit that is waiting for you as i have often waited for you here when you were away and i knew that the approach of the evening would bring you home again  hush you will liveyou will live repeated numerian in the same low vacant tones  the strength that still upheld him was in those few simple words they were the food of a hope that was born in agony and cradled in despair  oh if i might live said the girl softly if i might live but for a few days yet how much i have to live for  she endeavoured to bend her head towards her father as she spoke for the words were beginning to fall faintly and more faintly from her lipsexhaustion was mastering her once again  she dwelt for a moment now on the name of hermanric on the grave in the farmhouse garden then reverted again to her father the last feeble sounds she uttered were addressed to him and their burden was still of consolation and of love  soon the old man as he stooped over her saw her eyes close againthose innocent gentle eyes which even yet preserved their old expression while the face grew wan and pale around themand darkness and night sank down over his soul while he looked  she sleeps he murmured in a voice of awe as he resumed his watching position by the side of the couch  they call death a sleep but on her face there is no death  the night grew on  the women who were in attendance entered the room about midnight wondering that their assistance had not yet been required  they beheld the solemn unruffled composure on the girls wasted face the rapt attention of numerian as he ever preserved the same attitude by her side and went out again softly without uttering a word even in a whisper  there was something dread and impressive in the very appearance of this room where death that destroys was in mortal conflict with youth and beauty that adorn while the eyes of one old man watched in loneliness the awful progress of the strife  morning came and still there was no change  once when the lamp that lit the room was fading out as the dawn appeared numerian had risen and looked close on his daughters facehe thought at that moment that her features moved but he saw that the flickering of the dying light on them had deceived him the same stillness was over her  he placed his ear close to her lips for an instant and then resumed his place not stirring from it again  the slow current of his blood seemed to have come to a pausehe was waiting as a man waits with his head on the block ere the axe descendsas a mother waits to hear that the breath of life has entered her newborn child   the sun rose bright in a cloudless sky  as the fresh sharp air of the early dawn warmed under its spreading rays the women entered the apartment again and partly drew aside the curtain and shutter from the window  the beams of the new light fell fair and glorifying on the girls face the faint calm breezed ruffled the lighter locks of her hair  once this would have awakened her but it did not disturb her now  soon after the voice of the child who sojourned with the women in the house was heard beneath in the hall through the halfopened door of the room  the little creature was slowly ascending the stairs singing her faltering morning song to herself  she was preceded on her approach by a tame dove bought at the provision market outside the walls but preserved for the child as a pet and plaything by its mother  the bird fluttered cooing into the room perched upon the head of the couch and began dressing its feathers there  the women had caught the infection of the old mans enthralling suspense and moved not to bid the child retire or to take away the dove from its placethey watched like him  but the soft lulling notes of the bird were powerless over the girls ear as the light sunbeam over her facestill she never woke  the child entered and pausing in her song climbed on to the side of the couch  she held out one little hand for the dove to perch upon placed the other lightly on antoninas shoulder and pressed her fresh rosy lips to girls faded cheek  i and my bird have come to make antonina well this morning she said gravely  the still heavilyclosed eyelids movedthey quivered opened closed then opened again  the eyes had a faint dreaming unconscious look but antonina lived  antonina was awakened at last to another day on earth  her fathers rigid straining gaze still remained fixed upon her as at first but on his countenance there was a blank an absence of all appearance of sensation and life  the women as they looked on antonina and looked on him began to weep the child resumed very softly its morning song now addressing it to the wounded girl and now to the dove  at this moment vetranio and the physician appeared on the scene  the latter advanced to the couch removed the child from it and examined antonina intently  at length partly addressing numerian partly speaking to himself he said  she has slept long deeply without moving almost without breathinga sleep like death to all who looked on it  the old man spoke not in reply but the women answered eagerly in the affirmative  she is saved pursued the physician leisurely quitting the side of the couch and smiling on vetranio be careful of her for days and days to come  saved saved echoed the child joyfully setting the dove free in the room and running to numerian to climb on his knees  the father glanced down when the clear young voice sounded in his ear  the springs of joy so long dried up in his heart welled forth again as he saw the little hands raised towards him entreatingly his grey head droopedhe wept  at a sign from the physician the child was led from the room  the silence of deep and solemn emotion was preserved by all who remained nothing was heard but the suppressed sobs of the old man and the faint retiring notes of the infant voice still singing its morning song  and now one word joyfully reiterated again and again made all the burden of the music  saved  saved   the conclusion  ubi thesaurus ibi cor   shortly after the opening of the provision markets outside the gates of rome the goths broke up their camp before the city and retired to winter quarters in tuscany  the negotiations which ensued between alaric and the court and government at ravenna were conducted with cunning moderation by the conqueror and with infatuated audacity by the conquered and ultimately terminated in a resumption of hostilities rome was besieged a second and a third time by the barbarians  on the latter occasion the city was sacked its palaces were burnt its treasures were seized the monuments of the christian religion were alone respected  but it is no longer with the goths that our narrative is concerned the connection with them which it has hitherto maintained closes with the end of the first siege of rome  we can claim the readers attention for historical events no morethe march of our little pageant arrayed for his pleasure is over  if however he has felt and still retains some interest in antonina he will not refuse to follow us and look on her again ere we part  more than a month had passed since the besieging army had retired to their winter quarters when several of the citizens of rome assembled themselves on the plains beyond the walls to enjoy one of those rustic festivals of ancient times which are still celebrated under different usages but with the same spirit by the italians of modern days  the place was a level plot of ground beyond the pincian gate backed by a thick grove of pine trees and looking towards the north over the smooth extent of the country round rome  the persons congregated were mostly of the lower class  their amusements were dancing music games of strength and games of chance and above all to people who had lately suffered the extremities of famine abundant eating and drinkinglong serious ecstatic enjoyment of the powers of mastication and the faculties of taste  among the assembly were some individuals whose dress and manner raised them outwardly at least above the general mass  these persons walked backwards and forwards together on different parts of the ground as observers not as partakers in the sports  one of their number however in whatever direction he turned preserved an isolated position  he held an open letter in his hand which he looked at from time to time and appeared to be wholly absorbed in his own thoughts this man we may advantageously particularise on his own account as well as on account of the peculiarity of his accidental situation for he was the favoured minister of vetranios former pleasuresthe industrious carrio  the freedman who was last introduced to the reader in chapter xiv as exhibiting to vetranio the store of offal which he had collected during the famine for the consumption of the palace had contrived of late greatly to increase his masters confidence in him  on the organisation of the banquet of famine he had discreetly refrained from testifying the smallest desire to save himself from the catastrophe in which the senator and his friends had determined to involve themselves securing himself in a place of safety he awaited the end of the orgie and when he found that its unexpected termination left his master still living to employ him appeared again as a faithful servant ready to resume his customary occupation with undiminished zeal  after the dispersion of his household during the famine and amid the general confusion of the social system in rome on the raising of the blockade vetranio found no one near him that he could trust but carrioand he trusted him  nor was the confidence misplaced  the man was selfish and sordid enough but these very qualities ensured his fidelity to his master as long as that master retained the power to punish and the capacity to reward   the letter which carrio held in his hand was addressed to him at a villafrom which he had just returnedbelonging to vetranio on the shores of the bay of naples and was written by the senator from rome the introductory portions of this communication seemed to interest the freedman but little  they contained praises of his diligence in preparing the countryhouse for the immediate habitation of its owner and expressed his masters anxiety to quit rome as speedily as possible for the sake of living in perfect tranquillity and breathing the reviving air of the sea as the physicians had counselled  it was the latter part of the letter that carrio perused and reperused and then meditated over with unwonted attention and labour of mind  it ran thus  i have now to repose in you a trust which you will execute with perfect fidelity as you value my favour or respect the wealth from which you may obtain your reward  when you left rome you left the daughter of numerian lying in danger of death  she has since revived questions that i have addressed to her during her recovery have informed me of much in her history that i knew not before and have induced me to purchase for reasons of my own a farmhouse and its lands beyond the suburbs  the extent of the place and its situation are written on the vellum that is within this the husbandman who cultivated the property had survived the famine and will continue to cultivate it for me  but it is my desire that the garden and all that it contains shall remain entirely at the disposal of numerian and his daughter who may often repair to it and who must henceforth be regarded there as occupying my place and having my authority  you will divide your time between overlooking the few slaves whom i leave at the palace in my absence and the husbandman and his labourers whom i have installed at the farm and you will answer to me for the due performance of your own duties and the duties of those under youbeing assured that by well filling this office you will serve your own interests in these and in all things besides  the letter concluded by directing the freedman to return to rome on a certain day and to go to the farmhouse at an appointed hour there to meet his master who had further directions to give him and who would visit the newly acquired property before he proceeded on his journey to naples  nothing could exceed the perplexity of carrio as he read the passage in his patrons letter which we have quoted above  remembering the incidents attending vetranios early connection with antonina and her father the mere circumstances of a farm having been purchased to flatter what was doubtless some accidental caprice on the part of the girl would have little perplexed him  but that this act should be followed by the senators immediate separation of himself from the society of numerians daughter that she was to gain nothing after all from these lands which had evidently been bought at her instigation but the authority over a little strip of garden and yet the inviolability of this valueless privilege should be insisted on in such serious terms and with such an imperative tone of command as the senator had never been known to use beforethese were inconsistencies which all carrios ingenuity failed to reconcile  the man had been born and reared in vice vice had fed him clothed him freed him given him character reputation power in his own small wayhe lived in it as in the atmosphere that he breathed to show him an action referable only to a principle of pure integrity was to set him a problem which it was hopeless to solve  and yet it is impossible in one point of view to pronounce him utterly worthless  ignorant of all distinctions between good and bad he thought wrong from sheer inability to see right  however his instructions might perplex him he followed them nowand continued in after days to follow themto the letter  if to serve ones own interests be an art of that art carrio deserved to be head professor  he arrived at the farmhouse not only punctually but before the appointed time and calling the honest husbandman and the labourers about him explained to them every particular of the authority that his patron had vested in him with a flowing and peremptory solemnity of speech which equally puzzled and impressed his simple audience  he found numerian and antonina in the garden when he entered it  the girl had been carried there daily in a litter since her recovery and her father had followed  they were never separated now the old man when his first absorbing anxiety for her was calmed remembered again more distinctly the terrible disclosure in the temple and the yet more terrible catastrophe that followed it and he sought constant refuge from the horror of the recollection in the presence of his child   the freedman during his interview with the father and daughter observed for once an involuntary and unfeigned respect but he spoke briefly and left them together again almost immediately  humble and helpless as they were they awed him they looked thought and spoke like beings of another nature than his they were connected he knew not how with the mystery of the grave in the garden  he would have been selfpossessed in the presence of the emperor himself but he was uneasy in theirs  so he retired to the more congenial scene of the public festival which was in the immediate neighbourhood of the farmhouse to await the hour of his patrons arrival and to perplex himself afresh by a reperusal of vetranios letter  the time was now near at hand when it was necessary for the freedman to return to his appointed post  he carefully rolled up his note of instructions stood for a few minutes vacantly regarding the amusements which had hitherto engaged so little of his attention and then turning he proceeded through the pinegrove on his way back  we will follow him  on leaving the grove a footpath conducted over some fields to the farmhouse  arrived here carrio hesitated for a moment then moved slowly onward to await his masters approach in the lane that led to the highroad  at this point we will part company with him to enter the garden by the wicketgate  the trees the flowerbeds and the patches of grass all remained in their former positionsnothing had been added or taken away since the melancholy days that were past but a change was visible in hermanrics grave  the turf above it had been renewed and a border of small evergreen shrubs was planted over the track which goisvinthas footsteps had traced  a white marble cross was raised at one end of the mound the short latin inscription on it signifiedpray for the dead  the sunlight was shining calmly over the grave and over numerian and antonina as they sat by it sometimes when the mirth grew louder at the rustic festival it reached them in faint subdued notes sometimes they heard the voices of the labourers in the neighbouring fields talking to each other at their work but besides these no other sounds were loud enough to be distinguished  there was still an expression of the melancholy and feebleness that grief and suffering leave behind them on the countenances of the father and daughter but resignation and peace appeared there as wellresignation that was perfected by the hard teaching of woe and peace that was purer for being imparted from the one to the other like the strong and deathless love from which it grew  there was something now in the look and attitude of the girl as she sat thinking of the young warrior who had died in her defence and for her love and training the shrubs to grow closer round the grave which changed though she was recalled in a different form the old poetry and tranquillity of her existence when we first saw her singing to the music of her lute in the garden on the pincian hill no thoughts of horror and despair were suggested to her as she now looked on the farmhouse scene hers was not the grief which shrinks selfishly from all that revives the remembrance of the dead  to her their influence over the memory was a grateful and a guardian influence that gave a better purpose to the holiest life and a nobler nature to the purest thoughts  thus they were sitting by the grave sad yet content footsore already on the pilgrimage of life yet patient to journey farther if they mightwhen an unusual tumult a noise of rolling wheels mingled with a confused sound of voices was heard in the lane behind them  they looked round and saw that vetranio was approaching them alone through the wicketgate  he came forward slowly the stealthy poison instilled by the banquet of famine palpably displayed its presence within him as the clear sunlight fell on his pale wasted face  he smiled kindly as he addressed antonina but the bodily pain and mental agitation which that smile was intended to conceal betrayed themselves in his troubled voice as he spoke   this is our last meeting for yearsit may be our last meeting for life he said i linger at the outset of my journey but to behold you as guardian of the one spot of ground that is most precious to you on earthas mistress indeed of the little that i give you here  he paused a moment and pointed to the grave then continued  all the atonement that i owe to you you can never knowi can never tellthink only that i bear away with me a companion in the solitude to which i go in the remembrance of you  be calm good happy still for my sake and while you forgive the senator of former days forget not the friend who now parts from you in some sickness and sorrow but also in much patience and hope  farewell  his hand trembled as he held it out a flush overspread the girls cheek while she murmured a few inarticulate words of gratitude and bending over it pressed it to her lips  vetranios heart beat quick the action revived an emotion that he dared not cherish but he looked at the wan downcast face before him at the grave that rose mournful by his side and quelled it again  yet an instant he lingered to exchange a farewell with the old man then turned quickly passed through the gate and they saw him no more  antoninas tears fell fast on the grass beneath as she resumed her place  when she raised her head again and saw that her father was looking at her she nestled close to him and laid one of her arms round his neck  the other gradually dropped to her side until her hand reached the topmost leaves of the shrubs that grew round the grave                                  shall we longer delay in the farmhouse garden  no  for us as for vetranio it is now time to depart while peace still watches round the walls of rome while the hearts of the father and daughter still repose together in security after the trials that have wrung them let us quit the scene  here at last the narrative that we have followed over a dark and stormy track reposes on a tranquil field and here let us cease to pursue it  so the traveller who traces the course of a river wanders through the day among the rocks and precipices that lead onward from its troubled source and when the evening is at hand pauses and rests where the banks are grassy and the stream is smooth
