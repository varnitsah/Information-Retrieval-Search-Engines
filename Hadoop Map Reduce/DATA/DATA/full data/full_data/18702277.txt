   345   illustration  prefatory   the author is pleased to be able to present a sequel to aunt janes nieces the book which was received with so much favor last year yet it is not necessary one should have read the first book to fully understand the present volume the characters being taken to entirely new scenes  the various foreign localities are accurately described so that those who have visited them will recognize them at once while those who have not been so fortunate may acquire a clear conception of them it was my good fortune to be an eye witness of the recent great eruption of vesuvius  lest i be accused of undue sensationalism in relating the somewhat dramatic sicilian incident i will assure my reader that the story does not exaggerate present conditions in various parts of the island in fact il duca and tato are drawn from life although they did not have their mountain lair so near to taormina as i have ventured to locate it except that i have adapted their clever system of brigandage to the exigencies of this story their history is truly related many who have travelled somewhat outside the beaten tracks in sicily will frankly vouch for this statement  italy is doing its best to suppress the mafia and to eliminate brigandage from the beautiful islands it controls but so few of the inhabitants are italians or in sympathy with the government that the work of reformation is necessarily slow americans especially must exercise caution in travelling in any part of sicily yet with proper care not to tempt the irresponsible natives they are as safe in sicily as they are at home  aunt janes nieces are shown to be as frankly adventurous as the average clear headed american girl but their experiences amid the environments of an ancient and still primitive civilization are in no wise extraordinary       edith van dyne      chapter i  the doyles are astonished   it was sunday afternoon in miss patricia doyles pretty flat at 3708 willing square in the small drawing room patriciaor patsy as she preferred to be calledwas seated at the piano softly playing the one piece the music teacher had succeeded in drilling into her flighty head by virtue of much patience and perseverance in a thick cushioned morrischair reclined the motionless form of uncle john a chubby little man in a gray suit whose features were temporarily eclipsed by the newspaper that was spread carefully over them occasionally a gasp or a snore from beneath the paper suggested that the little man was snoozing as he sometimes gravely called it instead of listening to the music  major doyle sat opposite stiffly erect with his admiring eyes full upon patsy at times he drummed upon the arms of his chair in unison with the music nodding his grizzled head to mark the time as well as to emphasize his evident approbation patsy had played this same piece from start to finish seven times since dinner because it was the only one she knew but the major could have listened to it seven hundred times without the flicker of an eyelash it was not that he admired so much the piece the girl was playing as the girl who was playing the piece his pride in patsy was unbounded that she should have succeeded at all in mastering that imposing looking instrumentmaking it actually play chuneswas surely a thing to wonder at but then patsy could do anything if she but tried  suddenly uncle john gave a dreadful snort and sat bolt upright gazing at his companions with a startled look that melted into one of benign complacency as he observed his surroundings and realized where he was the interruption gave patsy an opportunity to stop playing the tune she swung around on the stool and looked with amusement at her newly awakened uncle  youve been asleep she said  no indeed quite a mistake replied the little man seriously ive only been thinking  an such beautchiful thoughts observed the major testily for he resented the interruption of his sunday afternoon treat you thought em aloud sir and the sound of it was a bad imithation of a bullfrog in a marsh youll have to give up eating the salad sir  bah dont i know asked uncle john indignantly  well if your knowledge is better than our hearing i suppose you do retorted the major but to an ignorant individual like meself the impression conveyed was that you snored like a man that has forgotten his manners an gone to sleep in the prisence of a lady  then no one has a better right to do that declared patsy soothingly and im sure our dear uncle johns thoughts were just the most beautiful dreams in the world tell us of them sir and well prove the major utterly wrong  even her father smiled at the girls diplomacy and uncle john who was on the verge of unreasonable anger beamed upon her gratefully  im going to europe he said  the major gave an involuntary start and then turned to look at him curiously  and im going to take patsy along he continued with a mischievous grin  the major frowned  conthrol yourself sir until you are fully awake said he youre dreaming again  patsy swung her feet from side to side for she was such a little thing that the stool raised her entirely off the floor there was a thoughtful look on her round freckled face and a wistful one in her great blue eyes as the full meaning of uncle johns abrupt avowal became apparent  the major was still frowning but a half frightened expression had replaced the one of scornful raillery for he too knew that his eccentric brotherinlaw was likely to propose any preposterous thing and then carry it out in spite of all opposition but to take patsy to europe would be like pulling the majors eye teeth or amputating his good right arm worse far worse it would mean taking the sunshine out of her old fathers sky altogether and painting it a grim despairing gray  but he resolved not to submit without a struggle  sir said he sternlyhe always called his brotherinlaw sir when he was in a sarcastic or reproachful moodive had an idea for some time that you were plotting mischief you havent looked me straight in the eye for a week and youve twice been late to dinner i will ask you to explain to us sir the brutal suggestion you have just advanced  uncle john laughed in the days when major doyle had thought him a poor man and in need of a helping hand the grizzled old irishman had been as tender toward him as a woman and studiously avoided any speech or epithet that by chance might injure the feelings of his dead wifes only brother but the majors invariable courtesy to the poor or unfortunate was no longer in evidence when he found that john merrick was a multimillionaire with a strongly defined habit of doing good to others and striving in obscure and unconventional ways to make everybody around him happy his affection for the little man increased mightily but his respectful attitude promptly changed and a chance to reprove or discomfit his absurdly rich brotherinlaw was one of his most satisfactory diversions uncle john appreciated this and holding the dignified major in loving regard was glad to cross swords with him now and then to add variety to their pleasant relations  its this way major doyle he now remarked coolly ive been worried to death lately over business matters and i need a change  phoo all your business is attended to by isham marvin  co youve no worry at all why weve just made you a quarter of a million in ch  ds  the we is explained by stating that the major held an important position in the great banking housea position mr merrick had secured for him some months previously  thats it said uncle john youve made me a quarter of a million that i dont want the ch  d stocks were going to pieces when i bought them and i had reason to hope id lose a good round sum on them but the confounded luck turned and the result is an accumulation of all this dreadful money so my dear major before im tempted to do someother foolish thing ive determined to run away where business cant follow me and where by industry and perseverance i can scatter some of my illgotten gains  the major smiled grimly  thats europe right enough he said and i dont object john to your going there whenever you please youre disgracefully countryfied and uninformed for a man of means and europell open your eyes and prove to you how insignificant you really are i advise you to visit ireland sor which im reliably informed is the centhral jewel in europes crown of beauty go and go whinever you please sor but forbear the wickedness of putting foolish thoughts into our patsys sweet head she cant go a step and you know it its positive cruelty to her sir to suggest such a thing  the majors speech had a touch of the brogue when he became excited but recovered when he calmed down  why you selfish old humbug cried uncle john indignantly why cant she go when theres money and time to spare would you keep her here to cuddle and spoil a vigorous man like yourself when she can run away and see the world and be happy  its a great happiness to cuddle the major said patsy softly and the poor man needs it as much as he does his slippers or his oatmeal for breakfast  and patsy has the house to look after added the major complacently  uncle john gave a snort of contempt  for an unreasonable man show me an irishman he remarked here youve been telling me how europe is an education and a delight and in the next breath you deliberately deprive your little daughter whom you pretend to love of the advantages she might gain by a trip abroad and why just because you want her yourself and might be a bit lonesome without her but ill settle that foolishness sir in short order you shall go with us  impossible ejaculated the major its the time of year im most needed in the office and mr marvin has been so kind and considerate that i wont play him a dirty trick by leaving him in the lurch  patsy nodded approval  thats right daddy she said  uncle john lay back in the chair and put the newspaper over his face again patsy and her father stared at one another with grave intentness then the major drew out his handkerchief and mopped his brow  youd like to go mavourneen he asked softly  yes daddy but i wont of course  tuttut dont you go putting yourself against your old fathers will patsy its not so far to europe he continued thoughtfully and you wont be away much longer than you were when you went to elmhurst after aunt janes moneywhich you didnt get mary takes fine care of our little rooms and doubtless i shall be so busy that i wont miss you at all at all  daddy  she was in his lap now her chubby arms clasped around his neck and her soft cheek laid close beside his rough and ruddy one  and when ye get back patsy darlin he whispered tenderly stroking her hair the joy of the meeting will make up for all that weve suffered its the way of life mavourneen unless a couple happens to be siamese twins theyre bound to get separated in the course of events more or less if not frequently  i wont go daddy  oh yes you will its not like you to be breakin my heart by stayin home next week said that wicked old unclehe remoinds me of the one that tried to desthroy the babes in the woods patsy dear you must try to reclaim him to humanity for im hopin theres a bit of good in the old rascal yet and he looked affectionately at the round little man under the newspaper  uncle john emerged again it was wonderful how well he understood the doyle family his face was now smiling and wore a look of supreme satisfaction  your selfishness my dear major said he is like the husk on a cocoanut when you crack it theres plenty of milk withinand in your case its the milk of human kindness come lets talk over the trip     chapter ii  uncle john makes plans   the thought came to me a long time ago uncle john resumed but it was only yesterday that i got all the details fixed and settled in my mind ive been a rough old duffer patsy and in all my hard working life never thought of such a thing as travelling or enjoying myself until i fell in with you and you taught me how pleasant it is to scatter sunshine in the hearts of others for to make others happy means a lot of joy for yourselfa secret you were trying to keep from me you crafty young woman until i discovered it by accident now here i am with three nieces on my hands  you may say two sir interrupted the major patsy can take care of herself  hold your tongue said uncle john i say ive got three niecesas fine a trio of intelligent sweet and attractive young women as youll run across in a month of sundays i dare you to deny it sir and they are all at an age when an european trip will do them a world of good so off we go a week from tuesday in the firstclass steamer princess irene bound from new york for the bay of naples  patsys eyes showed her delight they fairly danced  have you told beth and louise she asked  his face fell  not yet he said id forgotten to mention it to them  for my part continued the girl i can get ready in a week easily but beth is way out in ohio and we dont know whether she can go or not  ill telegraph her and find out said uncle john  do it today suggested the major  i will  and tomorrow you must see louise added patsy im not sure shell want to go dear shes such a social butterfly you know that her engagements may keep her at home  do you mean to say shes engaged asked mr merrick aghast  only for the parties and receptions uncle but it wouldnt surprise me if she was married soon shes older than beth or me and has a host of admirers  perhaps shes old enough to be sensible suggested the major  well ill see her and her mother tomorrow morning decided uncle john and if she cant find time for a trip to europe at my expense you and beth shall go anyhowand well bring louise a wedding present  with this declaration he took his hat and walking stick and started for the telegraph station leaving patsy and her father to canvass the unexpected situation  john merrick was sixty years old but as hale and rugged as a boy of twenty he had made his vast fortune on the pacific coast and during his years of busy activity had been practically forgotten by the eastern members of his family who never had credited him with sufficient ability to earn more than a precarious livelihood but the man was shrewd enough in a business way although simple almost to childishness in many other matters when he returned quite unheralded to end his days at home and employ his ample wealth to the best advantage he for a time kept his success a secret and so learned much of the dispositions and personal characteristics of his three nieces  they were at that time visiting his unmarried sister jane at her estate at elmhurst whither they had been invited for the first time and in the race for aunt janes fortune he watched the three girls carefully and found much to admire in each one of them patsy doyle however proved exceptionally frank and genuine and when aunt jane at last died and it was found she had no estate to bequeath patsy proved the one bright star in the firmament of disappointment supposing uncle john to be poor she insisted upon carrying him to new york with her and sharing with him the humble tenement room in which she lived with her fathera retired veteran who helped pay the family expenses by keeping books for a mercantile firm while patsy worked in a hairdressers shop  it was now that uncle john proved a modern fairy godfather to aunt janes nieceswho were likewise his own nieces the three girls had little in common except their poverty elizabeth de graf being the daughter of a music teacher in cloverton ohio while louise merrick lived with her widowed mother in a social atmosphere of the second class in new york where the two women frankly intrigued to ensnare for louise a husband who had sufficient means to ensure both mother and daughter a comfortable home in spite of this worldly and unlovely ambition which their circumstances might partially excuse louise who was but seventeen had many good and womanly qualities could they have been developed in an atmosphere uninfluenced by the schemes of her vain and selfish mother  uncle john casting aside the mask of poverty came to the relief of all three girls he settled the incomes of substantial sums of money upon both beth and louise making them practically independent for patsy he bought a handsome modern flat building located at 3708 willing square and installed her and the major in its cosiest apartment the rents of the remaining flats giving the doyles an adequate income for all time to come here uncle john believing himself cordially welcome as indeed he was made his own home and it required no shrewd guessing to arrive at the conclusion that little patsy was destined to inherit some day all his millions  the great banking and brokerage firm of isham marvin  co had long managed successfully john merricks vast fortune and at his solicitation it gave major doyle a responsible position in its main office with a salary that rendered him independent of his daughters suddenly acquired wealth and made him proud and selfrespecting  money had no power to change the nature of the doyles the major remained the same simple honest courteous yet brusque old warrior who had won uncle johns love as a hard working bookkeeper and patsys bright and sunny disposition had certain power to cheer any home whether located in a palace or a hovel  never before in his life had uncle john been so supremely happy and never before had aunt janes three nieces had so many advantages and pleasures it was to confer still further benefits upon these girls that their eccentric uncle had planned this unexpected european trip  his telegram to elizabeth was characteristic  patsy louise and i sail for europe next tuesday will you join us as my guest if so take first train to new york where i will look after your outfit answer immediately  that was a message likely to surprise a country girl but it did not strike john merrick as in any way extraordinary he thought he could depend upon beth she would be as eager to go as he was to have her and when he had paid for the telegram he dismissed the matter from further thought  next morning patsy reminded him that instead of going down town he must personally notify louise merrick of the proposed trip so he took a crosstown line and arrived at the merricks home at nine oclock  mrs merrick was in a morning wrapper sipping her coffee in an upper room but she could not deny herself to uncle john her dead husbands brother and her only daughters benefactor which meant indirectly her own benefactor so she ordered the maid to show him up at once  louise is still sweetly sleeping she said and wont waken for hours yet  is anything wrong with her he asked anxiously  oh dear no but everyone does not get up with the milkman as you do john and the dear child was at the opera last night which made her late in getting home  doesnt the opera let out before midnight the same as the theatres he asked  i believe so but there is the supper afterward you know  ah yes he returned thoughtfully ive always noticed that the opera makes folks desperately hungry for they flock to the restaurants as soon as they can get away singular isnt it  why i never thought of it in that light  but louise is well  quite well thank you  thats a great relief for im going to take her to europe with me next week he said  mrs merrick was so astonished that she nearly dropped her coffeecup and could make no better reply than to stare blankly at her brotherinlaw  we sail tuesday continued uncle john and you must have my niece ready in time and deliver her on board the princess irene at hoboken at nine oclock sharp  but johnjohn gasped mrs merrick feebly it will take a month at least to make her gowns and  stuff and rubbish he growled that shows martha how little you know about european trips no one makes gowns to go abroad with you buy em in paris to bring home  ah yes to be sure she muttered perhaps then it can be done if louise has no other engagements  just what patsy said see here martha do you imagine that any girl who is half human could have engagements that would keep her from europe  but the requirements of society  youll get me riled pretty soon martha and if you do youll wish you hadnt  this speech frightened the woman it wouldnt do to provoke uncle john however unreasonable he happened to be so she said meekly  ive no doubt louise will be delighted to go and so will i  you  whywhywhom do you intend taking  just the three girlsaunt janes three nieces also mine  but youll want a chaperone for them  why so  propriety requires it and so does ordinary prudence louise i know will be discreet for it is her nature but patsy is such a little flyaway and beth so deep and demure that without a chaperone they might cause you a lot of trouble  uncle john grew red and his eyes flashed  a chaperone he cried contemptuously not any in mine martha merrick either we young folks go alone without any deaths head to perpetually glower at us or we dont go at all three better girls never lived and ill trust em anywhere besides that we arent going to any of your confounded social functions were going on a reglar picnic and if i dont give those girls the time of their lives my name aint john merrick a chaperone indeed  mrs merrick held up her hands in horror  im not sure john she gasped that i ought to trust my dear child with an uncle who disregards so openly the proprieties  well im sure and the things settled he said more calmly dont worry maam ill look after patsy and beth and louise will look after all of usjust as she does after youbecause shes so discreet talk about your being a chaperone why you dont dare say your souls your own when louise is awake that chaperone business is all humbuggeryunless an old uncle like me can be a chaperone anyhow im the only one thats going to be appointed i wont wait for louise to wake up just tell her the news and help her to get ready on time and now im off good morning martha  she really had no words of protest ready at hand and it was long after queer old john merrick had gone away that she remembered a dozen effective speeches that she might have delivered  after all she sighed taking up her cup again it may be the best thing in the world for louise we dont know whether that young weldon who is paying her attentions just now is going to inherit his fathers money or not hes been a bit wild ive heard and it is just as well to postpone any engagement until we find out the facts i can do that nicely while my sweet child is in europe with uncle john and away from all danger of entanglements really its an ill wind that blows no good ill go talk with louise     chapter iii  all ashore   beth de graf was a puzzle to all who knew her she was a puzzle even to herself and was wont to say indifferently that the problem was not worth a solution for this beautiful girl of fifteen was somewhat bitter and misanthropic a condition perhaps due to the uncongenial atmosphere in which she had been reared she was of dark complexion and her big brown eyes held a sombre and unfathomable expression once she had secretly studied their reflection in a mirror and the eyes awed and frightened her and made her uneasy she had analyzed them much as if they belonged to someone else and wondered what lay behind their mask and what their capabilities might be  but this morbid condition mostly affected her when she was at home listening to the unpleasant bickerings of her father and mother who quarrelled constantly over trifles that beth completely ignored her parents seemed like two ill tempered animals confined in the same cage she thought and their snarls had long since ceased to interest her  this condition had of course been infinitely worse in all those dreadful years when they were poverty stricken since uncle john had settled a comfortable income on his niece the grocer was paid promptly and mrs de graf wore a silk dress on sundays and held her chin a little higher than any other of the cloverton ladies dared do the professor no longer harrassed by debts devoted less time to the drudgery of teaching and began the composition of an oratorio that he firmly believed would render his name famous so there being less to quarrel about beths parents indulged more moderately in that pastime but their natures were discordant and harmony in the de graf household was impossible  when away from home beths disposition softened some of her schoolfriends had seen her smilea wonderful and charming phenomenon during which her expression grew sweet and bewitchingly animated and her brown eyes radiant with mirthful light it was not the same beth at all  sometimes when the nieces were all at aunt janes beth had snuggled in the arms of her cousin louise who had a way of rendering herself agreeable to all with whom she came in contact and tried hard to win the affection of the frankly antagonistic girl at such times the gentleness of elizabeth her almost passionate desire to be loved and fondled completely transformed her for the moment louise shrewd at reading others told herself that beth possessed a reserve force of tenderness amiability and fond devotion that would render her adorable if she ever allowed those qualities full expression but she did not tell beth that the girl was so accustomed to despise herself and so suspicious of any creditable impulses that at times unexpectedly obtruded themselves that she would have dismissed such a suggestion as arrant flattery and louise was clever enough not to wish to arouse her cousin to a full consciousness of her own possibilities  the trained if not native indifference of this strange girl of fifteen was demonstrated by her reception of uncle johns telegram she quietly handed it to her mother and said as calmly as if it were an invitation to a church picnic  i think i shall go  nothing like that ever happened to me remarked mrs de graf enviously if john merrick had an atom of common sense hed have taken me to europe instead of a troop of stupid school girls but john always was a fool and always will be when will you start beth  tomorrow morning theres nothing to keep me ill go to patsy and stay with her until we sail  are you glad asked her mother looking into the expressionless face half curiously  yes returned beth as if considering her reply a change is always interesting and i have never travelled except to visit aunt jane at elmhurst so i think i am pleased to go to europe  mrs de graf sighed there was little in common between mother and daughter but that to a grave extent was the womans fault she had never tried to understand her childs complex nature and somewhat resented beths youth and good looks which she considered contrasted unfavorably with her own deepening wrinkles and graying hair for mrs de graf was vain and selfimportant and still thought herself attractive and even girlish it would really be a relief to have beth out of the way for a few months  the girl packed her own trunk and arranged for it to be taken to the station in the morning she entered the music room to bid the professor goodbye he frowned at the interruption for the oratorio was especially engrossing at the time mrs de graf kissed her daughter lightly upon the lips and said in a perfunctory way that she hoped beth would have a good time  the girl had no thought of resenting the lack of affection displayed by her parents it was what she had always been accustomed to and she had no reason to expect anything different  patsy met her at the train in new york and embraced her rapturously patsy was really fond of beth but it was her nature to be fond of everyone and her cousin escaping from her smacking and enthusiastic kisses told herself that patsy would have embraced a cat with the same spontaneous ecstacy that was not strictly true but there was nothing half hearted or halfway about miss doyle if she loved you there would never be an occasion for you to doubt the fact it was patsys way  uncle john also was cordial in his greetings he was very proud of his pretty niece and discerning enough to realize there was a broad strata of womanliness somewhere in elizabeths undemonstrative character he had promised himself to dig it out some day and perhaps the european trip would give him his opportunity  patsy and elizabeth shopped for the next few days most strenuously and delightfully sometimes their dainty cousin louise joined them and the three girls canvassed gravely their requirements for a trip that was as new to them as a flight to the moon naturally they bought much that was unnecessary and forgot many things that would have been useful you have to go twice to europe to know what to take along  louise needed less than the others for her wardrobe was more extensive and she already possessed all that a young girl could possibly make use of this niece the eldest of uncle johns trio was vastly more experienced in the ways of the world than the others although as a traveller she had no advantage of them urged thereto by her worldly mother she led a sort of trivial butterfly existence and her character was decidedly superficial to any close observer indeed her very suavity and sweetness of manner was assumed because it was so much more comfortable and effective to be agreeable than otherwise she was now past seventeen years of age tall and well formed with a delicate and attractive face which without being beautiful was considered pleasant and winning her eyes were good though a bit too shrewd and her light brown hair was fluffy as spun silk graceful of carriage gracious of manner yet affecting a languor unsuited to her years louise merrick was a girl calculated to draw from the passing throng glances of admiration and approval and to convey the impression of good breeding and feminine cleverness  all this however was outward neither patsy nor beth displayed any undue affection for their cousin although all of the girls exhibited a fair amount of cousinly friendship for one another they had once been thrown together under trying circumstances when various qualities of temperament not altogether admirable were liable to assert themselves those events were too recent to be already forgotten yet the girls were generous enough to be considerate of each others failings and had resolved to entertain no sentiment other than good will on the eve of their departure for such a charming outing as uncle john had planned for them  mr merrick being a man saw nothing radically wrong in the dispositions of any of his nieces their youth and girlishness appealed to him strongly and he loved to have them by his side it is true that he secretly regretted louise was not more genuine that beth was so cynical and frank and that patsy was not more diplomatic but he reflected that he had had no hand in molding their characters although he might be instrumental in improving them so he accepted the girls as they were thankful that their faults were not glaring and happy to have found three such interesting nieces to cheer his old age  at last the preparations were complete tuesday arrived and uncle john corralled his females as he expressed it and delivered them safely on board the staunch and comfortable ocean greyhound known as the princess irene together with their bags and baggage their flowers and fruits and candy boxes and all those other useless accessories to a voyage so eagerly thrust upon the departing travellers by their affectionate but illadvised friends  mrs merrick undertook the exertion of going to hoboken to see her daughter off and whispered in the ear of louise many worldly admonitions and such bits of practical advice as she could call to mind on the spur of the moment  major gregory doyle was there pompous and straight of form and wearing an assumed smile that was meant to assure patsy he was delighted at her going but which had the effect of scaring the girl because she at first thought the dreadful expression was due to convulsions  the major had no admonitions for patsy but she had plenty for him and gave him a long list of directions that would as he said cause him to walk mighty sthraight if by good luck he managed to remember them all  having made up his mind to let the child go to europe the old fellow allowed no wails or bemoanings to reach patsys ears to deprive her of a moments joyful anticipation of the delights in store for her he laughed and joked perpetually during that last day and promised the girl that he would take a vacation while she was gone and visit his old colonel in virginia which she knew was the rarest pleasure he could enjoy and now he stood upon the deck amusing them all with his quaint sayings and appearing so outwardly jolly and unaffected that only patsy herself suspected the deep grief that was gripping his kindly old heart  uncle john guessed perhaps for he hugged the major in a tight embrace whispering that patsy should be now as ever the apple of his eye and the subject of his most loving care  an dont be forgetting to bring me the meerschaum pipe from sicily an the leathern pocketbook from florence the major said to patsy impressively its little enough for ye to remember if ye go that way an to tell the truth im sending ye abroad just for to get them an dont be gettin off the boat till it stops at a station an remember that uncle john is full of rheumatics an cant walk more n thirty mile an hour an  its a slander said uncle john stoutly i never had rheumatics in my life  major observed patsy her blue eyes full of tears but her lips trying to smile do have the tailor sponge your vest every saturday its full of spots even now and ive been too busy lately to look after you properly youreyourejust disgraceful major  all ashore called a loud voice  the major gathered patsy into an embrace that threatened to crush her and then tossed her into uncle johns arms and hurried away mrs merrick followed with good wishes for all for a pleasant journey and then the four voyagers pressed to the rail and waved their handkerchiefs frantically to those upon the dock while the band played vociferously and the sailors ran here and there in sudden excitement and the great ship left her moorings and moved with proud deliberation down the bay to begin her long voyage to gibraltar and the blue waters of the mediterranean     chapter iv  some new acquaintances and a warning   for an inexperienced tourist uncle john managed their arrangements most admirably he knew nothing at all about ocean travel or what was the proper method to secure comfortable accommodations but while most of the passengers were writing hurried letters in the second deck gallery which were to be sent back by the pilot mr merrick took occasion to interview the chief steward and the deck steward and whatever other official he could find and purchased their good will so liberally that the effect of his astute diplomacy was immediately apparent  his nieces found that the sunniest deck chairs bore their names the most desirable seats in the dining hall were theirs when half famished because breakfast had been disregarded they trooped in to luncheon the best waiters on the ship attended to their wants and afterward their cabins were found to be cosily arranged with every comfort the heart of maid could wish for  at luncheon it was found that the steward had placed a letter before uncle johns plate the handwriting of the address louise who sat next her uncle at once recognized as that of her mother but she said nothing  mr merrick was amazed at the contents of the communication especially as he had so recently parted with the lady who had written it  it said i must warn you john that my daughter has just escaped a serious entanglement and i am therefore more grateful than i can express that you are taking her far from home for a few weeks a young man named arthur weldona son of the big railroad president you knowhas been paying louise marked attentions lately but i cautioned her not to encourage him because a rumor had reached me that he has quarrelled with his father and been disinherited my informant also asserted that the young man is wild and headstrong and cannot be controlled by his parent but he always seemed gentlemanly enough at our house and my greatest objection to him is that he is not likely to inherit a dollar of his fathers money louise and i decided to keep him dangling until we could learn the truth of this matter for you can easily understand that with her exceptional attractions there is no object in louise throwing herself away upon a poor man or one who cannot give her a prominent position in society imagine my horror john when i discovered last evening that my only child whom i have so fondly cherished has ungratefully deceived me carried away by the impetuous avowals of this young scapegrace whom his own father disowns she has confessed her love for himlove for a pauperand only by the most stringent exercise of my authority have i been able to exact from louise a promise that she will not become formally engaged to arthur weldon or even correspond with him until she has returned home by that time i shall have learned more of his history and prospects when i can better decide whether to allow the affair to go on of course i have hopes that in case my fears are proven to have been well founded i can arouse louise to a proper spirit and induce her to throw the fellow over meantime i implore you as my daughters temporary guardian not to allow louise to speak of or dwell upon this young man but try to interest her in other gentlemen whom you may meet and lead her to forget if possible her miserable entanglement consider a loving mothers feelings john try to help me in this emergency and i shall be forever deeply grateful  its from mother isnt it asked louise when he had finished reading the letter  yes he answered gruffly as he crumpled the missive and stuffed it into his pocket  what does she say uncle  nothing but rubbish and nonsense eat your soup my dear its getting cold  the girls sweet low laughter sounded very pleasant and served to calm his irritation from her demure yet amused expression uncle john guessed that louise knew the tenor of her mothers letter as well as if she had read it over his shoulder and it comforted him that she could take the matter so lightly perhaps the poor child was not so deeply in love as her mother had declared  he was greatly annoyed at the confidence mrs merrick had seen fit to repose in him and felt she had no right to burden him with any knowledge of such an absurd condition of affairs just as he was starting for a holiday whatever might be the truth of the girls entanglementand he judged that it was not all conveyed in martha merricks subtle letterlouise would surely be free and unhampered by either love or maternal diplomacy for some time to come when she returned home her mother might conduct the affair to suit herself he would have nothing to do with it in any way  as soon as luncheon was finished they rushed for the deck and you may imagine that chubby little uncle john with his rosy smiling face and kindly eyes surrounded by three eager and attractive girls of from fifteen to seventeen years of age was a sight to compel the attention of every passenger aboard the ship  it was found easy to make the acquaintance of the interesting group and many took advantage of that fact for uncle john chatted brightly with every man and patsy required no excuse of a formal introduction to confide to every woman that john merrick was taking his three nieces to europe to see the sights and have the time of their lives  many of the business men knew well the millionaires name and accorded him great respect because he was so enormously wealthy and successful but the little man was so genuinely human and unaffected and so openly scorned all toadyism that they soon forgot his greatness in the financial world and accepted him simply as a good fellow and an invariably cheerful comrade  the weather was somewhat rough for the latter part of marchthey had sailed the twentyseventhbut the irene was so staunch and rode the waves so gracefully that none of the party except louise was at all affected by the motion the eldest cousin however claimed to be indisposed for the first few days out and so beth and patsy and uncle john sat in a row in their steamer chairs with the rugs tucked up to their waists and kept themselves and everyone around them merry and light hearted  next to patsy reclined a dark complexioned man of about thirtyfive with a long thin face and intensely black grave eyes he was carelessly dressed and wore a flannel shirt but there was an odd look of mingled refinement and barbarity about him that arrested the girls attention he sat very quietly in his chair reserved both in speech and in manner but when she forced him to talk he spoke impetuously and with almost savage emphasis in a broken dialect that amused her immensely  you cant be american she said  i am sicilian was the proud answer  thats what i thought sicilian or italian or spanish but im glad its sicilian which is the same as italian i cant speak your lingo myself she continued although i am studying it hard but you manage the english pretty well so we shall get along famously together  he did not answer for a moment but searched her unconscious face with his keen eyes then he demanded brusquely  where do you go  why to europe she replied as if surprised  europe pah it is no answer at all he responded angrily europe is big to what part do you journey  patsy hesitated the magic word europe had seemed to sum up their destination very effectively and she had heretofore accepted it as sufficient for the time being at least uncle john had bought an armful of guide books and baedeckers but in the hurry of departure she had never glanced inside them to go to europe had been enough to satisfy her so far but perhaps she should have more definite knowledge concerning their trip so she turned to uncle john and said  uncle dear to what part of europe are we going  what part he answered why it tells on the ticket patsy i cant remember the name just now its where the ship stops of course  that is napoli said the thin faced man with a scarcely veiled sneer and then  and then repeated patsy turning to her uncle  then oh some confounded place or other that i cant think of im not a timetable patsy but the trip is all arranged in beautiful style by a friend of mine who has always wanted to go abroad and so has the whole programme mapped out in his head  is it in his head yet enquired patsy anxiously  no dear its in the left hand pocket of my blue coat all written down clearly so whats the use of bothering we arent there yet by and bye well get to europe an do it up brown whatever happens and wherever we go its got to be a spree and a jolly good time so take it easy patsy dear and dont worry  thats all right uncle she rejoined with a laugh im not worrying the least mite but when folks ask us where were going what shall we say  europe  and then mischievously  and then home again of course its as plain as the nose on your face patsy doyle and a good bit straighter  that made her laugh again and the strange italian who was listening growled a word in his native language he wasnt at all a pleasant companion but for that very reason patsy determined to make him talk and be sociable by degrees he seemed to appreciate her attention and always brightened when she came to sit beside him  youll have to tell me your name you know she said to him because i cant be calling you sir every minute  he glanced nervously around then he answered slowly  i am called valdivictor valdi  oh thats a pretty name mr valdior should i say signor  you should  do i pronounce it right  no  well never mind if i dont youll know what i mean and that i intend to be proper and polite she responded sweetly  beth while she made fewer acquaintances than patsy seemed to have cast off her sullen reserve when she boarded the ship in truth the girl was really happy for the first time in her life and it softened her so wonderfully and made her so attractive that she soon formed a select circle around her a young lady from cleveland who had two big brothers was impelled to introduce herself to beth because of the young mens intense admiration for the girls beautiful face when it was found that they were all from ohio they formed a friendly alliance at once marion horton was so frank and agreeable that she managed to draw out all that was best in beths nature and the stalwart young hortons were so shyly enthusiastic over this their first trip abroad that they inspired the girl with a like ardor which resulted in the most cordial relations between them  and it so happened that several other young men who chanced to be aboard the princess irene marked the hortons intimacy with beth and insisted on being introduced by them so that by the time louise had conquered her maldemer and appeared on deck she found an admiring group around her cousin that included most of the desirable young fellows on the ship beth sat enthroned like a queen listening to her courtiers and smiling encouragement now and then but taking little part in the conversation herself because of her inexperience such adoration was new to the little country girl and she really enjoyed it nor did the young men resent her silence all that they wanted her to do as tom horton tersely expressed it was to sit still and look pretty  as for uncle john he was so delighted with beths social success that he adopted all the boys on the spot and made them a part of what he called his family circle  louise discovering this state of affairs gave an amused laugh and joined the group she was a little provoked that she had isolated herself so long in her cabin when there was interesting sport on deck but having lost some valuable time she straightway applied herself to redeem the situation  in the brilliance of her conversation in her studied glances in a thousand pretty ways that were skillfully rendered effective she had a decided advantage over her more beautiful cousin when louise really desired to please she was indeed a charming companion and young men are not likely to detect insincerity in a girl who tries to captivate them  the result was astonishing to uncle john and somewhat humiliating to beth for a new queen was presently crowned and louise by some magnetic power assembled the court around herself only the youngest horton boy in whose susceptible heart beths image was firmly enshrined refused to change his allegiance but in truth the girl enjoyed herself more genuinely in the society of one loyal cavalier than when so many were clamoring for her favors the two would walk the deck together for hours without exchanging a single word or sit together silently listening to the band or watching the waves without the need as tom expressed it of jabbering every blessed minute in order to be happy  patsy was indignant at the artfulness of louise until she noticed that beth was quite content then she laughed softly and watched matters take their course feeling a little sorry for the boys because she knew louise was only playing with them  the trip across the atlantic was all too short on the fifth of april they passed the azores running close to the islands of fayal and san jorge so that the passengers might admire the zigzag rows of white houses that reached from the shore far up the steep hillsides on the sixth day they sighted gibraltar and passed between the moorish and spanish lighthouses into the lovely waters of the mediterranean the worldfamed rock was now disclosed to their eyes and when the ship anchored opposite it uncle john assisted his nieces aboard the lighter and took them for a brief excursion ashore  of course they rode to the fortress and wandered through its gloomy impressive galleries seeing little of the armament because visitors are barred from the real fortifications the fortress did not seem especially impregnable and was taken altogether a distinct disappointment to them but the ride through the town in the low basket phaetons was wholly delightful the quaint narrow streets and stone arches the beautiful vistas of sea and mountain the swarthy darkeyed moors whose presence lent to the town an oriental atmosphere and the queer marketplaces crowded with spaniards frenchmen jews and redcoated english soldiers altogether made up a panorama that was fascinating in the extreme  but their stay was short and after a rush of sightseeing that almost bewildered them they returned to the ship breathless but elated at having seen an done as uncle john declared their first foreign port  and now through waters so brightly blue and transparent that they aroused the girls wonder and admiration the good ship plowed her way toward the port of naples passing to the east of sardinia and corsica which they viewed with eager interest because these places had always seemed so far away to them and had now suddenly appeared as if by magic directly before their eyes  patsy and the big whiskered captain had become such good friends that he always welcomed the girl on his own exclusive deck and this afternoon she sat beside him and watched the rugged panorama slip by  when will we get to naples she asked  tomorrow evening probably answered the captain see it is over in that direction where the gray cloud appears in the sky  and what is the gray cloud captain  i do not know said he gravely perhaps smoke from vesuvius at gibraltar we heard that the volcano is in an ugly mood i hope it will cause you no inconvenience  wouldnt it be fine if we could see an eruption exclaimed the girl  the captain shook his head  interesting perhaps he admitted but no great calamity that causes thousands of people to suffer can be called fine  ah that is true she said quickly i had forgotten the suffering  next morning all the sky was thick with smoke and the sun was hidden the waters turned gray too and as they approached the italian coast the gloom perceptibly increased a feeling of uneasiness seemed to pervade the ship and even the captain had so many things to consider that he had no time to converse with his little friend  signor valdi forsook his deck chair for the first time and stood at the rail which overlooked the steerage with his eyes glued to the grim skies ahead when uncle john asked him what he saw he answered eagerly  death and destruction and a loss of millions of lira to the bankrupt government i know for i have studied etna for years and vesuvio is a second cousin to etna  hm said uncle john you seem pleased with the idea of an eruption  the thin faced man threw a shrewd look from his dark eyes and smiled uncle john frowned at the look and stumped away he was not at all easy in his own mind he had brought three nieces for a holiday to this foreign shore and here at the outset they were confronted by an intangible danger that was more fearful because it was not understood it was enough to make his round face serious although he had so strong an objection to unnecessary worry  afternoon tea was served on deck amidst an unusual quiet people soberly canvassed the situation and remarked upon the fact that the darkness increased visibly as they neared the bay of naples beth couldnt drink her tea for tiny black atoms fell through the air and floated upon the surface of the liquid louise retired to her stateroom with a headache and found her white serge gown peppered with particles of lava dust which had fallen from the skies  the pilot guided the ship cautiously past capri and into the bay the air was now black with volcanic dross and a gloom as of midnight surrounded them on every side the shore the mountain and the water of the bay itself were alike invisible     chapter v  vesuvius rampant   it was saturday night the seventh day of april nineteen hundred and sixa night never to be forgotten by those aboard the ship a night which has its place in history  at dinner the captain announced that he had dropped anchor at the immacollatella nuova but at a safe distance from the shore and that no passengers would be landed under any circumstances until the fall of ashes ceased and he could put his people ashore in a proper manner  a spirit of unrest fell upon them all big tom horton whispered to beth that he did not intend to leave her side until all danger was over the deck was deserted all the passengers crowding into the smoking room and saloons to escape the lava dust  few kept their rooms or ventured to sleep at intervals a loud detonation from the volcano shook the air and the mystery and awe of the enveloping gloom were so palpable as almost to be felt  toward midnight the wind changed driving the cloud of ashes to the southward and sufficiently clearing the atmosphere to allow the angry glow of the crater to be distinctly seen now it shot a pillar of fire thousands of feet straight into the heavens then it would darken and roll skyward great clouds that were illumined by the showers of sparks accompanying them  the windows of every cabin facing the volcano were filled with eager faces and in the smoking room uncle john clasped beth around the waist with one arm and patsy with the other and watched the wonderful exhibition through the window with a grave and anxious face tom horton had taken a position at one side of them and the dark italian at the other the latter assured patsy they were in no danger whatever tom secretly hoped they were and laid brave plans for rescuing beth or perishing at her side louise chose to lie in her berth and await events with calm resignation if they escaped she would not look haggard and holloweyed when morning came if a catastrophy was pending she would have no power to prevent it  it was four oclock on sunday morning when vesuvius finally reached the climax of her travail with a deep groan of anguish the mountain burst asunder and from its side rolled a great stream of molten lava that slowly spread down the slope consuming trees vineyards and dwellings in its path and overwhelming the fated city of boscotrecase  our friends marked the course of destruction by watching the thread of fire slowly wander down the mountain slope they did not know of the desolation it was causing but the sight was terrible enough to inspire awe in every breast  the volcano was easier after that final outburst but the black clouds formed thicker than ever and soon obscured the sky again     chapter vi  under a cloud   after all said uncle john next morning we may consider ourselves very lucky your parents might have come to naples a hundred times my dears and your children may come a hundred times more and yet never see the sights that have greeted us on our arrival if the confounded old hill was bound to spout it did the fair thing by spouting when we were around eh patsy  i quite agree with you said the girl i wouldnt have missed it for anythingif it really had to behave so  but youll pay for it growled signor valdi who had overheard these remarks you will pay for it with a thousand discomfortsand im glad that is so vesuvio is hell let loose and it amuses you hundreds are lying dead and crushed and you are lucky to be here listen he dropped his voice to a whisper if these neapolitans could see the rejoicing in my heart they would kill me and you pah you are no better you also rejoiceand they will welcome you to naples i have advice do not go on shore it is useless  they were all startled by this strange speech and the reproof it conveyed made them a trifle uncomfortable but uncle john whispered that the man was mad and to pay no attention to him  although ashes still fell softly upon the ship the day had somewhat lightened the gloom and they could see from deck the dim outlines of the shore a crowd of boats presently swarmed around them their occupants eagerly clamoring for passengers to go ashore or offering fruits flowers and souvenirs to any who might be induced to purchase their indifference to their own and their citys danger was astonishing it was their custom to greet arriving steamers in this way for by this means they gained a livelihood nothing short of absolute destruction seemed able to interfere with their established occupations  a steam tender also came alongside and after a cordial farewell to the ships officers and their travelling acquaintances uncle john placed his nieces and their baggage aboard the tender which shortly deposited them safely upon the dock  perhaps a lot of passengers more dismal looking never before landed on the beautiful shores of naplesbeautiful no longer but presenting an appearance gray and grewsome ashes were ankle deep in the streetsa fine flourlike dust that clung to your clothing filled your eyes and lungs and seemed to penetrate everywhere the foliage of the trees and shrubbery drooped under its load and had turned from green to the allpervading gray the grass was covered the cornices and balconies of the houses were banked with ashes  bless me said uncle john its as bad as pompey or whatever that city was called that was buried in the bible days  oh not quite uncle answered patsy in her cheery voice but it may be before vesuvius is satisfied  it is certainly bad enough observed louise pouting as she marked the destruction of her pretty cloak by the grimy deposit that was fast changing its color and texture  well let us get under shelter as soon as possible said uncle john  the outlines of a carriage were visible a short distance away he walked up to the driver and said  we want to go to a hotel  the man paid no attention  ask him how much he charges uncle you know you mustnt take a cab in naples without bargaining  why not  the driver will swindle you  ill risk that he answered just now were lucky if we get a carriage at all he reached up and prodded the jehu in the ribs with his cane how much to the hotel vesuvius he demanded loudly  the man woke up and flourished his whip at the same time bursting into a flood of italian  the girls listened carefully they had been trying to study italian from a small book beth had bought entitled italian in three weeks without a master but not a word the driver of the carriage said seemed to have occurred in the vocabulary of the book he repeated vesuvio many times however with scornful angry or imploring intonations and louise finally said  he thinks you want to go to the volcano uncle the hotel is the vesuve not the vesuvius  whats the difference  i dont know  all right you girls just hop in and leave the rest to me  he tumbled them all into the vehicle bag and baggage and then said sternly to the driver  hotel vesuvevesuvehotel vesuve drive there darned quick or ill break your confounded neck  the carriage started it plowed its way jerkily through the dustladen streets and finally stopped at an imposing looking structure the day was growing darker and an electric lamp burned before the entrance but no one came out to receive them  uncle john climbed out and read the sign hotel du vesuve it was the establishment he had been advised to stop at while in naples he compared the sign with a card which he drew from his pocket and knew that he had made no mistake  entering the spacious lobby he found it deserted in the office a man was hastily making a package of some books and papers and did not respond or even look up when spoken to at the concierges desk a big whiskered man sat staring straight ahead of him with a look of abject terror in his eyes  good morning said uncle john fine day isnt it  did you hear it whispered the concierge as a dull boom like that of a distant cannon made the windows rattle in their casements  of course replied mr merrick carelessly old vesuve seems on a rampage but never mind that now weve just come from america where the mountains are more polite and were going to stop at your hotel  the concierges eyes wandered from the man to the three girls who had entered and grouped themselves behind him then they fell upon the driver of the carriage who burst into a torrent of vociferous but wholly unintelligible exclamations which uncle john declared must be an excuseand a mighty poor onefor talking  the whiskered man whose cap was elaborately embroidered in gold with the words hotel du vesuve seemed to understand the driver he sighed drearily and said to mr merrick  you must pay him thirty lira  how much is that  six dollars  not by a jugfull  you made no bargain  i couldnt he cant talk  he claims it is you who cannot talk  what  and prices are advanced during these awful days what does it matter your money will do you no good when we are all buried deep in ash and scoria  the big man shuddered at this gloomy picture and added listlessly youll have to pay  uncle john paid but the driver wouldnt accept american money the disconsolate concierge would though he unlocked a drawer put the six dollars into one section and drew from another two tenlira notes the driver took them bowed respectfully to the whiskered man shot a broadside of invective italian at the unconscious americans and left the hotel  how about rooms asked uncle john  take any you please answered the concierge all our guests are gone but twotwo mad americans like yourselves the servants are also gone the chef has gone the elevator conductors are gone if you stay youll have to walk up  where have they all gone asked uncle john wonderingly  fled sir fled to escape destruction they remember pompeii only signor floriano the proprietor and myself are left we stick to the last we are brave  so i see now look here my manly hero its possible we shall all live through it ill bet you a thousand to ten that we do and then youll be glad to realize youve pocketed a little more american money come out of that box and show us some rooms and ill help to build up your fortune  the concierge obeyed even the horrors of the situation could not eliminate from his carefully trained nature that desire to accumulate which is the prime qualification of his profession the americans walked up one flight and found spacious rooms on the first floor of which they immediately took possession  send for our trunks said mr merrick and the man consented to do so provided he could secure a proper vehicle  you will be obliged to pay high for it he warned but that will not matter to witness the destruction of our beautiful naples is an unusual sight it will be worth your money  well settle that in the dim hereafter replied uncle john you get the trunks and ill take care of the finances  when the concierge had retired the girls began to stuff newspapers into the cracks of the windows of their sitting room where the fine ash was sifting in and forming little drifts several inches in thickness also the atmosphere of the room was filled with impalpable particles of dust which rendered breathing oppressive and unpleasant  uncle john watched them for a time and his brow clouded  see here girls he exclaimed lets hold a council of war do you suppose we are in any real danger  they grouped around him with eager interest  its something new to be in danger and rather exciting dont you think said beth but perhaps were as safe as we would be at home  once said louise slowly there was a great eruption of vesuvius which destroyed the cities of herculaneum and pompeii many of the inhabitants were buried alive perhaps they thought there was no real danger  uncle john scratched his head reflectively  i take it he observed that the moral of your story is to light out while we have the chance  not necessarily observed the girl smiling at his perplexity it is likewise true that many other eruptions have occurred when little damage was done  forewarned is forearmed declared patsy naples isnt buried more than six inches in ashes as yet and it will take days for them to reach to our windows provided theyre falling at the same rate they do now i dont see any use of getting scared before tomorrow anyhow  its a big hill said uncle john gravely and ive no right to take foolish chances with three girls on my hands  im not frightened uncle john  nor i  nor i the least bit  everyone has left the hotel but ourselves said he  how sorry they will be afterward remarked beth  he looked at them admiringly and kissed each one  you stay in this room and dont move a peg till i get back he enjoined them im going out to look over the situation     chapter vii  a friend in need   some of mr merricks business friends in new york hearing of his proposed trip had given him letters of introduction to people in various european cities he had accepted themquite a bunch altogetherbut had firmly resolved not to use them neither he nor the nieces cared to make superficial acquaintances during their wanderings yet uncle john chanced to remember that one of these letters was to a certain colonel angeli of the twelfth italian regiment occupying the barracks on the pizzofalcone hill at naples this introduction tendered by a relative of the colonels american wife was now reposing in mr merricks pocket and he promptly decided to make use of it in order to obtain expert advice as to the wisdom of remaining in the stricken city  enquiring his way from the still dazed concierge he found that the pizzofalcone barracks were just behind the hotel but several hundred feet above it so he turned up the strada st lucia and soon came upon the narrow lane that wound upward to the fortifications it was a long and tedious climb in the semidarkness caused by the steady fall of ashes and at intervals the detonations from vesuvius shook the huge rock and made its massive bulk seem insecure but the little man persevered and finally with sweating brow arrived at the barracks  a soldier carried in the letter to his colonel and presently returned to usher uncle john through the vast building up a flight of steps and so to a large covered balcony suspended many hundred feet above the via partenope where the hotel was situated  here was seated a group of officers watching intently the cloud that marked the location of the volcano colonel angeli big and bluff his uniform gorgeous his dark heavy moustaches carefully waxed his handsome face as ingenuous and merry as a schoolboys greeted the american with a gracious courtesy that made uncle john feel quite at his ease when he heard of the nieces the italian made a grimace and then laughed  i am despairing signore said he in english sufficiently strangulated to be amusing but nevertheless quite comprehensible that you and the sweet signorini are to see our lovely naples under tribulations so very great but yesterday in all the world is no city so enchanting so brilliant so gay todaylook is it not horrible vesuvio is sick and naples mourns until the tyrant is well again  but the danger said uncle john what do you think of the wisdom of our staying here is it safe to keep my girls in naples during this eruption  ah why not this very morning the mountain asunder burst and we who love our people dread the news of devastation we shall hear from the observatory where his majestys faithful servant still remains come telegrams that the great pebbleswhat we call scoriahave ruined ottajano and san guiseppe perhaps they are overwhelmed but the beast has vomited he will feel better now and ever become more quiet  i suppose remarked mr merrick thoughtfully that no one knows exactly what the blamed hill may do next i dont like to take chances with three girls on my hands they are a valuable lot colonel and worth saving  the boyish italian instantly looked grave then he led uncle john away from the others although doubtless he was the only officer present able to speak or understand english and said to him  where are you living  at the hotel named after your sick mountainthe vesuve  very good in the bay not distant from your hotel lies a government launch that is under my command at my home in the viala elena are a wife and two children who should danger that is serious arise will be put by my soldiers on the launch to carry them to safety admirable is it not  very good arrangement said uncle john  it renders me content to know that in any difficulty they cannot be hurt i am not scare myself but it is pleasant to know i have what you call the side that is safe from my american wife i have many of your excellent speech figures but now the launch is big remain happy in napleshappy as vesuvio will let youand watch his vast his gigantic exhibition if danger come you all enter my launch and be saved if no danger you have a marvelous experience the serious look glided from his face and was replaced by a smile as bright as before  thank you very much responded uncle john gratefully i shall go back to the girls well satisfied  make the signorini stay in today warned the colonel it is bad just now and so black one can nothing at all observe tomorrow it will be better and all can go without i will see you myself then and tell you what to do  then he insisted that uncle john clear his parched throat with a glass of vermoutha harmless drink of which all italians are very fondand sent him away much refreshed in body and mind  he made his way through the ashy rain back to the hotel people were holding umbrellas over their heads and plodding through the dust with seeming unconcern at one corner a street singer was warbling stopping frequently to cough the lava dust from his throat or shake it from his beloved mandolin a procession of peasants passed chanting slowly and solemnly a religious hymn at the head of the column was borne aloft a gilded statuette of the virgin and although uncle john did not know it these simple folks were trusting in the sacred image to avert further disaster from the angry mountain  on arriving home mr merrick told the girls with great elation of his new friend and how they were to be taken aboard the launch in case of emergency  but how will we know when danger threatens asked louise  while uncle john tried to think of an answer to this puzzling query someone knocked upon the door the concierge was standing in the passage and beside him was a soldier in uniform a natty cocks plume upon his beaver hat and a short carbine over his arm  a guard from colonel angeli signor said the concierge respectfullythe first respectful tone he had yet employed  the soldier took off his hat with a flourish and bowed low  he is to remain in the hotel sir yet will not disturb you in any way continued the whiskered one but should he approach you at any time and beckon you to follow him do so at once and without hesitation it is colonel angelis wish you are in the charge of this brave man who will watch over your welfare  that settles it my dears said uncle john cheerfully when the soldier and the concierge had withdrawn this italian friend doesnt do things by halves and i take it we are perfectly safe from this time on     chapter viii  across the bay   tom horton called an hour later he was in despair because his party had decided to leave naples for rome and he feared beth would be engulfed by the volcano unless he was present to protect her  mr merrick said the boy earnestly youll take good care of miss de graf sir wont you we both live in ohio you know and weve just got acquainted andand id like to see her again some time if she escapes  uncle johns eyes twinkled but he drew a long face  my dear tom he said dont ask me to take care of anyoneplease dont i brought these girls along to take care of methree of em sirand theyve got to do their duty dont you worry about the girls just you worry about me  that was not much consolation for the poor fellow but he could do nothing more than wring their handsbeths twice by mistakeand wish them good luck before he hurried away to rejoin his family  im sorry to see him go said beth honestly tom is a nice boy  quite right agreed uncle john i hope we shall meet no worse fellows than tom horton  at noon they were served a modest luncheon in their rooms for signor floriano having sent his important papers to a place of safety had resolved to stick to his hotel and do his duty by any guests that chose to remain with him in defiance of the existent conditions he had succeeded in retaining a few servants who had more courage than those that had stampeded at the first alarm and while the hotel service for the next few days was very inadequate no one was liable to suffer any great privation  during the afternoon the gloom grew denser than before while thicker than ever fell the rain of ashes this was the worst day naples experienced during the great eruption and uncle john and his nieces were content to keep their rooms and live in the glare of electric lights owing to their wise precautions to keep out the heavily laden air they breathed as little lava dust into their lungs as any people perhaps in the city but to escape all was impossible their eyes and throats became more or less inflamed by the floating atoms and the girls declared they felt as if they were sealed up in a tomb  well my chickens how do you like being abroad and actually in europe enquired uncle john cheerfully  beth and patsy smiled at him but louise looked up from the baedecker she was studying and replied  its simply delightful uncle and im glad we happened here during this splendid eruption of vesuvius onlyonly  only what my dear  only it is such hard work to keep clean answered his dainty niece even the water is full of lava and im sure my face looks like a chimneysweeps  and you beth  i dont like it uncle im sure id prefer naples in sunshine although this is an experience we can brag about when we get home  that is the idea exactly said louise and the only thing that reconciles me to the discomforts thousands see naples in sunshine but few can boast seeing vesuvius in eruption it will give us considerable prestige when we return home  ah that is why i selected this time to bring you here declared uncle john with a comical wink i ordered the eruption before i left home and i must say theyve been very prompt about it and done the thing up brown eh patsy  right you are uncle but you might tell em to turn off the eruption now because weve had enough  dont like europe eh  why if i thought all europe was surrounded by volcanoes id go home at once if i had to walk but the geographies dont mention many of these spouters so we may as well stick out our present experience and hope the rest of the continent will behave better the majorll be worried to death when he hears of this  ive sent him a cable said uncle john  what did you say asked patsy eagerly  all safe and well and enjoying the fireworks  im glad you did that replied the girl deeply grateful at this evidence of thoughtfulness its bad enough for the major to have me away without making him worry into the bargain  well no one is likely to worry about me said beth philosophically  mother seldom reads the papers except to get the society news remarked louise i doubt if shell hear of the eruption unless the major happens to tell her  ive cabled them all said uncle john theyre entitled to know that their kidiwinkles are in good shape  the evening was a tedious one although they tried to enliven it with a game of bridge in which uncle john and louise were quite proficient and the others dreadfully incompetent once in a while the volcano thundered a deep detonation that caused the windows to shiver but the americans were getting used to the sound and paid little heed to it  in the morning the wind had shifted and although the air was still full of dust all nearby objects were clearly visible and even the outline of vesuvius could be seen sending skyward its pillar of black smoke  colonel angeli appeared soon after breakfast his uniform fresh and bright and his boyish face beaming as pleasantly as ever  vesuvio is better said he but the rascal has badly acted and done much harm to our poor people like herculaneum our boscatrecase is covered with lava like pompeii our ottajano is buried in ashes let me advise you today go to sorrento and there stay for a time until we can the dust brush from our streets and prepare to welcome you with the comfort more serene i must myself ride to the villages that are suffering my men are already gone with the redcross corps to succor whom they can i will send to you word when you may return just now should you stay you will be able to see nothing at all  i believe that is wise counsel replied uncle john  sorrento has no ashes continued the colonel and from there you may watch the volcano better than from naples today come the duke and duchess daosta to render assistance to the homeless and hungry tomorrow his majesty the king will be here to discover what damage has been caused alas we have no sackcloth but we are in ashes i trust you will pardon my poor naples for her present inhospitality  sure thing said uncle john the city may be under a cloud but her people are the right stuff and we are greatly obliged to you for all your kindness to us  but that is so little said the colonel deprecatingly  they decided to leave their heavy baggage at the hotel du vesuve and carried only their suitcases and light luggage aboard the little steamer that was bound across the bay for sorrento the decks were thronged with people as eager to get away from the stricken city as were our friends and uncle john was only enabled to secure seats for his girls by bribing a steward so heavily that even that modern brigand was amazed at his good fortune  the ride was short but very interesting for they passed under the shadow of the smoking mountain and came into a fresh sweet atmosphere that was guiltless of a speck of the disagreeable lava dust that had so long annoyed them the high bluffs of sorrento with their picturesque villas and big hotels seemed traced in burnished silver by the strong sunshine and every member of uncle johns party was glad that colonel angeli had suggested this pleasant change of condition  small boats took them ashore and an elevator carried them swiftly to the top of the cliff and deposited them on the terrace of the victoria a beautiful inn that nestled in a garden brilliant with splendid flowers and shrubbery here they speedily established themselves preparing to enjoy their first real experience of sunny italy     chapter ix  count ferralti   at dinner it was announced that the famous tarantella would be danced in the lower hall of the hotel at nine oclock and the girls told uncle john that they must not miss this famous sight which is one of the most unique in sorrento or indeed in all italy  as they entered the pretty circular hall devoted to the dance louise gave a start of surprise a goodly audience had already assembled in the room and among them the girl seemed to recognize an acquaintance for after a brief hesitation she advanced and placed her hand in that of a gentleman who had risen on her entrance and hastened toward her  he was a nice looking young fellow beth thought and had a foreign and quite distinguished air  presently louise turned with cheeks somewhat flushed and brought the gentleman to her party introducing him to uncle john and her cousins as count ferralti whom she had once met in new york while he was on a visit to america  the count twirled his small and slender moustaches in a way that patsy thought affected and said in excellent english  it delights me to meet mr merrick and the young ladies may i express a hope that you are pleased with my beautiful country  are you italian asked uncle john regarding the young man critically  surely mr merrick but i have resided much in new york and may well claim to be an adopted son of your great city  new york adopts a good many said uncle john drily it has even been thoughtless enough to adopt me  the dancers entered at that moment and the americans were forced to seat themselves hastily so as not to obstruct the view of others count ferralti found a place beside louise but seemed to have little to say to her during the course of the entertainment  the dances were unique and graceful being executed by a troup of laughing peasants dressed in native costume who seemed very proud of their accomplishment and anxious to please the throng of tourists present the tarantella originated in ischia but sorrento and capri have the best dancers  afterward uncle john and his nieces stood upon the terrace and watched the volcano rolling its dense clouds mingled with sparks of redhot scoria toward the sky the count clung to louises side but also tried to make himself agreeable to her cousins in their rooms that night patsy told beth that the young foreigner was too highfalutin to suit her and beth replied that his manners were so like those of their cousin louise that the two ought to get along nicely together  uncle john liked his nieces to make friends and encouraged young men generally to meet them but there was something in the appearance of this callow italian nobleman that stamped his character as artificial and insincere he resolved to find out something about his antecedents before he permitted the young fellow to establish friendly relations with his girls  next morning after breakfast he wandered through the lobby and paused at the little office where he discovered that the proprietor of this hotel was a brother of that floriano who managed the hotel du vesuve that gave him an excuse to talk with the man who spoke very good english and was exceedingly courteous to his guestsespecially when they were american  i see you have count ferralti with you remarked uncle john  whom sir  ferralticount ferralti the young man standing by the window yonder  ii did not know he said hesitatingly the gentleman arrived last evening and i had not yet learned his name let me see he turned to his list of guests who register by card and not in a book and continued ah yes he has given his name as ferralti but added no title a count did you say  yes replied uncle john  the proprietor looked curiously toward the young man whose back only was visible then he remarked that the eruption of vesuvius was waning and the trouble nearly over for this time  are the ferraltis a good family asked uncle john abruptly  that i cannot tell you signor merrick  oh perhaps you know little about the nobility of your country  i i know little of the nobility answered floriano indignantly my dear signor there is no man better posted as to our nobility in all italy  yet you say you dont know the ferralti family  the proprietor reached for a book that lay above his desk  observe signor here is our record of nobility it is the same as the blue book or the peerage of england either fortunately or unfortunatelyi cannot sayyou have no need of such a book in america  he turned the pages and ran his finger down the line of fs  find me if you can a count ferralti in the list  uncle john looked he put on his glasses and looked again the name of ferralti was no place in the record  then there is no such count signor floriano  and no such noble family signor merrick  uncle john whistled softly and walked away to the window the young man greeted him with a smile and a bow  i misunderstood your name last evening he said i thought you were count ferralti  and that is right sir was the prompt reply allow me to offer you my card  uncle john took the card and read       conte leonardi ferralti                      milano italia  he carefully placed the card in his pocketbook  thank you said he its a fine morning count  charming mr merrick  uncle john walked away he was glad that he had not suspected the young man unjustly when an imposture is unmasked it is no longer dangerous  he joined his nieces who were all busily engaged in writing letters home and remarked casually  youve been deceived in your italian friend louise he is neither a count nor of noble family although i suppose when you met him in new york he had an object in posing as a titled aristocrat  the girl paused examining the point of her pen thoughtfully  are you sure uncle john  quite sure my dear ive just been through the list of italian counts and his name is not there floriano the proprietor who knows every aristocrat in italy has never before heard of him  how singular exclaimed louise i wonder why he has tried to deceive us  oh the world is full of impostors but when you are on to their game they are quite harmless of course we wont encourage this young man in any way it will be better to avoid him  hehe seems very nice and gentlemanly said louise with hesitation  the other girls exchanged glances but made no remark uncle john hardly knew what to say further he felt he was in an awkward position for louise was the most experienced in worldly ways of his three nieces and he had no desire to pose as a stern guardian or to deprive his girls of any passing pleasure they might enjoy moreover louise being in love with that young weldon her mother so strongly objected to she would not be likely to care much for this italian fellow and mrs merrick had enjoined him to keep her daughters mind from dwelling on her entanglement  oh well my dear he said to her you must act as you see fit i do not imagine we shall see much of this young man in any event and now that you are well aware of the fact that he is sailing under false colors you will know how to handle him better than i can advise you  i shall be very careful said louise slowly as she resumed her writing  well then girls what do you say to a stroll around the village asked their uncle im told its a proper place to buy silk stockings and inlaid woodwork they come assorted i suppose  beth and patsy jumped up with alacrity but louise pleaded that she had several more letters to write so the others left her and passed the rest of the forenoon in rummaging among the quaint shops of sorrento staring at the statue of tasso and enjoying the street scenes so vividly opposed to those of america it was almost their first glimpse of foreign manners and customs in naples they had as yet seen nothing but darkness and falling ashes     chapter x  the road to amalfi   the hotel victoria faces the bay of naples back of it are the famous gardens and as you emerge from these you find yourself upon the narrow main street of sorrento not far from the square of tasso  as our little party entered this street they were immediately espied by the vetturini or cabmen who rushed toward them with loud cries while they waved their whips frantically to attract attention one tall fellow was dressed in a most imposing uniform of blue and gold with a high hat bearing a cockade a la inglese and shiny top boots his long legs enabled him to outstrip the others and in an almost breathless voice he begged uncle john to choose his carriage the besta carrozza ina town  we dont want to ride was the answer  the cabman implored certainly they must make the amalfi drive or to massa lubrense or saint agata or at least il deserto the others stood by to listen silently to the discussion yielding first place to the victor in the race  uncle john was obdurate  all we want today is to see the town he declared were not going to ride but walk  ah but the amalfi road signore surely you will see that  tomorrow perhaps not now  tomorrow signore it is good at what hour tomorrow illustrissimo  oh dont bother me  we may as well drive to amalfi tomorrow suggested beth it is the proper thing to do uncle  all right well go then  you take my carrozza signore begged the cabman it is besta ina town  let us see it  instantly the crowd scampered back to the square followed more leisurely by uncle john and the girls there the uniformed vetturio stood beside the one modern carriage in the group it was new it was glossy it had beautiful carefully brushed cushions it was drawn by a pair of splendid looking horses  is not bellissima signore asked the man proudly  all right announced uncle john nodding approval be ready to start at nine oclock tomorrow morning  the man promised whereat his confreres lost all interest in the matter and the strangers were allowed to proceed without further interruption  they found out all about the amalfi drive that evening and were glad indeed they had decided to go even louise was pleased at the arrangement and as eager as the others to make the trip it is one of the most famous drives in the world along a road built upon the rocky cliff that overhangs the sea and continually winds in and out as it follows the outlines of the crags  they had an early breakfast and were ready at nine oclock but when they came to the gate of the garden they found only a dilapidated carriage standing before it  do you know where my rig is uncle john asked the driver at the same time peering up and down the road  it is me sir signore i am engage by you is it not so  mr merrick looked at the driver carefully it was longlegs sure enough but shorn of his beautiful regalia  wheres your uniform he asked  ah i have leave it home the road is dusty very i must not ruin a nice dress when i work answered the man smiling unabashed  but the carriage what has become of the fine carriage and the good horses sir  ah it is dreadful it is horrible signore i find me the carrozza is not easy it is not perfect it do not remain good for a long ride so i leave him home for i am kind i do not wish the signorini bella to tire and weep but see the fine vetture you now have is he not easy like feathers an strong an molto buena  it may be a bird but it dont look it said uncle john doubtfully i rented the best looking rig in town and you bring me the worst  only try signore others may look it is only you who must ride you will be much please when we return  well i suppose we may as well take it said the little man in a resigned tone hop in my dears  they entered the crazy looking vehicle and found the seats ample and comfortable despite the appearance of dilapidation everywhere prevalent the driver mounted the box cracked his whip and the lean nags ambled away at a fair pace  they passed near to the square where the first thing that attracted uncle johns attention was the beautiful turnout he had hired yesterday it was standing just as it had before and beside it was another man dressed in the splendid uniform his driver had claimed that he had left at home  herestop stop i say he yelled at the man angrily but the fellow seemed suddenly deaf and paid no heed he cracked his whip and rattled away through the streets without a glance behind him the girls laughed and uncle john stopped waving his arms and settled into his seat with a groan  weve been swindled my dears he said swindled most beautifully but i suppose we may as well make the best of it  better agreed patsy this rig is all right uncle it may not be as pretty as the other but i expect that one is only kept to make engagements with when it comes to actual use we dont get it  thats true enough he returned but ill get even with this rascal before ive done with him never fear  it was a cold raw morning but the portiere at the victoria had told them the sun would be out presently and the day become more genial indeed the sun did come out but only to give a discouraged look at the landscape and retire again during this one day in which they rode to amalfi and back uncle john afterward declared that they experienced seven different kinds of weather they had sunshine rain hail snow and a tornado and then rain again and more sunshine sunny italy seemed a misnomer that day as indeed it does many days in winter and spring when the climate is little better than that prevailing in the eastern and central portions of the united states and perhaps one suffers more in italy than in america owing to the general lack of means to keep warm on cold days the italian shivering and blue will tell you it is not cold at all for he will permit no reproach to lie on his beloved land but the traveller frequently becomes discouraged and the american contingent especially blames those misleading english writers who finding relief from their own bleak island in italian climes exaggerated the conditions by apostrophizing the country as sunny italy and for more than a century uttered such rhapsodies in its praise that the whole world credited themuntil it acquired personal experience of the matter  italy is beautiful it is charming and delightful but seldom is this true in winter or early spring  the horses went along at a spanking pace that was astonishing they passed through the picturesque lanes of sorrento climbed the further slope and brought the carriage to the other side of the peninsula where the girls obtained their first view of the gulf of salerno with the lovely isles of the sirens lying just beneath them  and now they were on the great road that skirts the coast as far as salerno and has no duplicate in all the known world for it is cut from the solid rock of precipitous cliffs rising straight from the sea which the highway overhangs at an average height of five hundred feet the traveller being protected only by a low stone parapet from the vast gulf that yawns beneath and on the other side of the road the cliffs continue to ascend a like distance toward the sky their irregular surfaces dotted with wonderful houses that cling to the slopes and vineyards that look as though they might slip down at any moment upon the heads of timorous pilgrims  when it rained they put up the carriage top which afforded but partial shelter the shower was brief but was shortly followed by hail as big as peas which threatened to dash in the frail roof of their carrozza while they shrank huddled beneath the blankets the sun came out suddenly and the driver shed his leathern apron cracked his whip and began singing merrily as the vehicle rolled over the smooth road  our travellers breathed again and prepared to enjoy once more the wonderful vistas that were unfolded at every turn of the winding way sometimes they skirted a little cove where hundreds of feet below the fishermen sat before their tiny huts busily mending their nets from that distance the boats drawn upon the sheltered beach seemed like mere toys then they would span a chasm on a narrow stone bridge or plunge through an arch dividing the solid mountain but ever the road returned in a brief space to the edge of the seacliff and everywhere it was solid as the hills themselves and seemingly as secure  they had just sighted the ancient town of positano and were circling a gigantic point of rock when the great adventure of the day overtook them without warning the wind came whistling around them in a great gale which speedily increased in fury until it drove the blinded horses reeling against the low parapet and pushed upon the carriage as if determined to dash it over the precipice  as it collided against the stone wall the vehicle tipped dangerously hurling the driver from his seat to dive headforemost into the space beneath but the man clung to the reins desperately and they arrested his fall leaving him dangling at the end of them while the maddened horses jerked at the bits by the weight of the man reared and plunged as if they would in any instant tumble themselves and the carriage over the cliff  at this critical moment a mounted horseman who unobserved had been following the party dashed to their rescue the rider caught the plunging steeds by their heads and tried to restrain their terror at his own eminent peril while the carriage lay wedged against the wall and the driver screamed pitifully from his dangerous position midway between sea and sky  then beth slipped from her seat to the flat top of the parapet stepped boldly to where the reins were pulling upon the terrified horses and seized them in her strong grasp  hold fast she called calmly to the driver and began dragging him upward inch by inch  he understood instantly the task she had undertaken and in a moment his courage returned and he managed to get his foot in a crack of the rock and assist her by relieving her of part of his weight just above was a slight ledge he could reach it now and then she had him by the arm so that another instant found him clinging to the parapet and drawing himself into a position of safety  the wind had died away as suddenly as it came upon them the horses as soon as the strain upon their bits was relaxed were easily quieted before those in the carriage had quite realized what had occurred the adventure was accomplished the peril was past and all was well again  uncle john leaped from the carriage followed by louise and patsy the young horseman who had come to their assistance so opportunely was none other than count ferralti whom they had such good reason to distrust he was sitting upon his horse and staring with amazement at beth at whose feet the driver was grovelling while tears flowed down his bronzed cheeks and he protested in an absurd mixture of english and italian by every saint in the calendar that the girl had saved him from a frightful death and he would devote his future life to her service  it is wonderful murmured ferralti however could such a slip of a girl do so great a deed  why its nothing at all returned beth flushing were trained to do such things in the gymnasium at cloverton and im much stronger than i appear to be  twas her head mostly said patsy giving her cousin an admiring hug she kept her wits while the rest of us were scared to death  uncle john had been observing the count one of the young mans hands hung limp and helpless  are you hurt sir he asked  ferralti smiled and his eyes rested upon louise  a little perhaps mr merrick but it is unimportant the horses were frantic at the time and wrenched my wrist viciously as i tried to hold them i felt something snap a small bone perhaps but i am sure it is nothing of moment  wed better get back to sorrento said uncle john abruptly  not on my account i beg of you returned ferralti quickly we are half way to amalfi now and you may as well go on for my part if the wrist troubles me i will see a surgeon at amalfithat is if you permit me to accompany you  he said this with a defferent bow and a glance of inquiry  uncle john could not well refuse the young fellow might be a sham count but the manliness and courage he had displayed in their grave emergency surely entitled him to their grateful consideration  you are quite welcome to join us said uncle john  the driver had by now repaired a broken strap and found his equippage otherwise uninjured  the horses stood meekly quiescent as if they had never known a moments fear in their lives so the girls and their uncle climbed into the vehicle again and the driver mounted the box and cracked his whip with his usual vigor  the wind had subsided as suddenly as it had arisen and as they passed through positanowhich is four hundred feet high the houses all up and down the side of a cliff like swallows nestsbig flakes of snow were gently falling around them  count ferralti rode at the side of the carriage but did not attempt much conversation his lips were tight set and the girls slyly observing his face were sure his wrist was hurting him much more than he cared to acknowledge  circling around the cliff beyond positano the sun greeted them shining from out a blue sky and they wondered what had become of the bad weather they had so lately experienced  from now on past prajano and into amalfi the day was brilliant and the temperature delightful it was full noon by the time they alighted at the little gatehouse of the ancient cappucciniconvento now a hotel much favored by the tourist count ferralti promised to join them later and rode on to the town to find a surgeon to look after his injured hand while the others slowly mounted the long inclines leading in a zigzag fashion up to the old monastery which was founded in the year 1212  from the arbored veranda of this charming retreat is obtained one of the finest views in europe and while the girls sat enjoying it uncle john arranged with a pleasant faced woman who had once lived in america for their luncheon  an hour later and just as they were sitting down to the meal count ferralti rejoined them his hand was bandaged and supported by a sling and in answer to louises gentle inquiries he said simply  it was as i had feared a small bone snapped but my surgeon is skillful and says time will mend the wrist as good as new  in spite of his courage he could eat no luncheon but merely sipped a glass of wine so uncle john alarmed at his pallor insisted that he take a seat in the carriage on the return journey beth wanted to ride the counts horse home but there was no side saddle to be had so they led the animal by a halter fastened behind the ricketty carriage and beth mounted the box and rode beside her friend the driver  the pleasant weather lasted until they neared sorrento when another shower of rain came up they reached their hotel damp and bedraggled but enthusiastic over their wonderful trip and the interesting adventure it had incidentally developed     chapter xi  the eagle screams   despite the glories of the amalfi road our tourists decided it was more pleasant to loiter around sorrento for a time than to undertake further excursions the mornings and evenings were chill but during the middle of the day the air was warm and delicious so the girls carried their books and fancywork into the beautiful gardens or wandered lazily through the highwalled lanes that shut in the villas and orange groves sometimes they found a gate open and were welcomed to the orchards and permitted to pluck freely the fragrant and rich flavored fruit which is excelled in no other section of the south country also uncle john with beth and patsy frequented the shops of the woodworkers and watched their delicate and busy fingers inlaying the various colored woods but louise mostly kept to the garden where count ferralti being a semiinvalid was content to sit by her side and amuse her  in spite of her uncles discovery of the false position assumed by this young man louise seemed to like his attentions and to approve his evident admiration for her his ways might be affected and effeminate and his conversational powers indifferent but his bandaged wrist was a constant reminder to all the nieces that he possessed courage and ready wit and it was but natural that he became more interesting to them because just now he was to an extent helpless and his crippled hand had been acquired in their service  uncle john watched the young fellow shrewdly but could discover little harm in him except his attempt to deceive them in regard to his name and position yet in his mature eyes there was not much about ferralti to arouse admiration and the little man considered his girls too sensible to be greatly impressed by this youthful italians personality so he allowed him to sit with his nieces in the gardens as much as he pleased believing it would be ungrateful to deprive the count of that harmless recreation  a reglar chaperone might think differently he reflected but thank goodness there are no dragons swimming in our cup of happiness  one day they devoted to capri and the blue grotto and afterward they lunched at the quisisana and passed the afternoon in the town but the charms of sorrento were too great for capri to win their allegiance and they were glad to get back to their quaint town and delightful gardens again  the week passed all too swiftly and then came a letter from colonel angeli telling them to return to naples and witness the results of the eruption this they decided to do and bidding goodbye to signor floriano and his excellent hotel they steamed across the bay and found the vesuve a vastly different hostelry from the dismal place they had left in their flight from naples it was now teeming with life for all danger being past the tourists had flocked to the city in droves the town was still covered with ashes but under the brilliant sunshine it did not look as gloomy as one might imagine and already thousands of carts were busily gathering the dust from the streets and dumping it in the waters of the bay it would require months of hard work though before naples could regain a semblance of its former beauty  their friend the colonel personally accompanied them to the towns that had suffered the most from the eruption at boscatrecasa they walked over the great beds of lava that had demolished the townbanks of cinders looking like lumps of pumice stone and massed from twenty to thirty feet in thickness throughout the valley the lava was still so hot that it was liable to blister the soles of their feet unless they kept constantly moving it would be many more days before the interior of the mass became cold  through the forlorn dustcovered vineyards they drove to san guiseppe where a church roof had fallen in and killed one hundred and forty people maiming many more the redcross tents were pitched in the streets and the whole town was one vast hospital ottajano a little nearer to the volcano had been buried in scoria and ninetenths of the roofs had fallen in rendering the dwellings untenable  from here a clear view of mt vesuvius could be obtained the shape of the mountain had greatly altered and the cone had lost sixtyfive feet of its altitude but when one gazed upon the enormous bulk of volcanic deposit that littered the country for miles around it seemed to equal a dozen mountains the size of vesuvius the marvel was that so much ashes and cinders could come from a single crater in so short a period  naples was cleaning house but slowly and listlessly the people seemed as cheerful and lighthearted as ever the volcano was one of their crosses and they bore it patiently the theatres would remain closed for some weeks to come but the great museo nationale was open and uncle john and his nieces were much interested in the bronze and marble statuary that here form the greatest single collection in all the world  it was at the museum that mr merrick was arrested for the first time in his life an experience he never afterward forgot  bad money is so common in naples that uncle john never accepted any change from anyone but obtained all his silver coins and notes directly from the banca commerciale italiana a government institution one morning he drove with the girls to the museum and paid the cabman a lira but before he could ascend the steps the man was after him and holding out a leaden coin claiming that his fare had given him bad money and must exchange it for good this is so common a method of swindling that uncle john paid no heed to the demands of the cabman until one of the guard municipale in his uniform of dark blue with yellow buttons and cap placed a restraining hand upon the americans shoulder  uncle john angrily shook him off but the man persisted and an interpreter employed by the museum stepped forward and explained that unless the cabman was given a good coin in exchange for the bad one the guarde would be obliged to take him before a commissionaire or magistrate  but i gave him a good coina lira direct from the bank declared uncle john  he exhibits a bad one returned the interpreter calmly  hes a swindler  he is a citizen of naples and entitled to a just payment said the other shrugging his shoulders  you are all leagued together said uncle john indignantly but you will get no more money out of me i promise you  the result was that the stubborn american was placed under arrest leaving the girls at the museum in charge of ferralti who had made no attempt to interfere in the dispute but implored uncle john to pay and avoid trouble the angry prisoner was placed in the same cab he had arrived in and with the officer seated beside him was publicly driven to the office of the magistrate  this official understood no english but he glowered and frowned fiercely when the american was brought before him the guarde and the cabman stood with bared bowed heads and in low tones preferred the charge against the prisoner but uncle john swaggered up to the desk and pounded his clinched fist upon it while he roared a defiance of italian injustice and threatened to bring over a few warships and blow naples into kingdom come  the magistrate was startled and ordered the prisoner searched for concealed weapons uncle john doubled his fists and dared the guarde to touch him  then the cabman was dispatched for someone who could speak english and when an interpreter arrived the american told him to send for the united states consul and also to inform the magistrate that nothing but war between america and italy could wipe out the affront that had been thrust upon him  the magistrate was disturbed and preferred not to send for the consul he offered to release uncle john if he would give the cabman a good lira in exchange for the bad one the official fee would be five liraor say three liraor even two uncle john flatly refused to pay anything to anybody only war could settle this international complicationbloody and bitter war the consul must cable at once for warships and troops he would insist upon it all compromise was now impossible  the magistrate was frightened the guardes eyes bulged with horror and he trembled visibly it was evident they had made a grave mistake in arresting this mad american who was evidently a personage of great importance and able to declare war at a moments notice the cabman the magistrate the guarde and the interpreter put their heads together and chattered voluble italianall speaking at once in excited toneswhile uncle john continued to warn them at the top of his lungs that their country was doomed to sudden annihilation and they were the culprits responsible for the coming calamity  as a result they bundled the irate american into the carriage again and drove him poste haste back to the museum where they deposited him upon the steps then in a flash the guarde and the cabman disappeared from sight and were seen no more  the victor smiled proudly as his nieces rushed toward him  did you have to pay another lira uncle asked patsy anxiously  not on your life my dear mopping his brow vigorously theyre a lot of cutthroats and assassinspolicemen magistrates and allbut when the eagle screams theyre wise enough to duck  the girls laughed  and did the eagle scream then patsy enquired  just a little my dear but if it whispered it would sound mighty loud in this mummified old world but weve lost enough time for one day come lets go see narcissus and the dancing faun     chapter xii  moving on   heres a letter from my dear old friend silas watson said uncle john delightedly its from palermo where he has been staying with his wardand your friend girlskenneth forbes and he wants me to lug you all over to sicily at once  thats jolly said patsy with a bright smile id like to see kenneth again  i suppose he is a great artist by this time said beth musingly  how singular exclaimed louise count ferralti told me only this morning that he had decided to go to palermo  really said uncle john  yes uncle isnt it a coincidence  why as for that he answered slowly im afraid it will prevent our seeing the dear countor whatever he isagain at least for some time for mr watson and kenneth are just leaving palermo and he asks us to meet him in another place altogether a town calledcalledlet me see tormenti or terminal or something  give me the letter dear said patsy i dont believe its terminal at all of course not consulting the pages its taormina  is that in sicily he asked  yes listen to what mr watson says im told it is the most beautiful spot in the world which is the same thing you hear about most beautiful places it is eight hundred feet above the mediterranean and nestles peacefully in the shadow of mount etna  etna cried uncle john with a start isnt that another volcano  to be sure said beth the geographer etna is the biggest volcano in the world  does it spout he asked anxiously  all the time they say but it is not usually dangerous  the proper thing when you go to europe declared uncle john positively is to do venice where the turpentine comes from and switzerland where they make chocolate and goats milk and paris and monte carlo where they kick high and melt pearls in champagne everybody knows that thats what goin to europe really means but sicily isnt on the programme that i ever heard of so well just tell silas watson that well see him laterwhich means when we get home again  but sicily is beautiful protested patsy id as soon go there as anywhere  its a very romantic place added louise reflectively  everybody goes to france and switzerland remarked beth but its because they dont know any better lets be original uncle and keep out of the beaten track of travel  but the volcano exclaimed mr merrick is it necessary to stick to volcanoes to be original  etna wont hurt us im sure said patsy  isnt there a greek theatre at taormina asked louise  ive never heard of it but i suppose the greeks have if its there he replied but why not wait till we get home and then go to kieths or hammersteins  you dont understand dear this theatre is very ancient  playing minstrel shows in it yet i suppose well girls if you say sicily sicily it is all im after is to give you a good time and if you get the volcano habit it isnt my fault  it is possible the count said taormina instead of palermo remarked louise plaintively i wasnt paying much attention at the time ill ask him  the others ignored this suggestion said patsy to her uncle  when do we go sir  whenever you like my dears  then i vote to move on at once decided the girl weve got the best out of naples and its pretty grimey here yet  the other nieces agreed with her so uncle john went out to enquire the best way to get to sicily and to make their arrangements  the steamer victor emmanuel of the navigazione general italiana line was due to leave naples for messina the next evening arriving at its destination the following morning uncle john promptly booked places the intervening day was spent in packing and preparing for the journey and like all travellers the girls were full of eager excitement at the prospect of seeing something new  im told sicily is an island grumbled uncle john here we are on a trip to europe and emigrating to an island the first thing we do  sicily is europe all right uncle answered patsy at least it isnt asia or africa  that assertion seemed to console him a little and he grew cheerful again  the evening was beautiful as they embarked but soon after leaving the bay the little tubshaped steamer began to tumble and toss vigorously so that all the passengers aboard speedily sought their berths  uncle john found himself in a stuffy little cabin that smelled of tar and various other flavors that were too mixed to be recognizable as a result he passed one of the most miserable nights of his life  toward morning he rolled out and dressed himself preferring the deck to his bed and the first breath of salt air did much to restore him day was just breaking and to the right he could see a tongue of fire flaming against the dark sky  what is that sir he enquired of an officer who passed  that is stromboli signor the great volcano of lipari it is always in eruption  uncle john groaned  volcanoes to right of us volcanoes to left of us volleyed and thundered he muttered dismally as he fell back in his chair  the sky brightened and the breath of the breeze changed and came to him laden with delicious fragrance  see signore called the officer passing again before us is mighty etnayou can see it clearly from the bow  volcanoes in front of us volcanoes behind us wailed the little man but he walked to the bow and saw the shores of sicily looming in advance with the outline of the stately mountain rising above and dominating it  then the sun burst forth flooding all with a golden radiance that was magical in its gorgeous effects patsy came on deck and stood beside her uncle lost in rapturous admiration beth soon followed her  before long they entered the straits of messina and passed between the classic rock of scylla on the calabrian coast and the whirlpool of charybdis at the point of the promontory of faro which forms the end of the famous golden sickle enclosing the bay of messina  if this is really europe im glad we came said uncle john drawing a long breath as the ship came to anchor opposite the palazzo municipale i dont remember seeing anything prettier since we left new york  presently they had loaded their trunks and hand baggage and incidentally themselves into the boat of the hotel trinacria which came alongside in charge of a sleepy porter after a brief examination at the customhouse where uncle john denied having either sugar tobacco or perfumery they followed on foot the truck laden with their worldly possessions and soon reached the hotel  a pleasant breakfast followed which they ate before a window overlooking the busy marina and then they drove about the town for a time to see in a casual way the sights in the afternoon they took the train for taormina messina seemed a delightful place but if they were going to settle in taormina for a time it would not pay them to unpack or linger on the way  so they rolled along the coast for a couple of hours in a quaint oldfashioned railway carriage and were then deposited upon the platform of the little station at giardini  im afraid there has been a mistake said the little man gazing around him anxiously theres no town here and i told the guard to put us off at taorminanot this forlorn place  just then beth discovered a line of carriages drawn up back of the station the drivers were mostly asleep inside them although several stood in a group arguing in fluent italian the grave question as to whether signora ganis cow had a black patch over its left shoulder or not  some of the carriages bore signs hotel timeo grand hotel san domenico hotel castelloamare grand hotel metropole and so forth in that of the castelloamare the man was awakening and rubbing his eyes uncle john said to him  good morning had a nice rest  i thank you signore i am well refreshed was the reply  by the way can you tell us where the town of taormina is i hate to trouble you but wed like to know  the man waved an arm upward and following the motion with their eyes they saw a line of precipitous cliffs that seemed impossible to scale  do you desire to go to the grand hotel castelloamare enquired the driver politely  is it in taormina  most certainly signore  and you will take us  with pleasure signore  oh i didnt know i supposed you were going to sleep again  the man looked at him reproachfully  it is my business signore i am very attentive to my duties if you permit me to drive you to our splendideour magnifico hotelyou will confer a favor  how about the baggage  the trunks signor we will send for later there is really no hurry about them the small baggage will accompany us you will remark how excellent is my english i am frascatti vietri perhaps you have heard of me in america  if i have it has escaped my memory said uncle john gravely  have you been to america asked beth  surely signorina i lived in chicago which as you are aware is america my uncle had a fruit shop in south water a via which is chicago is it not so you will find few in taormina who can the english speak and none at all who can so perfectly speak it as frascatti vietri  you are wonderful said patsy delighted with him but uncle john grew impatient to be off  i hate to interrupt you mr vietri he hinted but if you can spare the time we may as well make a start  the driver consented he gracefully swung the suitcases and travelling bags to the top of the vehicle and held the door open while his fares entered then he mounted to his seat took the reins and spoke to the horses some of the other drivers nodded at him cheerfully but more as if they were sorry he must exert himself than with any resentment at his success in getting the only tourists who had alighted from the train  as they moved away uncle john said observe the difference between the cabdrivers here and those at home in america they fight like beasts to get a job here they seem anxious to avoid earning an honest penny if there could be a happy medium somewhere id like it  are we going to the best hotel asked louise who had seemed a trifle disconsolate because she had not seen count ferralti since leaving naples  i dont know my dear it wasnt a question of choice but of necessity no other hotel seemed willing to receive us  they were now winding upward over a wonderful road cut in the solid rock it was broad and smooth and protected by a parapet of dressed limestone now and then they passed pleasant villas set in orchards of golden oranges or groves of olives and almonds but there was no sign of life on any side  the road was zigzag making a long ascent across the face of the cape then turning abruptly to wind back again but always creeping upward until an open space showed the station far below and a rambling stone building at the edge of the cliff far above  behold cried frascatti pointing up the grand hotel castelloamare is it not the excellenza location  has it a roof asked uncle john critically  of a certainty signore but it does not show from below was the grave reply  at times frascatti stopped his horses to allow them to rest and then he would turn in his seat to address his passengers in the open victoria and descant upon the beauties of the panorama each turn unfolded  this road is new said he because we are very progressive and the old road was most difficulty then it was three hours from the bottom to the top now it is but a short hour for our energy climbs the three miles in that brief time shall i stop here for the sunset or will your excellenzi hasten on  if your energy approves we will hasten returned uncle john we love a sunset because its bound to set anyway and we may as well make the best of it but we have likewise an objection to being out after dark any brigands around here  brigands ah the signor is merry never since the days of naxos have brigands infested our fair country  when were the days of naxos  some centuries before christ signor bowing his head and making the sign of the cross  very good the brigands of those days must of course be dead by this time now sir when you have leisure let us hasten  the horses started and crept slowly upward again none of the party was in a hurry such beautiful glimpses of scenery were constantly visible from the bends of the road that the girls were enraptured and could have ridden for hours in this glorious fairyland  but suddenly the horses broke into a trot and dragged the carriage rapidly forward over the last incline a moment later they dashed into the court of the hotel and the driver with a loud cry of ooah and a crack of his whip drew up before the entrance  the portiere and the padrone or landlordthe latter being also the proprietairecame out to greet them extending to their guests a courteous welcome the house was very full all of the cheaper rooms were taken but of course the signor americain would wish only the best and be glad to pay  uncle john requested them to rob him as modestly as possible without conflicting with their sense of duty and they assured him they would do so  the rooms were adorable they faced the sea and had little balconies that gave one a view of the blue mediterranean far beneath with lovely isola bella and the capo san andrea nestling on its bosom to the right towered the majestic peak of etna its crest just now golden red in the dying sunset  the girls drew in deep breaths and stood silent in a very ecstacy of delight at their feet was a terraced garden running downward two hundred feet to where the crag fell sheer to the sea it was glorious with blooming flowers of every sort that grows and the people on the balconies imagined at the moment they had been transferred to an earthly paradise too fair and sweet for ordinary mortals and then the glow of the sun faded softly and twilight took its place far down the winding road could be seen the train of carriages returning from the station the vetturini singing their native songs as the horses slowly ascended the slope an unseen organ somewhere in the distance ground out a neapolitan folk song and fresh and youthful voices sang a clear high toned accompaniment  even practical uncle john stood absorbed and admiring until the soft voice of the facchino called to ask if he wanted hot water in which to bathe before dinner  its no use said patsy smiling at him from the next balcony with tears in her eyes theres not another taormina on earth here we are and here we stay until we have to go home again  but my dear think of paris of venice of  ill think of nothing but this uncle john unless you settle down with us here ill turn milkmaid and live all my days in sicily  beth laughed and drew her into their room  dont be silly patsy dear she said calmly although almost as greatly affected as her cousin there are no cows here so you cant be a milkmaid  cant i milk the goats then  why the men seem to do that dear but cheer up weve only seen the romance of taormina yet doubtless it will be commonplace enough tomorrow     chapter xiii  il duca   beths prediction however did not come true the morning discovered nothing commonplace about taormina their hotel was outside the walls but a brief walk took them to the messina gate a quaint archway through which they passed into the narrow streets of one of the oldest towns in sicily doorways and windows of saracen or norman construction faced them on every side and every inch of the ancient buildings was picturesque and charming  some of the houses had been turned into shops mostly for the sale of curios uncle john and his nieces had scarcely passed a hundred yards into the town when one of these shops arrested their attention it was full of antique jewelry antique furniture antique laces and antique potteryall of the most fascinating description the jewelry was tarnished and broken the lace had holes in it and the furniture was decrepit and unsteady but the proprietor cared nothing for such defects all was very old and he knew the tourist was eager to buy so he scattered his wares inside and outside his salesroom much as the spider spreads his web for the unwary and waited for the inevitable tourist with a desire to acquire something ancient and useless  the girls could not be induced to pass the shop they entered the square low room and flooded the shopman with eager questions notwithstanding frascattis assertion that few in taormina could speak english this man was quite intelligible and fixed his prices according to the impression his wares made upon the artistic sense of the young american ladies  it was while they were intently inspecting some laces that the proprietor suddenly paused in his chatter removed his hat and bowed almost to the floor his face assuming at the same time a serious and most humble expression  turning around they saw standing outside the door a man whom they recognized at once as their fellow passenger aboard the princess irene  oh signor valdi cried patsy running toward him how strange to find you again in this outoftheway place  the italian frowned but in a dignified manner took the hand of all three girls in turn and then bowed a greeting to mr merrick  uncle john thought the fellow had improved in appearance instead of the flannel shirt and prince albert coat he had affected on shipboard he now wore a native costume of faded velvet while a cloak of thin but voluminous cloth swung from his shoulders and a soft felt hat shaded his dark eyes  his appearance was entirely in keeping with the place and the american noticed that the villagers who passed doffed their hats most respectfully to this seemingly wellknown individual but mingled with their polite deference was a shyness half fearful and none stopped to speak but hurried silently on  and how do we happen to find you here signor valdi patsy was saying do you live in taormina  i am of this district but not of taormina he replied it is chance that you see me here eh signor bruggi is it not so casting one of his characteristic fierce glances at the shopkeeper  it is so your excellency  but i am glad you have come to the shadow of etna he continued addressing the americans with slow deliberation here the grandeur of the world centers and life keeps time with nature you will like it you will stay  oh for a time anyway said patsy  we expect to meet some friends here explained uncle john they are coming down from palermo but must have been delayed somewhere on the way  who are they asked valdi brusquely  americans of course silas watson and kenneth forbes do you know of them  no said the other he cast an uneasy glance up and down the street i will meet you again signorini he added which is your hotel  the castelloamare it is delightful said beth  he nodded as if pleased then folding his cloak about him he murmured adios and stalked away without another word or look  queer fellow remarked uncle john  the shopkeeper drew a long breath and seemed relieved  il duca is unusual signore he replied  duke cried the girls in one voice  the man seemed startled  ii thought you knew him you seemed friends he stammered  we met signor valdi on shipboard said uncle john  valdi ah yes of course the duke has been to america  isnt his name valdi asked beth looking the man straight in the eyes has he another name here where he lives  the shopman hesitated  who knows was the evasive reply il duca has many names but we do not speak them when it is necessary to mention him we use his titlethe duke  why asked the girl  why signorina why perhaps because he does not like to be talked about yes that is it i am sure  where does he live asked patsy  the man seemed uneasy under so much questioning  somewhere in the mountains he said briefly his estates are there he is said to be very rich and powerful i know nothing more signorini  realizing that little additional information could be gleaned from this source they soon left the shop and wandered into the piazzo vittorio emanuele and from thence by the narrow lane to the famous teatro greco  for a time they admired this fascinating ruin which has the best preserved stage of any greek theatre now in existence from the top of the hill is one of the most magnificent views in sicily and here our travellers sat in contemplative awe until uncle john declared it was time to return to their hotel for luncheon  as they passed the portieres desk mr merrick paused to ask that important official  tell me if you please who is signor victor valdi  valdi signore  yes the duke di valdi i suppose you call him  i have never heard of him replied the man  but every one seems to know him in taormina  is it so we have but one duke near to us and he but never mind i do not know this valdi  a thin faced man with black eyes we met him on the steamer coming from america  the portiere dropped his eyes and turned toward his desk  luncheon is served signore he remarked also here is a letter for you which arrived this morning  uncle john took the letter and walked on to rejoin the girls  it seems hard work to find out anything about this valdi he said either the folks here do not know him or they wont acknowledge his acquaintance we may as well follow suit and avoid him  i dont like his looks a bit observed beth he seems afraid and defiant at the same time and his temper is dreadful it was only with great difficulty he could bring himself to be polite to us  oh i always got along with him all right said patsy im sure signor valdi isnt as bad as he appears and hes a duke too girlsa real duke  so it seems uncle john rejoined yet there is something queer about the fellow i agree with beth i dont like him  did mr watson say when he would join us here enquired louise when they were seated at the little round table  no but heres a letter from him id quite forgotten it  he tore open the envelope and carefully read the enclosure  too bad said he we might have stayed a few days in messina watson says he and kenneth have stopped at girgentiwherever that isto study the temples wonder if theyre solomons they wont get to taormina before saturday  it wont matter declared patsy so long as they arrive then and id a good deal rather be here than in messina or any other place of course well all be glad to see kenneth  mr watson wants us to be very careful while we are in sicily continued uncle john referring to the letter listen to this dont let the girls wear jewelry in public places or display their watches openly and take care all of you not to show much money if you buy anything have it sent to your hotel to be paid for by the hall porter and it is wise not to let anyone know who you are or how long you intend to remain in any one place this may strike you as an absurd precaution but you must remember that you are not in america but in an isolated italian province where government control is inefficient the truth is that the terrible mafia is still all powerful on this island and brigandage is by no means confined to the neighborhood of castrogiovanni as the guide books would have you believe the people seem simple and harmless enough but kenneth and i always keep our revolvers handy and believe it is a reasonable precaution i dont want to frighten you john merely to warn you sicily is full of tourists and few are ever molested but if you are aware of the conditions underlying the public serenity you are not so liable to run yourself and your nieces into needless dangers hows that for a haircurler girls  it sounds very romantic said louise smiling mr watson is such a cautious man  but its all rubbish about there being danger in taormina declared patsy indignantly mr watson has been in the wilds of the interior which baedecker admits is infested with brigands here everyone smiles at us in the friendliest way possible  except the duke added beth with a laugh  oh the duke is sour by nature patsy answered but if there really was danger im sure hed protect us for he lives here and knows the country  you are sure of a lot of things dear said her cousin smiling but it will do no harm to heed the advice and be careful  they all agreed to that and uncle john was glad to remember he had two brand new revolvers in the bottom of his trunk which he could use in an emergency if he could manage to find the cartridges to load them with  he got them out next morning and warned his nieces not to touch the dangerous things when they entered his room but patsy laughed at him saying  you are behind the times uncle beth has carried a revolver ever since we started  beth he cried horrified  just as a precaution said that young lady demurely  but youre only a child  even so uncle i have been taught to shoot in cloverton as a part of my education once i won a medalthink of that so i brought my pet revolver along although i may never have need to use it  uncle john looked thoughtful  it doesnt seem like a girlish accomplishment exactly he mused when i was young and went into the west the times were a bit unsettled and i used to carry a popgun myself but i never shot at a human being in my life there were women in the camps that could shoot too but the safest place was always in front of them if beth has won a medal though she might hit something  dont try beth said louise you ought to make a hit without shooting  thank you dear  as they left their hotel for a walk they came upon count ferralti who was standing in the court calmly smoking a cigarette his right hand was still in a sling  no one was greatly surprised at his appearance but uncle john uttered an exclamation of impatience it annoyed him that this fellow whose antecedents were decidedly cloudy should be chasing around after one of his nieces beth and patsy smiled at each other significantly as the young man was discovered but louise with a slight blush advanced to greet ferralti in her usual pleasant and cordial way  there was no use resenting the intrusion they owed a certain consideration to this boyish italian for his assistance on the amalfi road but uncle john almost wished he had left them to escape as best they might for the obligation was getting to be decidedly onerous  while ferralti was expressing his astonishment at so unexpectedly meeting again his american friends uncle john discovered their english speaking cocchiere frascatti vietri lolling half asleep on the box of his victoria  would your energy like to drive us this morning he asked  it is my duty signore if you wish to go was the reply  then you are engaged come girls hop in if you want to ride  the three nieces and uncle john just filled the victoria the count was disconsolate at being so cleverly dropped from the party but could only flourish his hat and wish them a pleasant drive  they descended the winding road to the coast where frascatti took the highway to sant alessio a charming drive leading to the taormina pass  by the way uncle john asked the driver do you know of a duke that lives in this neighborhood  the laughing face of the sicilian suddenly turned grave  no signore there is the prince di scaletta but no duke on this side the town  but on the other side  oh in the mountains to be sure there are noblemen there old estates almost forgotten in our great civilization of today we are very progressive in taormina signore there will be a fountain of the ice cream soda established next summer quite metropolitan ne ce  quite but tell me frascatti have you a duke in the mountains back of taormina  signore i beg you to pay no attention to the foolish stories you may hear from our peasants there has been no brigandage here for centuries i assure you the country is perfectionly safeespecial if you stay within the town or take me on your drives they know me signore and even il duca dares not trifle with my friends  why should he frascatti if there is no brigandage is it the mafia  ah i have heard that mafia spoken of but mostly when i lived in america which is chicago here we do not know of the mafia  but you advise us to be careful  everywhere illustrissimo signore it is well to be what you call the circumspection i remember that in the state street of chicago which is america peaceful citizens were often killed by bandits eh is it not so  quite probable said uncle john soberly  then what will you are we worse than americans that you fear us never mind il duca or the tales they foolishly whisper of him here you may be as safe and happy as in chicagowhich is america  he turned to his horses and urged them up a slope the girls and uncle john eyed one another enquiringly  our duke seems to bear no good reputation said beth in a tone so low that frascatti could not overhear everyone fears to speak of him  singular said uncle john that patsys friend turns out to be a mystery even in his own home i wonder if he is a leader of the mafia or just a common brigand  in either case said patsy he will not care to injure us i am sure we all treated him very nicely and i just made him talk and be sociable whether he wanted to or not that ought to count for something in our favor but my opinion is that hes just a gruff old nobleman who lives in the hills and makes few friends  and hasnt a name any more than louises count has is it customary my dear for all italian noblemen to conceal their identity  i do not know uncle answered louise casting down her eyes     chapter xiv  uncle john disappears   uncle john grew to love taormina its wildness and ruggedness somehow reminded him of the rockies in the old pioneer days and he wandered through all the lanes of the quaint old town until he knew every cornice and cobblestone familiarly and the women who sat weaving or mending before their squalid but picturesque hovels all nodded a greeting to the cheery little american as he passed by  he climbed malo too a high peak crowned by a ruined castle and also mt venere on the plateau of which an ancient city had once stood his walking tours did him good and frequently while the girls lay stretched upon the grass that lined the theatre enclosure to idle the time or read or write enthusiastic letters home uncle john scorning such laziness would take his stick and climb mountains or follow the rough paths that diverged from the highway just beyond the catania gate  the tax gatherer whose tiny office was just inside the gate came to know the little gentleman very well and although he could speak no english he would bob his grizzled head and murmur buon giorno signore as the stranger passed out on his daily stroll  one afternoon mr merrick went down the hill path leading from the castelloamare to capo di san andrea and as he passed around a narrow ledge of rock came full upon two men seated upon a flat stone one was valdi and the other ferralti and they seemed engaged in earnest conversation when he interrupted them the count smiled frankly and doffed his hat the duke frowned grimly but also nodded  uncle john passed on the path was wild and little frequented he felt in his side pocket and grasped the handle of his revolver but there was no attempt to follow or molest him nevertheless when he returned from the beach he came up the longer winding roadway and was glad of the company of a ragged goatherd who having no english entertained il signore by singing ditties as he drove his goats before him  the misgivings uncle john had originally conceived concerning count ferralti returned in full force with this incident but he resolved to say nothing of it to his nieces silas watson would be with them in a couple of days more and he would consult the shrewd lawyer before he took any decisive action  next morning after breakfast he left his nieces in the garden and said he would take a walk through the town and along the highway west toward kaggi  ill be back in an hour or so he remarked for i have some letters to write and i want them to catch the noon mail  so the girls sat on the terrace overlooking the sea and etna and breathed the sweet air and enjoyed the caressing sunshine until they noticed the portiere coming hastily toward them  pardon signorini he said breathlessly but it will be to oblige me greatly if you will tell me where signor ferralti is  he is not of our party answered patsy promptly but louise looked up as if startled and said i have been expecting him to join us here  then you do not know exclaimed the portiere in an anxious tone  know what sir asked the girl  that signor ferralti is gone he has not been seen by any after last evening he did not occupy his room but worse far worse will i break you the news gentlyhis baggage is gone with him  his baggage gone echoed louise greatly disturbed and he did not tell you you did not see him go  alas no signorina his bill is still unsettled he possessed two large travelling cases which must have been carried out at the side entrance with stealth most deplorable the padrone is worried signor ferralti is american and americans seldom treat us wrongfully  signor ferralti is italian answered louise stiffly  the name is italian perhaps but he speaks only the english declared the portiere  he is not a rogue however assure your master of that fact when mr merrick returns he will settle count ferraltis bill  oh louise gasped patsy  i dont understand it in the least continued louise looking at her cousins as if she were really bewildered i left him in the courtyard last evening to finish his cigar and he said he would meet us in the garden after breakfast i am sure he had no intention of going away and for the honor of american travellers his account here must be taken care of  one thing is singular observed beth calmly there has been no train since last you saw him if count ferralti has left the hotel where could he be  the portiere brightened  gia sintende he exclaimed he must still be in taorminadoubtless at some other hotel  will you send and find out asked louise  i will go myself and at once he answered and thank you signorina for the kind assurance regarding the account it will relieve the padrone very much  he hurried away again and an uneasy silence fell upon the nieces  do you care for this young man louise asked beth pointedly after the pause had become awkward  he is very attentive and gentlemanly and i feel you have all wronged him by your unjust suspicions she replied with spirit  that does not answer my question dear persisted her cousin are you especially fond of him  what right have you to question me in this way beth  no right at all dear i am only trying to figure out our doubtful position in regard to this young mana stranger to all of us but you  it is really none of our business observed patsy quickly were just a lot of gossips to be figuring on count ferralti at all and although this sudden disappearance looks queer on the face of it the gentleman may simply have changed his boarding place  i do not think so said louise he liked this hotel very much  and he may have liked some of its guests added patsy smiling well uncle john will soon be back and then we will talk it over with him  uncle john was late the portiere returned first he had been to every hotel in the little town but none of them had received a guest since the afternoon train of yesterday count ferralti had disappeared as if by magic and no one could account for it  noon arrived but no uncle john the girls became dispirited and anxious for the little man was usually very prompt in keeping his engagements and always had returned at the set time  they waited until the last moment and then entered the salle a manger and ate their luncheon in gloomy silence hoping every moment to hear the sound of their uncles familiar tread  after luncheon they held a hurried consultation and decided to go into town and search for him so away they trooped asking eager questions in their uncertain italian but receiving no satisfactory reply until they reached the little office of the tax gatherer at the catania gate  ah si signorini mia he answered cheerfully il poco signore passato da stamattini  but he had not returned  not yet  they looked at one another blankly  see here said patsy uncle john must have lost his way or met with an accident you go back to the hotel louise and wait there in case he returns home another way beth and i will follow some of these paths and see if we can find him  he may have sprained an ankle and be unable to walk suggested beth i think patsys advice is good  so louise returned through the town and the other girls began exploring the paths that led into the mountains from every turn of the highway but although they searched eagerly and followed each path a mile or more of its length no sign of life did they encountermuch less a sight of their missing uncle the paths were wild and unfrequented only on the catania road itself a peasant now and then being found patiently trudging along or driving before him a donkey laden with panniers of oranges or lemons for the markets of taormina  on some of the solitary rocky paths they called to uncle john by name hoping that their voices might reach him but only the echoes replied finally they grew discouraged  it will be sunset before we get back even if we start this minute said beth finally let us return and get some one to help us  patsy burst into tears  oh im sure hes lost or murdered or kidnapped she wailed dear dear uncle john whatever shall we do beth  why he may be at home waiting for us to get back dont give way patsy it will do no good you know  they were thoroughly tired when just at sunset they reached the hotel louise came to meet them and by the question in her eyes they knew their uncle had not returned  something must be done and at once said beth decidedly she was the younger of the three girls but in this emergency took the lead because of her calm and unruffled disposition and native good sense is frascatti in the courtyard  patsy ran to see and soon brought the vetturino into their sitting room he could speak english and knew the neighborhood thoroughly he ought to be able to advise them  frascatti listened intently to their story he was very evidently impressed  tell me then signorini he said thoughtfully is senor merreek very rich  why do you ask returned beth suspiciously she remembered the warning conveyed in mr watsons letter  of course i know that all the americans who travel are rich continued frascatti i have myself been in chicago which is america but is signor merreek a very rich and well acquainted man in his own country believe me it is well that you answer truly  i think he is  the man looked cautiously around and then came nearer and dropped his voice to a whisper  are you aware that il duca knows this he asked  beth thought a moment  we met the man you call il duca but who told us he was signor victor valdi on board the ship where many of the passengers knew my uncle well if he listened to their conversation he would soon know all about john merrick of course  frascatti wagged his head solemnly  then signorina he said still speaking very softly i assure you there is no need to worry over your uncles safety  what do you mean demanded beth  people do not lose their way in our mountains he replied the paths are straight and lead all to the highways and there is little danger of falling or of being injured buti regret to say it signoriniit is a reflection upon our advanced civilization and the good name of our peoplebut sometimes a man who is rich disappears for a time and no one knows how it is or where he may be he always returns but then he is not so rich  i understand my uncle is captured by brigands you think  there are no brigands signorina  or the mafia then  i do not know the mafia all i know is that the very rich should keep their riches secret when they travel in chicago which is america they will knock you upon the head for a few miserable dollars here my countrymen scorn to attack or to rob the common people but when a man is so very rich that he does not need all of his money there are i regret to say some lawless ones in sicily who insist that he divide with them but the prisoner is always well treated and when he pays he is sent away very happy  suppose he does not pay  ah signorina will not a drowning man clutch the raft that floats by and the lawless ones do not take his allmerely a part  the girls looked at one another helplessly  what must we do frascatti asked patsy  wait in a daytwo days perhapsyou will hear from your uncle he will tell you how to send money to the lawless ones you will follow his instructions and he will come home with smiles and singing i know it is very regrettable but it is so  it will not be so in this case said beth indignantly i will see the american consul  i am sorry but there is none here  i will telegraph to messina for the military they will search the mountains and bring your brigands to justice  frascatti smiled sadly  oh yes perhaps they will come but the military is italiannot sicilianand has no experience in these parts the search will find nothing except perhaps a dead body thrown upon the rocks to defy justice it is very regrettable signorina but it is so  patsy was wringing her hands frantic with terror louise was white and staring beth puckered her pretty brow in a frown and tried to think  ferralti is also gone murmured louise in a hoarse voice they will rob or murder him with uncle john  i am quite convinced said beth coldly that your false count is a fellow conspirator of the brigand called il duca he has been following us around to get a chance to ensnare uncle john  oh no no beth it is not so i know better than that  he would lie to you of course returned the girl bitterly as soon as the trap was set he disappeared bag and baggage and left the simple girl he had fooled to her own devices  you do not know what you are saying retorted louise turning her back to beth and walking to a window from where they stood they could hear her sobbing miserably  whether frascatti is right or not said patsy drying her eyes and trying to be brave we ought to search for uncle john at once  i think so too agreed beth then turning to the sicilian she said will you get together as many men as possible and search the hills with lanterns for my uncle you shall be well paid for all you do  most certainly signorina if it will please you he replied how long do you wish us to search  until you find him  then must we grow old in your service non fa niente it is regrettable but  will you go at once stamping her foot angrily  most certainly signorina  then lose no time i will go with you and see you start  she followed the man out and kept at his side until he had secured several servants with lanterns for the search the promise of high caparra or earnest money made all eager to join the band but the padrone could only allow a half dozen to leave their stations at the hotel in the town however whither beth accompanied them a score of sleepy looking fellows were speedily secured and under the command of frascatti who had resolved to earn his money by energy and good will because there was no chance of success they marched out of the catania gate and scattered along the mountain paths  if you find uncle john before morning i will give you a thousand lira additional promised beth  we will search faithfully replied her captain but the signorina must not be disappointed if the lawless ones evade us they have a way of hiding close in the caves where none may find them it is regrettable very but it is so  then he followed his men to the mountains and as the last glimmer from his lantern died away the girl sighed heavily and returned alone through the deserted streets to the hotel  clouds hid the moon and the night was black and forbidding but it did not occur to her to be afraid     chapter xv  days of anxiety   uncle johns nieces passed a miserable night patsy stole into his room and prayed fervently beside his bed that her dear uncle might be preserved and restored to them in health and safety beth meantime paced the room she shared with patsy with knitted brows and flashing eyes the flush in her cheeks growing deeper as her anger increased an ungovernable temper was the girls worst failing the abductors of her uncle were arousing in her the most violent passions of which she was capable and might lead her to adopt desperate measures she was only a country girl and little experienced in life yet beth might be expected to undertake extraordinary things if as she expressed it if she got good and mad  no sound was heard during the night from the room occupied by louise but the morning disclosed a white drawn face and reddened eyelids as proof that she had rested as little as her cousins  yet singularly enough louise was the most composed of the three when they gathered in the little sitting room at daybreak and tried earnestly to cheer the spirits of her cousins louise never conveyed the impression of being especially sincere but the pleasant words and manners she habitually assumed rendered her an agreeable companion and this faculty of masking her real feelings now stood her in good stead and served to relieve the weight of anxiety that oppressed them all  frascatti came limping back with his tired followers in the early dawn and reported that no trace of the missing man had been observed there were no brigands and no mafia on that point all his fellow townsmen agreed with him fully but it was barely possible some lawless ones who were all unknown to the honest taorminians had made the rich american a prisoner  il duca oh no signorini a thousand times no il duca was queer and unsociable but not lawless he was of noble family and a native of the district it would be very wrong and foolish to question il ducas integrity  with this assertion frascatti went to bed he had not shirked the search because he was paid for it and he and his men had tramped the mountains faithfully all night well knowing it would result in nothing but earning their money  on the morning train from catania arrived silas watson and his young ward kenneth forbes the boy who had so unexpectedly inherited aunt janes fine estate of elmhurst on her death the discovery of a will which gave to kenneth all the property their aunt had intended for her nieces had not caused the slightest estrangement between the young folks then or afterward on the contrary the girls were all glad that the gloomy neglected boy with his artistic highstrung temperament would be so well provided for without the inheritance he would have been an outcast now he was able to travel with his guardian the kindly old elmhurst lawyer and fit himself for his future important position in the world more than all this however kenneth had resolved to be a great landscape painter and italy and sicily had done much in the past year to prepare him for this career  the boy greeted his old friends with eager delight not noticing for the moment their anxious faces and perturbed demeanor but the lawyers sharp eyes saw at once that something was wrong  where is john merrick he asked  oh im so glad youve come cried patsy clinging to his hand  we are in sore straits indeed mr watson said louise  uncle john is lost explained beth and were afraid he is in the hands of brigands  then she related as calmly as she could all that had happened the relation was clear and concise she told of their meeting with valdi on the ship of count ferraltis persistence in attaching himself to their party and of uncle johns discovery that the young man was posing under an assumed name she did not fail to mention ferraltis timely assistance on the amalfi drive or his subsequent devoted attentions to louise but the latter beth considered merely as an excuse for following them around  in my opinion said she we have been watched ever since we left america by these two spies who had resolved to get uncle john into some unfrequented place and then rob him if they succeed in their vile plot mr watson we shall be humiliated and disgraced forever  tuttut said he dont think of that let us consider john merrick and nothing else  louise protested that beth had not been fair in her conclusions the count was an honorable man she would vouch for his character herself  but mr watson did not heed this defense the matter was very serioushow serious he alone realizedand his face was grave indeed as he listened to the descriptions of that terrible il duca whom the natives all shrank from and refused to discuss  when he had learned all the nieces had to tell he hastened into the town and telegraphed the american consul at messina then he found the questura or police office and was assured by the officer in attendance that the disappearance of mr merrick was already known to the authorities and every effort was being made to find him  do you think he has been abducted by brigands asked the lawyer  brigands signore was the astonished reply there are no brigands in this district at all we drove them out many years ago  how about il duca  and who is that signore  dont you know  i assure you we have no official knowledge of such a person there are dukes in sicily to be sure but il duca means nothing perhaps you can tell me to whom you refer  see here said the lawyer brusquely i know your methods questore mia but they wont prove effective in this case if you think an american is helpless in this country you are very much mistaken but to save time i am willing to submit to your official requirements i will pay you well for the rescue of my friend  all shall be done that is possible  but if you do not find him at once and return him to us unharmed i will have a regiment of soldiers in taormina to search your mountains and break up the bands of brigands that infest them when i prove that brigands are here and that you were not aware of them you will be disgraced and deposed from your office  the official shrugged his shoulders a gesture in which the sicilian is as expert as the frenchman  i will welcome the soldiery said he but you will be able to prove nothing the offer of a reward may accomplish moreif it is great enough to be interesting  how great is that  can i value your friend you must name the reward yourself but even then i can promise nothing in the course of our duty every effort is now being made to find the missing american but we work in the dark as you know your friend may be a suicide he may have lost his mind and wandered into the wilderness he may have committed some crime and absconded how do i know you say he is missing but that is no reason the brigands have him even did brigands exist which i doubt rest assured signore that rigid search will be made it is my boast that i leave no duty unfulfilled  mr watson walked back to the telegraph office and found an answer to his message the american consul was ill and had gone to naples for treatment when he returned his clerk stated the matter of the disappearance of john merrick would immediately be investigated  feeling extremely helpless and more fearful for his friend than before the lawyer returned to the hotel for a conference with the nieces  how much of a reward shall i offer he asked that seems to be the only thing that can be depended upon to secure results  give them a millionuncle john wont mind cried patsy earnestly  dont give them a penny sir said beth if they are holding him for a ransom uncle is in no personal danger and we have no right to assist in robbing him  but you dont understand my dear asserted the lawyer these brigands never let a victim go free unless they are well paid that is why they are so often successful if john merrick is not ransomed he will never again be heard of  but this is not a ransom sir you propose to offer a reward to the police  let me explain the ways of the italian police are very intricate they know of no brigandage here and cannot find a brigand but if the reward is great enough to divide they know where to offer a share of it in lieu of a ransom and will force the brigands to accept it in that way the police gets the glory of a rescue and a share of the spoils if we offer no reward or an insignificant one the brigands will be allowed to act as they please  that is outrageous exclaimed beth  yes the italian government deplores it it is trying hard to break up a system that has existed for centuries but has not yet succeeded  then id prefer to deal directly with the brigands  so would i if  if what sir  if we were sure your uncle is in their hands do you think the party you sent out last night searched thoroughly  i hope so  i will send out more men at once they shall search the hills in every direction should they find nothing our worst fears will be confirmed and then  well mr watson  then we must wait for the brigands to dictate the terms of a ransom and make the best bargain we can  that seems sensible said kenneth and both patsy and louise agreed with him although it would be tedious waiting  but beth only bit her lip and frowned  mr watsons searching party was maintained all dayfor two days and three but without result then they waited for the brigands to act but a week dragged painfully by and no word of john merricks whereabouts reached the ears of the weary watchers     chapter xvi  tato   when uncle john passed through the west gate for a tramp along the mountain paths he was feeling in an especially happy and contented mood the day was bright and balmy the air bracing the scenery unfolded step by step magnificent and appealing to be in this little corner of the old world amid ruins antedating the christian era and able to wholly forget those awful stock and market reports of wall street was a privilege the old gentleman greatly appreciated  so away he trudged exploring this path or that leading amongst the rugged cliffs until finally he began to take note of his erratic wanderings and wonder where he was climbing an elevated rock near the path he poised himself upon its peak and studied the landscape spread out beneath him  there was a patch of sea with the dim calabrian coast standing sentry behind it the nearer coast was hidden from view but away at the left was a dull white streak marking the old wall of taormina and above this the ruined citadel and the ancient castle of molaeach on its separate peak  i must be getting back he thought and sliding down the surface of the rock he presently returned to the path from whence he had climbed  to his surprise he found a boy standing there and looking at him with soft brown eyes that were both beautiful and intelligent uncle john was as short as he was stout but the boy scarcely reached to his shoulder he was slender and agile and clothed in a grey corduroy suit that was better in texture than the american had seen other sicilian youths wear as a rule the apparel of the children in this country seemed sadly neglected  yet the most attractive thing about this child was his face which was delicate of contour richly tinted to harmonize with his magnificent brown eyes and so sensitive and expressive that it seemed able to convey the most subtle shades of emotion he seemed ten or twelve years of age but might have been much older  as soon as the american had returned to the path the boy came toward him in an eager excited way and exclaimed  is it not signor merrick  the english was fluent and only rendered softer by the foreign intonation  it is said uncle john cheerfully where did you drop from my lad i thought these hills were deserted until now  i am sent by a friend answered the boy speaking rapidly and regarding the man with appealing glances he is in much trouble signore and asks your aid  a friend who is it  the name he gave me is ferralti signore he is near to this place in the hills yonder and unable to return to the town without assistance  ferralti hmm is he hurt  badly signore from a fall on the rocks  and he sent for me  yes signore i know you by sightwho does notand as i hurried along i saw you standing on the rock it is most fortunate will you hasten to your friend then i will lead you to him  uncle john hesitated he ought to be getting home instead of penetrating still farther into these rocky fastnesses and ferralti was no especial friend to claim his assistance but then the thought occurred that this young italian had befriended both him and his nieces in an extremity and was therefore entitled to consideration when trouble in turn overtook himself the natural impulse of this thought was to go to his assistance  all right my lad said he lead on and ill see what can be done for ferralti is it far  not far signore  with nervous impatient steps the child started up the narrow path and uncle john followednot slowly but scarcely fast enough to satisfy his zealous guide  what is your name little one  tato signore  where do you live  near by signore  and how did you happen to find ferralti  by chance signore  uncle john saved his remaining breath for the climb he could ask questions afterward  the path was in a crevasse where the rocks seemed once to have split it was narrow and steep and before long ended in a cul de sac the little man thought they had reached their destination then but without hesitation the boy climbed over a boulder and dropped into another path on the opposite side holding out a hand to assist the american  uncle john laughed at the necessity but promptly slid his stout body over the boulder and then paused to mop his brow  much farther tato  just a step signore  it is lucky you found ferralti or he might have died in these wilds without a soul knowing he was here  that is true signore  well is this the path  yes signore follow me please  the cliffs were precipitous on both sides of them it was another crevasse but not a long one presently the child came to a halt because the way ended and they could proceed no farther he leaned against the rock and in a highpitched sweet voice sang part of a sicilian ditty neither starting the verse nor ending it but merely trilling out a fragment  uncle john regarded him wonderingly and then with a sudden suspicion he demanded  you are not playing me false tato  i signore smiling frankly into the mans eyes you need never fear tato signore to be your friend and signor ferraltis friend makes me very proud  the rock he leaned against fell inward noiselessly and disclosed a passage it was short for there was light at the other end  the strange child darted in at once  this way signore he is here  uncle john drew back he had forgotten until now that these mountains are dangerous and something strange in the present proceedings the loneliness of the place and the elfish character of his guide suddenly warned him to be cautious  see here my lad he called ill go no farther  instantly tato was at his side again grasping the mans hand in his tiny brown one and searching his face with pleading eyes  ah signore you will not fail your friend when he is so near you and in such great trouble see i who am a stranger and not even his countryman even i weep for the poor young man and long to comfort him do you his friend refuse him aid because you have fear of the wild mountains and a poor peasant boy  tears really stood in the beautiful brown eyes they rolled down his cheeks as with both hands he pressed that of uncle john and urged him gently forward  oh well lead on tato ill see the other side of your tunnel anyhow but if you play me tricks my lad  he paused for a wonderful vision had opened before him coming through the short passage hewn in the rocks the american stood upon a ledge facing a most beautiful valley that was hemmed in by precipitous cliffs on every side from these stern barriers of the outside world the ground sloped gradually toward the center where a pretty brook flowed its waters sparkling like diamonds in the sunlight as it tumbled over its rocky bed groves of oranges and of olive lemon and almond trees occupied much of the vale and on a higher point at the right its back to the wall of rock that towered behind it stood a substantial yet picturesque mansion of stone with several outbuildings scattered on either side  the valley seemed indeed a toy kingdom sequestered from the great outside world yet so rich and productive within itself that it was independent of all else  uncle john gazed with amazement who could have guessed this delightful spot was hidden safe within the heart of the bleak bare mountain surrounding it but suddenly he bethought himself  what place is this tato he asked and where is our friend ferralti who needs me  there was no reply  he turned around to find the boy had disappeared moreover the passage had disappeared only a wall of rock was behind him and although his eyes anxiously searched the rifts and cracks of its rough surface no indication of the opening through which he had passed could be discovered     chapter xvii  the hidden valley   uncle johns first inspiration was to sit down upon a stone to think he drew out his pipe and lighted it to assist his meditations  these were none too pleasant that he had been cleverly entrapped and that by a child scarcely in its teens was too evident to need reflection and what a secure trap it was the mountains ranged all around the valley were impossible to scale even by an alpine climber and to one who was not informed of its location the existence of the valley itself was unimaginable  i had not believed ferralti was so shrewd he muttered wonderingly that something was wrong about the fellow i knew of course but i had not suspected such a thing as this now then first of all let me mark this spot so that i will remember it just back of where i now stand is the entrance or outlet to the tunnel through the wall it is closed i suppose by a swinging stone like the one on the opposite side i saw that one openedopened by some person concealed from view as soon as the boy sang his bit of song which was the signal agreed upon and i was fool enough after that warning to walk straight through the tunnel youre getting old john merrick thats the only way i can account for your folly but ferralti hasnt won the odd trick yet and if i keep my wits about me he isnt likely to win  thus ruminating uncle john searched the rocky wall carefully and believed he would know the place again although which of the rough stones of its surface formed the doorway to the tunnel he could not guess  a ledge of rock served as a path leading to right and left around this end of the valley or pocket in the mountain as it could more properly be called uncle john turned to the right striding along with his usual deliberation smoking his pipe and swinging his cane as he approached the stone dwelling that formed the center of the little settlement as yet no sign of human life had he observed since tato had disappeared although a few cows were standing in a green meadow and some goats scrambled among the loose rocks at the further end of the enclosure  around the house the grounds had been laid out in gardens with flowers and shrubbery hedges and shade trees scattered about chickens clucked and strutted along the paths and an air of restfulness and peace brooded over all  uncle john was plainly mystified until he drew quite close to the dwelling which had many verandas and balconies and bore every evidence of habitation then to his astonishment he beheld the form of a man stretched lazily in a wicker chair beside the entrance and while he paused hesitating the man sat up and bowed politely to him  good morning signor merreek  it was victor valdi or ignoring the fictitious name the mysterious personage known as il duca  behold my delight signor merreek to receive you in my poor home continued the man will you not be seated caro amico  the words were soft and fair but the dark eyes gleamed with triumph and a sneer curled the thin lips  thank you said uncle john i believe i will  he stepped upon the veranda and sat down opposite his host  i came to see count ferralti who is hurt i understand he continued  it is true signore but not badly the poor count is injured mostly in his mind presently you shall see him  no hurry observed uncle john pleasant place you have here duke  it is very good of you to praise it signore it is my most ancient patrimony and quite retired and exclusive  so i see  the house you have honored by your presence signore was erected some three hundred and thirty years ago by an ancestor who loved retirement it has been in my family ever since we all love retirement  very desirable spot for a brigand im sure remarked the american puffing his pipe composedly  brigand ah it pleases you to have humor signore mia brigand but i will be frank it is no dishonor to admit that my great ancestors of past centuries were truly brigands and from this quiet haven sallied forth to do mighty deeds they were quite famous i am told those olden dukes dalcanta  i do not question it  our legends tell of how my great ancestors demanded tribute of the rich who passed through their domainfor all this end of sicily was given to us by peter of aragon and remained in our possession until the second ferdinand robbed us of it those times were somewhat wild and barbarous signore and a gentleman who protected his estates and asked tribute of strangers was termed a brigand and became highly respected but now it is different we are civilized and meek and ruled most lovingly by italy they will tell you there is no brigandage in all sicily  so i understand  today i am nobody my very name is forgotten those around this mountain know nothing of my little estate and i am content i desire not glory i desire not prominence to live my life in seclusion with the occasional visit of a friend like yourself is enough to satisfy me  you seem well known in taormina  quite a mistake signore  and the natives must have climbed these peaks at times and looked down into your secluded kingdom  if so they have forgotten it  i see  i give to the churches and the poor but in secret if i have an enemy he disappearsi do not know how no one knows  of course not you are an improvement on your ancestors duke instead of being a brigand you belong to the mafia and perform your robberies and murders in security very clever indeed  but again you are wrong signore replied the duke with a frown i have never known of this mafia of which you speak nor do i believe it exists for myself i am no robber but a peaceful merchant  a merchant returned uncle john surprised by the statement  to be sure i have some ancient and very valuable relics in my possession treasured most carefully from the mediæval days these i sell to my friendswho are fortunately all foreigners like yourself and can appreciate such treasuresand so obtain for myself and my family a modest livelihood  and you expect to sell something to me asked uncle john understanding very well the sicilians meaning  it is my earnest hope signore  the american fell silent thinking upon the situation the fierce looking brigand beside him was absurd enough in his way but doubtless a dangerous man to deal with uncle john was greatly interested in the adventure it was such a sharp contrast to the humdrum unromantic american life he had latterly known that he derived a certain enjoyment from the novel experience if the girls did not worry over his absence he would not much regret his visit to il ducas secluded valley  it was already midday and his nieces would be expecting him to luncheon when he did not appear they would make enquiries and try to find him it occurred to him how futile all such attempts must prove even to one acquainted with the mountain paths the entrance to the dukes domain was doubtless a secret and the brigand had plainly hinted that the native sicilians were too cautious to spy upon him or molest him in any way  so far the only person he had seen was il duca himself the child who had decoyed him was of course somewhere about and so also was ferralti how many servants or followers the brigand might have was as yet a mystery to the new arrival  in the side pocket of uncle johns loose coat lay a loaded revolver which he had carried ever since he had received mr watsons warning letter he had never imagined a condition of danger where he could not use this weapon to defend himself and as long as it remained by him he had feared nothing but he had been made a prisoner in so deft a manner that he had no opportunity to expostulate or offer any sort of resistance later there might be a chance to fight for his liberty and the only sensible action was to wait and bide his time  for example the duke was saying in his labored broken english i have here a priceless treasurevery antique very beautiful it was in one time owned by robert the norman who presented it to my greatest ancestor  he drew an oddshaped ring from his pocket and handed it to the american it was of dull gold and set with a half dozen flatcut garnets perhaps antique perhaps not but of little intrinsic value  this ring i have decided to sell and it shall be yours signor merreek at a price far less than is represented by its historic worth i am sure you will be glad to buy it  for how much asked uncle john curiously  a trifle a mere hundred thousand lira  twenty thousand dollars  the ring of king roger how cheap but nevertheless you shall have it for that sum  uncle john smiled  my dear duke he replied you have made a sad mistake i am a comparatively poor man my fortune is very modest  the brigand lay back in his chair and lighted a fresh cigarette  i fear you undervalue yourself my dear guest he said recently have i returned from america where i was told much of the wealth of signor john merreek who is many times a millionaire see drawing a paper from his pocket here is a list of the stocks and securities you own also of government and railway bonds of real estate and of manufactures controlled by your money i will read and you will correct me if an error occurs  uncle john listened and was amazed the schedule was complete and its total was many millions it was a better list of holdings than uncle john possessed himself  you foreigners make queer mistakes duke said he taking another tack this property belongs to another john merrick it is a common name and that is doubtless why you mistook me for the rich john merrick  i have noticed returned the duke coldly that this strange delusion of mind is apt to overtake my guests but do not be alarmed it will pass away presently and then you will realize that you are yourself remember that i crossed the atlantic on your steamship signore many people there on board spoke of you and pointed you out to me as the great man of finance your own niece that is called patsy she also told me much about you and of your kindness to her and the other young signorini before i left new york a banker of much dignity informed me you would sail on the ship princess irene if a mistake has been made signore it is yours and not mine is your memory clearer now  uncle john laughed frankly the rascal was too clever for him to dispute with  whoever i am said he i will not buy your ring  i am pained replied the brigand lightly but there is ample time for you to reflect upon the matter do not decide hastily i implore you i may have been too liberal in making my offer and time may assist me in fixing a just price for the relic but we have had enough of business just now it is time for our midday collation oblige me by joining us signore  he blew a shrill whistle and a man stepped out of a doorway he was an enormous sicilian tall sinewy and with a countenance as dark and fierce as his masters in his belt was a long knife such as is known as a stilleto  tommaso said the duke kindly show signor merreek to his room and ask guido if luncheon is ready to be served  va bene padrone growled the man and turned obediently to escort the american  uncle john entered the house traversed a broad and cool passage mounted to the second floor and found himself in a pleasant room with a balcony overlooking the valley it was comfortably furnished and with a bow that was not without a certain grim respect the man left him alone and tramped down the stairs again there had been no attempt to restrain his liberty or molest him in any way yet he was not slow to recognize the fact that he was a prisoner not in the house perhaps but in the valley there was no need to confine him more closely he could not escape  he bathed his hands and face dried them on a fresh towel and found his toilet table well supplied with conveniences in the next room some one was pacing the floor like a caged beast growling and muttering angrily at every step  uncle john listened the brigand seems to have more than one guest he thought and smiled at the others foolish outbursts  then he caught a word or two of english that made him start he went to the door between the two rooms and threw it open finding himself face to face with count ferralti     chapter xviii  guests of the brigand   good morning count said uncle john cheerfully  the other stared at him astonished  good heavens have they got you too he exclaimed  why im visiting his excellency il duca if thats what you mean replied mr merrick but whether hes got me or ive got him i havent yet decided  the young mans jaw was tied in a bandage and one of his eyes was black and discolored he looked agitated and miserable  sir you are in grave danger we are both in grave danger he announced unless we choose to submit to being robbed by this rascally brigand  then observed uncle john lets submit  never not in a thousand years cried ferralti wildly and then this singular young man sank into a chair and burst into tears  uncle john was puzzled the slender youthfor he was but a youth in spite of his thin moustachesexhibited a queer combination of courage and weakness but somehow uncle john liked him better at that moment than he ever had before perhaps because he now realized he had unjustly suspected him  you seem to have been hurt count he remarked  why i was foolish enough to struggle and that brute tommaso pounded me was the reply you were wise to offer no resistance sir  as for that i hadnt a choice said uncle john smiling when did they get you ferralti  last evening i walked in the garden of the hotel and they threw a sack over my head i resisted and tried to cry out they beat me until i was insensible and then brought me here together with my travelling cases which they removed from my room to convey the impression that i had gone away voluntarily when i awakened from my swoon i was in this room with the doctor bending over me  the doctor  oh they have a doctor in this accursed den as well as a priest and a lawyer the duke entreated my pardon he will punish his men for abusing me but he holds me a safe prisoner just the same  why  he wants a ransom he will force me to purchase an ancient brass candlestick for fifty thousand lira  uncle john looked at his companion thoughtfully  tell me count ferralti he said who you really are i had believed you were il ducas accomplice until now but if he has trapped you and demands a ransom it is because you are a person of some consequence and able to pay may i not know as much about your position in life as does this brigand duke  the young man hesitated then he spread out his hands with an appealing gesture and said  not yet mr merrick do not press me now i implore you perhaps i have done wrong to try to deceive you but in good time i will explain everything and then you will understand me better  you are no count  that is true mr merrick  you are not even an italian  that is but partly true sir  you have seen fit to deceive us by  tommaso threw wide the door  il dejuné é servito he said gruffly  what does that mean asked uncle john  luncheon is ready shall we go down  yes im hungry  they followed the man to the lower floor where he ushered them into a low cool room where a long table was set the walls were whitewashed and bore some religious prints gaudily colored a white cloth covered the table which was well furnished with modern crockery and glass and antique silverware  at the head of the table were two thronelike chairs one slightly larger and more elevated than the other in the more important seat was a withered old woman with a face like that of a mummy except that it was supplied with two small but piercing jet eyes that seemed very much alive as they turned shrewdly upon the strangers she was the only one of the company they found seated the duke stood behind the smaller chair beside her and motioned the americans to occupy two places at the side of the table next him opposite them in the places adjoining the elevated dais were two remarkable individuals whom uncle john saw for the first time one was a cappuccin monk with shaven crown and coarse cassock fastened at the waist by a cord he was blind in one eye and the lid of the other drooped so as to expose only a thin slit fat awkward and unkempt he stood holding to the back of his chair and swaying slightly from side to side next to him was a dandified appearing man who was very slight and thin of form but affected the dress and manners of extreme youth ferralti whispered to uncle john that this was the doctor  the table dropped a step in heighth from these places and the balance of its length was occupied by several stalwart sicilians clothed in ordinary peasant costume and a few silent heavyfeatured women tato was not present  signori said the duke to the americans allow me to present you to my mother the head of our illustrious family one who is known admired and feared throughout sicily as her excellenza la duchessa dalcanta  with the words the duke bowed low to the old woman uncle john and ferralti also bowed low the lines of servitors humbly bent themselves double but the duchessa made no acknowledgment her bead like eyes searched the faces of the guests with disconcerting boldness and then dropped to her plate  at this signal the fat priest mumbled a blessing upon the food the duke waved his hand and all the company became seated  uncle john felt as if he were taking part in a comic opera and enjoyed the scene immensely but now his attention was distracted by the stewards bringing in steaming platters of macaroni and stewed mutton from which they first served the duchessa and then the duke and afterward the guests the servants waited hungryeyed until these formalities were completed and then swept the platters clean and ate ravenously  uncle john plied his knife and fork busily and found the food excellently prepared ferralti seemed to have little appetite some of his teeth had been knocked out and his broken wrist which had but partially healed had been wrenched in the scrimmage of the night before so that it caused him considerable pain  the duke attempted little conversation doubtless through deference to the aged duchessa who remained absolutely silent and unresponsive to her surroundings he praised his wine however which he said was from their own vineyards and pressed the americans to drink freely  when she had finished her meal the duchessa raised a hand and at the signal the whole company arose and stood at their places while two of the women assisted her to retire she leaned upon their shoulders being taller than her son but displayed surprising vigor for one so advanced in years  when she had gone the others finished at their leisure and the conversation became general the servants babbling in their voluble italian without any restraint whatever  then the duke led his prisoners to the veranda and offered them cigars these were brought by tato who then sat in the dukes lap and curled up affectionately in his embrace while the brigands expression softened and he stroked the boys head with a tender motion  uncle john watched the little scene approvingly it was the first time he had seen tato since the child had lured him through the tunnel  your son duke he asked  yes signore my only child the heir to my modest estate  and a very good brigand already for his years added mr merrick ah tato tato shaking his head at the child how could you be so cruel as to fool an innocent old chap like me  tato laughed  i did not deceive you signore you but misunderstood me i said signor ferralti was hurt and so he was  but you said he needed my assistance  does he not signore  how do you speak such good english  father antoine taught me  the monk  yes signore  my child is a linguist remarked the duke complacently shhe has been taught english german and french even from the days of infancy it is very good for me for now tato can entertain my guests  have you no italian guests then asked uncle john  no since italy owns sicily and i am a loyal subject neither have i many germans or frenchmen although a few wander my way now and then but the americans i love and often they visit me there were three last year and now here are two more to honor me with their presence  the americans make easier victims i suppose  oh the americans are very rich and they purchase my wares liberally by the way signor ferralti turning to the young man have you decided yet the little matter of your own purchase  i will not buy your candlestick if that is what you refer to was the response  no  by no means fifty thousand lira for a miserable bit of brass  but i forgot to tell you signore the candlestick is no longer for sale observed the duke with an evil smile instead i offer you a magnificent bracelet which is a hundred years old  thank you whats the price  a hundred thousand lira signore  ferralti started then in turn he smiled at his captor  that is absurd said he i have no wealth at all sir but live on a small allowance that barely supplies my needs i cannot pay  i will take that risk signore said the brigand coolly you have but to draw me an order on mr edward leighton of new york for one hundred thousand liraor say twenty thousand dollarsand the bracelet is yours  edward leighton my fathers attorney how did you know of him sir  i have an agent in new york answered the duke and lately i have been in your city myself  then if you know so much you scoundrelly thief you know that my father will not honor a draft for such a sum as you demand i doubt if my father would pay a single dollar to save me from assassination  we will not discuss that signore for i regret to say that your father is no longer able to honor drafts however your attorney can do so and will without question  ferralti stared at him blankly  what do you mean by that he demanded  the duke shook the ashes from his cigar and examined the glowing end with interest  your father was the deliberate reply was killed in a railway accident four days ago i have just been notified of the fact by a cable from america  ferralti sat trembling and regarding the man with silent horror  is this true sir asked uncle john quickly or is it only a part of your cursed game  it is quite true signore i regret being obliged to break the ill news so abruptly but this gentleman thought himself too poor to purchase my little bracelet and it was necessary to inform him that he is suddenly made wealthynot yet so great a croesus as yourself signor merreek but still a very rich man  ferralti ceased trembling but the horror still clung to his eyes  a railway wreck he muttered hoarsely where was it sir tell me i beseech you and are you sure my father is dead  very sure signore my informant is absolutely reliable but the details of the wreck i do not know i am only informed of the fact of your fathers death and that his will leaves you his entire fortune  ferralti arose and staggered away to his room and uncle john watched him go pityingly but knew no way to comfort him when he had gone he asked gently  his father was an american duke  yes signore  and wealthy you say  exceedingly wealthy signore  what was his name  ah about that ring my dear guest do you think a hundred and fifty thousand lira too much for it  you said a hundred thousand  that was this morning signore the ring has increased in value since tomorrow without doubt it will be worth two hundred thousand  tato laughed at the rueful expression on the victims face and a moment after uncle john joined in his laughter  very good duke he said i dont wish to rob you let us wait until tomorrow  the brigand seemed puzzled  may i ask why signor merreeksince you are warned he enquired  why its this way duke im just a simple commonplace american and have lived a rather stupid existence for some time we have no brigands at home nor any hidden valleys or protected criminals like yourself the romance of my surroundings interests me your methods are unique and worth studying if i am so rich as you think me a few extra hundred thousand lira will be a cheap price to pay for this experience is it not so  the duke frowned  do you play with me he asked menacingly  by no means im just the spectator i expect you to make the entertainment im sure it will be a good show although the price is rather high  il duca glared but made no reply at the moment instead he sat stroking tatos hair and glowering evilly at the american  the child whispered something in italian and the man nodded  very well signore he said more quietly tomorrow then if it so pleases you  then taking tatos hand he slowly arose and left the veranda  for a moment the american looked after them with a puzzled expression then he said to himself with a smile ah i have solved one mystery at any rate tato is a girl     chapter xix  a difficult position   and now uncle john finding himself left alone took his walkingstick and started out to explore the valley  he felt very sorry for young ferralti but believed his sympathy could in no way lighten the blow caused by the abrupt news of his parents death he would wish to be alone with his grief for a time by and by mr merrick intended to question his fellow prisoner and try to find out something of his history  the dale was very beautiful as it lay basking in the afternoon sun near the house was a large vegetable garden which being now shaded by the overhanging cliffs was being tended by a sourvisaged sicilian uncle john watched him for a time but the fellow paid no heed to him every servant connected with the dukes establishment seemed surly and morose and this was the more remarkable because the country folk and villagers uncle john had met were usually merry and lighthearted  down by the brook were green meadows and groves of fruit trees the little gentleman followed the stream for some distance and finally came upon a man seated on the bank above a broad pool intently engaged in fishing it proved to be the dandified old doctor who wore gloves to protect his hands and a broadrimmed straw hat to shade his face  uncle john stood beside the motionless figure for a moment watching the line then forgetting he was in a foreign country he asked carelessly  any luck  not yet was the quiet reply in clear english it is too early to interest the fishes an hour later they will bite  then why did you come so soon  to escape that hellhole yonder nodding his head toward the house  uncle john was surprised  but you are not a prisoner doctor he ventured to say  except through the necessity of earning a livelihood il duca pays wellor rather the duchessa does for she is the head of this household i am skillful and worth my price and they know it  you say the duchessa is the head of the house  assuredly signore il duca is her slave she plans and directs everything and her son but obeys her will  did she send him to america  i think so but do not misunderstand me the duke is clever on his own account and almost as wicked as his old mother and between them they are training the child to be as bad as they are it is dreadful  have you been here long  for seven years signore  but you can resign whenever you please  why not but the doubt makes me uneasy sometimes in another year i would like to go to venice and retire from professional life i am a venetian you observe no dastardly brigand of a sicilian and in another year i shall have sufficient means to retire and end my days in peace here i save every centessimo i make for i can spend nothing  uncle john sat down upon the bank beside the confiding venetian  doctor said he i am somewhat puzzled by this man you call il duca as well as by my audacious capture and the methods employed to rob me id like your advice what shall i do  the only possible thing signore submit  why is it the only possible thing  have you not yet discovered unless you pay your friends will never hear from you again il duca by his mothers favor is king here he will murder you if you oppose his demands  really  it is quite certain signore he has murdered several obstinate people since i have been here and the outside world will never know their fate it is folly to oppose the king were you not rich you would not be here il duca knows the exact wealth of every american who travels abroad and is likely to visit sicily many escape him but a few wander into his toils for he is wonderfully sagacious mark you he does not demand your all he merely takes tribute leaving his victims sufficient to render life desirable to them if he required their all many would as soon forfeit life as make the payment but a tithe they will spare for the privilege of living that is why he is so successful and that is why he remains undisturbed for an american being robbed so simply never tells of his humiliating experience he goes home and avoids sicily ever after  hmm i understand  but if you do not pay you are not permitted to leave this place you are killed at once and the incident is over il duca does not love to murder but he takes no chances  i see but suppose i pay and then make complaint to the italian government  it has been done signore but the government is very blind it does not know il duca d alcanta its officials are convinced he does not exist they investigate carefully and declare the tale is all a myth  then there is no way of escape  absolutely none such a condition is almost inconceivable is it not and in this enlightened age but it exists and is only harmful when its victims are stubborn and rebellious to be cheerful and pay promptly is the only sensible way out of your difficulty  thank you said uncle john i shall probably pay promptly but tell me to satisfy my curiosity how does your duke murder his victims  he does not call it murder as i do he says they are suicides or the victims of accident they walk along a path and fall into a pit it is deep and they are killed the pit is also their tomb they are forgotten and the trap is already set for their successors  rather a gloomy picture doctor  yes i tell you this because my nature is kind i abhor all crime and much prefer that you should live but if you die my salario continues i am employed to guard the health of the dukes familyespecially the old duchessaand have no part in this detestable business  isnt that a bite  no signore it is the current it is not time for the fish to bite  uncle john arose  good afternoon doctor  good afternoon signore  he left the old fellow sitting there and walked on the valley was about a half mile long and from a quarter to a third of a mile in width it resembled a huge amphitheatre in shape  the american tramped the length of the brook which disappeared into the rocky wall at the far end then he returned through the orchards to the house  the place was silent and seemed deserted there was a languor in the atmosphere that invited sleep uncle john sought his room and lay down for an afternoon nap soon falling into a sound slumber  when he awoke he found ferralti seated beside his bed the young man was pale but composed  mr merrick said he what have you decided to do  uncle john rubbed his eyes and sat up  im going to purchase that ring he answered at the best price the duke will make me  i am disappointed returned ferralti stiffly i do not intend to allow myself to be robbed in this way  then write a farewell letter and ill take it to your friends  it may not be necessary sir  uncle john regarded him thoughtfully  what can you do he asked  ferralti leaned forward and whispered softly i have a stout pocketknife with a very long blade i shall try to kill the duke once he is dead his people will not dare to oppose us but will fly in terror it is only il ducas audacity and genius that enables this robbers den to exist  you would rather attempt this than pay  sir i could not bear the infamy of letting this scoundrel triumph over me  well ferralti you are attempting a delicate and dangerous task but so far as i can i will help you  he took the revolver from his pocket and handed it to his companion  its loaded in every chamber he whispered perhaps it will serve your purpose better than a knife  ferraltis eyes sparkled  good he exclaimed concealing the weapon i shall watch for my opportunity so as to make no mistake meantime do you bargain with the duke but postpone any agreement to pay  all right my lad ill wait to see what happens it may add a good deal to the cost of that ring if you fail but ill take the chances of that for the sake of the game  he paused a moment and then added  is your father really dead count  yes the duke has sent me the cablegram he received from his agent i cannot doubt his authority my father and i have not been friendly of late years he was a severe man cold and unsympathetic but i am sorry we could not have been reconciled before this awful fate overtook him however it is now too late for vain regrets i tried not to disobey or antagonize my one parent but he did not understand my nature and perhaps i failed to understand his  he sighed and rising from his chair walked to the window to conceal his emotion  uncle john remained silent and presently tommaso entered to notify them that dinner would be served in a half hour and the duke expected them to join him at the table  the next morning mr merrick bargained pleasantly with his jailer who seemed not averse to discussing the matter at length but no conclusion was reached ferralti took no part in the conversation but remained sullen and silent and the duke did not press him  the day after however he insisted that he had dallied long enough although after much argument on the part of his enforced guests he agreed to give them three days to decide with the understanding that each day they delayed would add a goodly sum to their ransom if at the end of the three days the americans remained obdurate he would invite them to take a little walk and the affair would be terminated  ferralti hugged his revolver and awaited his opportunity it seemed to uncle john that he might have had a hundred chances to shoot the brigand who merited no better fate than assassination at their hands but although ferralti was resolved upon the deed he constantly hesitated to accomplish it in cold blood and the fact that he had three days grace induced him to put off the matter as long as possible  he came to regret most bitterly his indecision for something in the young mans eyes must have put the brigand on his guard when they awoke on the third morning which was the fifth since their imprisonment some one had searched their rooms thoroughly the revolver and the knife were both gone and the loss rendered them absolutely helpless     chapter xx  uncle john plays eavesdropper   it now seemed to uncle john that further resistance to the demands of il duca was as useless as it was dangerous he resented the necessity of paying a ransom as much as any man could but imprisoned as he was in a veritable robbers den without means of communicating with the authorities or the outside world and powerless to protect his life from the vengeance of the unprincipled scoundrel who held him the only safe and sane mode of procedure was to give in as gracefully as possible  he formed this conclusion during a long walk around the valley during which he once more noted the absolute seclusion of the place and the impossibility of escape by scaling the cliffs the doctor was fishing again by the brook but paid no heed when uncle john tramped by the sight of the dapper little man gave mr merrick a thought and presently he turned back and sat down beside the fisherman  i want to get out of this he said bluntly it was fun at first and rather interesting but ive had enough of it  the physician kept his eye on the line and made no reply  i want you to tell me how to escape continued uncle john its no use saying that it cant be done for nothing is impossible to a clever man such as i believe you to be  still no reply  you spoke the other day of earning enough money to go home and live in peace for the rest of your days here sir is your opportunity to improve upon that ambition the brigand is trying to exact a large ransom from me ill give it to you willinglyevery pennyif youll show me how to escape  why should you do that enquired the doctor still intent upon his line does it matter to you who gets your money  of course was the prompt reply in one case i pay it for a service rendered and do it gladly on the other hand i am robbed and that goes against the grain il duca has finally decided to demand fifty thousand dollars it shall be yours instead if you give me your assistance  signore said the other calmly i would like this money and i regret that it is impossible for me to earn it but there is no means of escape from this place except by the passage through the rocks which passage only three people know the secret of openingil duca himself the child tato and the old duchessa perhaps tommaso also knows i am not certain but he will not admit he has such knowledge you see signore i am as much a prisoner as yourself  there ought to be some way to climb these cliffs some secret path or underground tunnel remarked uncle john musingly  it is more than a hundred years since this valley was made secure by a brigand ancestor of our duchessa was the reply it may be two or three centuries ago for all i know and ever since it has been used for just this purpose to hold a prisoner until he was ransomedand no such man has ever left the place alive unless he paid the price  then you cannot help me asked uncle john who was weary of hearing these pessimistic declarations  i cannot even help myself for i may not resign my position here unless the duke is willing i should go  good morning doctor  the prisoner returned slowly toward the dwelling with its group of outhouses by chance he found a path leading to the rear of these which he had not traversed before and followed it until he came to a hedge of thickly set trees of some variety of cactus which seemed to have been planted to form an enclosure cautiously pushing aside the branches bordering a small gap in this hedge uncle john discovered a charming garden lying beyond so he quickly squeezed himself through the opening and entered  the garden was rudely but not badly kept there was even some attempt at ornamentation and many of the shrubs and flowers were rare and beautiful narrow walks traversed the masses of foliage and several leafy bowers invited one to escape the heat of the midday sun in their shelter it was not a large place and struck one as being overcrowded because so many of the plants were taller than a mans head  uncle john turned down one path which after several curves and turns came to an abrupt ending beneath the spreading branches of an acacia tree which had been converted into a bower by a thick climbing vine whose matted leaves and purple blossoms effectually screened off the garden beyond  while he stood gazing around him to find a way out without retracing his steps a clear voice within a few feet of him caused him to start the voice spoke in vehement italian and came from the other side of the screen of vines it was sharp and garrulous in tone and although uncle john did not understand the words he recognized their dominating accent  the duke replied slowly and sullenly and whatever he said had the effect of rousing the first speaker to fierce anger  the american became curious he found a place where the leaves were thinner than elsewhere and carefully pressing them apart looked through the opening beyond was a clear space well shaded and furnished with comfortable settles tables and chairs it adjoined a wing of the dwelling which stood but a few paces away and was evidently occupied by the women of the household the old duchessa her face still like a death mask but her eyes glittering with the brightness of a serpents sat enthroned within a large chair in the center of a family group it was her sharp voice that had first aroused the americans attention opposite her sat the duke his thin face wearing an expression of gloom and dissatisfaction the child tato occupied a stool at her fathers feet and in the background were three serving women sewing or embroidering near the duke stood the tall brigand known as pietro  answering the old womans fierce tirade tato said  it is foolish to quarrel in italian the servants are listening  let us then speak in english returned the duchessa these are matters the servants should not gossip about  the duke nodded assent both tato and her grandmother spoke easily the foreign tongue the duke was more uncertain in his english but understood it perfectly  i am still the head of this family resumed the duchessa in a more moderate tone i insist that my will be obeyed  your dignity i have the respect for replied the duke laboredly but you grow old and foolish  foolish i  yes you are absurd you live in past centuries you think today we must do all that your ancestors did  can you do better  yes the world has change it has progress with it i advance but you do not you would murder rob torture today as the great duke your grandfather did you think we still are of the world independent you think we are powerful and great bah we are nothingwe are as a speck of dust but still we are the outlaws and the outcasts of sicily and some day italy will crush us and we will be forgotten  i dare them to molest us  because you are imbecile the world you do not know i have travel i see many countries and i am wise  but you are still my vassal my slave and i alone rule here always have you rebelled and wanted to escape only my iron will has kept you here and made you do your duty  since you my brother ridolfo killed i have little stomach for the trade of brigand it is true but no longer is this trade necessary we are rich had i a son to inherit your business a different thought might prevail but i have only tato and a girl cannot be a successful brigand  why not cried the old duchessa contemptuously it is the girlalways the girlyou make excuses for but have i not ruled our domaini who am a woman  tato herself answered in a quiet voice  and what have you become nonna more than an outcast she enquired what use to you is money or a power that the world would sneer at did the world even suspect that you exist you are a failure in life my nonna and i will not be like you  the duchessa screamed an epithet and glared at the child as if she would annihilate her but no fitting words to reply could she find  uncle john smiled delightedly he felt no sense of humiliation or revolt at eavesdropping in this den of thieves and to be able to gain so fair a revelation of the inner life of this remarkable family was a diversion not lightly to be foregone  so far we have managed to escape the law resumed the duke but always it may not be our fortune to do this if we continue this life it is now a good time to stop of one american we will gain a quarter of a million liraa fortuneand of the other one hundred and fifty thousand lira with what we already have it is enough and more quietly we will disband our men and go away in another land we live the respectable life in peace with all and tato shall be the fine lady and forget she once was a brigands daughter  the child sprang up in glee and clasping her fathers neck with both arms kissed him with passionate earnestness  silently the duchessa watched the scene her face was as pallid and immobile as ever even the eyes seemed to have lost expression but the next words showed that she was still unconquered  you shall take the money of the fat pig of an american it is well to do so but the youth who boldly calls himself ferralti shall make no tribute to this family he shall die as i have declared  i will not take the risk asserted the duke sourly  have the others who lie in the pit told tales she demanded  no but they died alone here are two americans our prisoners and they have many and powerful friends both at taormina and at naples the man merrick when he goes will tell that ferralti is here to obtain his person alive or dead the soldiers will come here and destroy us all it is folly and shows you are old and imbecile  then go she cried fiercely go you and tato take your money and escape and leave me my valley and the youth ferralti and my revenge then if i die if the soldiers destroy me it is my own doing  in this new world of which you know nothing escape is not possible replied the duke after a moments thought ferralti must be accounted for and because i captured him they would accuse me of his death and even tato might be made to suffer no madame both the americans must be killed or both set free for ransom  uncle john gave a start of dismay here was a development he had not expected  then said the old woman positively let them both die  oh no exclaimed tato not that grandmother  certainly not so agreed the duke we want their money  you are already rich said the duchessa you have yourself said so and i know it is truth  this new world explained the duke contains of luxuries many that you have no understanding of to be rich today requires more money than in your days madre mia with these ransoms which already we have won we shall have enough without this money my tato would lack much that i desire for her so of new murders i will take no risk for the bambinas sake  and my revenge  bah of what use is it because the boys father married my sister bianca and illtreated her must we kill their offspring  he is his fathers son the father you say is dead and so also is my child bianca then my hatred falls upon the son arturo and he must die to avenge the wrong to our race  more proof that you are imbecile said the duke calmly he shall not die he is nothing to us except a mine from whence to get gold  he is my grandson i have a right to kill him  he is my nephew he shall live  do you defy me  with certainty i defy you the new world permits no crazy nonna to rule a family that is my privilege if you persist it is you who shall go to the pit if you have reason you shall remain in your garden in peace come tato we will retire  he arose and took the childs hand the old woman sat staring at them in silence but with an evil glint in her glistening eyes  uncle john turned around and softly made his retreat from the garden his face wore a startled and horrified expression and on his forehead stood great beads of sweat that the sultriness of the day did not account for  but he thought better of il duca     chapter xxi  the pit   they met an hour later at luncheon all but the duchessa who sulked in her garden tato was bright and smiling filled with a suppressed joy which bubbled up in spite of the little ones effort to be dignified and sedate when her hand stole under the table to find and press that of her father uncle john beamed upon her approvingly for he knew what had occurred and could sympathize with her delight  the duke however was more sombre than usual he had defied his mother successfully so far but he feared the terrible old woman more than did tato because he knew more of her history and of the bold and wicked deeds she had perpetrated in years gone by only once had a proposed victim escaped her and that was when her own daughter bianca had fallen in love with an american held for ransom and spirited him away from the valley through knowledge of the secret passage it was well bianca had fled with her lover otherwise her mother would surely have killed her but afterward when the girl returned to die in the old home all was forgiven and only the hatred of her foreign husband whose cruelty had driven her back to sicily remained to rankle in the old duchessas wicked heart  no one knew her evil nature better than her son he entertained a suspicion that he had not conquered her by his recent opposition to her will indeed he would never have dared to brave her anger except for tatos sake tato was his idol and in her defense the cowardly brigand had for the moment become bold  tato laughed and chatted with uncle john all through the meal even trying at times to cheer the doleful ferralti who was nearly as glum and unsociable as her father the servants and brigands at the lower end of the table looked upon the little one admiringly it was evident she was a general favorite  on the porch after luncheon the duke broached the subject of the ransoms again still maintaining the fable of selling his antique jewelry  sir said uncle john im going to submit gracefully but upon one condition  the duke scowled  i allow no conditions he said  youd better allow this one uncle john replied because it will make it easier for all of us of my own free will and accord i will make a present to tato of fifty thousand dollars and she shall have it for her dowry when she marries  tato clapped her hands  how did you know i am a girl when i wear boys clothes she asked  even the duke smiled at that but the next moment he shook his head solemnly  it will not do signore he declared answering uncle johns proposition this is a business affair altogether you must purchase the ring and at once  the little american sighed it had been his last hope  very well he said have your own way  you will send to your friends for the money  whenever you say duke youve got me in a hole and i must wiggle out the best way i can  the brigand turned to ferralti  and you signore he asked  i do not know whether i can get the money you demand  but you will make the attempt as i shall direct  yes  then signori it is all finished in a brief time you will leave my hospitable roof  the sooner the better declared ferralti  they sat for a time in silence each busy with his thoughts  go to your grandmother tato said the duke and try to make your peace with her if she is too angry do not remain tomorrow you must go into town with letters from these gentlemen to their friends  the child kissed him and went obediently to do his will then the brigand spoke to tommaso who brought writing material from the house and placed it upon a small table  uncle john without further demur sat down to write the duke dictated what he should say although he was allowed to express the words in his own characteristic style and he followed his instructions implicitly secretly admiring the shrewdness of the brigands methods  it was now ferraltis turn he had just seated himself at the table and taken the pen when they were startled by a shrill scream from the rear of the house it was followed by another and another in quick succession  it was tatos voice and the duke gave an answering cry and sprang from the veranda to dart quickly around the corner of the house uncle john followed him nearly as fearful as the childs father  tommaso seized a short rifle that stood near and ran around the house in the other direction when ferralti who for a moment had seemed dazed by the interruption followed tommaso rather than the others  as they came to the rear they were amazed to see the old duchessa whom they had known to be feeble and dependent upon her women rush through the garden hedge with the agility of a man bearing in her arms the struggling form of little tato  the child screamed pitifully but the woman glared upon tommaso and ferralti as she passed them with the ferocity of a tiger  she is mad cried ferralti quick tommaso let us follow her  the brigand bounded forward with the young man scarce a pace behind him the woman running with wonderful speed in spite of her burden began to ascend a narrow path leading up the face of a rugged cliff  a yell of anguish from behind for a moment arrested ferraltis rapid pursuit glancing back he saw the duke running frantically toward them at the same time waving his arms high above his head  the pit he shouted she is making for the pit stop her for the love of god  ferralti understood and dashed forward again at full speed tommaso also understood for his face was white and he muttered terrible oaths as he pressed on yet run as they might the mad duchessa was inspired with a strength so superhuman that she kept well in advance  but the narrow path ended half way up the cliff it ended at a deep chasm in the rocks the edge of which was protected by a large flat stone like the curb of a well  with a final leap the old woman gained this stone and while the dreadful pit yawned at her feet she turned and with a demoniacal laugh faced her pursuers hugging the child close to her breast  tommaso and ferralti who were nearest paused instinctively it was now impossible for them to prevent the tragedy about to be enacted the duke spurred on by fear was yet twenty paces in their rear and in a moment he also stopped clasping his hands in a gesture of vain entreaty  listen lugui his mother called to him in a dear high voice this is the child that has come between us and turned you from a man into a coward here alone is the cause of our troubles behold i will remove it forever from our path  with the words she lifted tato high above her head and turned toward the pitthat terrible cleft in the rocks which was believed to have no bottom  at her first movement tommaso had raised his gun and the duke perceiving this called to him in an agonized voice to fire but either the brigand wavered between his loyalty to the duke or the duchessa or he feared to injure tato for he hesitated to obey and the moments were precious  the childs fate hung in the balance when ferralti snatched the weapon from the brigands hands and fired it so hastily that he scarcely seemed to take aim  a wild cry echoed the shot the woman collapsed and fell dropping tato at her feet where they both tottered at the edge of the pit the child however clung desperately to the outer edge of the flat stone while the duchessas inert form seemed to hesitate for an instant and then disappeared from view  tommaso ran forward and caught up the child returning slowly along the path to place it in the fathers arms ferralti was looking vaguely from the weapon he held to the pit and then back again as if not fully understanding what he had done  thank you signore said the duke brokenly for saving my precious child  but i have slain your mother cried the young man horrified  the obligation is even replied the duke she was also your grandmother  ferralti stood motionless his face working convulsively his tongue refusing to utter a sound  but he did not shoot my grandmother at all said tato who was sobbing against her fathers breast for i heard the bullet strike the rock beside us my grandmothers strength gave way and she fainted it was that that saved me padre mia     chapter xxii  news at last   kenneth forbes had always been an unusual boy he had grown up in an unfriendly atmosphere unloved and uncared for and resented this neglect with all the force of his impetuous nature he had hated aunt jane and regarded her as cruel and selfisha fair estimate of her characteruntil aunt janes nieces taught him to be more considerate and forgiving patricia especially had exercised a gentler influence upon the arbitrary youth and as a consequence they had become staunch friends  when the unexpected inheritance of a fortune changed the boys condition from one of dependence to one of importance he found he had no longer any wrongs to resent therefore his surly and brusque moods gradually disappeared and he became a pleasant companion to those he cared for with strangers he still remained reserved and suspicious and occasionally the old sullen fits would seize him and it was well to avoid his society while they lasted  on his arrival at taormina kenneth had entered earnestly into the search for uncle john whom he regarded most affectionately and having passed the day tramping over the mountains he would fill the evening with discussions and arguments with the nieces concerning the fate of their missing uncle  but as the days dragged wearily away the search slackened and was finally abandoned kenneth set up his easel in the garden and began to paint old etna with its wreath of snow and the soft gray cloud of vapor that perpetually hovered over it  anyone with half a soul could paint that said patsy and as a proof of her assertion the boy did very well indeed except that his uneasiness on mr merricks account served to distract him more or less  nor was kenneth the only uneasy one mr watson hardheaded man of resource as he was grew more and more dejected as he realized the impossibility of interesting the authorities in the case the sicilian officials were silent and uncommunicative the italians wholly indifferent if strangers came to taormina and got into difficulties the government was in no way to blame it was their duty to tolerate tourists but those all too energetic foreigners must take care of themselves  probably mr watson would have cabled the state department at washington for assistance had he not expected each day to put him in communication with his friend and in the end he congratulated himself upon his patience the close of the week brought a sudden and startling change in the situation  the girls sat on the shaded terrace one afternoon watching the picture of etna grow under kenneths deft touches when they observed a child approaching them with shy diffidence it was a beautiful sicilian boy with wonderful brown eyes and a delicate profile after assuring himself that the party of young americans was quite separate from any straggling guest of the hotel the child came near enough to say in a low tone  i have a message from signor merrick  they crowded around him eagerly then raining questions from every side but the boy shrank away and said warningly  if we are overheard signorini mia it will be very bad no one must suspect that i am here  is my uncle well asked patsy imploringly  quite well mees  and have you also news of count ferralti anxiously enquired louise  oh ferralti he is better some teeth are knocked out but he eats very well without them replied the child with an amused laugh  where are our friends my lad kenneth asked  i cannot describe the place signore but here are letters to explain all the child produced a bulky package and after a glance at each in turn placed it in patsys hands read very secretly signorini and decide your course of action tomorrow i will come for your answer in the meantime confide in no one but yourselves if you are indiscreet you alone will become the murderers of signor merrick and the sad young ferralti  who are you asked beth examining the child closely  i am called tato signorina mia  where do you live  it is all explained in the letters believe me  beth glanced at patricia who was examining the package and now all crowded around for a glimpse of uncle johns wellknown handwriting the wrapper was inscribed       to miss doyle miss de graf and miss merrick                                  hotel castelloamare taormina        by the safe hands of tato  inside were two letters one addressed to louise personally she seized this and ran a little distance away while beth took uncle johns letter from patsys trembling hands and having opened it read aloud in a clear and composed voice the following       my dear nieces and also my dear friends silas watson and      kenneth forbes if they are with you greeting you have      perhaps been wondering at my absence which i will explain      by saying that i am visiting a noble acquaintance in a very      cozy and comfortable retreat which i am sure would look      better from a distance my spirits and health are a no 1      and it is my intention to return to you as soon as you have      executed a little commission for me which i want you to do      exactly as i hereby instruct you in other words if you      dont execute the commission you will probably execute me       i have decided to purchase a valuable antique ring from my      host at a price of fifty thousand dollars which trifling      sum i must have at once to complete the transaction for      until full payment is made i cannot rejoin you therefore      you must hasten to raise the dough heres the programme my      dear girls one of you must go by first train to messina and      cable isham marvin  co to deposit with the new york      correspondents of the banca commerciale italiana fifty      thousand dollars and have instructions cabled to the      messina branch of that bank to pay the sum to the written      order of john merrick this should all be accomplished      within twentyfour hours present the enclosed order      together with my letter of credit and passport which will      identify my signature and draw the money in cash return      with it to taormina and give it secretly to the boy tato      who will bring it to me i will rejoin you within three      hours after i have paid for the ring       this may seem a strange proceeding to you my dears but      you must not hesitate to accomplish itif you love me      should my old friend silas watson be now with you as i      expect him to be he will assist you to do my bidding for      he will be able to realize better than i can now explain      how important it is to me       also i beg you to do a like service for count ferralti who      is entrusting his personal commission to louise he also      must conclude an important purchase before he can return to      taormina       more than this i am not permitted to say in this letter      confide in no stranger or official of any sort and act as      secretly and quietly as possible i hope soon to be with      you       very affectionately         uncle john  what does it all mean asked patsy bewildered when beth had finished reading  why it is clear enough im sure said kenneth uncle john is imprisoned by brigands and the money he requires is his ransom we must get it as soon as possible you know and luckily he is so rich that he wont miss this little draft at all  beth sat silent angrily staring at the letter  i suppose said patsy hesitating the robbers will do the dear uncle some mischief if he doesnt pay  just knock him on the head thats all said the boy but theres no need to worry we can get the money easily  suddenly beth jumped up  wheres that girl she demanded sharply  what girl  tato  tato my dear coz is a boy answered kenneth and he disappeared ages ago  you must be blind said beth scornfully not to recognize a girl when you see one a boy indeed  why he dressed like a boy replied kenneth hesitatingly  so much the more disgraceful sniffed beth she belongs to those brigands i suppose  looks something like victor valdi said patsy thoughtfully  il duca of course i see it myself now patricia it is that wicked duke who has captured uncle john  i had guessed that declared patsy smiling  he must be a handsome rascal observed kenneth for the child is pretty as a picture  he isnt handsome at all replied beth but there is a look about the childs eyes that reminds me of him  thats it exactly agreed patsy  louise now approached them with a white frightened face  isnt it dreadful she moaned they are going to kill ferralti unless he gives them thirty thousand dollars  and i dont believe he can raise thirty cents said patsy calmly  oh yes he can answered louise beginning to cry hihisfather is ddead and has left himafortune  dont blubber lou said the boy chidingly in that case your dago friend is as well off as need be but i suppose youre afraid the noaccount count wont figure his life is worth thirty thousand dollars it does seem like an awful price to pay for a foreigner  it isnt that said louise striving to control her emotion he says he hates to be robbed he wouldnt pay a penny if he could help it  good for the count i dont blame him a bit exclaimed beth it is a beastly shame that free born americans should be enslaved by a crew of thieving sicilians and obliged to purchase their freedom  true for you said kenneth nodding but what are we going to do about it  pay of course decided patsy promptly our uncle john is too precious to be sacrificed for all the money in the world come lets go and find mr watson we ought not to lose a moments time  the lawyer read uncle johns letter carefully as well as the one from count ferralti which louise confided to him with the request that he keep the young mans identity a secret for a time until he could reveal it to her cousins in person  the only thing to be done announced mr watson is to carry out these instructions faithfully we can send the cable messages from here and in the morning louise and i will take the train for messina and remain there until we get the money  its an outrage cried beth  of course my dear but it cant be helped and your uncle is wise to take the matter so cheerfully after all it is little enough to pay for ones life and liberty and our friend is so wealthy that he will never feel the loss at all  it isnt that its the principle of the thing that i object to said the girl its downright disgraceful to be robbed so easily  to be sure but the disgrace is italys not ours object all you want to beth dear continued the old lawyer smiling at her but nevertheless well pay as soon as possible and have done with it what we want now is your uncle john and we want him mighty badly  really the pirates didnt charge enough for him added patsy  so mr watson sent the cables to john merricks bankers and count ferraltis attorney and the next morning went with louise to messina  frascatti drove all the party down the road to the station at giardini and as the train pulled out beth who had remained seated in the victoria with patricia and kenneth suddenly stood up to pull the vetturinos sleeve  tell me frascatti she whispered isnt that il ducas child lookthat little one standing in the corner  why yes it is really tato answered the man before he thought to deny it  very well you may now drive us home returned beth a shade of triumph in her voice     chapter xxiii  beth begins to plot   once back in their sittingroom behind closed doors beth patsy and kenneth got their three heads together and began eagerly to discuss a plot which beth had hinted of on the way home and now unfolded in detail and while they still whispered together a knock at the door startled them and made them look rather guilty until the boy answered the call and admitted little tato  the childs beautiful face wore a smile of demure satisfaction as tato bowed respectfully to the young americans  kenneth winked at beth from behind the visitors back  as you have a guest he remarked with a yawn that was somewhat rude i shall now go and take my nap  what do you sleep so early in the day you lazybones asked patsy brightly  any time my dear is good enough for an overworked artist he replied au revoir my cousins see you at luncheon  with this he strolled away and when he had gone beth said to tato  wont you sit down signorina  do you mean me asked the child as if surprised  yes i can see plainly that you are a girl  and a pretty one too my dear added patsy  tato blushed as if embarrassed but in a moment smiled upon the american girls  do you think me immodest then she asked anxiously  by no means my dear beth assured her i suppose you have an excellent reason for wearing boys clothes  so i have signorina i live in the mountains where dresses catch in the crags and bother a girl and my father has always been heartbroken because he had no son and likes to see me in this attire he has many errands for me too where a boy may go unnoticed yet a girl would attract too much attention this is one of the errands signorini but now tell me if you please how have you decided to answer the letters of signor merrick and signor ferralti  oh there was but one way to answer them tato replied beth composedly we have sent mr watson and our cousin louise merrick to messina to get the money if our friends in america act promptly mr watson and louise will return by tomorrow afternoons train and be prepared to make the payment  that is well signorina responded tato  we are to give the money to you i suppose said patsy  yes i will return for it tomorrow afternoon answered the child with businesslike gravity then she looked earnestly from one to the other of the two girls you must act discreetly in the meantime you know you must not talk to anyone or do anything to imperil your uncles safety  of course not tato  i beg you not signorini the uncle is a good man and brave i do not wish him to be injured  nor do we tato  and the young man is not a coward either he has been kind to me but he is sad and not so pleasant to talk with as the uncle  true enough tato said beth  patsy had been examining the child with curious intentness the little one was so lovely and graceful and her voice sounded so soft and womanly that patsy longed to take her in her arms and hug her  how old are you dear she asked  tato saw the friendly look and answered with a smile  perhaps as old as you signorina although i am so much smaller i shall be fifteen in a month  so old  tato laughed merrily  ah you might well say so young amico mia to be grown up is much nicer do you not think so and then i shall not look such a baby as now and have people scold me when i get in the way as they do little bambini  but when you are grown you cannot wear boys clothing either  tato sighed  we have a saying in sicily that each year has its sunshine and rain which means its sorrow and its joy she answered perhaps i sometimes think more of the tears than of the laughter although i know that is wrong not always shall i be a mountaineer and then the soft dresses of the young girls shall be my portion will i like them better i do not know but i must go now instead of chattering here farewell signorini until tomorrow  will you not remain with us  oh no although you are kind i am expected home but tomorrow i will come for the money you will be silent  surely tato  the child smiled upon them pleasantly it was a relief to deal with two tender girls instead of cold and resentful men such as she had sometimes met at the door she blew a kiss to them and darted away  in the courtyard frascatti saw her gliding out and discreetly turned his head the other way  tato took the old road circling around the theatre and through the narrow winding streets of the lower town to the catania gate she looked back one or twice but no one noticed her if any of the villagers saw her approaching they slipped out of her path  once on the highway however tato became lost in reflection her mission being successfully accomplished it required no further thought but the sweet young american girls had made a strong impression upon the lonely sicilian maid and she dreamed of their pretty gowns and ribbons their fresh and comely faces and the gentleness of their demeanor  tato was not gentle she was wild and free and boyish and had no pretty gowns whatever but what then she must help her father to get his fortune and then he had promised her that some day they would go to paris or cairo and live in the world and be brigands no longer  she would like that she thought as she clambered up the steep paths and perhaps she would meet these american girls again or others like them and make them her friends she had never known a girl friend as yet  these ambitions would yesterday have seemed far in the dim future but now that her stern old grandmother was gone it was possible her father would soon fulfill his promises while the duchessa lived she ruled them all and she was a brigand to the backbone now her fathers will prevailed and he could refuse his child nothing  kenneth was not an expert detective but he had managed to keep tato in sight without being suspected by her he had concealed himself near the catania gate through which he knew she must pass and by good luck she had never looked around once so intent were her musings  when she came to the end of the path and leaned against the rock to sing the broken refrain which was the open sesame to the valley the boy was hidden snug behind a boulder where he could watch her every movement  then the rock opened tato passed in and the opening closed behind her  kenneth found a foothold and climbed up the wall of rock higher and higher until at last he crept upon a high ridge and looked over  the hidden valley lay spread before him in all its beauty but the precipice at his feet formed a sheer drop of a hundred feet or more and he drew back with a shudder  then he took courage to look again and observed the house on the porch of which stood tato engaged in earnest conversation with a tall dark sicilian uncle john was nowhere to be seen but the boy understood that he was there nevertheless and realized that his prison was so secure that escape was impossible  and now he climbed down again a much more difficult feat than getting up but although he was forced to risk his life several times he was agile and clearheaded and finally dropped to the path that led to the secret door of the passage  his next thought was to mark the exact location of the place so that he could find it again and as he returned slowly along the paths through the rocky fissures he took mental note of every curve and communication and believed he could now find his way to the retreat of the brigands at any time he chose     chapter xxiv  patsys new friend   i must say that i dont like the job said patsy the next morning as she stood by the window and faced beth and kenneth suppose we fail  in the bright lexicon of youth  shut up ken if we fail said beth we will be no worse off than before  and if we win added the boy theyll think twice before they try to rob americans again  well im with you anyhow declared patricia i can see its risky all right but as you say no great harm will be done if we slip up  you announced beth gravely must be the captain  it isnt in me dear you figured the thing out and ken and i will follow your lead  no said beth decidedly im not quick enough either in thought or action to be a leader patsy and theres a bit of deception required that i couldnt manage that clever little thing tato would know at once i was up to some mischief but she would never suspect you  i like that compliment replied patricia i may deserve it of course but it strikes me louise is the one best fitted for such work  we cant let louise into this plot said the boy positively shed spoil it all  dont be silly patsy said beth youre genuine and frank and the child likes you i could see that yesterday all you have to do is to be nice to her and win her confidence and then when the climax comes you must be the spokesman and talk straight out from the shoulder you can do that all right  ill bet on her cried kenneth with an admiring look at the girl  then said patsy it is all arranged and im the captain and is it agreed that we wont lisp a word to mr watson or louise  not a word  here said kenneth drawing a revolver from his pocket is uncle johns popgun its the only one i could find in his room so he must have taken the other with him be careful of it patsy for its loaded all round can you shoot  no but i suppose the pistol can i know enough to pull the trigger  and when you do remember to point it away from your friends now hide it my dear and be careful of it  patsy concealed the weapon in the bosom of her dress not without making a wry face and shivering a bit  have you got your revolver beth asked the boy  yes  and she can shoot just wonderfully exclaimed patsy yesterday she picked an orange off a tree with a bullet you should have seen her  i know said ken nodding ive seen beth shoot before and shes our main reliance in this conspiracy for my part i can hit a mark sometimes and sometimes i cant see here he exhibited a beautiful pearl and silvermounted weapon which he drew from his pocket mr watson and i have carried revolvers ever since we came to sicily but weve never had occasion to use them i can hardly believe even now that this beautiful place harbors brigands its such a romantic incident in our prosaic world of today and now young ladies we are armed to the teeth and can defy an army eh captain pat  if youre not more respectful said the girl ill have you courtmarshalled and drummed out of camp  on the afternoon train came louise and mr watson from messina the american agents had responded promptly and the bank had honored the orders and delivered the money without delay  it is all safe in my satchel said the lawyer as they rode together to the hotel and our dear friends are as good as rescued already its pretty bulky kennethfour hundred thousand lirabut it is all in notes on the banca ditalia for we couldnt manage gold  quite a haul for the brigand observed kenneth thoughtfully  true but little enough for the lives of two men that is the way i look at the transaction and since our friends can afford the loss we must be as cheerful over the thing as possible it might have been a tragedy you know  louise shivered  im glad it is all over she said gratefully  the conspirators looked at one another and smiled but held their peace  arriving at the hotel beth and kenneth at once disappeared saying they were going to town as they would not be needed longer patsy accompanied their cousin and the lawyer to the sittingroom where presently tato came to them  well little one said the lawyer pleasantly we have secured the money required to enable mr merrick to purchase the ring and mrercount ferralti to buy his bracelet will you count it  yes signore if you please replied tato with a sober face  mr watson drew out two packages of bank notes and placed them upon the table the child realizing the importance of the occasion carefully counted each bundle and then replaced the wrappers  the amounts are correct signore she said i thank you for making my task so easy and now i will go  the lawyer brought a newspaper and wrapped the money in it once again  it is always dangerous to carry so much money said he but now no one will be likely to suspect the contents of your package  tato smiled  no one would care to molest me she said for they fear those that protect me good afternoon signore your friends will be with you in time to dine in your company good afternoon signorini turning to patsy and louise  ill walk a little way with you may i asked patsy smiling into tatos splendid eyes  to be sure signorina was the quick response  patricia caught up a sunshade and followed the child out at the side entrance which was little used tato took the way along the old road and patsy walked beside her chatting brightly of the catacombs the norman villa that showed its checkered tower above the trees and the ancient wall that still hemmed in the little village  i love taormina she said earnestly and shall be sorry to leave it you must be very happy tato to be able to live here always  it is my birthplace she said but i long to get away from it and see other countries the view is fine they say but it tires me the air is sweet and pure but it oppresses me the climate is glorious but i have had enough of it in other places there is novelty and many things that sicily knows nothing of  that is true replied patsy tucking the little ones arm underneath her own with a sympathetic gesture i know just how you feel tato you must come to america some day and visit me i will make you very welcome dear and you shall be my friend  the child looked into her face earnestly  you do not hate me signorina becausebecause  because why  because my errand to you has been so lawless andandunfriendly  ah tato you do not choose this life do you  no signorina  it is forced on you by circumstances is it not  truly signorina  i know you would not long so wistfully to change your condition if you enjoyed being a little brigand but nothing that has passed must interfere with our friendship dear if i were in your place you see i would do just as you have done it is not a very honest life tato nor one to be proud of but im not going to blame you one bit  they had passed the catania gate and reached the foot of one of the mountain paths tato paused hesitatingly  oh ill go a little farther said patsy promptly no one will notice two girls you know shall i carry your parcel for a time  no replied the child hugging it close with her disengaged arm but she offered no objection when patsy continued to walk by her side  have you any brothers or sisters tato  no signorina  have you a mother  no signorina my father and i are alone  i know him well tato we were on the ship together crossing the ocean he was gruff and disagreeable but i made him talk to me and smile  i know he has told me of the signorina patsy he is fond of you  yet he robbed my uncle  the child flushed and drew away her arm  that is it that is why you should hate me she replied bitterly i know it is robbery and brigandage although my father masks it by saying he sells antiques until now i have seen nothing wrong in this life signorina but you have made me ashamed  why dear  because you are so good and gentle and so forgiving  patsy laughed  in reality tato i am resentful and unforgiving you will find out soon that i am a very human girl and then i will not make you ashamed but your fathers business is shameful nevertheless  tato was plainly puzzled and knew not what to reply but just then they reached the end of the crevasse and the child said  you must return now signorina patsy  but why cannot i go on with you and come back with my uncle  tato hesitated accustomed as she was to duplicity and acting in her capacity as lure for her thieving father the child was just now softened by patsys kindly manner and the successful accomplishment of her mission she had no thought of any treachery or deception on the part of the american girl and the request seemed to her natural enough  if you like she decided you may come as far as the barrier and there wait for your uncle it will not be long  very well dear  tato clambered over the dividing rock and dropped into the path beyond patsy sprang lightly after her a short distance farther and they reached the barrier  this is the place signorina you will sit upon that stone and wait until your uncle appears she hesitated and then added softly i may not see you again but you will not forget me  never tato and if you come to america you must not forget to visit me remember whatever happens that we are friends and must always remain so  the child nodded gratefully then leaning against the face of the cliff she raised her voice and warbled clearly the bit of song that served as the signal to her father     chapter xxv  turning the tables   no sooner had the notes ceased than kenneth sprang from behind a rock that had concealed him and grasped the child in his strong arms trying to cover her mouth at the same time to prevent her from crying out  tato developed surprising strength the adventure of yesterday had so thoroughly frightened her that when she found herself again seized she struggled madly the boy found that he could scarcely hold her so he enfolded her in both his arms and letting her scream as she might picked up her tiny form and mounted the slope of the hill leaping from rock to rock until he came to a broad boulder twenty feet or more above the path here he paused panting and awaited results  the rock doors had opened promptly even while kenneth struggled with the brigands daughter patsy could see straight through the tunnel and into the valley beyond the child had dropped her bundle in the effort to escape and while kenneth was leaping with her up the crags patsy ran forward and secured the money returning quickly to her position facing the tunnel  and now they heard shouts and the sound of hastening feet as il duca ran from the tunnel followed closely by two of his brigands they paused a moment at the entrance as if bewildered but when the father saw his child in the grasp of a stranger and heard her screams he answered with a roar of fury and prepared to scramble up the rock to rescue her  that was where patsy showed her mettle she hastily covered the brigand with her revolver and shouted warningly  stop or you are a dead man  it was wonderfully dramatic and effective  il duca shrank back scowling for he had no weapon at hand leaning against the entrance to his valley he glared around to determine the number of his foes and the probable chance of defeating them  kenneth laughed boyishly at his discomfiture kneeling down the youth grasped tato by both wrists and lowered her body over the edge of the rock so that her feet just touched a little ledge beneath he continued to hold fast to her wrists though and there she remained stretched against the face of the rock fronting the path in full view of all but still unable to move  from this exasperating sight il duca glanced at patsy she was holding the revolver rigidly extended and her blue eyes blazed with the excitement of the moment it was a wonder she did not pull the trigger inadvertently and the thought that she might do so caused the brigand to shudder  turning half around he beheld a third enemy quietly seated upon the rocks directly across the path from kenneth her pose unconcerned as she rested her chin lightly upon her left hand it was beth who held her revolver nonchalantly and gazed upon the scene below her with calm interest  the duke gave a cough to clear his throat his men hung back of him silent and motionless for they did not like this absolute and dangerous defiance of their chief  tell me then tato he called in english what is the cause of this trouble  i do not know my father except that these are friends of signor merrick who have secretly followed me here  the carefully arranged programme gave patsy a speech at this point but she had entirely forgotten it  let me explain said beth coldly you have dared to detain in your robbers den the persons of mr merrick and count ferralti you have also demanded a ransom for their release that is brigandage which is denounced by the laws of sicily we have appealed to the authorities but they are helpless to assist us therefore being americans we have decided to assist ourselves we command you to deliver to us on this spot safe and uninjured the persons of our friends and that without any unnecessary delay  the duke listened with a sneer  and if we refuse signorina  if you refuseif you do not obey at oncei swear that i will shoot your child tato whose body yonder awaits my bullet and afterward i shall kill you  as she spoke she levelled the revolver and aimed it carefully at the exposed body of the child  the brigand paled and grasped the rock to steady himself  bah no girl can shoot from that distance he exclaimed scornfully  indeed take care of your finger called beth and a shot echoed sharply along the mountain side  the brigand jumped and uttered a yell at the same time whipping his right hand underneath his left arm for beths bullet had struck one of his fingers and then flattened itself against the cliff  that settled all argument as far as il duca was concerned for he now had ample evidence that the sterneyed girl above him could shoot and was not to be trifled with all his life he had ruled by the terror of his threats today he was suddenly vanquished by a determination he dared not withstand  enough he cried have your way  he spoke to his men in italian and they hastened through the tunnel glad to escape  following their departure there was a brief silence during which all stood alert then tato still half suspended against the cliff said in a clear soft voice  father if you think you can escape let them shoot me and keep your prisoners the money for their ransom i brought to this place and they will pay it even yet to save their friends from your vengeance do not let these wild americans defeat us i beg of you i am not afraid save yourself and let them shoot me if they will  kenneth afterward declared that he thought the jig was up then for they had no intention whatever of harming tato it was all merely a bit of american bluff and it succeeded because the brigand was a coward and dared not emulate his daughters courage  no no tato cried the duke brokenly as he wrung his hands in anguish there is more money to be had but i have only one child they shall not harm a hair of your head my pretty one  patsy wanted to yell bravo but wisely refrained her eyes were full of tears though and her resolution at ebb tide  fortunately the men had made haste they returned with surprising promptness pushing the amazed prisoners before them  uncle john as he emerged from the tunnel looked around upon the tragic scene and gasped  well i declare  count ferralti was more composed if equally surprised he lifted his hat politely to beth and patsy and smiled with great satisfaction  you are free said il duca harshly go  they lost no time in getting the brigands between themselves and the mouth of the tunnel and then kenneth gently drew tato to a place beside him and assisted her to clamber down the path  good bye little one he said pleasantly youre what we call a brick in our country i like you and im proud of you  tato did not reply with streaming eyes she was examining her fathers shattered hand and sobbing at sight of the blood that dripped upon the rocks at his feet  get inside called beth sharply and close up that rock lively now  the girl who could shoot still sat toying with her revolver and the mountaineers obeyed her injunction the rock promptly closed and the group of americans was left alone  then beth came slowly down to where patsy was hugging uncle john in a wild frenzy of delight and count ferralti was shaking kenneths hand with a face eloquent of emotion  come said she her voice sounding faint and weary let us get away from here it was a pretty game while it lasted but ill feel safer when we are home again wheres the money  ive got it said kenneth holding up the package  what didnt you pay demanded uncle john astounded  of course not dear said patsy gleefully did you think your nieces would let you be robbed by a bunch of dagoes  ferralti caught hold of beths swaying form  look after your cousin he said sharply i think she has fainted     chapter xxvi  the count unmasks   and now said uncle john as he sat in their cosy sittingroom propped in an easy chair with his feet upon a stool its about time for you to give an account of yourselves you young rascals  they had eaten a late but very satisfactory dinner at the castelloamare where the return of the missing ones was hailed with joy by the proprietor and his assistants even the little bewhiskered headwaiter who resembled a jackinthebox more than he did a man strove to celebrate the occasion by putting every good thing the house afforded before the returned guests for although they dared not interfere to protect the victims of the terrible il duca the hotel people fully recognized the fact that brigandage was not a good advertisement for taormina and hoped the little incident would not become generally known  old silas watson dignified lawyer as he was actually danced a hornpipe when he beheld his old friend safe and sound but he shook his head reproachfully when he learned of the adventure his ward and the two girls had undertaken with such temerity but marvelous success  beth had quickly recovered from her weakness although kenneth had insisted on keeping her arm all the way home but the girl had been silent and thoughtful and would eat nothing at dinner  when they had gathered in their room to talk it all over the lawyer thought his young friends deserved a reproof  the money wasnt worth the risk you crazy lunatics he said  it wasnt the money at all replied patsy demurely  no  it was the principle of the thing and wasnt beth just wonderful though  shucks said kenneth she had to go and faint like a ninny and she cried all the way home because she had hurt the brigands finger  the girls eyes were still red but she answered the boys scornful remark by saying gravely  i am sorry it had to be done ill never touch a revolver again as long as i live  uncle john gathered his brave niece into an ample embrace  im very proud of you my dear he said stroking her hair lovingly and you mustnt pay any attention to that silly boy ive always known you were true blue beth and now you have proved it to everyone it may have been a reckless thing to do as mr watson says but you did it like a major and saved our selfesteem as well as our money  hurrah for beth yelled the boy changing his colors without a blush  if you dont shut up ill box your ears said his guardian sternly  uncle john and young ferralti were the heroes of the evening the little old gentleman smoked a big cigar and beamed upon his nieces and friends with intense satisfaction while ferralti sat glum and silent beside louise until an abrupt challenge from mr merrick effectually aroused him  ive only one fault to find with this young man was the observation referred to that he made our acquaintance under false pretenses when a fairly decent fellow becomes an impostor there is usually reason for it and i would like count ferraltior whatever his name isto give us that reason and make a clean breast of his deception  ferralti bowed with a serious face but looked significantly toward the other members of the company  whatever you have to say should be heard by all declared uncle john answering the look  perhaps you are right mr merrick and all present are entitled to an explanation answered the young man slowly i may have been foolish but i believe i have done nothing that i need be ashamed of fortunately there is now no further reason for concealment on my part and in listening to my explanation i hope you will be as considerate as possible  they were attentive enough by this time and every eye was turned not unkindly upon the youth who had so long been an enigma to them allexcept perhaps to louise  i am an american by birth and my name is arthur weldon  in the pause that followed uncle john gave a soft whistle and patsy laughed outright to the undisguised indignation of louise  years ago resumed the youth my father who was a rich man made a trip to sicily and although i did not know this until recently was seized by brigands and imprisoned in the hidden valley we have just left there he fell in love with a beautiful girl who was the daughter of the female brigand known as the duchess of alcanta and who assisted him to escape and then married him it was a pretty romance at the time but when my father had taken his bride home to new york and became immersed in the details of his business his love grew cold and he began to neglect his wife cruelly he became a railway president and amassed a great fortune but was not so successful a husband as he was a financier the result was that the sicilian girl after some years of unhappiness and suffering deserted him and returned to her own country leaving her child then three years old behind her to be frank with you it was said at the time that my mothers mind had become unbalanced or she would not have abandoned me to the care of a loveless father but i prefer to think that she had come to hate her husband so bitterly that she could have no love for his child or else she feared that her terrible mother would kill me if i came into her power her flight mattered little to my father except that it made him more stern and tyrannical toward me he saw me very seldom and confided my education to servants so i grew up practically unloved and uncared for and when the proper time arrived i was sent to college my father now gave me an ample allowance and at the close of my college career called me into his office and ordered me to enter the employ of the railway company i objected to this i did not like the business and had other plans for my future but he was stubborn and dictatorial and when i continued unsubmissive he threatened to cast me off entirely and leave his fortune to charity since he had no other near relatives he must have thought better of this decision afterward for he gave me a year to decide whether or not i would obey him at the end of that time he declared i would become either a pauper or his heir at my option  it was during this year that i formed the acquaintance of your niece miss merrick and grew to love her devotedly louise returned my affection but her mother learning of my quarrel with my father refused to sanction our engagement until i was acknowledged his heir i was forbidden her house but naturally we met elsewhere and when i knew she was going to europe with you sir who had never seen me we hit upon what we thought was a happy and innocent plan to avoid the long separation i decided to go to europe also and without you or your other nieces suspecting my identity attach myself to your party and enjoy the society of louise while she remained abroad so i followed you on the next ship and met you at sorrento where i introduced myself as count ferraltia name we had agreed i should assume before we parted in america  the rest of my story you know my father was killed in an accident on his own railroad and i received the news while we were prisoners of the brigand whom i discovered to be my uncle but who had no mercy upon me because of the relationship tonight on my return here i found a letter from my fathers attorney forwarded from my bankers in paris through my fathers sudden death i have inherited all his wealth as he had no time to alter his will therefore mrs merricks objection to me is now removed and louise has never cared whether i had a penny or not  he halted as if not knowing what more to say and the little group of listeners remained quiet because it seemed that no remark from them was necessary young weldon however was ill at ease and after hitching nervously in his chair he addressed uncle john in these words  sir you are the young ladys guardian for the present as she is in your charge i therefore ask your consent to our formal engagement  not any said uncle john decidedly ill sanction no engagement of any children on this trip you are wrong in supposing i am louises guardianim just her chum and uncle its like cradlesnatching to want to marry a girl of sixteen and you ought to be ashamed of yourself for you cant be much more than twentyone yourself while louise is in my care i wont have any entanglements of any sort so youll have to wait till you get home and settle the business with her mother  very wise and proper sir said mr watson nodding gravely  louises cheeks were flaming  do you intend to drive arthur away uncle she asked  why should i my dear except that youve both taken me for a blind old idiot and tried to deceive me let the boy stay with us if he wants to but hell have to cut out all lovemaking and doubledealing from this time onor ill take you home in doublequick time  the young man seemed to resent the indictment  the deception seemed necessary at the time sir he said and you must not forget the old adage that alls fair in love and war but i beg that you will forgive us both and overlook our fault if fault it was hereafter it is our desire to be perfectly frank with you in all things  that was a good way to disarm uncle johns anger and the result was immediately apparent  very good said the old gentleman if you are proper and obedient children ive no objection to your being together i rather like you arthur weldon and most of your failings are due to the foolishness of youth but youve got to acquire dignity now for you have suddenly become a man of consequence in the world dont think youve got to marry every girl that attracts you by her pretty face this devotion to louise may be puppylove after all and  oh uncle came a chorus of protest  what you rascals are you encouraging this desperate folderol  you are too severe uncle john said patsy smiling the trouble with you is that youve never been in love yourself  never been in love he beamed upon the three girls with devotion written all over his round jolly face  then youre jealous said kenneth give the poor kids a fair show uncle john  all right i will arthur my lad join our happy family as one of my kidlets and love us allbut no one in particular eh until we get home again you know weve started out to have the time of our lives and were getting it in chunkseh girls  we certainly are uncle john another chorus  well what do you say arthur weldon  perhaps you are right sir answered the young man and anyway i am deeply grateful for your kindness i fear i must return home in a couple of weeks to look after business matters but while i remain with you i shall try to conduct myself as you wish  that sounds proper is it satisfactory to you louise  yes uncle  then weve settled cupidfor a time anyway and now my dears i think we have all had enough of taormina where shall we go next     chapter xxvii  tato is adopted   they canvassed the subject of their future travels with considerable earnestness uncle john was bent upon getting to rome and venice and from there to paris and the nieces were willing to go anywhere he preferred as they were sure to enjoy every day of their trip in the old world but mr watson urged them strongly to visit syracuse since they were not likely to return to sicily again and the most famous of all the ancient historic capitals was only a few hours journey from taormina so it was finally decided to pass a week in syracuse before returning to the continent and preparations were at once begun for their departure  kenneth pleaded for one more day in which to finish his picture of etna and this was allowed him uncle john nevertheless confessed to being uneasy as long as they remained on the scene of his recent exciting experiences mr watson advised them all not to stray far from the hotel as there was no certainty that il duca would not make another attempt to entrap them or at least to be revenged for their escape from his clutches  on the afternoon of the next day however they were startled by a call from the duke in person he was dressed in his usual faded velvet costume and came to them leading by the hand a beautiful little girl  the nieces gazed at the child in astonishment  tato wore a gray cloth gown illfitting and of coarse material but no costume could destroy the fairylike perfection of her form or the daintiness of her exquisite features with downcast eyes and a troubled expression she stood modestly before them until patsy caught her rapturously in her arms and covered her face with kisses  you lovely lovely thing she cried im so glad to see you again tato darling  the dukes stern features softened he sighed heavily and accepted uncle johns polite invitation to be seated  the little party of americans was fairly astounded by this unexpected visit kenneth regretted that he had left his revolver upstairs but the others remembered that the brigand would not dare to molest them in the security of the hotel grounds and were more curious than afraid  il ducas hand was wrapped in a bandage but the damaged finger did not seem to affect him seriously beth could not take her eyes off this dreadful evidence of her late conflict and stared at it as if the bandage fascinated her  signore said the duke addressing uncle john especially i owe to you my apologies and my excuses for the annoyance i have caused to you and your friends i have the explanation if you will so kindly permit me  fire away duke was the response  signore i unfortunately come of a race of brigands for centuries my family has been lawless and it was natural that by education i too should become a brigand in my youth my father was killed in an affray and my mother took his place seizing many prisoners and exacting from them ransom my mother you have seen and you know of her sudden madness and of her death she was always mad i think and by nature a fiend she urged my elder brother to wicked crimes and when he rebelled she herself cast him in a fit of anger into the pit i became duke in his place and did my mothers bidding because i feared to oppose her but for years i have longed to abandon the life and have done with crime  with me our race ends for i have no sons but my one child whom you know as tato i love dearly my greatest wish is to see her happy the last few days have changed the fortunes of us both the duchessa is gone and at last i am the master of my own fate as for tato she has been charmed by the young american signorini and longs to be like them so we come to ask that you forgive the wrong we did you and that you will now allow us to be your friends  uncle john was amazed  you have decided to reform duke he asked  yes signore not alone for tatos sake but because i loathe the life of brigandage see here is my thought at once i will disband my men and send them away my household effects i will sell and then abandon the valley forever tato and i have some money enough to live in quiet in some other land where we shall be unknown  a very good idea duke  but from my respect for you signer merreek and from my daughters love for your niecesthe brave and beautiful signorinii shall dare to ask from you a favor but already i am aware that we do not deserve it  what is it sir  that you take my tato to keep for a few weeks until i can send away my men and arrange my affairs here it would be unpleasant for the child here and with you she will be so happy i would like the sweet signorini to buy nice dresses like those they themselves wear for my little girl and to teach her the good manners she could not gain as the brigands daughter tato has the money to pay for everything but the kindness if you will let her stay in your society until i can claim her i am aware that i ask too much but the signorina patsy has said to my child that they would always be friends whatever might happen and as i know you to be generous i have dared to come to you with this request i only ask your friendship for my tato who is innocent for myself after i have become a good man then perhaps you will forgive me too  uncle john looked thoughtful the old lawyer was grave and listened silently patsy her arms still around the shrinking form of the child looked pleadingly at her uncle beths eyes were moist and louise smiled encouragingly  well my dears the duke is certainly not entitled to our friendship as he truly says but i have nothing against little tato what do you advise  let us keep her and dress her like the beautiful doll she is and love her cried patsy  she shall be our adopted cousin said louise  tato is good stuff declared kenneth  well beth  it seems to me uncle said the girl seriously that if the duke really wishes to reform we should give him a helping hand the little girl has led a bad life only because her father forced her to lure his victims and then procure the money for their ransoms but i am sure her nature is sweet and pure and she is so young that she will soon forget the evil things she has learned so i vote with my cousins let us adopt tato and care for her until her father can introduce her into a new and more proper life  well argued beth said uncle john approvingly i couldnt have put the case better myself what do you say silas watson  that you are all quite right answered the old lawyer and the best part of the whole thing to me is the fact that this nest of brigands will be wiped out of existence and taormina be hereafter as safe for tourists as old elmhurst itself i wish i could say as much for the rest of sicily  uncle john extended his hand to the duke who took it gratefully although with a shamefaced expression that was perhaps natural under the circumstances  look up dear said patsy to the girl softly look up and kiss me youve been adopted tato are you glad     chapter xxviii  dreams and dressmaking   tato was now one of the family they left taormina the next day and frascatti drove all the girls in his victoria to the station  you must come again signorini said he looking regretful at their departure next year the fountain of the ice cream soda will be in operation like those you have in chicago which is america our culture increases with our civilization it is even hinted that il duca is to abandon our island forever he has been interesting to us but not popular and you will not miss him when you come again to find he is not here if this time he has caused you an inconvenience i am sorry it is regrettable but  but it is so said patsy laughing  tato was again transformed patricia who was the smallest of the three nieces though not especially slim had quickly altered one of her own pretty white gowns to fit the child and as she was deft with her needle and the others had enthusiastically assisted her tato now looked more like a fairy than ever  it was really wonderful what a suitable dress could do for the tiny sicilian maid she had lost her free and boyish manner and become shy and retiring with strangers although when in the society of the three nieces she was as sweet and frank as ever she wore her new gown gracefully too as if well accustomed to feminine attire all her life the only thing now needed as patsy said was time in which to grow her hair which had always been cut short in boyish fashion  they were a merry party when they boarded the train for syracuse and uncle john arranged with the guard to secure two adjoining compartments all to themselves that they might have plenty of room  where did you put the money uncle john beth whispered when at last they were whirling along and skirting the base of mt etna toward the catania side  ive hidden it in my trunk he replied in the same confidential tone there is no bank in this neighborhood to receive it so i decided to carry it with us  but will it be safe in the trunk she enquired  of course my dear who would think of looking there for fifty thousand dollars and no one knows we happen to have so much money with us  what did the counti mean mr weldondo with his ransom  carries it in his satchel so he can keep it with him and have an eye on it its a great mistake beth to do such a thing as that itll make him uneasy every minute and he wont dare to let a facchino handle his grip but in my case on the other hand i know its somewhere in the baggage car so i dont have to worry  the journey was a delightful one the road skirted the coast through the oldest and most picturesque part of sicily and it amazed them to observe that however far they travelled etna was always apparently next door and within reaching distance  at aci castello they were pointed out the seven isles of the cyclops which the blind polyphemus once hurled after the crafty ulysses then they came to catania which is the second largest city in sicily but has little of historic interest here they were really at the nearest point to the mighty volcano but did not realize it because it always seemed to be near them eighteen miles farther they passed leontinoi which in ancient days dared to rival siracusa itself and an hour later the train skirted the bay and capo santa panagia and slowly came to a halt in that city which for centuries dominated all the known world and was more powerful and magnificent in its prime than athens itselfsyracuse  the day had become cloudy and gray and the wind whistled around them with a chill sweep as they left their coach at the station and waited for kenneth to find carriages afterward they had a mile to drive to their hotel for instead of stopping in the modern town uncle john had telegraphed for rooms at the villa politi which is located in the ancient achradina at the edge of the latomia de cappuccini by the time they arrived there they were blue with cold and were glad to seek the warm rooms prepared for them and pass the remainder of the afternoon unpacking and getting settled  im afraid said patsy dolefully that we shall miss the bright sunshine and warmth of taormina tato  oh it is not always warm there nor is it always cold here replied the child indeed signorina i have heard that the climate of siracusa is very delightful  it doesnt look it returned patsy but it may improve  the interior of the hotel was comfortable though however bleak the weather might be outside a good dinner put them all in a better humor and they passed the evening watching the strangers assembled in the parlors and wondering where they had come from and who they were  that money whispered uncle john to beth as he kissed her good night is still as safe as can be ive lost the key to my trunk and now i cant even get at it myself  lost it she exclaimed  yes but that wont matter its the big trunk that holds the things i dont often use and if i cant unlock it no one else can thats certain so i shall rest easy until i need something out of it and then ill get a locksmith to pick the lock  but i wish you hadnt lost the key said the girl thoughtfully  strikes me its good luck pleasant dreams my dear i can fancy arthur weldon lying awake all night with his dreadful thirty thousand tucked under his pillow its a great mistake to carry so much money with you beth for youre sure to worry about it  the next morning when they came down to breakfast they were all amazed at the gorgeous sunshine and the genial temperature that had followed the dreary afternoon of their arrival syracuse was transformed and from every window of the hotel the brilliant glow of countless flowers invited one to wander in the gardens which are surpassed by few if any in the known world  the villa politi stood so near the edge of a monstrous quarry that it seemed as if it might topple into the abyss at any moment our friends were on historic ground indeed for these quarriesor latomia as they are calledsupplied all the stone of which the five cities of ancient syracuse were builtcities which in our age have nearly if not quite passed out of existence the walls of the quarry are a hundred feet in depth and at the bottom are now acres upon acres of the most delightful gardens whose luxuriance is attributable to the fact that they are shielded from the winds while the sun reaches them nearly all the day there are gardens on the level above and beautiful ones too but these in the deep latomia are the most fascinating  the girls could scarcely wait to finish breakfast before rushing out to descend the flights of iron steps that lead to the bottom of the vast excavation and presently they were standing on the ground below and looking up at the vine covered cliffs that shut out all of the upper world  it was peaceful here and soothing to tired nerves through blooming shrubbery and along quiet paths they might wander for hours and at every step find something new to marvel at and to delight the senses  here were ancient tombs cut from the solid rockone of them that of an american midshipman who died in syracuse and selected this impressive and lovely vault for his burial place and there stood the famous statue of archimedes who used in life to wander in this very latomia  once said mr watson musingly there were seven thousand athenian prisoners confined in this very place and allowed to perish through starvation and disease the citizens of syracuseeven the fine ladies and the little childrenused to stand on the heights above and mock at the victims of their kings cruelty  couldnt they climb out asked patsy shuddering at the thought that some of the poor prisoners might have died on the very spot her feet now trod  no dear and it is said the guards constantly patrolled the edge to slay any who might venture to make the attempt  wasnt it dreadful she exclaimed but im glad they have made a flower garden of it now somehow it reminds me of a cemetery  but there were other interesting sights to be seen at syracuse and they laid out a systematic programme of the places they would visit each morning while they remained there the afternoons were supposed to be reserved for rest but the girls were so eager to supply tato with a fitting wardrobe that they at once began to devote the afternoons to shopping and dressmaking  the child had placed in uncle johns keeping a liberally supplied purse which the duke wished to be applied to the purchase of whatever his daughter might need or desire  he wants me to dress as you do said tato simply and because you will know what is fitting my station and will be required in my future life he has burdened you with my society it was selfish in my father was it not but buti wanted so much to be with youbecause you are good to me  and were mighty glad to have you with us answered patsy its no end of fun getting a girl a whole new outfit from top to toe and aside from that we already love you as if you were our little sister  beth and louise equally endorsed this statement and indeed the child was so sweet and pretty and so grateful for the least kindness bestowed upon her that it was a pleasure to assist and counsel her  tato looked even smaller in girls clothing than in boys and she improved so rapidly in her manners by constantly watching the nieces that it was hard to imagine she had until now been all unused to polite society already they began to dread the day when her father would come to claim her and the girls and uncle john had conceived a clever plan to induce the duke to let his daughter travel with them on the continent and then go for a brief visit to them in america  by that time declared louise tatos education will be accomplished and she will be as refined and ladylike as any girl of her age we know blood will tell they say and the monk who taught her must have been an intelligent and careful man  she knows more of history and languages than all the rest of us put together added beth  and having adopted her we mustnt do the thing by halves concluded patsy so our darling little brigandess must tease her papa to let her stay with us as long as possible  tato smiled and blushed with pleasure it was very delightful to know she had such enthusiastic friends but she was afraid the duke would not like to spare her for so long a time as a visit to america would require  you leave him to me said uncle john ill argue the case clearly and logically and after that he will have to cave in gracefully  meantime the dainty gowns and pretty costumes were one by one finished and sent to the hotel and the girls ransacked the rather inadequate shops of syracuse for the smartest things in lingerie that could be procured as they were determined to try everything on and see how their protégé looked in her finery tato was now obliged to dress for dinner and on every other possible occasion and she not only astonished her friends by her loveliness but drew the eye of every stranger as surely as the magnet attracts the needle  even in sicily where the greek type of beauty today exists more perfectly than in helene there were few to compare with tato and it was only natural that the americans should be very proud of her  kenneth was sketching a bit of the quarry and the old monastery beyond it with the blue sea glimmering in the distance sometimes he would join the others in their morning trips to the catacombs the cathedrals or the museum but the afternoons he devoted to his picture and the others came to the gardens with him and sat themselves down to sew or read beside his easel  arthur weldon was behaving very well indeed and although a good deal of the credit belonged to louise who managed him with rare diplomatic ability uncle john grew to like the young man better each day and had no fault whatever to find with him  he was still rather silent and reserved but that seemed a part of his nature inherited doubtless from his father and when he chose to talk his conversation was interesting and agreeable  kenneth claimed that arthur had a bad habit of making googoo eyes at louise but the young mans manner was always courteous and judicious when addressing her and he managed to conceal his love with admirable discretionat least when others were present  uncle johns private opinion confided in secret to his friend mr watson was that louise really might do worse that is if they were both of the same mind when they grew up  and so the days passed pleasantly away and the time for their departure from syracuse drew near  on the last morning all of themwith the exception of tato who pleaded a headachedrove to the latomia del paradiso to see the celebrated ear of dionysiusthat vast cavern through which the tyrant is said to have overheard every whisper uttered by the prisoners who were confined in that quarry there is a little room at the top of the cliff also built from the rock where it is claimed dionysius sat and played eavesdropper and it is true that one in that place can hear the slightest sound uttered in the chamber below  afterward the amphitheatre and the ancient street of the tombs were paid a final visit with a stop at san giovanni where st paul once preached and at noon the tourists returned to the hotel hungry but enthusiastic in time for the tabledhote luncheon     chapter xxix  tato wins   this is funny cried patsy appearing before uncle john with a white and startled face i cant find tato anywhere  and her new trunk is gone from her room as well as her gowns and everything she owns continued beths clear voice over her cousins shoulder  uncle john stared at them bewildered then an expression of anxiety crept over his kindly face  are you sure he asked  there cant be a mistake uncle shes just gone  none of you has offended or annoyed the child i suppose  oh no uncle she kissed us all very sweetly when we left her this morning  i cant understand it  nor can we  could her father have come for her do you think suggested mr merrick after a moments thought  i cant imagine her so ungrateful as to leave us without a word said patsy i know tato well uncle and the dear child would not hurt our feelings for the world she loves us dearly  but shes a queer thing added louise and i dont trust her altogether sometimes ive surprised a look in her eyes that wasnt as innocent and demure as she would have us imagine her  oh louise  and theres another reason  what is it  she reformed too suddenly  uncle john slapped his forehead a mighty blow as a suspicious and dreadful thought flashed across his mind but next instant he drew a long breath and smiled again  it was lucky i lost that key to the trunk he observed still a little ashamed of his temporary lack of confidence in tato its been locked ever since we left taormina so the child couldnt be tempted by that  she wouldnt touch your money for the world said patsy indignantly tato is no thief  she comes of a race of thieves though beth reminded her  i wonder if arthurs money is still safe remarked louise following the line of thought suggested  as if with one accord they moved down the hall to the door of the young mans room  are you in arthur asked uncle john knocking briskly  yes sir  he opened his door at once and saw with surprise the little group of anxious faces outside  is your money safe asked uncle john  weldon gave them a startled glance and then ran to his dresser and pulled open a drawer after a moments fumbling he turned with a smile  all safe sir  uncle john and his nieces were visibly relieved  you see continued arthur ive invented a clever hidingplace because the satchel could not be left alone and i didnt wish to lug it with me every step i took so i placed the packages of bills inside the leg of a pair of trousers and put them in a drawer with some other clothing at top and bottom a dozen people might rummage in that drawer without suspecting the fact that money is hidden there ive come to believe the place is as good as a bank but you startled me for a minute with your question whats wrong  tatos gone  gone  departed bag and baggage  but your fifty thousand sir is it safe  it has to be answered uncle john it is in a steelbound doublelocked trunk to which ive lost the key no bank can beat that my boy  then why did the child run away  they could not answer that  its a mystery said patsy almost ready to weep but ill bet its that cruel wicked father of hers perhaps he came while we were out and wouldnt wait a minute  what does the hall porter say asked kenneth who had joined the group in time to overhear the last speech and guess what had happened  stupid cried uncle john we never thought of the hallporter come back to our sitting room and well have him up in a jiffy  the portiere answered his hell with alacrity the americans were liberal guests  the young lady ah she had driven away soon after they had themselves gone a thinfaced darkeyed man had called for her and taken her away placing her baggage on the box of the carriage yes she had paid her bill and tipped the servants liberally  just as i suspected cried patsy that horrid duke has forced her to leave us perhaps he was jealous and feared we would want to keep her always was she weeping and miserable porter  no signorina she laughed and was very merry andbut i had forgotten there is a letter which she left for the signorina doyle  where  in the office i will bring it at once  he ran away and quickly returned placing a rather bulky parcel in the girls hands  you read it uncle john she said there cant be anything private in tatos letter and perhaps she has explained everything  he put on his glasses and then took the missive and deliberately opened it tato wrote a fine delicate hand and although the english words were badly spelled she expressed herself quite well in the foreign tongue with the spelling and lack of punctuation corrected her letter was as follows  dear innocent foolish patsy how astonished you will be to find i have vanished from your life forever and what angry and indignant words you will hurl after poor tato but they will not reach me because you will not know in which direction to send them and i will not care whether you are angry or not  you have been good to me patsy and i really love youfully as much as i have fear of that shrewd and pretty cousin of yours whose cold eyes have made me tremble more than once but tell beth i forgive her because she is the only clever one of the lot of you louise thinks she is clever but her actions remind me of the juggler who explained his tricks before he did them so that the audience would know how skillful he was  but oh patsy what simpletons you all are and because you have been too stupid to guess the truth i must bother to write it all down for it would spoil much of my satisfaction and enjoyment if you did not know how completely i have fooled you  you tricked us that day in the mountain glen and for the first time an alcanta brigand lost his prisoners and his ransom money through being outwitted but did you think that was the end if so you failed to appreciate us  look you my dear we could have done without the money for our family has been robbing and accumulating for ages with little need to expend much from year to year it is all in the bank of italy too and drawing the interest for my father is a wise man of business that four hundred thousand lira was to have been our last ransom and after we had fairly earned it you tricked us and did not pay  so my father and i determined to get even with you as much through revenge as cupidity we were obliged to desert the valley at once because we were getting so rich that the government officials became uneasy and warned us to go or be arrested so we consulted together and decided upon our little plot which was so simple that it has worked perfectly we came to you with our sad story and you thought we had reformed and kindly adopted me as one of your party it was so easy that i almost laughed in your foolish faces but i didnt for i can act i played the child very nicely i think and you quite forgot i was a brigands daughter with the wild free blood of many brave outlaws coursing in my veins ah i am more proud of that than of my acting  innocent as i seemed i watched you all carefully and knew from almost the first hour where the money had been put i stole the key to uncle johns trunk on the train while we were going from taormina to syracuse but i did not take the money from it because i had no better place to keep it and the only danger was that he would force the lock some day but ferraltis moneyi call him ferralti because it is a prettier name than weldonbothered me for a long time at the first he would not let that little satchel out of his sight and when he finally did he had removed the money to some other place i searched his room many times but could not find his hiding place until last night while he was at dinner i discovered the bills in one of the drawers of his dresser  but for this difficulty i should have left your charming society before as my father has been secretly waiting for me for three days having located ferraltis money i waited until this morning and when you had all left me i signalled to my father from my window and prepared to disappear it took but a few minutes to get the money from uncle johns trunk and arthurs trouserleg much obliged for it im sure then i packed up all my pretty dresses in my new trunkfor part of our plot was to use your good taste in fitting me out properlyand now i am writing this loving epistle before i leave  we shall go to paris or vienna or cairo or londonguess which we shall have other namesvery beautiful onesand be rich and dignified and respected when i grow older i think i shall marry a prince and become a princess but that will not interest you much for you will not know that the great princess is your own little tato  tell uncle john i have left the key to his trunk on the mantel behind the picture of the madonna i stuffed papers into arthurs trouser leg to deceive him if he came back before i had a chance to escape but i hoped you would discover nothing until you read this letter for i wanted to surprise you have i then i am content you tricked me once but i have tricked you at the last and the final triumph is mine  in spite of all patsy dear i love you for you are sweet and good and although i would not be like you for the world i can appreciate your excellent qualities remember this when your anger is gone i wont be able to visit you in america but i shall always think of you in a more kindly way than i fear you will think of the sicilian tomboy tato     chapter xxx  a way to forget   the faces of the group as uncle john finished reading were worth studying arthur weldon was white with anger and his eyes blazed silas watson stared blankly at his old friend wondering if it was because he was growing old that he had been so easily hoodwinked by this saucy child beth was biting her lip to keep back the tears of humiliation that longed to trickle down her cheeks louise frowned because she remembered the hard things tato had said of her patsy was softly crying at the loss of her friend  then kenneth laughed and the sound sent a nervous shiver through the group  tatos a brick announced the boy audaciously cant you see you stupids that the thing is a good joke on us all or are you too thin skinned to laugh at your own expense  oh we can laugh responded uncle john gravely but if tatos a brick its because she is hard and insensible the loss of the money doesnt hurt me but to think the wicked little lass made me love her when she didnt deserve it is the hardest blow i have ever received  that made patsy sob outright while louise ejaculated with scorn the little wretch  it serves us right for having confidence in a child reared to crime and murder from the cradle said arthur rather savagely i dont know how much money i am worth but id gladly spend another thirty thousand to bring this wretched creature to justice  money wont do it declared the lawyer shaking his head regretfully the rascals are too clever to be caught in europe it would be different at home  well the best thing to do is to grin and bear it and forget the unpleasant incident as soon as possible said uncle john i feel as if id had my pocket picked by my best friend but it isnt nearly as disgraceful as being obliged to assist the thief by paying ransom money the loss amounts to nothing to either of us and such treachery thank goodness is rare in the world we cant afford to let the thing make us unhappy my friends so cheer up all of you and dont dwell upon it any more than you can help  they left syracuse a rather solemn group in spite of this wise advice and journeyed back to naples and thence to rome there was much to see here and they saw it so energetically that when they boarded the train for florence they were all fagged out and could remember nothing clearly except the coliseum and the baths of carracalla  florence was just now a bower of roses and very beautiful but kenneth lugged them to the galleries day after day until uncle john declared he hated to look an old master in the face  after all theyre only daubs he declared any tenyearold boy in america can paint better pictures  dont let anyone hear you say that dear cautioned patsy theyd think you dont know good art  but i do he protested if any of those pictures by old masters was used in a streetcar ad at home it would be money wasted for no one would look at them the people wouldnt stand for it a minute  they are wonderful for the age in which they were painted said kenneth soberly you must remember that we have had centuries in which to improve our art since then  oh ive a proper respect for old age i hope replied uncle john but to fall down and worship a thing because its grayhaired and outofdate isnt just my style all of these ohs and ahs over the old masters are rank humbug and im ashamed of the people that dont know better  and now arthur weldon was obliged to bid goodbye to louise and her friends and take a train directly to paris to catch the steamer for home his attorney advised him that business demanded his immediate presence and he was obliged to return however reluctantly  kenneth and mr watson also left the party at florence as the boy artist wished to remain there for a time to study the pictures that uncle john so bitterly denounced the others went on to venice which naturally proved to the nieces one of the most delightful places they had yet seen mr merrick loved it because he could ride in a gondola and rest his stubby legs which had become weary with tramping through galleries and cathedrals these last monuments by the way had grown to become a sort of nightmare to the little gentleman the girls were enthusiastic over cathedrals and allowed none to escape a visit for a time uncle john had borne up bravely but the day of rebellion was soon coming  no cathedrals in venice i hope he had said on their arrival  oh yes dear the loveliest one in the world st marks is here you know  but no st pauls or st peters  no uncle theres the saluta and the  never mind well do that first one and then quit what they build so many churches for i cant imagine nobody goes to em but tourists that i can see  he developed a streak of extravagance in venice and purchased venetian lace and venetian glassware to such an extent that the nieces had to assure him they were all supplied with enough to last them and their friends for all time to come major doyle had asked for a meerschaum pipe and a florentine leather pocket book so uncle john made a collection of thirtyseven pipes of all shapes and sizes and bought so many pocketbooks that patsy declared her father could use a different one every day in the month  but theyre handy things to have said her uncle and we may not get to europe again in a hurry  this was his excuse for purchasing many things and it was only by reminding him of the duty he would have to pay in new york that the girls could induce him to desist  this customs tax worried the old gentleman at times before this trip he had always believed in a protective tariff but now he referred to the united states customs as a species of brigandage worse than that of il duca himself  they stopped at milan to visit the great cathedral and then raced through switzerland and made a dash from luzerne to paris  thank heaven said uncle john there are no cathedrals in gay paree at any rate  oh yes there are they assured him we must see notre dame anyway and there are a dozen other famous cathedrals  here is where uncle john balked  see here my dears he announced not a cathedral will i visit from this time on you can take a guide and go by yourselves if you feel you cant let any get away from you go and find another of mike angelos last work every church has got one for my part ive always been religiously inclined but ive been to church enough lately to last me the rest of my natural life and ive fully determined not to darken the doors of another cathedral again theyre like circuses anyhow when youve seen one youve seen em all  no argument would induce him to abandon this position so the girls accepted his proposal and visited their beloved cathedrals in charge of a guide whose well of information was practically inexhaustible if not remarkable for its clarity  the opera suited uncle john better and he freely revelled in the shops purchasing the most useless and preposterous things in spite of that growing bugbear of the customs duties  but finally this joyous holiday came to an end as all good things will and they sailed from cherbourg for new york  uncle john had six extra trunks patsy carried a french poodle that was as much trouble as an infant in arms and louise engineered several hatboxes that could not be packed at the last minute but the girls embarked gay and rosycheeked and animated and in spite of all the excitement and pleasure that had attended their trip not one of the party was really sorry when the return voyage began     chapter xxxi  safe home   to me said uncle john as he stood on the deck and pointed proudly to the statue of liberty in new york harbor that is the prettiest sight ive seen since i left home  prettier than the old masters uncle asked patsy mischievously  yes or the cathedrals he retorted  when they reached the dock there was the major waiting to receive patsy in a new checked suit with a big flower in his buttonhole and a broad smile on his jolly face  and there was mrs merrick too with arthur weldon beside her which proved to louise that he had succeeded in making his peace with her mother also there were the sternfeatured customhouse officials in their uniforms and the sight of them sent the cold chills flying down uncle johns spine  there was no one present to receive beth but her uncle tucked her arm underneath his own with a proud gesture and kept her close beside him for the girl had quite won his loving old heart on this trip and she seemed to him more mature and far sweeter than when they had left home  but the greetings and the brigandage were soon over and in good time they were all assembled in the doyle flat where the joyous major had prepared an elaborate dinner to celebrate the return of the wanderers  weve a million pipes and pocketbooks for you daddy whispered patsy hugging him for the twentieth time and ive got a thousand things to tell you about our adventures in strange lands  save em till were alone said the major theyre too good to waste on a crowd  mr merrick was placed at the head of the table to make a speech it was brief and to the point  i promised these young ladies to give them time of their lives he said did i do it girls  and in a lively chorus they answered  you did uncle john
