90665795	the tale of johnny townmouse  by beatrix potter  author of the tale of peter rabbit c  frederick warne  co inc new york  1918     to aesop in the shadows     johnny townmouse was born in a cupboard timmy willie was born in a garden timmy willie was a little country mouse who went to town by mistake in a hamper the gardener sent vegetables to town once a week by carrier he packed them in a big hamper  the gardener left the hamper by the garden gate so that the carrier could pick it up when he passed timmy willie crept in through a hole in the wickerwork and after eating some peastimmy willie fell fast asleep  he awoke in a fright while the hamper was being lifted into the carriers cart then there was a jolting and a clattering of horses feet other packages were thrown in for miles and milesjoltjoltjolt and timmy willie trembled amongst the jumbled up vegetables  at last the cart stopped at a house where the hamper was taken out carried in and set down the cook gave the carrier sixpence the back door banged and the cart rumbled away but there was no quiet there seemed to be hundreds of carts passing dogs barked boys whistled in the street the cook laughed the parlour maid ran up and downstairs and a canary sang like a steam engine  timmy willie who had lived all his life in a garden was almost frightened to death presently the cook opened the hamper and began to unpack the vegetables out sprang the terrified timmy willie  up jumped the cook on a chair exclaiming a mouse a mouse call the cat fetch me the poker sarah timmy willie did not wait for sarah with the poker he rushed along the skirting board till he came to a little hole and in he popped  he dropped half a foot and crashed into the middle of a mouse dinner party breaking three glasseswho in the world is this inquired johnny townmouse but after the first exclamation of surprise he instantly recovered his manners  with the utmost politeness he introduced timmy willie to nine other mice all with long tails and white neckties timmy willies own tail was insignificant johnny townmouse and his friends noticed it but they were too well bred to make personal remarks only one of them asked timmy willie if he had ever been in a trap  the dinner was of eight courses not much of anything but truly elegant all the dishes were unknown to timmy willie who would have been a little afraid of tasting them only he was very hungry and very anxious to behave with company manners the continual noise upstairs made him so nervous that he dropped a plate never mind they dont belong to us said johnny  why dont those youngsters come back with the dessert it should be explained that two young mice who were waiting on the others went skirmishing upstairs to the kitchen between courses several times they had come tumbling in squeaking and laughing timmy willie learnt with horror that they were being chased by the cat his appetite failed he felt faint try some jelly said johnny townmouse  no would you rather go to bed i will show you a most comfortable sofa pillow  the sofa pillow had a hole in it johnny townmouse quite honestly recommended it as the best bed kept exclusively for visitors but the sofa smelt of cat timmy willie preferred to spend a miserable night under the fender  it was just the same next day an excellent breakfast was providedfor mice accustomed to eat bacon but timmy willie had been reared on roots and salad johnny townmouse and his friends racketted about under the floors and came boldly out all over the house in the evening one particularly loud crash had been caused by sarah tumbling downstairs with the teatray there were crumbs and sugar and smears of jam to be collected in spite of the cat  timmy willie longed to be at home in his peaceful nest in a sunny bank the food disagreed with him the noise prevented him from sleeping in a few days he grew so thin that johnny townmouse noticed it and questioned him he listened to timmy willies story and inquired about the garden it sounds rather a dull place what do you do when it rains  when it rains i sit in my little sandy burrow and shell corn and seeds from my autumn store i peep out at the throstles and blackbirds on the lawn and my friend cock robin and when the sun comes out again you should see my garden and the flowersroses and pinks and pansiesno noise except the birds and bees and the lambs in the meadows  there goes that cat again exclaimed johnny townmouse when they had taken refuge in the coalcellar he resumed the conversation i confess i am a little disappointed we have endeavoured to entertain you timothy william  oh yes yes you have been most kind but i do feel so ill said timmy willie  it may be that your teeth and digestion are unaccustomed to our food perhaps it might be wiser for you to return in the hamper  oh oh cried timmy willie  why of course for the matter of that we could have sent you back last week said johnny rather huffilydid you not know that the hamper goes back empty on saturdays  so timmy willie said goodbye to his new friends and hid in the hamper with a crumb of cake and a withered cabbage leaf and after much jolting he was set down safely in his own garden  sometimes on saturdays he went to look at the hamper lying by the gate but he knew better than to get in again and nobody got out though johnny townmouse had half promised a visit  the winter passed the sun came out again timmy willie sat by his burrow warming his little fur coat and sniffing the smell of violets and spring grass he had nearly forgotten his visit to town when up the sandy path all spick and span with a brown leather bag came johnny townmouse  timmy willie received him with open arms you have come at the best of all the year we will have herb pudding and sit in the sun  hmm it is a little damp said johnny townmouse who was carrying his tail under his arm out of the mud  what is that fearful noise he started violently  that said timmy willie that is only a cow i will beg a little milk they are quite harmless unless they happen to lie down upon you how are all our friends  johnnys account was rather middling he explained why he was paying his visit so early in the season the family had gone to the seaside for easter the cook was doing spring cleaning on board wages with particular instructions to clear out the mice there were four kittens and the cat had killed the canary  they say we did it but i know better said johnny townmouse whatever is that fearful racket  that is only the lawnmower i will fetch some of the grass clippings presently to make your bed i am sure you had better settle in the country johnny  hmmwe shall see by tuesday week the hamper is stopped while they are at the seaside  i am sure you will never want to live in town again said timmy willie  but he did he went back in the very next hamper of vegetables he said it was too quiet  one place suits one person another place suits another person for my part i prefer to live in the country like timmy willie
