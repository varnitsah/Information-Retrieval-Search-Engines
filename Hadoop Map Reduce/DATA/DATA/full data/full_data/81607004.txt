nathaniel hawthorne    on a bright summer evening two persons stood among the shrubbery of a garden stealthily watching a young girl who sat in the window seat of a neighboring mansion  one of these unseen observers a gentleman was youthful and had an air of high breeding and refinement and a face marked with intellect though otherwise of unprepossessing aspect  his features wore even an ominous though somewhat mirthful expression while he pointed his long forefinger at the girl and seemed to regard her as a creature completely within the scope of his influence  the charm works said he in a low but emphatic whisper  do you know edward hamiltonsince so you choose to be nameddo you know said the lady beside him that i have almost a mind to break the spell at once  what if the lesson should prove too severe  true if my ward could be thus laughed out of her fantastic nonsense she might be the better for it through life  but then she is such a delicate creature  and besides are you not ruining your own chance by putting forward this shadow of a rival  but will he not vanish into thin air at my bidding  rejoined edward hamilton  let the charm work  the girls slender and sylphlike figure tinged with radiance from the sunset clouds and overhung with the rich drapery of the silken curtains and set within the deep frame of the window was a perfect picture or rather it was like the original loveliness in a painters fancy from which the most finished picture is but an imperfect copy  though her occupation excited so much interest in the two spectators she was merely gazing at a miniature which she held in her hand encased in white satin and red morocco nor did there appear to be any other cause for the smile of mockery and malice with which hamilton regarded her  the charm works muttered he again  our pretty sylvias scorn will have a dear retribution  at this moment the girl raised her eyes and instead of a lifelike semblance of the miniature beheld the illomened shape of edward hamilton who now stepped forth from his concealment in the shrubbery  sylvia etherege was an orphan girl who had spent her life till within a few months past under the guardianship and in the secluded dwelling of an old bachelor uncle  while yet in her cradle she had been the destined bride of a cousin who was no less passive in the betrothal than herself  their future union had been projected as the means of uniting two rich estates and was rendered highly expedient if not indispensable by the testamentary dispositions of the parents on both sides  edgar vaughan the promised bridegroom had been bred from infancy in europe and had never seen the beautiful girl whose heart he was to claim as his inheritance  but already for several years a correspondence had been kept up between tine cousins and had produced an intellectual intimacy though it could but imperfectly acquaint them with each others character  sylvia was shy sensitive and fanciful and her guardians secluded habits had shut her out from even so much of the world as is generally open to maidens of her age  she had been left to seek associates and friends for herself in the haunts of imagination and to converse with them sometimes in the language of dead poets oftener in the poetry of her own mind  the companion whom she chiefly summoned up was the cousin with whose idea her earliest thoughts had been connected  she made a vision of edgar vaughan and tinted it with stronger hues than a mere fancypicture yet graced it with so many bright and delicate perfections that her cousin could nowhere have encountered so dangerous a rival  to this shadow she cherished a romantic fidelity  with its airy presence sitting by her side or gliding along her favorite paths the loneliness of her young life was blissful her heart was satisfied with love while yet its virgin purity was untainted by the earthliness that the touch of a real lover would have left there  edgar vaughan seemed to be conscious of her character for in his letters he gave her a name that was happily appropriate to the sensitiveness of her disposition the delicate peculiarity of her manners and the ethereal beauty both of her mind and person  instead of sylvia he called her sylphwith the prerogative of a cousin and a loverhis dear sylph etherege  when sylvia was seventeen her guardian died and she passed under the care of mrs grosvenor a lady of wealth and fashion and sylvias nearest relative though a distant one  while an inmate of mrs grosvenors family she still preserved somewhat of her lifelong habits of seclusion and shrank from a too familiar intercourse with those around her  still too she was faithful to her cousin or to the shadow which bore his name  the time now drew near when edgar vaughan whose education had been completed by an extensive range of travel was to revisit the soil of his nativity  edward hamilton a young gentleman who had been vaughans companion both in his studies and rambles had already recrossed the atlantic bringing letters to mrs grosvenor and sylvia etherege  these credentials insured him an earnest welcome which however on sylvias part was not followed by personal partiality or even the regard that seemed due to her cousins most intimate friend  as she herself could have assigned no cause for her repugnance it might be termed instinctive  hamiltons person it is true was the reverse of attractive especially when beheld for the first time  yet in the eyes of the most fastidious judges the defect of natural grace was compensated by the polish of his manners and by the intellect which so often gleamed through his dark features  mrs grosvenor with whom he immediately became a prodigious favorite exerted herself to overcome sylvias dislike  but in this matter her ward could neither be reasoned with nor persuaded  the presence of edward hamilton was sure to render her cold shy and distant abstracting all the vivacity from her deportment as if a cloud had come betwixt her and the sunshine  the simplicity of sylvias demeanor rendered it easy for so keen an observer as hamilton to detect her feelings  whenever any slight circumstance made him sensible of them a smile might be seen to flit over the young mans sallow visage  none that had once beheld this smile were in any danger of forgetting it whenever they recalled to memory the features of edward hamilton they were always duskily illuminated by this expression of mockery and malice  in a few weeks after hamiltons arrival he presented to sylvia etherege a miniature of her cousin which as he informed her would have been delivered sooner but was detained with a portion of his baggage  this was the miniature in the contemplation of which we beheld sylvia so absorbed at the commencement of our story  such in truth was too often the habit of the shy and musing girl  the beauty of the pictured countenance was almost too perfect to represent a human creature that had been born of a fallen and worldworn race and had lived to manhood amid ordinary troubles and enjoyments and must become wrinkled with age and care  it seemed too bright for a thing formed of dust and doomed to crumble into dust again  sylvia feared that such a being would be too refined and delicate to love a simple girl like her  yet even while her spirit drooped with that apprehension the picture was but the masculine counterpart of sylph ethereges sylphlike beauty  there was that resemblance between her own face and the miniature which is said often to exist between lovers whom heaven has destined for each other and which in this instance might be owing to the kindred blood of the two parties sylvia felt indeed that there was something familiar in the countenance so like a friend did the eyes smile upon her and seem to imply a knowledge of her thoughts  she could account for this impression only by supposing that in some of her daydreams imagination had conjured up the true similitude of her distant and unseen lover  but now could sylvia give a brighter semblance of reality to those daydreams  clasping the miniature to her heart she could summon forth from that haunted cell of pure and blissful fantasies the lifelike shadow to roam with her in the moonlight garden  even at noontide it sat with her in the arbor when the sunshine threw its broken flakes of gold into the clustering shade  the effect upon her mind was hardly less powerful than if she had actually listened to and reciprocated the vows of edgar vaughan for though the illusion never quite deceived her yet the remembrance was as distinct as of a remembered interview  those heavenly eyes gazed forever into her soul which drank at them as at a fountain and was disquieted if reality threw a momentary cloud between she heard the melody of a voice breathing sentiments with which her own chimed in like music  o happy yet hapless girl  thus to create the being whom she loves to endow him with all the attributes that were most fascinating to her heart and then to flit with the airy creature into the realm of fantasy and moonlight where dwelt his dreamy kindred  for her lover wiled sylvia away from earth which seemed strange and dull and darksome and lured her to a country where her spirit roamed in peaceful rapture deeming that it had found its home  many in their youth have visited that land of dreams and wandered so long in its enchanted groves that when banished thence they feel like exiles everywhere  the darkbrowed edward hamilton like the villain of a tale would often glide through the romance wherein poor sylvia walked  sometimes at the most blissful moment of her ecstasy when the features of the miniature were pictured brightest in the air they would suddenly change and darken and be transformed into his visage  and always when such change occurred the intrusive visage wore that peculiar smile with which hamilton had glanced at sylvia  before the close of summer it was told sylvia etherege that vaughan had arrived from france and that she would meet himwould meet for the first time the loved of yearsthat very evening  we will not tell how often and how earnestly she gazed upon the miniature thus endeavoring to prepare herself for the approaching interview lest the throbbing of her timorous heart should stifle the words of welcome  while the twilight grew deeper and duskier she sat with mrs grosvenor in an inner apartment lighted only by the softened gleam from an alabaster lamp which was burning at a distance on the centretable of the drawingroom never before had sylph etherege looked so sylphlike  she had communed with a creature of imagination till her own loveliness seemed but the creation of a delicate and dreamy fancy  every vibration of her spirit was visible in her frame as she listened to the rattling of wheels and the tramp upon the pavement and deemed that even the breeze bore the sound of her lovers footsteps as if he trode upon the viewless air mrs grosvenor too while she watched the tremulous flow of sylvias feelings was deeply moved she looked uneasily at the agitated girl and was about to speak when the opening of the streetdoor arrested the words upon her lips  footsteps ascended the staircase with a confident and familiar tread and some one entered the drawingroom  from the sofa where they sat in the inner apartment mrs grosvenor and sylvia could not discern the visitor  sylph cried a voice  dearest sylph  where are you sweet sylph etherege  here is your edgar vaughan  but instead of answering or rising to meet her loverwho had greeted her by the sweet and fanciful name which appropriate as it was to her character was known only to himsylvia grasped mrs grosvenors arm while her whole frame shook with the throbbing of her heart  who is it gasped she  who calls me sylph  before mrs grosvenor could reply the stranger entered the room bearing the lamp in his hand  approaching the sofa he displayed to sylvia the features of edward hamilton illuminated by that evil smile from which his face derived so marked an individuality  is not the miniature an admirable likeness inquired he  sylvia shuddered but had not power to turn away her white face from his gaze  the miniature which she had been holding in her hand fell down upon the floor where hamilton or vaughan set his foot upon it and crushed the ivory counterfeit to fragments  there my sweet sylph he exclaimed  it was i that created your phantomlover and now i annihilate him  your dream is rudely broken awake sylph etherege awake to truth  i am the only edgar vaughan  we have gone too far edgar vaughan said mrs grosvenor catching sylvia in her arms  the revengeful freak which vaughans wounded vanity had suggested had been countenanced by this lady in the hope of curing sylvia of her romantic notions and reconciling her to the truths and realities of life  look at the poor child she continued  i protest i tremble for the consequences  indeed madam replied vaughan sneeringly as he threw the light of the lamp on sylvias closed eyes and marble features  well my conscience is clear  i did but look into this delicate creatures heart and with the pure fantasies that i found there i made what seemed a manand the delusive shadow has wiled her away to shadowland and vanished there  it is no new tale  many a sweet maid has shared the lot of poor sylph etherege  and now edgar vaughan said mrs grosvenor as sylvias heart began faintly to throb again now try in good earnest to win back her love from the phantom which you conjured up  if you succeed she will be the better her whole life long for the lesson we have given her  whether the result of the lesson corresponded with mrs grosvenors hopes may be gathered from the closing scene of our story  it had been made known to the fashionable world that edgar vaughan had returned from france and under the assumed name of edward hamilton had won the affections of the lovely girl to whom he had been affianced in his boyhood  the nuptials were to take place at an early date  one evening before the day of anticipated bliss arrived edgar vaughan entered mrs grosvenors drawingroom where he found that lady and sylph etherege  only that sylvia makes no complaint remarked mrs grosvenor i should apprehend that the town air is illsuited to her constitution  she was always indeed a delicate creature but now she is a mere gossamer  do but look at her  did you ever imagine anything so fragile  vaughan was already attentively observing his mistress who sat in a shadowy and moonlighted recess of the room with her dreamy eyes fixed steadfastly upon his own  the bough of a tree was waving before the window and sometimes enveloped her in the gloom of its shadow into which she seemed to vanish  yes he said to mrs grosvenor  i can scarcely deem her of the earth earthy  no wonder that i call her sylph  methinks she will fade into the moonlight which falls upon her through the window  or in the open air she might flit away upon the breeze like a wreath of mist  sylvias eyes grew yet brighter  she waved her hand to edgar vaughan with a gesture of ethereal triumph  farewell she said  i will neither fade into the moonlight nor flit away upon the breeze  yet you cannot keep me here  there was something in sylvias look and tones that startled mrs grosvenor with a terrible apprehension  but as she was rushing towards the girl vaughan held her back  stay cried he with a strange smile of mockery and anguish  can our sweet sylph be going to heaven to seek the original of the miniature
