95175999	white fang   part i   chapter ithe trail of the meat   dark spruce forest frowned on either side the frozen waterway  the trees had been stripped by a recent wind of their white covering of frost and they seemed to lean towards each other black and ominous in the fading light  a vast silence reigned over the land  the land itself was a desolation lifeless without movement so lone and cold that the spirit of it was not even that of sadness  there was a hint in it of laughter but of a laughter more terrible than any sadnessa laughter that was mirthless as the smile of the sphinx a laughter cold as the frost and partaking of the grimness of infallibility  it was the masterful and incommunicable wisdom of eternity laughing at the futility of life and the effort of life  it was the wild the savage frozenhearted northland wild  but there was life abroad in the land and defiant  down the frozen waterway toiled a string of wolfish dogs  their bristly fur was rimed with frost  their breath froze in the air as it left their mouths spouting forth in spumes of vapour that settled upon the hair of their bodies and formed into crystals of frost  leather harness was on the dogs and leather traces attached them to a sled which dragged along behind  the sled was without runners  it was made of stout birchbark and its full surface rested on the snow  the front end of the sled was turned up like a scroll in order to force down and under the bore of soft snow that surged like a wave before it  on the sled securely lashed was a long and narrow oblong box  there were other things on the sledblankets an axe and a coffeepot and fryingpan but prominent occupying most of the space was the long and narrow oblong box  in advance of the dogs on wide snowshoes toiled a man  at the rear of the sled toiled a second man  on the sled in the box lay a third man whose toil was overa man whom the wild had conquered and beaten down until he would never move nor struggle again  it is not the way of the wild to like movement  life is an offence to it for life is movement and the wild aims always to destroy movement  it freezes the water to prevent it running to the sea it drives the sap out of the trees till they are frozen to their mighty hearts and most ferociously and terribly of all does the wild harry and crush into submission manman who is the most restless of life ever in revolt against the dictum that all movement must in the end come to the cessation of movement  but at front and rear unawed and indomitable toiled the two men who were not yet dead  their bodies were covered with fur and softtanned leather  eyelashes and cheeks and lips were so coated with the crystals from their frozen breath that their faces were not discernible  this gave them the seeming of ghostly masques undertakers in a spectral world at the funeral of some ghost  but under it all they were men penetrating the land of desolation and mockery and silence puny adventurers bent on colossal adventure pitting themselves against the might of a world as remote and alien and pulseless as the abysses of space  they travelled on without speech saving their breath for the work of their bodies  on every side was the silence pressing upon them with a tangible presence  it affected their minds as the many atmospheres of deep water affect the body of the diver  it crushed them with the weight of unending vastness and unalterable decree  it crushed them into the remotest recesses of their own minds pressing out of them like juices from the grape all the false ardours and exaltations and undue selfvalues of the human soul until they perceived themselves finite and small specks and motes moving with weak cunning and little wisdom amidst the play and interplay of the great blind elements and forces  an hour went by and a second hour  the pale light of the short sunless day was beginning to fade when a faint far cry arose on the still air it soared upward with a swift rush till it reached its topmost note where it persisted palpitant and tense and then slowly died away  it might have been a lost soul wailing had it not been invested with a certain sad fierceness and hungry eagerness  the front man turned his head until his eyes met the eyes of the man behind  and then across the narrow oblong box each nodded to the other  a second cry arose piercing the silence with needlelike shrillness both men located the sound  it was to the rear somewhere in the snow expanse they had just traversed  a third and answering cry arose also to the rear and to the left of the second cry  theyre after us bill said the man at the front  his voice sounded hoarse and unreal and he had spoken with apparent effort  meat is scarce answered his comrade  i aint seen a rabbit sign for days  thereafter they spoke no more though their ears were keen for the huntingcries that continued to rise behind them  at the fall of darkness they swung the dogs into a cluster of spruce trees on the edge of the waterway and made a camp  the coffin at the side of the fire served for seat and table  the wolfdogs clustered on the far side of the fire snarled and bickered among themselves but evinced no inclination to stray off into the darkness  seems to me henry theyre stayin remarkable close to camp bill commented  henry squatting over the fire and settling the pot of coffee with a piece of ice nodded  nor did he speak till he had taken his seat on the coffin and begun to eat  they know where their hides is safe he said  theyd sooner eat grub than be grub  theyre pretty wise them dogs  bill shook his head  oh i dont know  his comrade looked at him curiously  first time i ever heard you say anything about their not bein wise  henry said the other munching with deliberation the beans he was eating did you happen to notice the way them dogs kicked up when i was afeedin em  they did cut up moren usual henry acknowledged  how many dogs ve we got henry  six  well henry     bill stopped for a moment in order that his words might gain greater significance  as i was sayin henry weve got six dogs  i took six fish out of the bag  i gave one fish to each dog an henry i was one fish short  you counted wrong  weve got six dogs the other reiterated dispassionately  i took out six fish  one ear didnt get no fish  i came back to the bag afterward an got m his fish  weve only got six dogs henry said  henry bill went on  i wont say they was all dogs but there was seven of m that got fish  henry stopped eating to glance across the fire and count the dogs  theres only six now he said  i saw the other one run off across the snow bill announced with cool positiveness  i saw seven  henry looked at him commiseratingly and said ill be almighty glad when this trips over  what dye mean by that bill demanded  i mean that this load of ourn is gettin on your nerves an that youre beginnin to see things  i thought of that bill answered gravely  an so when i saw it run off across the snow i looked in the snow an saw its tracks  then i counted the dogs an there was still six of em  the tracks is there in the snow now  dye want to look at em  ill show em to you  henry did not reply but munched on in silence until the meal finished he topped it with a final cup of coffee  he wiped his mouth with the back of his hand and said  then youre thinkin as it was  a long wailing cry fiercely sad from somewhere in the darkness had interrupted him  he stopped to listen to it then he finished his sentence with a wave of his hand toward the sound of the cry one of them  bill nodded  id a blame sight sooner think that than anything else you noticed yourself the row the dogs made  cry after cry and answering cries were turning the silence into a bedlam  from every side the cries arose and the dogs betrayed their fear by huddling together and so close to the fire that their hair was scorched by the heat  bill threw on more wood before lighting his pipe  im thinking youre down in the mouth some henry said  henry      he sucked meditatively at his pipe for some time before he went on  henry i was athinkin what a blame sight luckier he is than you an mell ever be  he indicated the third person by a downward thrust of the thumb to the box on which they sat  you an me henry when we die well be lucky if we get enough stones over our carcases to keep the dogs off of us  but we aint got people an money an all the rest like him henry rejoined  longdistance funerals is somethin you an me cant exactly afford  what gets me henry is what a chap like this thats a lord or something in his own country and thats never had to bother about grub nor blankets why he comes abuttin round the godforsaken ends of the earththats what i cant exactly see  he might have lived to a ripe old age if hed stayed at home henry agreed  bill opened his mouth to speak but changed his mind  instead he pointed towards the wall of darkness that pressed about them from every side  there was no suggestion of form in the utter blackness only could be seen a pair of eyes gleaming like live coals  henry indicated with his head a second pair and a third  a circle of the gleaming eyes had drawn about their camp  now and again a pair of eyes moved or disappeared to appear again a moment later  the unrest of the dogs had been increasing and they stampeded in a surge of sudden fear to the near side of the fire cringing and crawling about the legs of the men  in the scramble one of the dogs had been overturned on the edge of the fire and it had yelped with pain and fright as the smell of its singed coat possessed the air  the commotion caused the circle of eyes to shift restlessly for a moment and even to withdraw a bit but it settled down again as the dogs became quiet  henry its a blame misfortune to be out of ammunition  bill had finished his pipe and was helping his companion to spread the bed of fur and blanket upon the spruce boughs which he had laid over the snow before supper  henry grunted and began unlacing his mocassins  how many cartridges did you say you had left he asked  three came the answer  an i wisht twas three hundred  then id show em what for damn em  he shook his fist angrily at the gleaming eyes and began securely to prop his moccasins before the fire  an i wisht this cold snapd break he went on  its ben fifty below for two weeks now  an i wisht id never started on this trip henry  i dont like the looks of it  i dont feel right somehow  an while im wishin i wisht the trip was over an done with an you an me asittin by the fire in fort mcgurry just about now an playing cribbagethats what i wisht  henry grunted and crawled into bed  as he dozed off he was aroused by his comrades voice  say henry that other one that come in an got a fishwhy didnt the dogs pitch into it  thats whats botherin me  youre botherin too much bill came the sleepy response  you was never like this before  you jes shut up now an go to sleep an youll be all hunkydory in the mornin  your stomachs sour thats whats botherin you  the men slept breathing heavily side by side under the one covering the fire died down and the gleaming eyes drew closer the circle they had flung about the camp  the dogs clustered together in fear now and again snarling menacingly as a pair of eyes drew close  once their uproar became so loud that bill woke up  he got out of bed carefully so as not to disturb the sleep of his comrade and threw more wood on the fire  as it began to flame up the circle of eyes drew farther back  he glanced casually at the huddling dogs  he rubbed his eyes and looked at them more sharply  then he crawled back into the blankets  henry he said  oh henry  henry groaned as he passed from sleep to waking and demanded whats wrong now  nothin came the answer only theres seven of em again  i just counted  henry acknowledged receipt of the information with a grunt that slid into a snore as he drifted back into sleep  in the morning it was henry who awoke first and routed his companion out of bed  daylight was yet three hours away though it was already six oclock and in the darkness henry went about preparing breakfast while bill rolled the blankets and made the sled ready for lashing  say henry he asked suddenly how many dogs did you say we had  six  wrong bill proclaimed triumphantly  seven again henry queried  no five ones gone  the hell  henry cried in wrath leaving the cooking to come and count the dogs  youre right bill he concluded  fattys gone  an he went like greased lightnin once he got started  couldnt ve seen m for smoke  no chance at all henry concluded  they jes swallowed m alive  i bet he was yelpin as he went down their throats damn em  he always was a fool dog said bill  but no fool dog ought to be fool enough to go off an commit suicide that way  he looked over the remainder of the team with a speculative eye that summed up instantly the salient traits of each animal  i bet none of the others would do it  couldnt drive em away from the fire with a club bill agreed  i always did think there was somethin wrong with fatty anyway  and this was the epitaph of a dead dog on the northland trailless scant than the epitaph of many another dog of many a man    chapter iithe shewolf   breakfast eaten and the slim campoutfit lashed to the sled the men turned their backs on the cheery fire and launched out into the darkness at once began to rise the cries that were fiercely sadcries that called through the darkness and cold to one another and answered back conversation ceased  daylight came at nine oclock  at midday the sky to the south warmed to rosecolour and marked where the bulge of the earth intervened between the meridian sun and the northern world  but the rosecolour swiftly faded  the grey light of day that remained lasted until three oclock when it too faded and the pall of the arctic night descended upon the lone and silent land  as darkness came on the huntingcries to right and left and rear drew closerso close that more than once they sent surges of fear through the toiling dogs throwing them into shortlived panics  at the conclusion of one such panic when he and henry had got the dogs back in the traces bill said  i wisht theyd strike game somewheres an go away an leave us alone  they do get on the nerves horrible  henry sympathised  they spoke no more until camp was made  henry was bending over and adding ice to the babbling pot of beans when he was startled by the sound of a blow an exclamation from bill and a sharp snarling cry of pain from among the dogs  he straightened up in time to see a dim form disappearing across the snow into the shelter of the dark  then he saw bill standing amid the dogs half triumphant half crestfallen in one hand a stout club in the other the tail and part of the body of a suncured salmon  it got half of it he announced but i got a whack at it jes the same  dye hear it squeal  whatd it look like henry asked  couldnt see  but it had four legs an a mouth an hair an looked like any dog  must be a tame wolf i reckon  its damned tame whatever it is comin in here at feedin time an gettin its whack of fish  that night when supper was finished and they sat on the oblong box and pulled at their pipes the circle of gleaming eyes drew in even closer than before  i wisht theyd spring up a bunch of moose or something an go away an leave us alone bill said  henry grunted with an intonation that was not all sympathy and for a quarter of an hour they sat on in silence henry staring at the fire and bill at the circle of eyes that burned in the darkness just beyond the firelight  i wisht we was pullin into mcgurry right now he began again  shut up your wishin and your croakin henry burst out angrily  your stomachs sour  thats whats ailin you  swallow a spoonful of sody an youll sweeten up wonderful an be more pleasant company  in the morning henry was aroused by fervid blasphemy that proceeded from the mouth of bill  henry propped himself up on an elbow and looked to see his comrade standing among the dogs beside the replenished fire his arms raised in objurgation his face distorted with passion  hello henry called  whats up now  frogs gone came the answer  no  i tell you yes  henry leaped out of the blankets and to the dogs  he counted them with care and then joined his partner in cursing the power of the wild that had robbed them of another dog  frog was the strongest dog of the bunch bill pronounced finally  an he was no fool dog neither henry added  and so was recorded the second epitaph in two days  a gloomy breakfast was eaten and the four remaining dogs were harnessed to the sled  the day was a repetition of the days that had gone before the men toiled without speech across the face of the frozen world  the silence was unbroken save by the cries of their pursuers that unseen hung upon their rear  with the coming of night in the midafternoon the cries sounded closer as the pursuers drew in according to their custom and the dogs grew excited and frightened and were guilty of panics that tangled the traces and further depressed the two men  there thatll fix you fool critters bill said with satisfaction that night standing erect at completion of his task  henry left the cooking to come and see  not only had his partner tied the dogs up but he had tied them after the indian fashion with sticks about the neck of each dog he had fastened a leather thong  to this and so close to the neck that the dog could not get his teeth to it he had tied a stout stick four or five feet in length  the other end of the stick in turn was made fast to a stake in the ground by means of a leather thong  the dog was unable to gnaw through the leather at his own end of the stick  the stick prevented him from getting at the leather that fastened the other end  henry nodded his head approvingly  its the only contraption thatll ever hold one ear he said  he can gnaw through leather as clean as a knife an jes about half as quick they allll be here in the mornin hunkydory  you jes bet they will bill affirmed  if one of em turns up missin ill go without my coffee  they jes know we aint loaded to kill henry remarked at bedtime indicating the gleaming circle that hemmed them in  if we could put a couple of shots into em theyd be more respectful  they come closer every night  get the firelight out of your eyes an look hardthere did you see that one  for some time the two men amused themselves with watching the movement of vague forms on the edge of the firelight  by looking closely and steadily at where a pair of eyes burned in the darkness the form of the animal would slowly take shape  they could even see these forms move at times  a sound among the dogs attracted the mens attention  one ear was uttering quick eager whines lunging at the length of his stick toward the darkness and desisting now and again in order to make frantic attacks on the stick with his teeth  look at that bill henry whispered  full into the firelight with a stealthy sidelong movement glided a doglike animal  it moved with commingled mistrust and daring cautiously observing the men its attention fixed on the dogs  one ear strained the full length of the stick toward the intruder and whined with eagerness  that fool one ear dont seem scairt much bill said in a low tone  its a shewolf henry whispered back an that accounts for fatty an frog  shes the decoy for the pack  she draws out the dog an then all the rest pitches in an eats m up  the fire crackled  a log fell apart with a loud spluttering noise  at the sound of it the strange animal leaped back into the darkness  henry im athinkin bill announced  thinkin what  im athinkin that was the one i lambasted with the club  aint the slightest doubt in the world was henrys response  an right here i want to remark bill went on that that animals familyarity with campfires is suspicious an immoral  it knows for certain moren a selfrespectin wolf ought to know henry agreed  a wolf that knows enough to come in with the dogs at feedin time has had experiences  ol villan had a dog once that run away with the wolves bill cogitates aloud  i ought to know  i shot it out of the pack in a moose pasture over on little stick  an ol villan cried like a baby  hadnt seen it for three years he said  ben with the wolves all that time  i reckon youve called the turn bill  that wolfs a dog an its eaten fish manys the time from the hand of man  an if i get a chance at it that wolf thats a dogll be jes meat bill declared  we cant afford to lose no more animals  but youve only got three cartridges henry objected  ill wait for a dead sure shot was the reply  in the morning henry renewed the fire and cooked breakfast to the accompaniment of his partners snoring  you was sleepin jes too comfortable for anything henry told him as he routed him out for breakfast  i hadnt the heart to rouse you  bill began to eat sleepily  he noticed that his cup was empty and started to reach for the pot  but the pot was beyond arms length and beside henry  say henry he chided gently aint you forgot somethin  henry looked about with great carefulness and shook his head  bill held up the empty cup  you dont get no coffee henry announced  aint run out bill asked anxiously  nope  aint thinkin itll hurt my digestion  nope  a flush of angry blood pervaded bills face  then its jes warm an anxious i am to be hearin you explain yourself he said  spankers gone henry answered  without haste with the air of one resigned to misfortune bill turned his head and from where he sat counted the dogs  howd it happen he asked apathetically  henry shrugged his shoulders  dont know  unless one ear gnawed m loose  he couldnt adone it himself thats sure  the darned cuss  bill spoke gravely and slowly with no hint of the anger that was raging within  jes because he couldnt chew himself loose he chews spanker loose  well spankers troubles is over anyway i guess hes digested by this time an cavortin over the landscape in the bellies of twenty different wolves was henrys epitaph on this the latest lost dog  have some coffee bill  but bill shook his head  go on henry pleaded elevating the pot  bill shoved his cup aside  ill be dingdongdanged if i do  i said i wouldnt if ary dog turned up missin an i wont  its darn good coffee henry said enticingly  but bill was stubborn and he ate a dry breakfast washed down with mumbled curses at one ear for the trick he had played  ill tie em up out of reach of each other tonight bill said as they took the trail  they had travelled little more than a hundred yards when henry who was in front bent down and picked up something with which his snowshoe had collided  it was dark and he could not see it but he recognised it by the touch  he flung it back so that it struck the sled and bounced along until it fetched up on bills snowshoes  mebbe youll need that in your business henry said  bill uttered an exclamation  it was all that was left of spankerthe stick with which he had been tied  they ate m hide an all bill announced  the sticks as clean as a whistle  theyve ate the leather offen both ends  theyre damn hungry henry an theyll have you an me guessin before this trips over  henry laughed defiantly  i aint been trailed this way by wolves before but ive gone through a whole lot worse an kept my health  takes moren a handful of them pesky critters to do for yours truly bill my son  i dont know i dont know bill muttered ominously  well youll know all right when we pull into mcgurry  i aint feelin special enthusiastic bill persisted  youre off colour thats whats the matter with you henry dogmatised what you need is quinine an im goin to dose you up stiff as soon as we make mcgurry  bill grunted his disagreement with the diagnosis and lapsed into silence  the day was like all the days  light came at nine oclock  at twelve oclock the southern horizon was warmed by the unseen sun and then began the cold grey of afternoon that would merge three hours later into night  it was just after the suns futile effort to appear that bill slipped the rifle from under the sledlashings and said  you keep right on henry im goin to see what i can see  youd better stick by the sled his partner protested  youve only got three cartridges an theres no tellin what might happen  whos croaking now bill demanded triumphantly  henry made no reply and plodded on alone though often he cast anxious glances back into the grey solitude where his partner had disappeared  an hour later taking advantage of the cutoffs around which the sled had to go bill arrived  theyre scattered an rangin along wide he said keeping up with us an lookin for game at the same time  you see theyre sure of us only they know theyve got to wait to get us  in the meantime theyre willin to pick up anything eatable that comes handy  you mean they think theyre sure of us henry objected pointedly  but bill ignored him  i seen some of them  theyre pretty thin  they aint had a bite in weeks i reckon outside of fatty an frog an spanker an theres so many of em that that didnt go far  theyre remarkable thin  their ribs is like washboards an their stomachs is right up against their backbones  theyre pretty desperate i can tell you  theyll be goin mad yet an then watch out  a few minutes later henry who was now travelling behind the sled emitted a low warning whistle  bill turned and looked then quietly stopped the dogs  to the rear from around the last bend and plainly into view on the very trail they had just covered trotted a furry slinking form  its nose was to the trail and it trotted with a peculiar sliding effortless gait  when they halted it halted throwing up its head and regarding them steadily with nostrils that twitched as it caught and studied the scent of them  its the shewolf bill answered  the dogs had lain down in the snow and he walked past them to join his partner in the sled  together they watched the strange animal that had pursued them for days and that had already accomplished the destruction of half their dogteam  after a searching scrutiny the animal trotted forward a few steps  this it repeated several times till it was a short hundred yards away  it paused head up close by a clump of spruce trees and with sight and scent studied the outfit of the watching men  it looked at them in a strangely wistful way after the manner of a dog but in its wistfulness there was none of the dog affection  it was a wistfulness bred of hunger as cruel as its own fangs as merciless as the frost itself  it was large for a wolf its gaunt frame advertising the lines of an animal that was among the largest of its kind  stands pretty close to two feet an a half at the shoulders henry commented  an ill bet it aint far from five feet long  kind of strange colour for a wolf was bills criticism  i never seen a red wolf before  looks almost cinnamon to me  the animal was certainly not cinnamoncoloured  its coat was the true wolfcoat  the dominant colour was grey and yet there was to it a faint reddish huea hue that was baffling that appeared and disappeared that was more like an illusion of the vision now grey distinctly grey and again giving hints and glints of a vague redness of colour not classifiable in terms of ordinary experience  looks for all the world like a big husky sleddog bill said  i wouldnt be sprised to see it wag its tail  hello you husky he called  come here you whateveryournameis  aint a bit scairt of you henry laughed  bill waved his hand at it threateningly and shouted loudly but the animal betrayed no fear  the only change in it that they could notice was an accession of alertness  it still regarded them with the merciless wistfulness of hunger  they were meat and it was hungry and it would like to go in and eat them if it dared  look here henry bill said unconsciously lowering his voice to a whisper because of what he imitated  weve got three cartridges  but its a dead shot  couldnt miss it  its got away with three of our dogs an we oughter put a stop to it  what dye say  henry nodded his consent  bill cautiously slipped the gun from under the sledlashing  the gun was on the way to his shoulder but it never got there  for in that instant the shewolf leaped sidewise from the trail into the clump of spruce trees and disappeared  the two men looked at each other  henry whistled long and comprehendingly  i might have knowed it bill chided himself aloud as he replaced the gun  of course a wolf that knows enough to come in with the dogs at feedin time d know all about shootingirons  i tell you right now henry that critters the cause of all our trouble  wed have six dogs at the present time stead of three if it wasnt for her  an i tell you right now henry im goin to get her  shes too smart to be shot in the open  but im goin to lay for her  ill bushwhack her as sure as my name is bill  you neednt stray off too far in doin it his partner admonished  if that pack ever starts to jump you them three cartridgesd be wuth no moren three whoops in hell  them animals is damn hungry an once they start in theyll sure get you bill  they camped early that night  three dogs could not drag the sled so fast nor for so long hours as could six and they were showing unmistakable signs of playing out  and the men went early to bed bill first seeing to it that the dogs were tied out of gnawingreach of one another  but the wolves were growing bolder and the men were aroused more than once from their sleep  so near did the wolves approach that the dogs became frantic with terror and it was necessary to replenish the fire from time to time in order to keep the adventurous marauders at safer distance  ive hearn sailors talk of sharks followin a ship bill remarked as he crawled back into the blankets after one such replenishing of the fire  well them wolves is land sharks  they know their business bettern we do an they aint aholdin our trail this way for their health  theyre goin to get us  theyre sure goin to get us henry  theyve half got you aready atalkin like that henry retorted sharply  a mans half licked when he says he is  an youre half eaten from the way youre goin on about it  theyve got away with better men than you an me bill answered  oh shet up your croakin  you make me allfired tired  henry rolled over angrily on his side but was surprised that bill made no similar display of temper  this was not bills way for he was easily angered by sharp words  henry thought long over it before he went to sleep and as his eyelids fluttered down and he dozed off the thought in his mind was theres no mistakin it bills almighty blue  ill have to cheer him up tomorrow    chapter iiithe hunger cry   the day began auspiciously  they had lost no dogs during the night and they swung out upon the trail and into the silence the darkness and the cold with spirits that were fairly light  bill seemed to have forgotten his forebodings of the previous night and even waxed facetious with the dogs when at midday they overturned the sled on a bad piece of trail  it was an awkward mixup  the sled was upside down and jammed between a treetrunk and a huge rock and they were forced to unharness the dogs in order to straighten out the tangle  the two men were bent over the sled and trying to right it when henry observed one ear sidling away  here you one ear he cried straightening up and turning around on the dog  but one ear broke into a run across the snow his traces trailing behind him  and there out in the snow of their back track was the shewolf waiting for him  as he neared her he became suddenly cautious  he slowed down to an alert and mincing walk and then stopped  he regarded her carefully and dubiously yet desirefully  she seemed to smile at him showing her teeth in an ingratiating rather than a menacing way  she moved toward him a few steps playfully and then halted  one ear drew near to her still alert and cautious his tail and ears in the air his head held high  he tried to sniff noses with her but she retreated playfully and coyly every advance on his part was accompanied by a corresponding retreat on her part  step by step she was luring him away from the security of his human companionship  once as though a warning had in vague ways flitted through his intelligence he turned his head and looked back at the overturned sled at his teammates and at the two men who were calling to him  but whatever idea was forming in his mind was dissipated by the shewolf who advanced upon him sniffed noses with him for a fleeting instant and then resumed her coy retreat before his renewed advances  in the meantime bill had bethought himself of the rifle  but it was jammed beneath the overturned sled and by the time henry had helped him to right the load one ear and the shewolf were too close together and the distance too great to risk a shot  too late one ear learned his mistake  before they saw the cause the two men saw him turn and start to run back toward them  then approaching at right angles to the trail and cutting off his retreat they saw a dozen wolves lean and grey bounding across the snow  on the instant the she wolfs coyness and playfulness disappeared  with a snarl she sprang upon one ear  he thrust her off with his shoulder and his retreat cut off and still intent on regaining the sled he altered his course in an attempt to circle around to it  more wolves were appearing every moment and joining in the chase  the shewolf was one leap behind one ear and holding her own  where are you goin henry suddenly demanded laying his hand on his partners arm  bill shook it off  i wont stand it he said  they aint agoin to get any more of our dogs if i can help it  gun in hand he plunged into the underbrush that lined the side of the trail  his intention was apparent enough  taking the sled as the centre of the circle that one ear was making bill planned to tap that circle at a point in advance of the pursuit  with his rifle in the broad daylight it might be possible for him to awe the wolves and save the dog  say bill henry called after him  be careful  dont take no chances  henry sat down on the sled and watched  there was nothing else for him to do  bill had already gone from sight but now and again appearing and disappearing amongst the underbrush and the scattered clumps of spruce could be seen one ear  henry judged his case to be hopeless  the dog was thoroughly alive to its danger but it was running on the outer circle while the wolfpack was running on the inner and shorter circle it was vain to think of one ear so outdistancing his pursuers as to be able to cut across their circle in advance of them and to regain the sled  the different lines were rapidly approaching a point  somewhere out there in the snow screened from his sight by trees and thickets henry knew that the wolfpack one ear and bill were coming together  all too quickly far more quickly than he had expected it happened  he heard a shot then two shots in rapid succession and he knew that bills ammunition was gone  then he heard a great outcry of snarls and yelps he recognised one ears yell of pain and terror and he heard a wolfcry that bespoke a stricken animal  and that was all  the snarls ceased the yelping died away  silence settled down again over the lonely land  he sat for a long while upon the sled  there was no need for him to go and see what had happened  he knew it as though it had taken place before his eyes  once he roused with a start and hastily got the axe out from underneath the lashings  but for some time longer he sat and brooded the two remaining dogs crouching and trembling at his feet  at last he arose in a weary manner as though all the resilience had gone out of his body and proceeded to fasten the dogs to the sled  he passed a rope over his shoulder a mantrace and pulled with the dogs  he did not go far  at the first hint of darkness he hastened to make a camp and he saw to it that he had a generous supply of firewood  he fed the dogs cooked and ate his supper and made his bed close to the fire  but he was not destined to enjoy that bed  before his eyes closed the wolves had drawn too near for safety  it no longer required an effort of the vision to see them  they were all about him and the fire in a narrow circle and he could see them plainly in the firelight lying down sitting up crawling forward on their bellies or slinking back and forth  they even slept  here and there he could see one curled up in the snow like a dog taking the sleep that was now denied himself  he kept the fire brightly blazing for he knew that it alone intervened between the flesh of his body and their hungry fangs  his two dogs stayed close by him one on either side leaning against him for protection crying and whimpering and at times snarling desperately when a wolf approached a little closer than usual  at such moments when his dogs snarled the whole circle would be agitated the wolves coming to their feet and pressing tentatively forward a chorus of snarls and eager yelps rising about him  then the circle would lie down again and here and there a wolf would resume its broken nap  but this circle had a continuous tendency to draw in upon him  bit by bit an inch at a time with here a wolf bellying forward and there a wolf bellying forward the circle would narrow until the brutes were almost within springing distance  then he would seize brands from the fire and hurl them into the pack  a hasty drawing back always resulted accompanied by angry yelps and frightened snarls when a wellaimed brand struck and scorched a too daring animal  morning found the man haggard and worn wideeyed from want of sleep  he cooked breakfast in the darkness and at nine oclock when with the coming of daylight the wolfpack drew back he set about the task he had planned through the long hours of the night  chopping down young saplings he made them crossbars of a scaffold by lashing them high up to the trunks of standing trees  using the sledlashing for a heaving rope and with the aid of the dogs he hoisted the coffin to the top of the scaffold  they got bill an they may get me but theyll sure never get you young man he said addressing the dead body in its treesepulchre  then he took the trail the lightened sled bounding along behind the willing dogs for they too knew that safety lay open in the gaining of fort mcgurry  the wolves were now more open in their pursuit trotting sedately behind and ranging along on either side their red tongues lolling out their lean sides showing the undulating ribs with every movement  they were very lean mere skinbags stretched over bony frames with strings for musclesso lean that henry found it in his mind to marvel that they still kept their feet and did not collapse forthright in the snow  he did not dare travel until dark  at midday not only did the sun warm the southern horizon but it even thrust its upper rim pale and golden above the skyline  he received it as a sign  the days were growing longer  the sun was returning  but scarcely had the cheer of its light departed than he went into camp  there were still several hours of grey daylight and sombre twilight and he utilised them in chopping an enormous supply of firewood  with night came horror  not only were the starving wolves growing bolder but lack of sleep was telling upon henry  he dozed despite himself crouching by the fire the blankets about his shoulders the axe between his knees and on either side a dog pressing close against him he awoke once and saw in front of him not a dozen feet away a big grey wolf one of the largest of the pack  and even as he looked the brute deliberately stretched himself after the manner of a lazy dog yawning full in his face and looking upon him with a possessive eye as if in truth he were merely a delayed meal that was soon to be eaten  this certitude was shown by the whole pack  fully a score he could count staring hungrily at him or calmly sleeping in the snow  they reminded him of children gathered about a spread table and awaiting permission to begin to eat  and he was the food they were to eat  he wondered how and when the meal would begin  as he piled wood on the fire he discovered an appreciation of his own body which he had never felt before  he watched his moving muscles and was interested in the cunning mechanism of his fingers  by the light of the fire he crooked his fingers slowly and repeatedly now one at a time now all together spreading them wide or making quick gripping movements he studied the nailformation and prodded the fingertips now sharply and again softly gauging the while the nervesensations produced  it fascinated him and he grew suddenly fond of this subtle flesh of his that worked so beautifully and smoothly and delicately  then he would cast a glance of fear at the wolfcircle drawn expectantly about him and like a blow the realisation would strike him that this wonderful body of his this living flesh was no more than so much meat a quest of ravenous animals to be torn and slashed by their hungry fangs to be sustenance to them as the moose and the rabbit had often been sustenance to him  he came out of a doze that was half nightmare to see the redhued she wolf before him  she was not more than half a dozen feet away sitting in the snow and wistfully regarding him  the two dogs were whimpering and snarling at his feet but she took no notice of them  she was looking at the man and for some time he returned her look  there was nothing threatening about her  she looked at him merely with a great wistfulness but he knew it to be the wistfulness of an equally great hunger  he was the food and the sight of him excited in her the gustatory sensations  her mouth opened the saliva drooled forth and she licked her chops with the pleasure of anticipation  a spasm of fear went through him  he reached hastily for a brand to throw at her  but even as he reached and before his fingers had closed on the missile she sprang back into safety and he knew that she was used to having things thrown at her  she had snarled as she sprang away baring her white fangs to their roots all her wistfulness vanishing being replaced by a carnivorous malignity that made him shudder  he glanced at the hand that held the brand noticing the cunning delicacy of the fingers that gripped it how they adjusted themselves to all the inequalities of the surface curling over and under and about the rough wood and one little finger too close to the burning portion of the brand sensitively and automatically writhing back from the hurtful heat to a cooler grippingplace and in the same instant he seemed to see a vision of those same sensitive and delicate fingers being crushed and torn by the white teeth of the shewolf  never had he been so fond of this body of his as now when his tenure of it was so precarious  all night with burning brands he fought off the hungry pack  when he dozed despite himself the whimpering and snarling of the dogs aroused him  morning came but for the first time the light of day failed to scatter the wolves  the man waited in vain for them to go  they remained in a circle about him and his fire displaying an arrogance of possession that shook his courage born of the morning light  he made one desperate attempt to pull out on the trail  but the moment he left the protection of the fire the boldest wolf leaped for him but leaped short  he saved himself by springing back the jaws snapping together a scant six inches from his thigh  the rest of the pack was now up and surging upon him and a throwing of firebrands right and left was necessary to drive them back to a respectful distance  even in the daylight he did not dare leave the fire to chop fresh wood twenty feet away towered a huge dead spruce  he spent half the day extending his campfire to the tree at any moment a half dozen burning faggots ready at hand to fling at his enemies  once at the tree he studied the surrounding forest in order to fell the tree in the direction of the most firewood  the night was a repetition of the night before save that the need for sleep was becoming overpowering  the snarling of his dogs was losing its efficacy  besides they were snarling all the time and his benumbed and drowsy senses no longer took note of changing pitch and intensity  he awoke with a start  the shewolf was less than a yard from him mechanically at short range without letting go of it he thrust a brand full into her open and snarling mouth  she sprang away yelling with pain and while he took delight in the smell of burning flesh and hair he watched her shaking her head and growling wrathfully a score of feet away  but this time before he dozed again he tied a burning pineknot to his right hand  his eyes were closed but few minutes when the burn of the flame on his flesh awakened him  for several hours he adhered to this programme  every time he was thus awakened he drove back the wolves with flying brands replenished the fire and rearranged the pineknot on his hand  all worked well but there came a time when he fastened the pine knot insecurely  as his eyes closed it fell away from his hand  he dreamed  it seemed to him that he was in fort mcgurry  it was warm and comfortable and he was playing cribbage with the factor  also it seemed to him that the fort was besieged by wolves  they were howling at the very gates and sometimes he and the factor paused from the game to listen and laugh at the futile efforts of the wolves to get in  and then so strange was the dream there was a crash  the door was burst open  he could see the wolves flooding into the big livingroom of the fort  they were leaping straight for him and the factor  with the bursting open of the door the noise of their howling had increased tremendously  this howling now bothered him  his dream was merging into something elsehe knew not what but through it all following him persisted the howling  and then he awoke to find the howling real  there was a great snarling and yelping  the wolves were rushing him  they were all about him and upon him  the teeth of one had closed upon his arm  instinctively he leaped into the fire and as he leaped he felt the sharp slash of teeth that tore through the flesh of his leg  then began a fire fight  his stout mittens temporarily protected his hands and he scooped live coals into the air in all directions until the campfire took on the semblance of a volcano  but it could not last long  his face was blistering in the heat his eyebrows and lashes were singed off and the heat was becoming unbearable to his feet  with a flaming brand in each hand he sprang to the edge of the fire  the wolves had been driven back  on every side wherever the live coals had fallen the snow was sizzling and every little while a retiring wolf with wild leap and snort and snarl announced that one such live coal had been stepped upon  flinging his brands at the nearest of his enemies the man thrust his smouldering mittens into the snow and stamped about to cool his feet  his two dogs were missing and he well knew that they had served as a course in the protracted meal which had begun days before with fatty the last course of which would likely be himself in the days to follow  you aint got me yet he cried savagely shaking his fist at the hungry beasts and at the sound of his voice the whole circle was agitated there was a general snarl and the shewolf slid up close to him across the snow and watched him with hungry wistfulness  he set to work to carry out a new idea that had come to him  he extended the fire into a large circle  inside this circle he crouched his sleeping outfit under him as a protection against the melting snow  when he had thus disappeared within his shelter of flame the whole pack came curiously to the rim of the fire to see what had become of him  hitherto they had been denied access to the fire and they now settled down in a closedrawn circle like so many dogs blinking and yawning and stretching their lean bodies in the unaccustomed warmth  then the she wolf sat down pointed her nose at a star and began to howl  one by one the wolves joined her till the whole pack on haunches with noses pointed skyward was howling its hunger cry  dawn came and daylight  the fire was burning low  the fuel had run out and there was need to get more  the man attempted to step out of his circle of flame but the wolves surged to meet him  burning brands made them spring aside but they no longer sprang back  in vain he strove to drive them back  as he gave up and stumbled inside his circle a wolf leaped for him missed and landed with all four feet in the coals  it cried out with terror at the same time snarling and scrambled back to cool its paws in the snow  the man sat down on his blankets in a crouching position  his body leaned forward from the hips  his shoulders relaxed and drooping and his head on his knees advertised that he had given up the struggle  now and again he raised his head to note the dying down of the fire  the circle of flame and coals was breaking into segments with openings in between  these openings grew in size the segments diminished  i guess you can come an get me any time he mumbled  anyway im goin to sleep  once he awakened and in an opening in the circle directly in front of him he saw the shewolf gazing at him  again he awakened a little later though it seemed hours to him  a mysterious change had taken placeso mysterious a change that he was shocked wider awake  something had happened  he could not understand at first  then he discovered it  the wolves were gone  remained only the trampled snow to show how closely they had pressed him  sleep was welling up and gripping him again his head was sinking down upon his knees when he roused with a sudden start  there were cries of men and churn of sleds the creaking of harnesses and the eager whimpering of straining dogs  four sleds pulled in from the river bed to the camp among the trees  half a dozen men were about the man who crouched in the centre of the dying fire  they were shaking and prodding him into consciousness  he looked at them like a drunken man and maundered in strange sleepy speech  red shewolf    come in with the dogs at feedin time    first she ate the dogfood    then she ate the dogs    an after that she ate bill      wheres lord alfred one of the men bellowed in his ear shaking him roughly  he shook his head slowly  no she didnt eat him    hes roostin in a tree at the last camp  dead the man shouted  an in a box henry answered  he jerked his shoulder petulantly away from the grip of his questioner  say you lemme alone    im jes plump tuckered out    goo night everybody  his eyes fluttered and went shut  his chin fell forward on his chest and even as they eased him down upon the blankets his snores were rising on the frosty air  but there was another sound  far and faint it was in the remote distance the cry of the hungry wolfpack as it took the trail of other meat than the man it had just missed     part ii   chapter ithe battle of the fangs   it was the shewolf who had first caught the sound of mens voices and the whining of the sleddogs and it was the shewolf who was first to spring away from the cornered man in his circle of dying flame  the pack had been loath to forego the kill it had hunted down and it lingered for several minutes making sure of the sounds and then it too sprang away on the trail made by the shewolf  running at the forefront of the pack was a large grey wolfone of its several leaders  it was he who directed the packs course on the heels of the shewolf  it was he who snarled warningly at the younger members of the pack or slashed at them with his fangs when they ambitiously tried to pass him  and it was he who increased the pace when he sighted the shewolf now trotting slowly across the snow  she dropped in alongside by him as though it were her appointed position and took the pace of the pack  he did not snarl at her nor show his teeth when any leap of hers chanced to put her in advance of him  on the contrary he seemed kindly disposed toward hertoo kindly to suit her for he was prone to run near to her and when he ran too near it was she who snarled and showed her teeth  nor was she above slashing his shoulder sharply on occasion  at such times he betrayed no anger  he merely sprang to the side and ran stiffly ahead for several awkward leaps in carriage and conduct resembling an abashed country swain  this was his one trouble in the running of the pack but she had other troubles  on her other side ran a gaunt old wolf grizzled and marked with the scars of many battles  he ran always on her right side  the fact that he had but one eye and that the left eye might account for this  he also was addicted to crowding her to veering toward her till his scarred muzzle touched her body or shoulder or neck  as with the running mate on the left she repelled these attentions with her teeth but when both bestowed their attentions at the same time she was roughly jostled being compelled with quick snaps to either side to drive both lovers away and at the same time to maintain her forward leap with the pack and see the way of her feet before her  at such times her running mates flashed their teeth and growled threateningly across at each other they might have fought but even wooing and its rivalry waited upon the more pressing hungerneed of the pack  after each repulse when the old wolf sheered abruptly away from the sharptoothed object of his desire he shouldered against a young three yearold that ran on his blind right side  this young wolf had attained his full size and considering the weak and famished condition of the pack he possessed more than the average vigour and spirit  nevertheless he ran with his head even with the shoulder of his oneeyed elder  when he ventured to run abreast of the older wolf which was seldom a snarl and a snap sent him back even with the shoulder again  sometimes however he dropped cautiously and slowly behind and edged in between the old leader and the shewolf  this was doubly resented even triply resented  when she snarled her displeasure the old leader would whirl on the threeyearold  sometimes she whirled with him  and sometimes the young leader on the left whirled too  at such times confronted by three sets of savage teeth the young wolf stopped precipitately throwing himself back on his haunches with fore legs stiff mouth menacing and mane bristling  this confusion in the front of the moving pack always caused confusion in the rear  the wolves behind collided with the young wolf and expressed their displeasure by administering sharp nips on his hindlegs and flanks  he was laying up trouble for himself for lack of food and short tempers went together but with the boundless faith of youth he persisted in repeating the manoeuvre every little while though it never succeeded in gaining anything for him but discomfiture  had there been food lovemaking and fighting would have gone on apace and the packformation would have been broken up  but the situation of the pack was desperate  it was lean with longstanding hunger  it ran below its ordinary speed  at the rear limped the weak members the very young and the very old  at the front were the strongest  yet all were more like skeletons than fullbodied wolves  nevertheless with the exception of the ones that limped the movements of the animals were effortless and tireless  their stringy muscles seemed founts of inexhaustible energy  behind every steellike contraction of a muscle lay another steellike contraction and another and another apparently without end  they ran many miles that day  they ran through the night  and the next day found them still running  they were running over the surface of a world frozen and dead  no life stirred  they alone moved through the vast inertness  they alone were alive and they sought for other things that were alive in order that they might devour them and continue to live  they crossed low divides and ranged a dozen small streams in a lowerlying country before their quest was rewarded  then they came upon moose  it was a big bull they first found  here was meat and life and it was guarded by no mysterious fires nor flying missiles of flame  splay hoofs and palmated antlers they knew and they flung their customary patience and caution to the wind  it was a brief fight and fierce  the big bull was beset on every side  he ripped them open or split their skulls with shrewdly driven blows of his great hoofs  he crushed them and broke them on his large horns  he stamped them into the snow under him in the wallowing struggle  but he was foredoomed and he went down with the shewolf tearing savagely at his throat and with other teeth fixed everywhere upon him devouring him alive before ever his last struggles ceased or his last damage had been wrought  there was food in plenty  the bull weighed over eight hundred poundsfully twenty pounds of meat per mouth for the fortyodd wolves of the pack  but if they could fast prodigiously they could feed prodigiously and soon a few scattered bones were all that remained of the splendid live brute that had faced the pack a few hours before  there was now much resting and sleeping  with full stomachs bickering and quarrelling began among the younger males and this continued through the few days that followed before the breakingup of the pack  the famine was over  the wolves were now in the country of game and though they still hunted in pack they hunted more cautiously cutting out heavy cows or crippled old bulls from the small mooseherds they ran across  there came a day in this land of plenty when the wolfpack split in half and went in different directions  the shewolf the young leader on her left and the oneeyed elder on her right led their half of the pack down to the mackenzie river and across into the lake country to the east each day this remnant of the pack dwindled  two by two male and female the wolves were deserting  occasionally a solitary male was driven out by the sharp teeth of his rivals  in the end there remained only four the shewolf the young leader the oneeyed one and the ambitious three yearold  the shewolf had by now developed a ferocious temper  her three suitors all bore the marks of her teeth  yet they never replied in kind never defended themselves against her  they turned their shoulders to her most savage slashes and with wagging tails and mincing steps strove to placate her wrath  but if they were all mildness toward her they were all fierceness toward one another  the threeyearold grew too ambitious in his fierceness  he caught the oneeyed elder on his blind side and ripped his ear into ribbons  though the grizzled old fellow could see only on one side against the youth and vigour of the other he brought into play the wisdom of long years of experience  his lost eye and his scarred muzzle bore evidence to the nature of his experience  he had survived too many battles to be in doubt for a moment about what to do  the battle began fairly but it did not end fairly  there was no telling what the outcome would have been for the third wolf joined the elder and together old leader and young leader they attacked the ambitious threeyearold and proceeded to destroy him  he was beset on either side by the merciless fangs of his erstwhile comrades  forgotten were the days they had hunted together the game they had pulled down the famine they had suffered  that business was a thing of the past  the business of love was at handever a sterner and crueller business than that of foodgetting  and in the meanwhile the shewolf the cause of it all sat down contentedly on her haunches and watched  she was even pleased  this was her dayand it came not oftenwhen manes bristled and fang smote fang or ripped and tore the yielding flesh all for the possession of her  and in the business of love the threeyearold who had made this his first adventure upon it yielded up his life  on either side of his body stood his two rivals  they were gazing at the shewolf who sat smiling in the snow  but the elder leader was wise very wise in love even as in battle  the younger leader turned his head to lick a wound on his shoulder  the curve of his neck was turned toward his rival  with his one eye the elder saw the opportunity  he darted in low and closed with his fangs  it was a long ripping slash and deep as well  his teeth in passing burst the wall of the great vein of the throat  then he leaped clear  the young leader snarled terribly but his snarl broke midmost into a tickling cough  bleeding and coughing already stricken he sprang at the elder and fought while life faded from him his legs going weak beneath him the light of day dulling on his eyes his blows and springs falling shorter and shorter  and all the while the shewolf sat on her haunches and smiled  she was made glad in vague ways by the battle for this was the lovemaking of the wild the sextragedy of the natural world that was tragedy only to those that died  to those that survived it was not tragedy but realisation and achievement  when the young leader lay in the snow and moved no more one eye stalked over to the shewolf  his carriage was one of mingled triumph and caution  he was plainly expectant of a rebuff and he was just as plainly surprised when her teeth did not flash out at him in anger  for the first time she met him with a kindly manner  she sniffed noses with him and even condescended to leap about and frisk and play with him in quite puppyish fashion  and he for all his grey years and sage experience behaved quite as puppyishly and even a little more foolishly  forgotten already were the vanquished rivals and the lovetale redwritten on the snow  forgotten save once when old one eye stopped for a moment to lick his stiffening wounds  then it was that his lips half writhed into a snarl and the hair of his neck and shoulders involuntarily bristled while he half crouched for a spring his claws spasmodically clutching into the snowsurface for firmer footing  but it was all forgotten the next moment as he sprang after the shewolf who was coyly leading him a chase through the woods  after that they ran side by side like good friends who have come to an understanding  the days passed by and they kept together hunting their meat and killing and eating it in common  after a time the shewolf began to grow restless  she seemed to be searching for something that she could not find  the hollows under fallen trees seemed to attract her and she spent much time nosing about among the larger snowpiled crevices in the rocks and in the caves of overhanging banks  old one eye was not interested at all but he followed her goodnaturedly in her quest and when her investigations in particular places were unusually protracted he would lie down and wait until she was ready to go on  they did not remain in one place but travelled across country until they regained the mackenzie river down which they slowly went leaving it often to hunt game along the small streams that entered it but always returning to it again  sometimes they chanced upon other wolves usually in pairs but there was no friendliness of intercourse displayed on either side no gladness at meeting no desire to return to the packformation  several times they encountered solitary wolves  these were always males and they were pressingly insistent on joining with one eye and his mate  this he resented and when she stood shoulder to shoulder with him bristling and showing her teeth the aspiring solitary ones would back off turntail and continue on their lonely way  one moonlight night running through the quiet forest one eye suddenly halted  his muzzle went up his tail stiffened and his nostrils dilated as he scented the air  one foot also he held up after the manner of a dog  he was not satisfied and he continued to smell the air striving to understand the message borne upon it to him  one careless sniff had satisfied his mate and she trotted on to reassure him  though he followed her he was still dubious and he could not forbear an occasional halt in order more carefully to study the warning  she crept out cautiously on the edge of a large open space in the midst of the trees  for some time she stood alone  then one eye creeping and crawling every sense on the alert every hair radiating infinite suspicion joined her  they stood side by side watching and listening and smelling  to their ears came the sounds of dogs wrangling and scuffling the guttural cries of men the sharper voices of scolding women and once the shrill and plaintive cry of a child  with the exception of the huge bulks of the skinlodges little could be seen save the flames of the fire broken by the movements of intervening bodies and the smoke rising slowly on the quiet air  but to their nostrils came the myriad smells of an indian camp carrying a story that was largely incomprehensible to one eye but every detail of which the shewolf knew  she was strangely stirred and sniffed and sniffed with an increasing delight  but old one eye was doubtful  he betrayed his apprehension and started tentatively to go  she turned and touched his neck with her muzzle in a reassuring way then regarded the camp again  a new wistfulness was in her face but it was not the wistfulness of hunger she was thrilling to a desire that urged her to go forward to be in closer to that fire to be squabbling with the dogs and to be avoiding and dodging the stumbling feet of men  one eye moved impatiently beside her her unrest came back upon her and she knew again her pressing need to find the thing for which she searched  she turned and trotted back into the forest to the great relief of one eye who trotted a little to the fore until they were well within the shelter of the trees  as they slid along noiseless as shadows in the moonlight they came upon a runway  both noses went down to the footprints in the snow these footprints were very fresh  one eye ran ahead cautiously his mate at his heels  the broad pads of their feet were spread wide and in contact with the snow were like velvet  one eye caught sight of a dim movement of white in the midst of the white  his sliding gait had been deceptively swift but it was as nothing to the speed at which he now ran  before him was bounding the faint patch of white he had discovered  they were running along a narrow alley flanked on either side by a growth of young spruce  through the trees the mouth of the alley could be seen opening out on a moonlit glade  old one eye was rapidly overhauling the fleeing shape of white  bound by bound he gained  now he was upon it one leap more and his teeth would be sinking into it  but that leap was never made  high in the air and straight up soared the shape of white now a struggling snowshoe rabbit that leaped and bounded executing a fantastic dance there above him in the air and never once returning to earth  one eye sprang back with a snort of sudden fright then shrank down to the snow and crouched snarling threats at this thing of fear he did not understand  but the shewolf coolly thrust past him  she poised for a moment then sprang for the dancing rabbit  she too soared high but not so high as the quarry and her teeth clipped emptily together with a metallic snap  she made another leap and another  her mate had slowly relaxed from his crouch and was watching her  he now evinced displeasure at her repeated failures and himself made a mighty spring upward  his teeth closed upon the rabbit and he bore it back to earth with him  but at the same time there was a suspicious crackling movement beside him and his astonished eye saw a young spruce sapling bending down above him to strike him  his jaws let go their grip and he leaped backward to escape this strange danger his lips drawn back from his fangs his throat snarling every hair bristling with rage and fright  and in that moment the sapling reared its slender length upright and the rabbit soared dancing in the air again  the shewolf was angry  she sank her fangs into her mates shoulder in reproof and he frightened unaware of what constituted this new onslaught struck back ferociously and in still greater fright ripping down the side of the shewolfs muzzle  for him to resent such reproof was equally unexpected to her and she sprang upon him in snarling indignation  then he discovered his mistake and tried to placate her but she proceeded to punish him roundly until he gave over all attempts at placation and whirled in a circle his head away from her his shoulders receiving the punishment of her teeth  in the meantime the rabbit danced above them in the air  the shewolf sat down in the snow and old one eye now more in fear of his mate than of the mysterious sapling again sprang for the rabbit  as he sank back with it between his teeth he kept his eye on the sapling  as before it followed him back to earth  he crouched down under the impending blow his hair bristling but his teeth still keeping tight hold of the rabbit but the blow did not fall  the sapling remained bent above him  when he moved it moved and he growled at it through his clenched jaws when he remained still it remained still and he concluded it was safer to continue remaining still  yet the warm blood of the rabbit tasted good in his mouth  it was his mate who relieved him from the quandary in which he found himself  she took the rabbit from him and while the sapling swayed and teetered threateningly above her she calmly gnawed off the rabbits head at once the sapling shot up and after that gave no more trouble remaining in the decorous and perpendicular position in which nature had intended it to grow  then between them the shewolf and one eye devoured the game which the mysterious sapling had caught for them  there were other runways and alleys where rabbits were hanging in the air and the wolfpair prospected them all the shewolf leading the way old one eye following and observant learning the method of robbing snaresa knowledge destined to stand him in good stead in the days to come    chapter iithe lair   for two days the shewolf and one eye hung about the indian camp  he was worried and apprehensive yet the camp lured his mate and she was loath to depart  but when one morning the air was rent with the report of a rifle close at hand and a bullet smashed against a tree trunk several inches from one eyes head they hesitated no more but went off on a long swinging lope that put quick miles between them and the danger  they did not go fara couple of days journey  the shewolfs need to find the thing for which she searched had now become imperative  she was getting very heavy and could run but slowly  once in the pursuit of a rabbit which she ordinarily would have caught with ease she gave over and lay down and rested  one eye came to her but when he touched her neck gently with his muzzle she snapped at him with such quick fierceness that he tumbled over backward and cut a ridiculous figure in his effort to escape her teeth  her temper was now shorter than ever but he had become more patient than ever and more solicitous  and then she found the thing for which she sought  it was a few miles up a small stream that in the summer time flowed into the mackenzie but that then was frozen over and frozen down to its rocky bottoma dead stream of solid white from source to mouth  the shewolf was trotting wearily along her mate well in advance when she came upon the overhanging high claybank  she turned aside and trotted over to it the wear and tear of spring storms and melting snows had underwashed the bank and in one place had made a small cave out of a narrow fissure  she paused at the mouth of the cave and looked the wall over carefully then on one side and the other she ran along the base of the wall to where its abrupt bulk merged from the softerlined landscape  returning to the cave she entered its narrow mouth  for a short three feet she was compelled to crouch then the walls widened and rose higher in a little round chamber nearly six feet in diameter  the roof barely cleared her head  it was dry and cosey  she inspected it with painstaking care while one eye who had returned stood in the entrance and patiently watched her  she dropped her head with her nose to the ground and directed toward a point near to her closely bunched feet and around this point she circled several times then with a tired sigh that was almost a grunt she curled her body in relaxed her legs and dropped down her head toward the entrance  one eye with pointed interested ears laughed at her and beyond outlined against the white light she could see the brush of his tail waving goodnaturedly  her own ears with a snuggling movement laid their sharp points backward and down against the head for a moment while her mouth opened and her tongue lolled peaceably out and in this way she expressed that she was pleased and satisfied  one eye was hungry  though he lay down in the entrance and slept his sleep was fitful  he kept awaking and cocking his ears at the bright world without where the april sun was blazing across the snow  when he dozed upon his ears would steal the faint whispers of hidden trickles of running water and he would rouse and listen intently  the sun had come back and all the awakening northland world was calling to him  life was stirring  the feel of spring was in the air the feel of growing life under the snow of sap ascending in the trees of buds bursting the shackles of the frost  he cast anxious glances at his mate but she showed no desire to get up he looked outside and half a dozen snowbirds fluttered across his field of vision  he started to get up then looked back to his mate again and settled down and dozed  a shrill and minute singing stole upon his heating  once and twice he sleepily brushed his nose with his paw then he woke up  there buzzing in the air at the tip of his nose was a lone mosquito  it was a fullgrown mosquito one that had lain frozen in a dry log all winter and that had now been thawed out by the sun  he could resist the call of the world no longer  besides he was hungry  he crawled over to his mate and tried to persuade her to get up  but she only snarled at him and he walked out alone into the bright sunshine to find the snowsurface soft under foot and the travelling difficult  he went up the frozen bed of the stream where the snow shaded by the trees was yet hard and crystalline  he was gone eight hours and he came back through the darkness hungrier than when he had started  he had found game but he had not caught it  he had broken through the melting snow crust and wallowed while the snowshoe rabbits had skimmed along on top lightly as ever  he paused at the mouth of the cave with a sudden shock of suspicion faint strange sounds came from within  they were sounds not made by his mate and yet they were remotely familiar  he bellied cautiously inside and was met by a warning snarl from the shewolf  this he received without perturbation though he obeyed it by keeping his distance but he remained interested in the other soundsfaint muffled sobbings and slubberings  his mate warned him irritably away and he curled up and slept in the entrance  when morning came and a dim light pervaded the lair he again sought after the source of the remotely familiar sounds  there was a new note in his mates warning snarl  it was a jealous note and he was very careful in keeping a respectful distance  nevertheless he made out sheltering between her legs against the length of her body five strange little bundles of life very feeble very helpless making tiny whimpering noises with eyes that did not open to the light  he was surprised  it was not the first time in his long and successful life that this thing had happened  it had happened many times yet each time it was as fresh a surprise as ever to him  his mate looked at him anxiously  every little while she emitted a low growl and at times when it seemed to her he approached too near the growl shot up in her throat to a sharp snarl  of her own experience she had no memory of the thing happening but in her instinct which was the experience of all the mothers of wolves there lurked a memory of fathers that had eaten their newborn and helpless progeny  it manifested itself as a fear strong within her that made her prevent one eye from more closely inspecting the cubs he had fathered  but there was no danger  old one eye was feeling the urge of an impulse that was in turn an instinct that had come down to him from all the fathers of wolves  he did not question it nor puzzle over it  it was there in the fibre of his being and it was the most natural thing in the world that he should obey it by turning his back on his newborn family and by trotting out and away on the meattrail whereby he lived  five or six miles from the lair the stream divided its forks going off among the mountains at a right angle  here leading up the left fork he came upon a fresh track  he smelled it and found it so recent that he crouched swiftly and looked in the direction in which it disappeared then he turned deliberately and took the right fork  the footprint was much larger than the one his own feet made and he knew that in the wake of such a trail there was little meat for him  half a mile up the right fork his quick ears caught the sound of gnawing teeth  he stalked the quarry and found it to be a porcupine standing upright against a tree and trying his teeth on the bark  one eye approached carefully but hopelessly  he knew the breed though he had never met it so far north before and never in his long life had porcupine served him for a meal  but he had long since learned that there was such a thing as chance or opportunity and he continued to draw near  there was never any telling what might happen for with live things events were somehow always happening differently  the porcupine rolled itself into a ball radiating long sharp needles in all directions that defied attack  in his youth one eye had once sniffed too near a similar apparently inert ball of quills and had the tail flick out suddenly in his face  one quill he had carried away in his muzzle where it had remained for weeks a rankling flame until it finally worked out  so he lay down in a comfortable crouching position his nose fully a foot away and out of the line of the tail  thus he waited keeping perfectly quiet  there was no telling  something might happen  the porcupine might unroll  there might be opportunity for a deft and ripping thrust of paw into the tender unguarded belly  but at the end of half an hour he arose growled wrathfully at the motionless ball and trotted on  he had waited too often and futilely in the past for porcupines to unroll to waste any more time  he continued up the right fork  the day wore along and nothing rewarded his hunt  the urge of his awakened instinct of fatherhood was strong upon him  he must find meat  in the afternoon he blundered upon a ptarmigan  he came out of a thicket and found himself face to face with the slowwitted bird  it was sitting on a log not a foot beyond the end of his nose each saw the other  the bird made a startled rise but he struck it with his paw and smashed it down to earth then pounced upon it and caught it in his teeth as it scuttled across the snow trying to rise in the air again  as his teeth crunched through the tender flesh and fragile bones he began naturally to eat  then he remembered and turning on the back track started for home carrying the ptarmigan in his mouth  a mile above the forks running velvetfooted as was his custom a gliding shadow that cautiously prospected each new vista of the trail he came upon later imprints of the large tracks he had discovered in the early morning  as the track led his way he followed prepared to meet the maker of it at every turn of the stream  he slid his head around a corner of rock where began an unusually large bend in the stream and his quick eyes made out something that sent him crouching swiftly down  it was the maker of the track a large female lynx  she was crouching as he had crouched once that day in front of her the tightrolled ball of quills  if he had been a gliding shadow before he now became the ghost of such a shadow as he crept and circled around and came up well to leeward of the silent motionless pair  he lay down in the snow depositing the ptarmigan beside him and with eyes peering through the needles of a lowgrowing spruce he watched the play of life before himthe waiting lynx and the waiting porcupine each intent on life and such was the curiousness of the game the way of life for one lay in the eating of the other and the way of life for the other lay in being not eaten  while old one eye the wolf crouching in the covert played his part too in the game waiting for some strange freak of chance that might help him on the meattrail which was his way of life  half an hour passed an hour and nothing happened  the balls of quills might have been a stone for all it moved the lynx might have been frozen to marble and old one eye might have been dead  yet all three animals were keyed to a tenseness of living that was almost painful and scarcely ever would it come to them to be more alive than they were then in their seeming petrifaction  one eye moved slightly and peered forth with increased eagerness something was happening  the porcupine had at last decided that its enemy had gone away  slowly cautiously it was unrolling its ball of impregnable armour  it was agitated by no tremor of anticipation slowly slowly the bristling ball straightened out and lengthened  one eye watching felt a sudden moistness in his mouth and a drooling of saliva involuntary excited by the living meat that was spreading itself like a repast before him  not quite entirely had the porcupine unrolled when it discovered its enemy  in that instant the lynx struck  the blow was like a flash of light  the paw with rigid claws curving like talons shot under the tender belly and came back with a swift ripping movement  had the porcupine been entirely unrolled or had it not discovered its enemy a fraction of a second before the blow was struck the paw would have escaped unscathed but a sideflick of the tail sank sharp quills into it as it was withdrawn  everything had happened at oncethe blow the counterblow the squeal of agony from the porcupine the big cats squall of sudden hurt and astonishment  one eye half arose in his excitement his ears up his tail straight out and quivering behind him  the lynxs bad temper got the best of her  she sprang savagely at the thing that had hurt her  but the porcupine squealing and grunting with disrupted anatomy trying feebly to roll up into its ballprotection flicked out its tail again and again the big cat squalled with hurt and astonishment  then she fell to backing away and sneezing her nose bristling with quills like a monstrous pincushion  she brushed her nose with her paws trying to dislodge the fiery darts thrust it into the snow and rubbed it against twigs and branches and all the time leaping about ahead sidewise up and down in a frenzy of pain and fright  she sneezed continually and her stub of a tail was doing its best toward lashing about by giving quick violent jerks  she quit her antics and quieted down for a long minute  one eye watched  and even he could not repress a start and an involuntary bristling of hair along his back when she suddenly leaped without warning straight up in the air at the same time emitting a long and most terrible squall  then she sprang away up the trail squalling with every leap she made  it was not until her racket had faded away in the distance and died out that one eye ventured forth  he walked as delicately as though all the snow were carpeted with porcupine quills erect and ready to pierce the soft pads of his feet  the porcupine met his approach with a furious squealing and a clashing of its long teeth  it had managed to roll up in a ball again but it was not quite the old compact ball its muscles were too much torn for that  it had been ripped almost in half and was still bleeding profusely  one eye scooped out mouthfuls of the bloodsoaked snow and chewed and tasted and swallowed  this served as a relish and his hunger increased mightily but he was too old in the world to forget his caution  he waited  he lay down and waited while the porcupine grated its teeth and uttered grunts and sobs and occasional sharp little squeals  in a little while one eye noticed that the quills were drooping and that a great quivering had set up  the quivering came to an end suddenly  there was a final defiant clash of the long teeth  then all the quills drooped quite down and the body relaxed and moved no more  with a nervous shrinking paw one eye stretched out the porcupine to its full length and turned it over on its back  nothing had happened  it was surely dead  he studied it intently for a moment then took a careful grip with his teeth and started off down the stream partly carrying partly dragging the porcupine with head turned to the side so as to avoid stepping on the prickly mass  he recollected something dropped the burden and trotted back to where he had left the ptarmigan he did not hesitate a moment  he knew clearly what was to be done and this he did by promptly eating the ptarmigan  then he returned and took up his burden  when he dragged the result of his days hunt into the cave the shewolf inspected it turned her muzzle to him and lightly licked him on the neck  but the next instant she was warning him away from the cubs with a snarl that was less harsh than usual and that was more apologetic than menacing  her instinctive fear of the father of her progeny was toning down  he was behaving as a wolffather should and manifesting no unholy desire to devour the young lives she had brought into the world    chapter iiithe grey cub   he was different from his brothers and sisters  their hair already betrayed the reddish hue inherited from their mother the shewolf while he alone in this particular took after his father  he was the one little grey cub of the litter  he had bred true to the straight wolf stockin fact he had bred true to old one eye himself physically with but a single exception and that was he had two eyes to his fathers one  the grey cubs eyes had not been open long yet already he could see with steady clearness  and while his eyes were still closed he had felt tasted and smelled  he knew his two brothers and his two sisters very well  he had begun to romp with them in a feeble awkward way and even to squabble his little throat vibrating with a queer rasping noise the forerunner of the growl as he worked himself into a passion  and long before his eyes had opened he had learned by touch taste and smell to know his mothera fount of warmth and liquid food and tenderness  she possessed a gentle caressing tongue that soothed him when it passed over his soft little body and that impelled him to snuggle close against her and to doze off to sleep  most of the first month of his life had been passed thus in sleeping but now he could see quite well and he stayed awake for longer periods of time and he was coming to learn his world quite well  his world was gloomy but he did not know that for he knew no other world  it was dim lighted but his eyes had never had to adjust themselves to any other light  his world was very small  its limits were the walls of the lair but as he had no knowledge of the wide world outside he was never oppressed by the narrow confines of his existence  but he had early discovered that one wall of his world was different from the rest  this was the mouth of the cave and the source of light  he had discovered that it was different from the other walls long before he had any thoughts of his own any conscious volitions  it had been an irresistible attraction before ever his eyes opened and looked upon it the light from it had beat upon his sealed lids and the eyes and the optic nerves had pulsated to little sparklike flashes warmcoloured and strangely pleasing  the life of his body and of every fibre of his body the life that was the very substance of his body and that was apart from his own personal life had yearned toward this light and urged his body toward it in the same way that the cunning chemistry of a plant urges it toward the sun  always in the beginning before his conscious life dawned he had crawled toward the mouth of the cave  and in this his brothers and sisters were one with him  never in that period did any of them crawl toward the dark corners of the backwall  the light drew them as if they were plants the chemistry of the life that composed them demanded the light as a necessity of being and their little puppetbodies crawled blindly and chemically like the tendrils of a vine  later on when each developed individuality and became personally conscious of impulsions and desires the attraction of the light increased  they were always crawling and sprawling toward it and being driven back from it by their mother  it was in this way that the grey cub learned other attributes of his mother than the soft soothing tongue  in his insistent crawling toward the light he discovered in her a nose that with a sharp nudge administered rebuke and later a paw that crushed him down and rolled him over and over with swift calculating stroke  thus he learned hurt and on top of it he learned to avoid hurt first by not incurring the risk of it and second when he had incurred the risk by dodging and by retreating  these were conscious actions and were the results of his first generalisations upon the world  before that he had recoiled automatically from hurt as he had crawled automatically toward the light  after that he recoiled from hurt because he knew that it was hurt  he was a fierce little cub  so were his brothers and sisters  it was to be expected  he was a carnivorous animal  he came of a breed of meat killers and meateaters  his father and mother lived wholly upon meat the milk he had sucked with his first flickering life was milk transformed directly from meat and now at a month old when his eyes had been open for but a week he was beginning himself to eat meatmeat halfdigested by the shewolf and disgorged for the five growing cubs that already made too great demand upon her breast  but he was further the fiercest of the litter  he could make a louder rasping growl than any of them  his tiny rages were much more terrible than theirs  it was he that first learned the trick of rolling a fellow cub over with a cunning pawstroke  and it was he that first gripped another cub by the ear and pulled and tugged and growled through jaws tightclenched  and certainly it was he that caused the mother the most trouble in keeping her litter from the mouth of the cave  the fascination of the light for the grey cub increased from day to day he was perpetually departing on yardlong adventures toward the caves entrance and as perpetually being driven back  only he did not know it for an entrance  he did not know anything about entrancespassages whereby one goes from one place to another place  he did not know any other place much less of a way to get there  so to him the entrance of the cave was a walla wall of light  as the sun was to the outside dweller this wall was to him the sun of his world  it attracted him as a candle attracts a moth  he was always striving to attain it  the life that was so swiftly expanding within him urged him continually toward the wall of light  the life that was within him knew that it was the one way out the way he was predestined to tread  but he himself did not know anything about it  he did not know there was any outside at all  there was one strange thing about this wall of light  his father he had already come to recognise his father as the one other dweller in the world a creature like his mother who slept near the light and was a bringer of meathis father had a way of walking right into the white far wall and disappearing  the grey cub could not understand this though never permitted by his mother to approach that wall he had approached the other walls and encountered hard obstruction on the end of his tender nose  this hurt  and after several such adventures he left the walls alone  without thinking about it he accepted this disappearing into the wall as a peculiarity of his father as milk and halfdigested meat were peculiarities of his mother  in fact the grey cub was not given to thinkingat least to the kind of thinking customary of men  his brain worked in dim ways  yet his conclusions were as sharp and distinct as those achieved by men  he had a method of accepting things without questioning the why and wherefore in reality this was the act of classification  he was never disturbed over why a thing happened  how it happened was sufficient for him  thus when he had bumped his nose on the backwall a few times he accepted that he would not disappear into walls  in the same way he accepted that his father could disappear into walls  but he was not in the least disturbed by desire to find out the reason for the difference between his father and himself  logic and physics were no part of his mental make up  like most creatures of the wild he early experienced famine  there came a time when not only did the meatsupply cease but the milk no longer came from his mothers breast  at first the cubs whimpered and cried but for the most part they slept  it was not long before they were reduced to a coma of hunger  there were no more spats and squabbles no more tiny rages nor attempts at growling while the adventures toward the far white wall ceased altogether  the cubs slept while the life that was in them flickered and died down  one eye was desperate  he ranged far and wide and slept but little in the lair that had now become cheerless and miserable  the shewolf too left her litter and went out in search of meat  in the first days after the birth of the cubs one eye had journeyed several times back to the indian camp and robbed the rabbit snares but with the melting of the snow and the opening of the streams the indian camp had moved away and that source of supply was closed to him  when the grey cub came back to life and again took interest in the far white wall he found that the population of his world had been reduced only one sister remained to him  the rest were gone  as he grew stronger he found himself compelled to play alone for the sister no longer lifted her head nor moved about  his little body rounded out with the meat he now ate but the food had come too late for her  she slept continuously a tiny skeleton flung round with skin in which the flame flickered lower and lower and at last went out  then there came a time when the grey cub no longer saw his father appearing and disappearing in the wall nor lying down asleep in the entrance  this had happened at the end of a second and less severe famine  the shewolf knew why one eye never came back but there was no way by which she could tell what she had seen to the grey cub  hunting herself for meat up the left fork of the stream where lived the lynx she had followed a dayold trail of one eye  and she had found him or what remained of him at the end of the trail  there were many signs of the battle that had been fought and of the lynxs withdrawal to her lair after having won the victory  before she went away the shewolf had found this lair but the signs told her that the lynx was inside and she had not dared to venture in  after that the shewolf in her hunting avoided the left fork  for she knew that in the lynxs lair was a litter of kittens and she knew the lynx for a fierce badtempered creature and a terrible fighter  it was all very well for half a dozen wolves to drive a lynx spitting and bristling up a tree but it was quite a different matter for a lone wolf to encounter a lynxespecially when the lynx was known to have a litter of hungry kittens at her back  but the wild is the wild and motherhood is motherhood at all times fiercely protective whether in the wild or out of it and the time was to come when the shewolf for her grey cubs sake would venture the left fork and the lair in the rocks and the lynxs wrath    chapter ivthe wall of the world   by the time his mother began leaving the cave on hunting expeditions the cub had learned well the law that forbade his approaching the entrance not only had this law been forcibly and many times impressed on him by his mothers nose and paw but in him the instinct of fear was developing  never in his brief cavelife had he encountered anything of which to be afraid  yet fear was in him  it had come down to him from a remote ancestry through a thousand thousand lives  it was a heritage he had received directly from one eye and the shewolf but to them in turn it had been passed down through all the generations of wolves that had gone before  fearthat legacy of the wild which no animal may escape nor exchange for pottage  so the grey cub knew fear though he knew not the stuff of which fear was made  possibly he accepted it as one of the restrictions of life  for he had already learned that there were such restrictions  hunger he had known and when he could not appease his hunger he had felt restriction the hard obstruction of the cavewall the sharp nudge of his mothers nose the smashing stroke of her paw the hunger unappeased of several famines had borne in upon him that all was not freedom in the world that to life there was limitations and restraints  these limitations and restraints were laws  to be obedient to them was to escape hurt and make for happiness  he did not reason the question out in this man fashion  he merely classified the things that hurt and the things that did not hurt  and after such classification he avoided the things that hurt the restrictions and restraints in order to enjoy the satisfactions and the remunerations of life  thus it was that in obedience to the law laid down by his mother and in obedience to the law of that unknown and nameless thing fear he kept away from the mouth of the cave  it remained to him a white wall of light  when his mother was absent he slept most of the time while during the intervals that he was awake he kept very quiet suppressing the whimpering cries that tickled in his throat and strove for noise  once lying awake he heard a strange sound in the white wall  he did not know that it was a wolverine standing outside all atrembling with its own daring and cautiously scenting out the contents of the cave  the cub knew only that the sniff was strange a something unclassified therefore unknown and terriblefor the unknown was one of the chief elements that went into the making of fear  the hair bristled upon the grey cubs back but it bristled silently  how was he to know that this thing that sniffed was a thing at which to bristle  it was not born of any knowledge of his yet it was the visible expression of the fear that was in him and for which in his own life there was no accounting  but fear was accompanied by another instinctthat of concealment  the cub was in a frenzy of terror yet he lay without movement or sound frozen petrified into immobility to all appearances dead  his mother coming home growled as she smelt the wolverines track and bounded into the cave and licked and nozzled him with undue vehemence of affection  and the cub felt that somehow he had escaped a great hurt  but there were other forces at work in the cub the greatest of which was growth  instinct and law demanded of him obedience  but growth demanded disobedience  his mother and fear impelled him to keep away from the white wall  growth is life and life is for ever destined to make for light  so there was no damming up the tide of life that was rising within himrising with every mouthful of meat he swallowed with every breath he drew  in the end one day fear and obedience were swept away by the rush of life and the cub straddled and sprawled toward the entrance  unlike any other wall with which he had had experience this wall seemed to recede from him as he approached  no hard surface collided with the tender little nose he thrust out tentatively before him  the substance of the wall seemed as permeable and yielding as light  and as condition in his eyes had the seeming of form so he entered into what had been wall to him and bathed in the substance that composed it  it was bewildering  he was sprawling through solidity  and ever the light grew brighter  fear urged him to go back but growth drove him on suddenly he found himself at the mouth of the cave  the wall inside which he had thought himself as suddenly leaped back before him to an immeasurable distance  the light had become painfully bright  he was dazzled by it  likewise he was made dizzy by this abrupt and tremendous extension of space  automatically his eyes were adjusting themselves to the brightness focusing themselves to meet the increased distance of objects  at first the wall had leaped beyond his vision  he now saw it again but it had taken upon itself a remarkable remoteness  also its appearance had changed  it was now a variegated wall composed of the trees that fringed the stream the opposing mountain that towered above the trees and the sky that outtowered the mountain  a great fear came upon him  this was more of the terrible unknown  he crouched down on the lip of the cave and gazed out on the world  he was very much afraid  because it was unknown it was hostile to him therefore the hair stood up on end along his back and his lips wrinkled weakly in an attempt at a ferocious and intimidating snarl  out of his puniness and fright he challenged and menaced the whole wide world  nothing happened  he continued to gaze and in his interest he forgot to snarl  also he forgot to be afraid  for the time fear had been routed by growth while growth had assumed the guise of curiosity  he began to notice near objectsan open portion of the stream that flashed in the sun the blasted pinetree that stood at the base of the slope and the slope itself that ran right up to him and ceased two feet beneath the lip of the cave on which he crouched  now the grey cub had lived all his days on a level floor  he had never experienced the hurt of a fall  he did not know what a fall was  so he stepped boldly out upon the air  his hindlegs still rested on the cave lip so he fell forward head downward  the earth struck him a harsh blow on the nose that made him yelp  then he began rolling down the slope over and over  he was in a panic of terror  the unknown had caught him at last  it had gripped savagely hold of him and was about to wreak upon him some terrific hurt  growth was now routed by fear and he kiyid like any frightened puppy  the unknown bore him on he knew not to what frightful hurt and he yelped and kiyid unceasingly  this was a different proposition from crouching in frozen fear while the unknown lurked just alongside  now the unknown had caught tight hold of him  silence would do no good  besides it was not fear but terror that convulsed him  but the slope grew more gradual and its base was grasscovered  here the cub lost momentum  when at last he came to a stop he gave one last agonised yell and then a long whimpering wail  also and quite as a matter of course as though in his life he had already made a thousand toilets he proceeded to lick away the dry clay that soiled him  after that he sat up and gazed about him as might the first man of the earth who landed upon mars  the cub had broken through the wall of the world the unknown had let go its hold of him and here he was without hurt  but the first man on mars would have experienced less unfamiliarity than did he  without any antecedent knowledge without any warning whatever that such existed he found himself an explorer in a totally new world  now that the terrible unknown had let go of him he forgot that the unknown had any terrors  he was aware only of curiosity in all the things about him  he inspected the grass beneath him the mossberry plant just beyond and the dead trunk of the blasted pine that stood on the edge of an open space among the trees  a squirrel running around the base of the trunk came full upon him and gave him a great fright he cowered down and snarled  but the squirrel was as badly scared  it ran up the tree and from a point of safety chattered back savagely  this helped the cubs courage and though the woodpecker he next encountered gave him a start he proceeded confidently on his way  such was his confidence that when a moosebird impudently hopped up to him he reached out at it with a playful paw  the result was a sharp peck on the end of his nose that made him cower down and kiyi  the noise he made was too much for the moosebird who sought safety in flight  but the cub was learning  his misty little mind had already made an unconscious classification  there were live things and things not alive also he must watch out for the live things  the things not alive remained always in one place but the live things moved about and there was no telling what they might do  the thing to expect of them was the unexpected and for this he must be prepared  he travelled very clumsily  he ran into sticks and things  a twig that he thought a long way off would the next instant hit him on the nose or rake along his ribs  there were inequalities of surface  sometimes he overstepped and stubbed his nose  quite as often he understepped and stubbed his feet  then there were the pebbles and stones that turned under him when he trod upon them and from them he came to know that the things not alive were not all in the same state of stable equilibrium as was his cavealso that small things not alive were more liable than large things to fall down or turn over  but with every mishap he was learning  the longer he walked the better he walked  he was adjusting himself  he was learning to calculate his own muscular movements to know his physical limitations to measure distances between objects and between objects and himself  his was the luck of the beginner  born to be a hunter of meat though he did not know it he blundered upon meat just outside his own cavedoor on his first foray into the world  it was by sheer blundering that he chanced upon the shrewdly hidden ptarmigan nest  he fell into it  he had essayed to walk along the trunk of a fallen pine  the rotten bark gave way under his feet and with a despairing yelp he pitched down the rounded crescent smashed through the leafage and stalks of a small bush and in the heart of the bush on the ground fetched up in the midst of seven ptarmigan chicks  they made noises and at first he was frightened at them  then he perceived that they were very little and he became bolder  they moved he placed his paw on one and its movements were accelerated  this was a source of enjoyment to him  he smelled it  he picked it up in his mouth  it struggled and tickled his tongue  at the same time he was made aware of a sensation of hunger  his jaws closed together  there was a crunching of fragile bones and warm blood ran in his mouth  the taste of it was good  this was meat the same as his mother gave him only it was alive between his teeth and therefore better  so he ate the ptarmigan  nor did he stop till he had devoured the whole brood  then he licked his chops in quite the same way his mother did and began to crawl out of the bush  he encountered a feathered whirlwind  he was confused and blinded by the rush of it and the beat of angry wings  he hid his head between his paws and yelped  the blows increased  the mother ptarmigan was in a fury then he became angry  he rose up snarling striking out with his paws he sank his tiny teeth into one of the wings and pulled and tugged sturdily  the ptarmigan struggled against him showering blows upon him with her free wing  it was his first battle  he was elated  he forgot all about the unknown  he no longer was afraid of anything  he was fighting tearing at a live thing that was striking at him  also this live thing was meat  the lust to kill was on him  he had just destroyed little live things  he would now destroy a big live thing  he was too busy and happy to know that he was happy  he was thrilling and exulting in ways new to him and greater to him than any he had known before  he held on to the wing and growled between his tightclenched teeth  the ptarmigan dragged him out of the bush  when she turned and tried to drag him back into the bushs shelter he pulled her away from it and on into the open  and all the time she was making outcry and striking with her free wing while feathers were flying like a snowfall  the pitch to which he was aroused was tremendous  all the fighting blood of his breed was up in him and surging through him  this was living though he did not know it  he was realising his own meaning in the world he was doing that for which he was madekilling meat and battling to kill it  he was justifying his existence than which life can do no greater for life achieves its summit when it does to the uttermost that which it was equipped to do  after a time the ptarmigan ceased her struggling  he still held her by the wing and they lay on the ground and looked at each other  he tried to growl threateningly ferociously  she pecked on his nose which by now what of previous adventures was sore  he winced but held on  she pecked him again and again  from wincing he went to whimpering  he tried to back away from her oblivious to the fact that by his hold on her he dragged her after him  a rain of pecks fell on his illused nose the flood of fight ebbed down in him and releasing his prey he turned tail and scampered on across the open in inglorious retreat  he lay down to rest on the other side of the open near the edge of the bushes his tongue lolling out his chest heaving and panting his nose still hurting him and causing him to continue his whimper  but as he lay there suddenly there came to him a feeling as of something terrible impending  the unknown with all its terrors rushed upon him and he shrank back instinctively into the shelter of the bush  as he did so a draught of air fanned him and a large winged body swept ominously and silently past  a hawk driving down out of the blue had barely missed him  while he lay in the bush recovering from his fright and peering fearfully out the motherptarmigan on the other side of the open space fluttered out of the ravaged nest  it was because of her loss that she paid no attention to the winged bolt of the sky  but the cub saw and it was a warning and a lesson to himthe swift downward swoop of the hawk the short skim of its body just above the ground the strike of its talons in the body of the ptarmigan the ptarmigans squawk of agony and fright and the hawks rush upward into the blue carrying the ptarmigan away with it  it was a long time before the cub left its shelter  he had learned much live things were meat  they were good to eat  also live things when they were large enough could give hurt  it was better to eat small live things like ptarmigan chicks and to let alone large live things like ptarmigan hens  nevertheless he felt a little prick of ambition a sneaking desire to have another battle with that ptarmigan henonly the hawk had carried her away  may be there were other ptarmigan hens  he would go and see  he came down a shelving bank to the stream  he had never seen water before  the footing looked good  there were no inequalities of surface he stepped boldly out on it and went down crying with fear into the embrace of the unknown  it was cold and he gasped breathing quickly the water rushed into his lungs instead of the air that had always accompanied his act of breathing  the suffocation he experienced was like the pang of death  to him it signified death  he had no conscious knowledge of death but like every animal of the wild he possessed the instinct of death  to him it stood as the greatest of hurts  it was the very essence of the unknown it was the sum of the terrors of the unknown the one culminating and unthinkable catastrophe that could happen to him about which he knew nothing and about which he feared everything  he came to the surface and the sweet air rushed into his open mouth  he did not go down again  quite as though it had been a longestablished custom of his he struck out with all his legs and began to swim  the near bank was a yard away but he had come up with his back to it and the first thing his eyes rested upon was the opposite bank toward which he immediately began to swim  the stream was a small one but in the pool it widened out to a score of feet  midway in the passage the current picked up the cub and swept him downstream  he was caught in the miniature rapid at the bottom of the pool  here was little chance for swimming  the quiet water had become suddenly angry  sometimes he was under sometimes on top  at all times he was in violent motion now being turned over or around and again being smashed against a rock  and with every rock he struck he yelped his progress was a series of yelps from which might have been adduced the number of rocks he encountered  below the rapid was a second pool and here captured by the eddy he was gently borne to the bank and as gently deposited on a bed of gravel  he crawled frantically clear of the water and lay down  he had learned some more about the world  water was not alive  yet it moved  also it looked as solid as the earth but was without any solidity at all  his conclusion was that things were not always what they appeared to be  the cubs fear of the unknown was an inherited distrust and it had now been strengthened by experience  thenceforth in the nature of things he would possess an abiding distrust of appearances  he would have to learn the reality of a thing before he could put his faith into it  one other adventure was destined for him that day  he had recollected that there was such a thing in the world as his mother  and then there came to him a feeling that he wanted her more than all the rest of the things in the world  not only was his body tired with the adventures it had undergone but his little brain was equally tired  in all the days he had lived it had not worked so hard as on this one day  furthermore he was sleepy  so he started out to look for the cave and his mother feeling at the same time an overwhelming rush of loneliness and helplessness  he was sprawling along between some bushes when he heard a sharp intimidating cry  there was a flash of yellow before his eyes  he saw a weasel leaping swiftly away from him  it was a small live thing and he had no fear  then before him at his feet he saw an extremely small live thing only several inches long a young weasel that like himself had disobediently gone out adventuring  it tried to retreat before him he turned it over with his paw  it made a queer grating noise  the next moment the flash of yellow reappeared before his eyes  he heard again the intimidating cry and at the same instant received a sharp blow on the side of the neck and felt the sharp teeth of the motherweasel cut into his flesh  while he yelped and kiyid and scrambled backward he saw the mother weasel leap upon her young one and disappear with it into the neighbouring thicket  the cut of her teeth in his neck still hurt but his feelings were hurt more grievously and he sat down and weakly whimpered  this motherweasel was so small and so savage  he was yet to learn that for size and weight the weasel was the most ferocious vindictive and terrible of all the killers of the wild  but a portion of this knowledge was quickly to be his  he was still whimpering when the motherweasel reappeared  she did not rush him now that her young one was safe  she approached more cautiously and the cub had full opportunity to observe her lean snakelike body and her head erect eager and snakelike itself  her sharp menacing cry sent the hair bristling along his back and he snarled warningly at her  she came closer and closer  there was a leap swifter than his unpractised sight and the lean yellow body disappeared for a moment out of the field of his vision  the next moment she was at his throat her teeth buried in his hair and flesh  at first he snarled and tried to fight but he was very young and this was only his first day in the world and his snarl became a whimper his fight a struggle to escape  the weasel never relaxed her hold  she hung on striving to press down with her teeth to the great vein where his lifeblood bubbled  the weasel was a drinker of blood and it was ever her preference to drink from the throat of life itself  the grey cub would have died and there would have been no story to write about him had not the shewolf come bounding through the bushes  the weasel let go the cub and flashed at the shewolfs throat missing but getting a hold on the jaw instead  the shewolf flirted her head like the snap of a whip breaking the weasels hold and flinging it high in the air  and still in the air the shewolfs jaws closed on the lean yellow body and the weasel knew death between the crunching teeth  the cub experienced another access of affection on the part of his mother  her joy at finding him seemed even greater than his joy at being found  she nozzled him and caressed him and licked the cuts made in him by the weasels teeth  then between them mother and cub they ate the blooddrinker and after that went back to the cave and slept    chapter vthe law of meat   the cubs development was rapid  he rested for two days and then ventured forth from the cave again  it was on this adventure that he found the young weasel whose mother he had helped eat and he saw to it that the young weasel went the way of its mother  but on this trip he did not get lost  when he grew tired he found his way back to the cave and slept  and every day thereafter found him out and ranging a wider area  he began to get accurate measurement of his strength and his weakness and to know when to be bold and when to be cautious  he found it expedient to be cautious all the time except for the rare moments when assured of his own intrepidity he abandoned himself to petty rages and lusts  he was always a little demon of fury when he chanced upon a stray ptarmigan  never did he fail to respond savagely to the chatter of the squirrel he had first met on the blasted pine  while the sight of a moosebird almost invariably put him into the wildest of rages for he never forgot the peck on the nose he had received from the first of that ilk he encountered  but there were times when even a moosebird failed to affect him and those were times when he felt himself to be in danger from some other prowling meat hunter  he never forgot the hawk and its moving shadow always sent him crouching into the nearest thicket  he no longer sprawled and straddled and already he was developing the gait of his mother slinking and furtive apparently without exertion yet sliding along with a swiftness that was as deceptive as it was imperceptible  in the matter of meat his luck had been all in the beginning  the seven ptarmigan chicks and the baby weasel represented the sum of his killings his desire to kill strengthened with the days and he cherished hungry ambitions for the squirrel that chattered so volubly and always informed all wild creatures that the wolfcub was approaching  but as birds flew in the air squirrels could climb trees and the cub could only try to crawl unobserved upon the squirrel when it was on the ground  the cub entertained a great respect for his mother  she could get meat and she never failed to bring him his share  further she was unafraid of things  it did not occur to him that this fearlessness was founded upon experience and knowledge  its effect on him was that of an impression of power  his mother represented power and as he grew older he felt this power in the sharper admonishment of her paw while the reproving nudge of her nose gave place to the slash of her fangs  for this likewise he respected his mother  she compelled obedience from him and the older he grew the shorter grew her temper  famine came again and the cub with clearer consciousness knew once more the bite of hunger  the shewolf ran herself thin in the quest for meat she rarely slept any more in the cave spending most of her time on the meattrail and spending it vainly  this famine was not a long one but it was severe while it lasted  the cub found no more milk in his mothers breast nor did he get one mouthful of meat for himself  before he had hunted in play for the sheer joyousness of it now he hunted in deadly earnestness and found nothing  yet the failure of it accelerated his development  he studied the habits of the squirrel with greater carefulness and strove with greater craft to steal upon it and surprise it  he studied the woodmice and tried to dig them out of their burrows and he learned much about the ways of moosebirds and woodpeckers  and there came a day when the hawks shadow did not drive him crouching into the bushes  he had grown stronger and wiser and more confident  also he was desperate  so he sat on his haunches conspicuously in an open space and challenged the hawk down out of the sky  for he knew that there floating in the blue above him was meat the meat his stomach yearned after so insistently  but the hawk refused to come down and give battle and the cub crawled away into a thicket and whimpered his disappointment and hunger  the famine broke  the shewolf brought home meat  it was strange meat different from any she had ever brought before  it was a lynx kitten partly grown like the cub but not so large  and it was all for him his mother had satisfied her hunger elsewhere though he did not know that it was the rest of the lynx litter that had gone to satisfy her  nor did he know the desperateness of her deed  he knew only that the velvet furred kitten was meat and he ate and waxed happier with every mouthful  a full stomach conduces to inaction and the cub lay in the cave sleeping against his mothers side  he was aroused by her snarling never had he heard her snarl so terribly  possibly in her whole life it was the most terrible snarl she ever gave  there was reason for it and none knew it better than she  a lynxs lair is not despoiled with impunity  in the full glare of the afternoon light crouching in the entrance of the cave the cub saw the lynxmother  the hair rippled up along his back at the sight  here was fear and it did not require his instinct to tell him of it  and if sight alone were not sufficient the cry of rage the intruder gave beginning with a snarl and rushing abruptly upward into a hoarse screech was convincing enough in itself  the cub felt the prod of the life that was in him and stood up and snarled valiantly by his mothers side  but she thrust him ignominiously away and behind her  because of the lowroofed entrance the lynx could not leap in and when she made a crawling rush of it the shewolf sprang upon her and pinned her down  the cub saw little of the battle  there was a tremendous snarling and spitting and screeching  the two animals threshed about the lynx ripping and tearing with her claws and using her teeth as well while the shewolf used her teeth alone  once the cub sprang in and sank his teeth into the hind leg of the lynx he clung on growling savagely  though he did not know it by the weight of his body he clogged the action of the leg and thereby saved his mother much damage  a change in the battle crushed him under both their bodies and wrenched loose his hold  the next moment the two mothers separated and before they rushed together again the lynx lashed out at the cub with a huge forepaw that ripped his shoulder open to the bone and sent him hurtling sidewise against the wall  then was added to the uproar the cubs shrill yelp of pain and fright  but the fight lasted so long that he had time to cry himself out and to experience a second burst of courage and the end of the battle found him again clinging to a hindleg and furiously growling between his teeth  the lynx was dead  but the shewolf was very weak and sick  at first she caressed the cub and licked his wounded shoulder but the blood she had lost had taken with it her strength and for all of a day and a night she lay by her dead foes side without movement scarcely breathing  for a week she never left the cave except for water and then her movements were slow and painful  at the end of that time the lynx was devoured while the shewolfs wounds had healed sufficiently to permit her to take the meattrail again  the cubs shoulder was stiff and sore and for some time he limped from the terrible slash he had received  but the world now seemed changed  he went about in it with greater confidence with a feeling of prowess that had not been his in the days before the battle with the lynx  he had looked upon life in a more ferocious aspect he had fought he had buried his teeth in the flesh of a foe and he had survived  and because of all this he carried himself more boldly with a touch of defiance that was new in him  he was no longer afraid of minor things and much of his timidity had vanished though the unknown never ceased to press upon him with its mysteries and terrors intangible and evermenacing  he began to accompany his mother on the meattrail and he saw much of the killing of meat and began to play his part in it  and in his own dim way he learned the law of meat  there were two kinds of lifehis own kind and the other kind  his own kind included his mother and himself the other kind included all live things that moved  but the other kind was divided  one portion was what his own kind killed and ate  this portion was composed of the nonkillers and the small killers  the other portion killed and ate his own kind or was killed and eaten by his own kind  and out of this classification arose the law  the aim of life was meat  life itself was meat  life lived on life  there were the eaters and the eaten  the law was eat or be eaten  he did not formulate the law in clear set terms and moralise about it  he did not even think the law he merely lived the law without thinking about it at all  he saw the law operating around him on every side  he had eaten the ptarmigan chicks  the hawk had eaten the ptarmiganmother  the hawk would also have eaten him  later when he had grown more formidable he wanted to eat the hawk  he had eaten the lynx kitten  the lynxmother would have eaten him had she not herself been killed and eaten  and so it went  the law was being lived about him by all live things and he himself was part and parcel of the law  he was a killer  his only food was meat live meat that ran away swiftly before him or flew into the air or climbed trees or hid in the ground or faced him and fought with him or turned the tables and ran after him  had the cub thought in manfashion he might have epitomised life as a voracious appetite and the world as a place wherein ranged a multitude of appetites pursuing and being pursued hunting and being hunted eating and being eaten all in blindness and confusion with violence and disorder a chaos of gluttony and slaughter ruled over by chance merciless planless endless  but the cub did not think in manfashion  he did not look at things with wide vision  he was singlepurposed and entertained but one thought or desire at a time  besides the law of meat there were a myriad other and lesser laws for him to learn and obey  the world was filled with surprise  the stir of the life that was in him the play of his muscles was an unending happiness  to run down meat was to experience thrills and elations  his rages and battles were pleasures  terror itself and the mystery of the unknown led to his living  and there were easements and satisfactions  to have a full stomach to doze lazily in the sunshinesuch things were remuneration in full for his ardours and toils while his ardours and tolls were in themselves selfremunerative  they were expressions of life and life is always happy when it is expressing itself  so the cub had no quarrel with his hostile environment  he was very much alive very happy and very proud of himself     part iii   chapter ithe makers of fire   the cub came upon it suddenly  it was his own fault  he had been careless  he had left the cave and run down to the stream to drink  it might have been that he took no notice because he was heavy with sleep he had been out all night on the meattrail and had but just then awakened  and his carelessness might have been due to the familiarity of the trail to the pool  he had travelled it often and nothing had ever happened on it  he went down past the blasted pine crossed the open space and trotted in amongst the trees  then at the same instant he saw and smelt before him sitting silently on their haunches were five live things the like of which he had never seen before  it was his first glimpse of mankind  but at the sight of him the five men did not spring to their feet nor show their teeth nor snarl  they did not move but sat there silent and ominous  nor did the cub move  every instinct of his nature would have impelled him to dash wildly away had there not suddenly and for the first time arisen in him another and counter instinct  a great awe descended upon him  he was beaten down to movelessness by an overwhelming sense of his own weakness and littleness  here was mastery and power something far and away beyond him  the cub had never seen man yet the instinct concerning man was his  in dim ways he recognised in man the animal that had fought itself to primacy over the other animals of the wild  not alone out of his own eyes but out of the eyes of all his ancestors was the cub now looking upon manout of eyes that had circled in the darkness around countless winter campfires that had peered from safe distances and from the hearts of thickets at the strange twolegged animal that was lord over living things  the spell of the cubs heritage was upon him the fear and the respect born of the centuries of struggle and the accumulated experience of the generations  the heritage was too compelling for a wolf that was only a cub  had he been fullgrown he would have run away  as it was he cowered down in a paralysis of fear already half proffering the submission that his kind had proffered from the first time a wolf came in to sit by mans fire and be made warm  one of the indians arose and walked over to him and stooped above him the cub cowered closer to the ground  it was the unknown objectified at last in concrete flesh and blood bending over him and reaching down to seize hold of him  his hair bristled involuntarily his lips writhed back and his little fangs were bared  the hand poised like doom above him hesitated and the man spoke laughing wabam wabisca ip pit tah look  the white fangs  the other indians laughed loudly and urged the man on to pick up the cub  as the hand descended closer and closer there raged within the cub a battle of the instincts  he experienced two great impulsionsto yield and to fight  the resulting action was a compromise  he did both  he yielded till the hand almost touched him  then he fought his teeth flashing in a snap that sank them into the hand  the next moment he received a clout alongside the head that knocked him over on his side then all fight fled out of him  his puppyhood and the instinct of submission took charge of him  he sat up on his haunches and kiyid but the man whose hand he had bitten was angry  the cub received a clout on the other side of his head  whereupon he sat up and kiyid louder than ever  the four indians laughed more loudly while even the man who had been bitten began to laugh  they surrounded the cub and laughed at him while he wailed out his terror and his hurt  in the midst of it he heard something  the indians heard it too  but the cub knew what it was and with a last long wail that had in it more of triumph than grief he ceased his noise and waited for the coming of his mother of his ferocious and indomitable mother who fought and killed all things and was never afraid  she was snarling as she ran  she had heard the cry of her cub and was dashing to save him  she bounded in amongst them her anxious and militant motherhood making her anything but a pretty sight  but to the cub the spectacle of her protective rage was pleasing  he uttered a glad little cry and bounded to meet her while the mananimals went back hastily several steps  the shewolf stood over against her cub facing the men with bristling hair a snarl rumbling deep in her throat  her face was distorted and malignant with menace even the bridge of the nose wrinkling from tip to eyes so prodigious was her snarl  then it was that a cry went up from one of the men  kiche was what he uttered  it was an exclamation of surprise  the cub felt his mother wilting at the sound  kiche the man cried again this time with sharpness and authority  and then the cub saw his mother the shewolf the fearless one crouching down till her belly touched the ground whimpering wagging her tail making peace signs  the cub could not understand  he was appalled  the awe of man rushed over him again  his instinct had been true  his mother verified it  she too rendered submission to the man animals  the man who had spoken came over to her  he put his hand upon her head and she only crouched closer  she did not snap nor threaten to snap the other men came up and surrounded her and felt her and pawed her which actions she made no attempt to resent  they were greatly excited and made many noises with their mouths  these noises were not indication of danger the cub decided as he crouched near his mother still bristling from time to time but doing his best to submit  it is not strange an indian was saying  her father was a wolf  it is true her mother was a dog but did not my brother tie her out in the woods all of three nights in the mating season  therefore was the father of kiche a wolf  it is a year grey beaver since she ran away spoke a second indian  it is not strange salmon tongue grey beaver answered  it was the time of the famine and there was no meat for the dogs  she has lived with the wolves said a third indian  so it would seem three eagles grey beaver answered laying his hand on the cub and this be the sign of it  the cub snarled a little at the touch of the hand and the hand flew back to administer a clout  whereupon the cub covered its fangs and sank down submissively while the hand returning rubbed behind his ears and up and down his back  this be the sign of it grey beaver went on  it is plain that his mother is kiche  but his father was a wolf  wherefore is there in him little dog and much wolf  his fangs be white and white fang shall be his name  i have spoken  he is my dog  for was not kiche my brothers dog  and is not my brother dead  the cub who had thus received a name in the world lay and watched  for a time the mananimals continued to make their mouthnoises  then grey beaver took a knife from a sheath that hung around his neck and went into the thicket and cut a stick  white fang watched him  he notched the stick at each end and in the notches fastened strings of rawhide one string he tied around the throat of kiche  then he led her to a small pine around which he tied the other string  white fang followed and lay down beside her  salmon tongues hand reached out to him and rolled him over on his back  kiche looked on anxiously  white fang felt fear mounting in him again  he could not quite suppress a snarl but he made no offer to snap  the hand with fingers crooked and spread apart rubbed his stomach in a playful way and rolled him from side to side  it was ridiculous and ungainly lying there on his back with legs sprawling in the air  besides it was a position of such utter helplessness that white fangs whole nature revolted against it  he could do nothing to defend himself  if this man animal intended harm white fang knew that he could not escape it  how could he spring away with his four legs in the air above him  yet submission made him master his fear and he only growled softly  this growl he could not suppress nor did the mananimal resent it by giving him a blow on the head  and furthermore such was the strangeness of it white fang experienced an unaccountable sensation of pleasure as the hand rubbed back and forth  when he was rolled on his side he ceased to growl when the fingers pressed and prodded at the base of his ears the pleasurable sensation increased and when with a final rub and scratch the man left him alone and went away all fear had died out of white fang  he was to know fear many times in his dealing with man yet it was a token of the fearless companionship with man that was ultimately to be his  after a time white fang heard strange noises approaching  he was quick in his classification for he knew them at once for mananimal noises  a few minutes later the remainder of the tribe strung out as it was on the march trailed in  there were more men and many women and children forty souls of them and all heavily burdened with camp equipage and outfit  also there were many dogs and these with the exception of the partgrown puppies were likewise burdened with camp outfit  on their backs in bags that fastened tightly around underneath the dogs carried from twenty to thirty pounds of weight  white fang had never seen dogs before but at sight of them he felt that they were his own kind only somehow different  but they displayed little difference from the wolf when they discovered the cub and his mother  there was a rush  white fang bristled and snarled and snapped in the face of the openmouthed oncoming wave of dogs and went down and under them feeling the sharp slash of teeth in his body himself biting and tearing at the legs and bellies above him  there was a great uproar he could hear the snarl of kiche as she fought for him and he could hear the cries of the mananimals the sound of clubs striking upon bodies and the yelps of pain from the dogs so struck  only a few seconds elapsed before he was on his feet again  he could now see the mananimals driving back the dogs with clubs and stones defending him saving him from the savage teeth of his kind that somehow was not his kind  and though there was no reason in his brain for a clear conception of so abstract a thing as justice nevertheless in his own way he felt the justice of the mananimals and he knew them for what they weremakers of law and executors of law  also he appreciated the power with which they administered the law  unlike any animals he had ever encountered they did not bite nor claw  they enforced their live strength with the power of dead things  dead things did their bidding  thus sticks and stones directed by these strange creatures leaped through the air like living things inflicting grievous hurts upon the dogs  to his mind this was power unusual power inconceivable and beyond the natural power that was godlike  white fang in the very nature of him could never know anything about gods at the best he could know only things that were beyond knowingbut the wonder and awe that he had of these mananimals in ways resembled what would be the wonder and awe of man at sight of some celestial creature on a mountain top hurling thunderbolts from either hand at an astonished world  the last dog had been driven back  the hubbub died down  and white fang licked his hurts and meditated upon this his first taste of packcruelty and his introduction to the pack  he had never dreamed that his own kind consisted of more than one eye his mother and himself  they had constituted a kind apart and here abruptly he had discovered many more creatures apparently of his own kind  and there was a subconscious resentment that these his kind at first sight had pitched upon him and tried to destroy him  in the same way he resented his mother being tied with a stick even though it was done by the superior mananimals  it savoured of the trap of bondage  yet of the trap and of bondage he knew nothing  freedom to roam and run and lie down at will had been his heritage and here it was being infringed upon  his mothers movements were restricted to the length of a stick and by the length of that same stick was he restricted for he had not yet got beyond the need of his mothers side  he did not like it  nor did he like it when the mananimals arose and went on with their march for a tiny mananimal took the other end of the stick and led kiche captive behind him and behind kiche followed white fang greatly perturbed and worried by this new adventure he had entered upon  they went down the valley of the stream far beyond white fangs widest ranging until they came to the end of the valley where the stream ran into the mackenzie river  here where canoes were cached on poles high in the air and where stood fishracks for the drying of fish camp was made and white fang looked on with wondering eyes  the superiority of these mananimals increased with every moment  there was their mastery over all these sharpfanged dogs  it breathed of power  but greater than that to the wolfcub was their mastery over things not alive their capacity to communicate motion to unmoving things their capacity to change the very face of the world  it was this last that especially affected him  the elevation of frames of poles caught his eye yet this in itself was not so remarkable being done by the same creatures that flung sticks and stones to great distances  but when the frames of poles were made into tepees by being covered with cloth and skins white fang was astounded  it was the colossal bulk of them that impressed him  they arose around him on every side like some monstrous quickgrowing form of life  they occupied nearly the whole circumference of his field of vision  he was afraid of them  they loomed ominously above him and when the breeze stirred them into huge movements he cowered down in fear keeping his eyes warily upon them and prepared to spring away if they attempted to precipitate themselves upon him  but in a short while his fear of the tepees passed away  he saw the women and children passing in and out of them without harm and he saw the dogs trying often to get into them and being driven away with sharp words and flying stones  after a time he left kiches side and crawled cautiously toward the wall of the nearest tepee  it was the curiosity of growth that urged him onthe necessity of learning and living and doing that brings experience  the last few inches to the wall of the tepee were crawled with painful slowness and precaution  the days events had prepared him for the unknown to manifest itself in most stupendous and unthinkable ways  at last his nose touched the canvas  he waited nothing happened  then he smelled the strange fabric saturated with the mansmell  he closed on the canvas with his teeth and gave a gentle tug nothing happened though the adjacent portions of the tepee moved  he tugged harder  there was a greater movement  it was delightful  he tugged still harder and repeatedly until the whole tepee was in motion then the sharp cry of a squaw inside sent him scampering back to kiche but after that he was afraid no more of the looming bulks of the tepees  a moment later he was straying away again from his mother  her stick was tied to a peg in the ground and she could not follow him  a partgrown puppy somewhat larger and older than he came toward him slowly with ostentatious and belligerent importance  the puppys name as white fang was afterward to hear him called was liplip  he had had experience in puppy fights and was already something of a bully  liplip was white fangs own kind and being only a puppy did not seem dangerous so white fang prepared to meet him in a friendly spirit  but when the strangers walk became stifflegged and his lips lifted clear of his teeth white fang stiffened too and answered with lifted lips  they half circled about each other tentatively snarling and bristling  this lasted several minutes and white fang was beginning to enjoy it as a sort of game  but suddenly with remarkable swiftness liplip leaped in delivering a slashing snap and leaped away again  the snap had taken effect on the shoulder that had been hurt by the lynx and that was still sore deep down near the bone  the surprise and hurt of it brought a yelp out of white fang but the next moment in a rush of anger he was upon liplip and snapping viciously  but liplip had lived his life in camp and had fought many puppy fights three times four times and half a dozen times his sharp little teeth scored on the newcomer until white fang yelping shamelessly fled to the protection of his mother  it was the first of the many fights he was to have with liplip for they were enemies from the start born so with natures destined perpetually to clash  kiche licked white fang soothingly with her tongue and tried to prevail upon him to remain with her  but his curiosity was rampant and several minutes later he was venturing forth on a new quest  he came upon one of the mananimals grey beaver who was squatting on his hams and doing something with sticks and dry moss spread before him on the ground  white fang came near to him and watched  grey beaver made mouthnoises which white fang interpreted as not hostile so he came still nearer  women and children were carrying more sticks and branches to grey beaver it was evidently an affair of moment  white fang came in until he touched grey beavers knee so curious was he and already forgetful that this was a terrible mananimal  suddenly he saw a strange thing like mist beginning to arise from the sticks and moss beneath grey beavers hands  then amongst the sticks themselves appeared a live thing twisting and turning of a colour like the colour of the sun in the sky white fang knew nothing about fire  it drew him as the light in the mouth of the cave had drawn him in his early puppyhood  he crawled the several steps toward the flame  he heard grey beaver chuckle above him and he knew the sound was not hostile  then his nose touched the flame and at the same instant his little tongue went out to it  for a moment he was paralysed  the unknown lurking in the midst of the sticks and moss was savagely clutching him by the nose  he scrambled backward bursting out in an astonished explosion of kiyis  at the sound kiche leaped snarling to the end of her stick and there raged terribly because she could not come to his aid  but grey beaver laughed loudly and slapped his thighs and told the happening to all the rest of the camp till everybody was laughing uproariously  but white fang sat on his haunches and kiyid and kiyid a forlorn and pitiable little figure in the midst of the mananimals  it was the worst hurt he had ever known  both nose and tongue had been scorched by the live thing suncoloured that had grown up under grey beavers hands  he cried and cried interminably and every fresh wail was greeted by bursts of laughter on the part of the mananimals  he tried to soothe his nose with his tongue but the tongue was burnt too and the two hurts coming together produced greater hurt whereupon he cried more hopelessly and helplessly than ever  and then shame came to him  he knew laughter and the meaning of it  it is not given us to know how some animals know laughter and know when they are being laughed at but it was this same way that white fang knew it  and he felt shame that the mananimals should be laughing at him  he turned and fled away not from the hurt of the fire but from the laughter that sank even deeper and hurt in the spirit of him  and he fled to kiche raging at the end of her stick like an animal gone madto kiche the one creature in the world who was not laughing at him  twilight drew down and night came on and white fang lay by his mothers side  his nose and tongue still hurt but he was perplexed by a greater trouble  he was homesick  he felt a vacancy in him a need for the hush and quietude of the stream and the cave in the cliff  life had become too populous  there were so many of the mananimals men women and children all making noises and irritations  and there were the dogs ever squabbling and bickering bursting into uproars and creating confusions  the restful loneliness of the only life he had known was gone  here the very air was palpitant with life  it hummed and buzzed unceasingly  continually changing its intensity and abruptly variant in pitch it impinged on his nerves and senses made him nervous and restless and worried him with a perpetual imminence of happening  he watched the mananimals coming and going and moving about the camp  in fashion distantly resembling the way men look upon the gods they create so looked white fang upon the mananimals before him  they were superior creatures of a verity gods  to his dim comprehension they were as much wonderworkers as gods are to men  they were creatures of mastery possessing all manner of unknown and impossible potencies overlords of the alive and the not alivemaking obey that which moved imparting movement to that which did not move and making life suncoloured and biting life to grow out of dead moss and wood  they were firemakers they were gods    chapter iithe bondage   the days were thronged with experience for white fang  during the time that kiche was tied by the stick he ran about over all the camp inquiring investigating learning  he quickly came to know much of the ways of the mananimals but familiarity did not breed contempt  the more he came to know them the more they vindicated their superiority the more they displayed their mysterious powers the greater loomed their godlikeness  to man has been given the grief often of seeing his gods overthrown and his altars crumbling but to the wolf and the wild dog that have come in to crouch at mans feet this grief has never come  unlike man whose gods are of the unseen and the overguessed vapours and mists of fancy eluding the garmenture of reality wandering wraiths of desired goodness and power intangible outcroppings of self into the realm of spiritunlike man the wolf and the wild dog that have come in to the fire find their gods in the living flesh solid to the touch occupying earthspace and requiring time for the accomplishment of their ends and their existence  no effort of faith is necessary to believe in such a god no effort of will can possibly induce disbelief in such a god  there is no getting away from it  there it stands on its two hindlegs club in hand immensely potential passionate and wrathful and loving god and mystery and power all wrapped up and around by flesh that bleeds when it is torn and that is good to eat like any flesh  and so it was with white fang  the mananimals were gods unmistakable and unescapable  as his mother kiche had rendered her allegiance to them at the first cry of her name so he was beginning to render his allegiance  he gave them the trail as a privilege indubitably theirs when they walked he got out of their way  when they called he came when they threatened he cowered down  when they commanded him to go he went away hurriedly  for behind any wish of theirs was power to enforce that wish power that hurt power that expressed itself in clouts and clubs in flying stones and stinging lashes of whips  he belonged to them as all dogs belonged to them  his actions were theirs to command  his body was theirs to maul to stamp upon to tolerate  such was the lesson that was quickly borne in upon him  it came hard going as it did counter to much that was strong and dominant in his own nature and while he disliked it in the learning of it unknown to himself he was learning to like it  it was a placing of his destiny in anothers hands a shifting of the responsibilities of existence  this in itself was compensation for it is always easier to lean upon another than to stand alone  but it did not all happen in a day this giving over of himself body and soul to the mananimals  he could not immediately forego his wild heritage and his memories of the wild  there were days when he crept to the edge of the forest and stood and listened to something calling him far and away  and always he returned restless and uncomfortable to whimper softly and wistfully at kiches side and to lick her face with eager questioning tongue  white fang learned rapidly the ways of the camp  he knew the injustice and greediness of the older dogs when meat or fish was thrown out to be eaten  he came to know that men were more just children more cruel and women more kindly and more likely to toss him a bit of meat or bone  and after two or three painful adventures with the mothers of partgrown puppies he came into the knowledge that it was always good policy to let such mothers alone to keep away from them as far as possible and to avoid them when he saw them coming  but the bane of his life was liplip  larger older and stronger lip lip had selected white fang for his special object of persecution  while fang fought willingly enough but he was outclassed  his enemy was too big  liplip became a nightmare to him  whenever he ventured away from his mother the bully was sure to appear trailing at his heels snarling at him picking upon him and watchful of an opportunity when no man animal was near to spring upon him and force a fight  as liplip invariably won he enjoyed it hugely  it became his chief delight in life as it became white fangs chief torment  but the effect upon white fang was not to cow him  though he suffered most of the damage and was always defeated his spirit remained unsubdued  yet a bad effect was produced  he became malignant and morose  his temper had been savage by birth but it became more savage under this unending persecution  the genial playful puppyish side of him found little expression  he never played and gambolled about with the other puppies of the camp  liplip would not permit it  the moment white fang appeared near them liplip was upon him bullying and hectoring him or fighting with him until he had driven him away  the effect of all this was to rob white fang of much of his puppyhood and to make him in his comportment older than his age  denied the outlet through play of his energies he recoiled upon himself and developed his mental processes  he became cunning he had idle time in which to devote himself to thoughts of trickery  prevented from obtaining his share of meat and fish when a general feed was given to the campdogs he became a clever thief  he had to forage for himself and he foraged well though he was ofttimes a plague to the squaws in consequence  he learned to sneak about camp to be crafty to know what was going on everywhere to see and to hear everything and to reason accordingly and successfully to devise ways and means of avoiding his implacable persecutor  it was early in the days of his persecution that he played his first really big crafty game and got there from his first taste of revenge  as kiche when with the wolves had lured out to destruction dogs from the camps of men so white fang in manner somewhat similar lured liplip into kiches avenging jaws  retreating before liplip white fang made an indirect flight that led in and out and around the various tepees of the camp  he was a good runner swifter than any puppy of his size and swifter than liplip  but he did not run his best in this chase  he barely held his own one leap ahead of his pursuer  liplip excited by the chase and by the persistent nearness of his victim forgot caution and locality  when he remembered locality it was too late  dashing at top speed around a tepee he ran full tilt into kiche lying at the end of her stick  he gave one yelp of consternation and then her punishing jaws closed upon him  she was tied but he could not get away from her easily  she rolled him off his legs so that he could not run while she repeatedly ripped and slashed him with her fangs  when at last he succeeded in rolling clear of her he crawled to his feet badly dishevelled hurt both in body and in spirit  his hair was standing out all over him in tufts where her teeth had mauled  he stood where he had arisen opened his mouth and broke out the long heartbroken puppy wail  but even this he was not allowed to complete in the middle of it white fang rushing in sank his teeth into liplips hind leg  there was no fight left in liplip and he ran away shamelessly his victim hot on his heels and worrying him all the way back to his own tepee  here the squaws came to his aid and white fang transformed into a raging demon was finally driven off only by a fusillade of stones  came the day when grey beaver deciding that the liability of her running away was past released kiche  white fang was delighted with his mothers freedom  he accompanied her joyfully about the camp and so long as he remained close by her side liplip kept a respectful distance  whitefang even bristled up to him and walked stifflegged but liplip ignored the challenge  he was no fool himself and whatever vengeance he desired to wreak he could wait until he caught white fang alone  later on that day kiche and white fang strayed into the edge of the woods next to the camp  he had led his mother there step by step and now when she stopped he tried to inveigle her farther  the stream the lair and the quiet woods were calling to him and he wanted her to come he ran on a few steps stopped and looked back  she had not moved  he whined pleadingly and scurried playfully in and out of the underbrush he ran back to her licked her face and ran on again  and still she did not move  he stopped and regarded her all of an intentness and eagerness physically expressed that slowly faded out of him as she turned her head and gazed back at the camp  there was something calling to him out there in the open  his mother heard it too  but she heard also that other and louder call the call of the fire and of manthe call which has been given alone of all animals to the wolf to answer to the wolf and the wilddog who are brothers  kiche turned and slowly trotted back toward camp  stronger than the physical restraint of the stick was the clutch of the camp upon her unseen and occultly the gods still gripped with their power and would not let her go  white fang sat down in the shadow of a birch and whimpered softly  there was a strong smell of pine and subtle wood fragrances filled the air reminding him of his old life of freedom before the days of his bondage  but he was still only a partgrown puppy and stronger than the call either of man or of the wild was the call of his mother  all the hours of his short life he had depended upon her  the time was yet to come for independence  so he arose and trotted forlornly back to camp pausing once and twice to sit down and whimper and to listen to the call that still sounded in the depths of the forest  in the wild the time of a mother with her young is short but under the dominion of man it is sometimes even shorter  thus it was with white fang  grey beaver was in the debt of three eagles  three eagles was going away on a trip up the mackenzie to the great slave lake  a strip of scarlet cloth a bearskin twenty cartridges and kiche went to pay the debt  white fang saw his mother taken aboard three eagles canoe and tried to follow her  a blow from three eagles knocked him backward to the land  the canoe shoved off  he sprang into the water and swam after it deaf to the sharp cries of grey beaver to return  even a man animal a god white fang ignored such was the terror he was in of losing his mother  but gods are accustomed to being obeyed and grey beaver wrathfully launched a canoe in pursuit  when he overtook white fang he reached down and by the nape of the neck lifted him clear of the water  he did not deposit him at once in the bottom of the canoe  holding him suspended with one hand with the other hand he proceeded to give him a beating  and it was a beating  his hand was heavy  every blow was shrewd to hurt and he delivered a multitude of blows  impelled by the blows that rained upon him now from this side now from that white fang swung back and forth like an erratic and jerky pendulum varying were the emotions that surged through him  at first he had known surprise  then came a momentary fear when he yelped several times to the impact of the hand  but this was quickly followed by anger  his free nature asserted itself and he showed his teeth and snarled fearlessly in the face of the wrathful god  this but served to make the god more wrathful  the blows came faster heavier more shrewd to hurt  grey beaver continued to beat white fang continued to snarl  but this could not last for ever  one or the other must give over and that one was white fang  fear surged through him again  for the first time he was being really manhandled  the occasional blows of sticks and stones he had previously experienced were as caresses compared with this  he broke down and began to cry and yelp  for a time each blow brought a yelp from him but fear passed into terror until finally his yelps were voiced in unbroken succession unconnected with the rhythm of the punishment  at last grey beaver withheld his hand  white fang hanging limply continued to cry  this seemed to satisfy his master who flung him down roughly in the bottom of the canoe  in the meantime the canoe had drifted down the stream  grey beaver picked up the paddle  white fang was in his way  he spurned him savagely with his foot  in that moment white fangs free nature flashed forth again and he sank his teeth into the moccasined foot  the beating that had gone before was as nothing compared with the beating he now received  grey beavers wrath was terrible likewise was white fangs fright  not only the hand but the hard wooden paddle was used upon him and he was bruised and sore in all his small body when he was again flung down in the canoe  again and this time with purpose did grey beaver kick him  white fang did not repeat his attack on the foot he had learned another lesson of his bondage  never no matter what the circumstance must he dare to bite the god who was lord and master over him the body of the lord and master was sacred not to be defiled by the teeth of such as he  that was evidently the crime of crimes the one offence there was no condoning nor overlooking  when the canoe touched the shore white fang lay whimpering and motionless waiting the will of grey beaver  it was grey beavers will that he should go ashore for ashore he was flung striking heavily on his side and hurting his bruises afresh  he crawled tremblingly to his feet and stood whimpering  liplip who had watched the whole proceeding from the bank now rushed upon him knocking him over and sinking his teeth into him  white fang was too helpless to defend himself and it would have gone hard with him had not grey beavers foot shot out lifting liplip into the air with its violence so that he smashed down to earth a dozen feet away  this was the mananimals justice and even then in his own pitiable plight white fang experienced a little grateful thrill  at grey beavers heels he limped obediently through the village to the tepee  and so it came that white fang learned that the right to punish was something the gods reserved for themselves and denied to the lesser creatures under them  that night when all was still white fang remembered his mother and sorrowed for her  he sorrowed too loudly and woke up grey beaver who beat him  after that he mourned gently when the gods were around  but sometimes straying off to the edge of the woods by himself he gave vent to his grief and cried it out with loud whimperings and wailings  it was during this period that he might have harkened to the memories of the lair and the stream and run back to the wild  but the memory of his mother held him  as the hunting mananimals went out and came back so she would come back to the village some time  so he remained in his bondage waiting for her  but it was not altogether an unhappy bondage  there was much to interest him  something was always happening  there was no end to the strange things these gods did and he was always curious to see  besides he was learning how to get along with grey beaver  obedience rigid undeviating obedience was what was exacted of him and in return he escaped beatings and his existence was tolerated  nay grey beaver himself sometimes tossed him a piece of meat and defended him against the other dogs in the eating of it  and such a piece of meat was of value  it was worth more in some strange way then a dozen pieces of meat from the hand of a squaw  grey beaver never petted nor caressed  perhaps it was the weight of his hand perhaps his justice perhaps the sheer power of him and perhaps it was all these things that influenced white fang for a certain tie of attachment was forming between him and his surly lord  insidiously and by remote ways as well as by the power of stick and stone and clout of hand were the shackles of white fangs bondage being riveted upon him  the qualities in his kind that in the beginning made it possible for them to come in to the fires of men were qualities capable of development  they were developing in him and the camplife replete with misery as it was was secretly endearing itself to him all the time  but white fang was unaware of it  he knew only grief for the loss of kiche hope for her return and a hungry yearning for the free life that had been his    chapter iiithe outcast   liplip continued so to darken his days that white fang became wickeder and more ferocious than it was his natural right to be  savageness was a part of his makeup but the savageness thus developed exceeded his make up  he acquired a reputation for wickedness amongst the mananimals themselves  wherever there was trouble and uproar in camp fighting and squabbling or the outcry of a squaw over a bit of stolen meat they were sure to find white fang mixed up in it and usually at the bottom of it they did not bother to look after the causes of his conduct  they saw only the effects and the effects were bad  he was a sneak and a thief a mischiefmaker a fomenter of trouble and irate squaws told him to his face the while he eyed them alert and ready to dodge any quickflung missile that he was a wolf and worthless and bound to come to an evil end  he found himself an outcast in the midst of the populous camp  all the young dogs followed liplips lead  there was a difference between white fang and them  perhaps they sensed his wildwood breed and instinctively felt for him the enmity that the domestic dog feels for the wolf  but be that as it may they joined with liplip in the persecution  and once declared against him they found good reason to continue declared against him  one and all from time to time they felt his teeth and to his credit he gave more than he received  many of them he could whip in single fight but single fight was denied him  the beginning of such a fight was a signal for all the young dogs in camp to come running and pitch upon him  out of this packpersecution he learned two important things how to take care of himself in a massfight against himand how on a single dog to inflict the greatest amount of damage in the briefest space of time  to keep ones feet in the midst of the hostile mass meant life and this he learnt well  he became catlike in his ability to stay on his feet  even grown dogs might hurtle him backward or sideways with the impact of their heavy bodies and backward or sideways he would go in the air or sliding on the ground but always with his legs under him and his feet downward to the mother earth  when dogs fight there are usually preliminaries to the actual combatsnarlings and bristlings and stifflegged struttings  but white fang learned to omit these preliminaries  delay meant the coming against him of all the young dogs  he must do his work quickly and get away  so he learnt to give no warning of his intention  he rushed in and snapped and slashed on the instant without notice before his foe could prepare to meet him  thus he learned how to inflict quick and severe damage also he learned the value of surprise  a dog taken off its guard its shoulder slashed open or its ear ripped in ribbons before it knew what was happening was a dog half whipped  furthermore it was remarkably easy to overthrow a dog taken by surprise while a dog thus overthrown invariably exposed for a moment the soft underside of its neckthe vulnerable point at which to strike for its life  white fang knew this point  it was a knowledge bequeathed to him directly from the hunting generation of wolves  so it was that white fangs method when he took the offensive was first to find a young dog alone second to surprise it and knock it off its feet and third to drive in with his teeth at the soft throat  being but partly grown his jaws had not yet become large enough nor strong enough to make his throatattack deadly but many a young dog went around camp with a lacerated throat in token of white fangs intention and one day catching one of his enemies alone on the edge of the woods he managed by repeatedly overthrowing him and attacking the throat to cut the great vein and let out the life  there was a great row that night  he had been observed the news had been carried to the dead dogs master the squaws remembered all the instances of stolen meat and grey beaver was beset by many angry voices  but he resolutely held the door of his tepee inside which he had placed the culprit and refused to permit the vengeance for which his tribespeople clamoured  white fang became hated by man and dog  during this period of his development he never knew a moments security  the tooth of every dog was against him the hand of every man  he was greeted with snarls by his kind with curses and stones by his gods  he lived tensely  he was always keyed up alert for attack wary of being attacked with an eye for sudden and unexpected missiles prepared to act precipitately and coolly to leap in with a flash of teeth or to leap away with a menacing snarl  as for snarling he could snarl more terribly than any dog young or old in camp  the intent of the snarl is to warn or frighten and judgment is required to know when it should be used  white fang knew how to make it and when to make it  into his snarl he incorporated all that was vicious malignant and horrible  with nose serrulated by continuous spasms hair bristling in recurrent waves tongue whipping out like a red snake and whipping back again ears flattened down eyes gleaming hatred lips wrinkled back and fangs exposed and dripping he could compel a pause on the part of almost any assailant  a temporary pause when taken off his guard gave him the vital moment in which to think and determine his action  but often a pause so gained lengthened out until it evolved into a complete cessation from the attack  and before more than one of the grown dogs white fangs snarl enabled him to beat an honourable retreat  an outcast himself from the pack of the partgrown dogs his sanguinary methods and remarkable efficiency made the pack pay for its persecution of him  not permitted himself to run with the pack the curious state of affairs obtained that no member of the pack could run outside the pack white fang would not permit it  what of his bushwhacking and waylaying tactics the young dogs were afraid to run by themselves  with the exception of liplip they were compelled to hunch together for mutual protection against the terrible enemy they had made  a puppy alone by the river bank meant a puppy dead or a puppy that aroused the camp with its shrill pain and terror as it fled back from the wolfcub that had waylaid it  but white fangs reprisals did not cease even when the young dogs had learned thoroughly that they must stay together  he attacked them when he caught them alone and they attacked him when they were bunched  the sight of him was sufficient to start them rushing after him at which times his swiftness usually carried him into safety  but woe the dog that outran his fellows in such pursuit  white fang had learned to turn suddenly upon the pursuer that was ahead of the pack and thoroughly to rip him up before the pack could arrive  this occurred with great frequency for once in full cry the dogs were prone to forget themselves in the excitement of the chase while white fang never forgot himself  stealing backward glances as he ran he was always ready to whirl around and down the overzealous pursuer that outran his fellows  young dogs are bound to play and out of the exigencies of the situation they realised their play in this mimic warfare  thus it was that the hunt of white fang became their chief gamea deadly game withal and at all times a serious game  he on the other hand being the fastestfooted was unafraid to venture anywhere  during the period that he waited vainly for his mother to come back he led the pack many a wild chase through the adjacent woods  but the pack invariably lost him  its noise and outcry warned him of its presence while he ran alone velvet footed silently a moving shadow among the trees after the manner of his father and mother before him  further he was more directly connected with the wild than they and he knew more of its secrets and stratagems a favourite trick of his was to lose his trail in running water and then lie quietly in a nearby thicket while their baffled cries arose around him  hated by his kind and by mankind indomitable perpetually warred upon and himself waging perpetual war his development was rapid and onesided  this was no soil for kindliness and affection to blossom in of such things he had not the faintest glimmering  the code he learned was to obey the strong and to oppress the weak  grey beaver was a god and strong  therefore white fang obeyed him  but the dog younger or smaller than himself was weak a thing to be destroyed  his development was in the direction of power  in order to face the constant danger of hurt and even of destruction his predatory and protective faculties were unduly developed  he became quicker of movement than the other dogs swifter of foot craftier deadlier more lithe more lean with ironlike muscle and sinew more enduring more cruel more ferocious and more intelligent  he had to become all these things else he would not have held his own nor survive the hostile environment in which he found himself    chapter ivthe trail of the gods   in the fall of the year when the days were shortening and the bite of the frost was coming into the air white fang got his chance for liberty for several days there had been a great hubbub in the village  the summer camp was being dismantled and the tribe bag and baggage was preparing to go off to the fall hunting  white fang watched it all with eager eyes and when the tepees began to come down and the canoes were loading at the bank he understood  already the canoes were departing and some had disappeared down the river  quite deliberately he determined to stay behind  he waited his opportunity to slink out of camp to the woods  here in the running stream where ice was beginning to form he hid his trail  then he crawled into the heart of a dense thicket and waited  the time passed by and he slept intermittently for hours  then he was aroused by grey beavers voice calling him by name  there were other voices  white fang could hear grey beavers squaw taking part in the search and mitsah who was grey beavers son  white fang trembled with fear and though the impulse came to crawl out of his hidingplace he resisted it  after a time the voices died away and some time after that he crept out to enjoy the success of his undertaking  darkness was coming on and for a while he played about among the trees pleasuring in his freedom  then and quite suddenly he became aware of loneliness  he sat down to consider listening to the silence of the forest and perturbed by it  that nothing moved nor sounded seemed ominous  he felt the lurking of danger unseen and unguessed  he was suspicious of the looming bulks of the trees and of the dark shadows that might conceal all manner of perilous things  then it was cold  here was no warm side of a tepee against which to snuggle  the frost was in his feet and he kept lifting first one fore foot and then the other  he curved his bushy tail around to cover them and at the same time he saw a vision  there was nothing strange about it  upon his inward sight was impressed a succession of memorypictures he saw the camp again the tepees and the blaze of the fires  he heard the shrill voices of the women the gruff basses of the men and the snarling of the dogs  he was hungry and he remembered pieces of meat and fish that had been thrown him  here was no meat nothing but a threatening and inedible silence  his bondage had softened him  irresponsibility had weakened him  he had forgotten how to shift for himself  the night yawned about him  his senses accustomed to the hum and bustle of the camp used to the continuous impact of sights and sounds were now left idle  there was nothing to do nothing to see nor hear  they strained to catch some interruption of the silence and immobility of nature  they were appalled by inaction and by the feel of something terrible impending  he gave a great start of fright  a colossal and formless something was rushing across the field of his vision  it was a treeshadow flung by the moon from whose face the clouds had been brushed away  reassured he whimpered softly then he suppressed the whimper for fear that it might attract the attention of the lurking dangers  a tree contracting in the cool of the night made a loud noise  it was directly above him  he yelped in his fright  a panic seized him and he ran madly toward the village  he knew an overpowering desire for the protection and companionship of man  in his nostrils was the smell of the campsmoke  in his ears the campsounds and cries were ringing loud he passed out of the forest and into the moonlit open where were no shadows nor darknesses  but no village greeted his eyes  he had forgotten  the village had gone away  his wild flight ceased abruptly  there was no place to which to flee  he slunk forlornly through the deserted camp smelling the rubbishheaps and the discarded rags and tags of the gods  he would have been glad for the rattle of stones about him flung by an angry squaw glad for the hand of grey beaver descending upon him in wrath while he would have welcomed with delight liplip and the whole snarling cowardly pack  he came to where grey beavers tepee had stood  in the centre of the space it had occupied he sat down  he pointed his nose at the moon  his throat was afflicted by rigid spasms his mouth opened and in a heart broken cry bubbled up his loneliness and fear his grief for kiche all his past sorrows and miseries as well as his apprehension of sufferings and dangers to come  it was the long wolfhowl fullthroated and mournful the first howl he had ever uttered  the coming of daylight dispelled his fears but increased his loneliness the naked earth which so shortly before had been so populous thrust his loneliness more forcibly upon him  it did not take him long to make up his mind  he plunged into the forest and followed the river bank down the stream  all day he ran  he did not rest  he seemed made to run on for ever  his ironlike body ignored fatigue  and even after fatigue came his heritage of endurance braced him to endless endeavour and enabled him to drive his complaining body onward  where the river swung in against precipitous bluffs he climbed the high mountains behind  rivers and streams that entered the main river he forded or swam  often he took to the rimice that was beginning to form and more than once he crashed through and struggled for life in the icy current  always he was on the lookout for the trail of the gods where it might leave the river and proceed inland  white fang was intelligent beyond the average of his kind yet his mental vision was not wide enough to embrace the other bank of the mackenzie what if the trail of the gods led out on that side  it never entered his head  later on when he had travelled more and grown older and wiser and come to know more of trails and rivers it might be that he could grasp and apprehend such a possibility  but that mental power was yet in the future  just now he ran blindly his own bank of the mackenzie alone entering into his calculations  all night he ran blundering in the darkness into mishaps and obstacles that delayed but did not daunt  by the middle of the second day he had been running continuously for thirty hours and the iron of his flesh was giving out  it was the endurance of his mind that kept him going  he had not eaten in forty hours and he was weak with hunger  the repeated drenchings in the icy water had likewise had their effect on him  his handsome coat was draggled  the broad pads of his feet were bruised and bleeding  he had begun to limp and this limp increased with the hours to make it worse the light of the sky was obscured and snow began to falla raw moist melting clinging snow slippery under foot that hid from him the landscape he traversed and that covered over the inequalities of the ground so that the way of his feet was more difficult and painful  grey beaver had intended camping that night on the far bank of the mackenzie for it was in that direction that the hunting lay  but on the near bank shortly before dark a moose coming down to drink had been espied by klookooch who was grey beavers squaw  now had not the moose come down to drink had not mitsah been steering out of the course because of the snow had not klookooch sighted the moose and had not grey beaver killed it with a lucky shot from his rifle all subsequent things would have happened differently  grey beaver would not have camped on the near side of the mackenzie and white fang would have passed by and gone on either to die or to find his way to his wild brothers and become one of thema wolf to the end of his days  night had fallen  the snow was flying more thickly and white fang whimpering softly to himself as he stumbled and limped along came upon a fresh trail in the snow  so fresh was it that he knew it immediately for what it was  whining with eagerness he followed back from the river bank and in among the trees  the campsounds came to his ears  he saw the blaze of the fire klookooch cooking and grey beaver squatting on his hams and mumbling a chunk of raw tallow  there was fresh meat in camp  white fang expected a beating  he crouched and bristled a little at the thought of it  then he went forward again  he feared and disliked the beating he knew to be waiting for him  but he knew further that the comfort of the fire would be his the protection of the gods the companionship of the dogsthe last a companionship of enmity but none the less a companionship and satisfying to his gregarious needs  he came cringing and crawling into the firelight  grey beaver saw him and stopped munching the tallow  white fang crawled slowly cringing and grovelling in the abjectness of his abasement and submission  he crawled straight toward grey beaver every inch of his progress becoming slower and more painful  at last he lay at the masters feet into whose possession he now surrendered himself voluntarily body and soul  of his own choice he came in to sit by mans fire and to be ruled by him white fang trembled waiting for the punishment to fall upon him  there was a movement of the hand above him  he cringed involuntarily under the expected blow  it did not fall  he stole a glance upward  grey beaver was breaking the lump of tallow in half  grey beaver was offering him one piece of the tallow  very gently and somewhat suspiciously he first smelled the tallow and then proceeded to eat it  grey beaver ordered meat to be brought to him and guarded him from the other dogs while he ate  after that grateful and content white fang lay at grey beavers feet gazing at the fire that warmed him blinking and dozing secure in the knowledge that the morrow would find him not wandering forlorn through bleak foreststretches but in the camp of the mananimals with the gods to whom he had given himself and upon whom he was now dependent    chapter vthe covenant   when december was well along grey beaver went on a journey up the mackenzie  mitsah and klookooch went with him  one sled he drove himself drawn by dogs he had traded for or borrowed  a second and smaller sled was driven by mitsah and to this was harnessed a team of puppies  it was more of a toy affair than anything else yet it was the delight of mitsah who felt that he was beginning to do a mans work in the world  also he was learning to drive dogs and to train dogs while the puppies themselves were being broken in to the harness  furthermore the sled was of some service for it carried nearly two hundred pounds of outfit and food  white fang had seen the campdogs toiling in the harness so that he did not resent overmuch the first placing of the harness upon himself  about his neck was put a mossstuffed collar which was connected by two pullingtraces to a strap that passed around his chest and over his back it was to this that was fastened the long rope by which he pulled at the sled  there were seven puppies in the team  the others had been born earlier in the year and were nine and ten months old while white fang was only eight months old  each dog was fastened to the sled by a single rope  no two ropes were of the same length while the difference in length between any two ropes was at least that of a dogs body  every rope was brought to a ring at the front end of the sled  the sled itself was without runners being a birchbark toboggan with upturned forward end to keep it from ploughing under the snow  this construction enabled the weight of the sled and load to be distributed over the largest snowsurface for the snow was crystalpowder and very soft  observing the same principle of widest distribution of weight the dogs at the ends of their ropes radiated fanfashion from the nose of the sled so that no dog trod in anothers footsteps  there was furthermore another virtue in the fanformation  the ropes of varying length prevented the dogs attacking from the rear those that ran in front of them  for a dog to attack another it would have to turn upon one at a shorter rope  in which case it would find itself face to face with the dog attacked and also it would find itself facing the whip of the driver  but the most peculiar virtue of all lay in the fact that the dog that strove to attack one in front of him must pull the sled faster and that the faster the sled travelled the faster could the dog attacked run away  thus the dog behind could never catch up with the one in front  the faster he ran the faster ran the one he was after and the faster ran all the dogs  incidentally the sled went faster and thus by cunning indirection did man increase his mastery over the beasts  mitsah resembled his father much of whose grey wisdom he possessed  in the past he had observed liplips persecution of white fang but at that time liplip was another mans dog and mitsah had never dared more than to shy an occasional stone at him  but now liplip was his dog and he proceeded to wreak his vengeance on him by putting him at the end of the longest rope  this made liplip the leader and was apparently an honour but in reality it took away from him all honour and instead of being bully and master of the pack he now found himself hated and persecuted by the pack  because he ran at the end of the longest rope the dogs had always the view of him running away before them  all that they saw of him was his bushy tail and fleeing hind legsa view far less ferocious and intimidating than his bristling mane and gleaming fangs  also dogs being so constituted in their mental ways the sight of him running away gave desire to run after him and a feeling that he ran away from them  the moment the sled started the team took after liplip in a chase that extended throughout the day  at first he had been prone to turn upon his pursuers jealous of his dignity and wrathful but at such times mitsah would throw the stinging lash of the thirtyfoot cariboogut whip into his face and compel him to turn tail and run on  liplip might face the pack but he could not face that whip and all that was left him to do was to keep his long rope taut and his flanks ahead of the teeth of his mates  but a still greater cunning lurked in the recesses of the indian mind  to give point to unending pursuit of the leader mitsah favoured him over the other dogs  these favours aroused in them jealousy and hatred  in their presence mitsah would give him meat and would give it to him only this was maddening to them  they would rage around just outside the throwingdistance of the whip while liplip devoured the meat and mit sah protected him  and when there was no meat to give mitsah would keep the team at a distance and make believe to give meat to liplip  white fang took kindly to the work  he had travelled a greater distance than the other dogs in the yielding of himself to the rule of the gods and he had learned more thoroughly the futility of opposing their will in addition the persecution he had suffered from the pack had made the pack less to him in the scheme of things and man more  he had not learned to be dependent on his kind for companionship  besides kiche was wellnigh forgotten and the chief outlet of expression that remained to him was in the allegiance he tendered the gods he had accepted as masters  so he worked hard learned discipline and was obedient faithfulness and willingness characterised his toil  these are essential traits of the wolf and the wilddog when they have become domesticated and these traits white fang possessed in unusual measure  a companionship did exist between white fang and the other dogs but it was one of warfare and enmity  he had never learned to play with them he knew only how to fight and fight with them he did returning to them a hundredfold the snaps and slashes they had given him in the days when liplip was leader of the pack  but liplip was no longer leaderexcept when he fled away before his mates at the end of his rope the sled bounding along behind  in camp he kept close to mitsah or grey beaver or klookooch  he did not dare venture away from the gods for now the fangs of all dogs were against him and he tasted to the dregs the persecution that had been white fangs  with the overthrow of liplip white fang could have become leader of the pack  but he was too morose and solitary for that  he merely thrashed his teammates  otherwise he ignored them  they got out of his way when he came along nor did the boldest of them ever dare to rob him of his meat  on the contrary they devoured their own meat hurriedly for fear that he would take it away from them  white fang knew the law well to oppress the weak and obey the strong  he ate his share of meat as rapidly as he could  and then woe the dog that had not yet finished  a snarl and a flash of fangs and that dog would wail his indignation to the uncomforting stars while white fang finished his portion for him  every little while however one dog or another would flame up in revolt and be promptly subdued  thus white fang was kept in training  he was jealous of the isolation in which he kept himself in the midst of the pack and he fought often to maintain it  but such fights were of brief duration  he was too quick for the others  they were slashed open and bleeding before they knew what had happened were whipped almost before they had begun to fight  as rigid as the sleddiscipline of the gods was the discipline maintained by white fang amongst his fellows  he never allowed them any latitude  he compelled them to an unremitting respect for him  they might do as they pleased amongst themselves  that was no concern of his but it was his concern that they leave him alone in his isolation get out of his way when he elected to walk among them and at all times acknowledge his mastery over them  a hint of stiffleggedness on their part a lifted lip or a bristle of hair and he would be upon them merciless and cruel swiftly convincing them of the error of their way  he was a monstrous tyrant  his mastery was rigid as steel  he oppressed the weak with a vengeance  not for nothing had he been exposed to the pitiless struggles for life in the day of his cubhood when his mother and he alone and unaided held their own and survived in the ferocious environment of the wild  and not for nothing had he learned to walk softly when superior strength went by  he oppressed the weak but he respected the strong  and in the course of the long journey with grey beaver he walked softly indeed amongst the fullgrown dogs in the camps of the strange mananimals they encountered  the months passed by  still continued the journey of grey beaver  white fangs strength was developed by the long hours on trail and the steady toil at the sled and it would have seemed that his mental development was wellnigh complete  he had come to know quite thoroughly the world in which he lived  his outlook was bleak and materialistic  the world as he saw it was a fierce and brutal world a world without warmth a world in which caresses and affection and the bright sweetnesses of the spirit did not exist  he had no affection for grey beaver  true he was a god but a most savage god  white fang was glad to acknowledge his lordship but it was a lordship based upon superior intelligence and brute strength  there was something in the fibre of white fangs being that made his lordship a thing to be desired else he would not have come back from the wild when he did to tender his allegiance  there were deeps in his nature which had never been sounded  a kind word a caressing touch of the hand on the part of grey beaver might have sounded these deeps but grey beaver did not caress nor speak kind words  it was not his way  his primacy was savage and savagely he ruled administering justice with a club punishing transgression with the pain of a blow and rewarding merit not by kindness but by withholding a blow  so white fang knew nothing of the heaven a mans hand might contain for him  besides he did not like the hands of the mananimals  he was suspicious of them  it was true that they sometimes gave meat but more often they gave hurt  hands were things to keep away from  they hurled stones wielded sticks and clubs and whips administered slaps and clouts and when they touched him were cunning to hurt with pinch and twist and wrench  in strange villages he had encountered the hands of the children and learned that they were cruel to hurt  also he had once nearly had an eye poked out by a toddling papoose  from these experiences he became suspicious of all children  he could not tolerate them  when they came near with their ominous hands he got up  it was in a village at the great slave lake that in the course of resenting the evil of the hands of the mananimals he came to modify the law that he had learned from grey beaver namely that the unpardonable crime was to bite one of the gods  in this village after the custom of all dogs in all villages white fang went foraging for food  a boy was chopping frozen moosemeat with an axe and the chips were flying in the snow  white fang sliding by in quest of meat stopped and began to eat the chips  he observed the boy lay down the axe and take up a stout club  white fang sprang clear just in time to escape the descending blow  the boy pursued him and he a stranger in the village fled between two tepees to find himself cornered against a high earth bank  there was no escape for white fang  the only way out was between the two tepees and this the boy guarded  holding his club prepared to strike he drew in on his cornered quarry  white fang was furious  he faced the boy bristling and snarling his sense of justice outraged  he knew the law of forage  all the wastage of meat such as the frozen chips belonged to the dog that found it  he had done no wrong broken no law yet here was this boy preparing to give him a beating  white fang scarcely knew what happened  he did it in a surge of rage  and he did it so quickly that the boy did not know either  all the boy knew was that he had in some unaccountable way been overturned into the snow and that his clubhand had been ripped wide open by white fangs teeth  but white fang knew that he had broken the law of the gods  he had driven his teeth into the sacred flesh of one of them and could expect nothing but a most terrible punishment  he fled away to grey beaver behind whose protecting legs he crouched when the bitten boy and the boys family came demanding vengeance  but they went away with vengeance unsatisfied  grey beaver defended white fang  so did mitsah and klookooch  white fang listening to the wordy war and watching the angry gestures knew that his act was justified  and so it came that he learned there were gods and gods  there were his gods and there were other gods and between them there was a difference  justice or injustice it was all the same he must take all things from the hands of his own gods  but he was not compelled to take injustice from the other gods  it was his privilege to resent it with his teeth  and this also was a law of the gods  before the day was out white fang was to learn more about this law  mit sah alone gathering firewood in the forest encountered the boy that had been bitten  with him were other boys  hot words passed  then all the boys attacked mitsah  it was going hard with him  blows were raining upon him from all sides  white fang looked on at first  this was an affair of the gods and no concern of his  then he realised that this was mitsah one of his own particular gods who was being maltreated  it was no reasoned impulse that made white fang do what he then did  a mad rush of anger sent him leaping in amongst the combatants  five minutes later the landscape was covered with fleeing boys many of whom dripped blood upon the snow in token that white fangs teeth had not been idle  when mitsah told the story in camp grey beaver ordered meat to be given to white fang  he ordered much meat to be given and white fang gorged and sleepy by the fire knew that the law had received its verification  it was in line with these experiences that white fang came to learn the law of property and the duty of the defence of property  from the protection of his gods body to the protection of his gods possessions was a step and this step he made  what was his gods was to be defended against all the worldeven to the extent of biting other gods  not only was such an act sacrilegious in its nature but it was fraught with peril  the gods were allpowerful and a dog was no match against them yet white fang learned to face them fiercely belligerent and unafraid duty rose above fear and thieving gods learned to leave grey beavers property alone  one thing in this connection white fang quickly learnt and that was that a thieving god was usually a cowardly god and prone to run away at the sounding of the alarm  also he learned that but brief time elapsed between his sounding of the alarm and grey beaver coming to his aid  he came to know that it was not fear of him that drove the thief away but fear of grey beaver  white fang did not give the alarm by barking  he never barked  his method was to drive straight at the intruder and to sink his teeth in if he could  because he was morose and solitary having nothing to do with the other dogs he was unusually fitted to guard his masters property and in this he was encouraged and trained by grey beaver  one result of this was to make white fang more ferocious and indomitable and more solitary  the months went by binding stronger and stronger the covenant between dog and man  this was the ancient covenant that the first wolf that came in from the wild entered into with man  and like all succeeding wolves and wild dogs that had done likewise white fang worked the covenant out for himself  the terms were simple  for the possession of a fleshand blood god he exchanged his own liberty  food and fire protection and companionship were some of the things he received from the god  in return he guarded the gods property defended his body worked for him and obeyed him  the possession of a god implies service  white fangs was a service of duty and awe but not of love  he did not know what love was  he had no experience of love  kiche was a remote memory  besides not only had he abandoned the wild and his kind when he gave himself up to man but the terms of the covenant were such that if ever he met kiche again he would not desert his god to go with her  his allegiance to man seemed somehow a law of his being greater than the love of liberty of kind and kin    chapter vithe famine   the spring of the year was at hand when grey beaver finished his long journey  it was april and white fang was a year old when he pulled into the home villages and was loosed from the harness by mitsah  though a long way from his full growth white fang next to liplip was the largest yearling in the village  both from his father the wolf and from kiche he had inherited stature and strength and already he was measuring up alongside the fullgrown dogs  but he had not yet grown compact  his body was slender and rangy and his strength more stringy than massive his coat was the true wolfgrey and to all appearances he was true wolf himself  the quarterstrain of dog he had inherited from kiche had left no mark on him physically though it had played its part in his mental makeup  he wandered through the village recognising with staid satisfaction the various gods he had known before the long journey  then there were the dogs puppies growing up like himself and grown dogs that did not look so large and formidable as the memory pictures he retained of them  also he stood less in fear of them than formerly stalking among them with a certain careless ease that was as new to him as it was enjoyable  there was baseek a grizzled old fellow that in his younger days had but to uncover his fangs to send white fang cringing and crouching to the right about  from him white fang had learned much of his own insignificance and from him he was now to learn much of the change and development that had taken place in himself  while baseek had been growing weaker with age white fang had been growing stronger with youth  it was at the cuttingup of a moose freshkilled that white fang learned of the changed relations in which he stood to the dogworld  he had got for himself a hoof and part of the shinbone to which quite a bit of meat was attached  withdrawn from the immediate scramble of the other dogsin fact out of sight behind a thickethe was devouring his prize when baseek rushed in upon him  before he knew what he was doing he had slashed the intruder twice and sprung clear  baseek was surprised by the others temerity and swiftness of attack  he stood gazing stupidly across at white fang the raw red shinbone between them  baseek was old and already he had come to know the increasing valour of the dogs it had been his wont to bully  bitter experiences these which perforce he swallowed calling upon all his wisdom to cope with them  in the old days he would have sprung upon white fang in a fury of righteous wrath  but now his waning powers would not permit such a course  he bristled fiercely and looked ominously across the shinbone at white fang  and white fang resurrecting quite a deal of the old awe seemed to wilt and to shrink in upon himself and grow small as he cast about in his mind for a way to beat a retreat not too inglorious  and right here baseek erred  had he contented himself with looking fierce and ominous all would have been well  white fang on the verge of retreat would have retreated leaving the meat to him  but baseek did not wait  he considered the victory already his and stepped forward to the meat  as he bent his head carelessly to smell it white fang bristled slightly  even then it was not too late for baseek to retrieve the situation  had he merely stood over the meat head up and glowering white fang would ultimately have slunk away  but the fresh meat was strong in baseeks nostrils and greed urged him to take a bite of it  this was too much for white fang  fresh upon his months of mastery over his own teammates it was beyond his selfcontrol to stand idly by while another devoured the meat that belonged to him  he struck after his custom without warning  with the first slash baseeks right ear was ripped into ribbons  he was astounded at the suddenness of it  but more things and most grievous ones were happening with equal suddenness  he was knocked off his feet  his throat was bitten  while he was struggling to his feet the young dog sank teeth twice into his shoulder the swiftness of it was bewildering  he made a futile rush at white fang clipping the empty air with an outraged snap  the next moment his nose was laid open and he was staggering backward away from the meat  the situation was now reversed  white fang stood over the shinbone bristling and menacing while baseek stood a little way off preparing to retreat  he dared not risk a fight with this young lightningflash and again he knew and more bitterly the enfeeblement of oncoming age  his attempt to maintain his dignity was heroic  calmly turning his back upon young dog and shinbone as though both were beneath his notice and unworthy of his consideration he stalked grandly away  nor until well out of sight did he stop to lick his bleeding wounds  the effect on white fang was to give him a greater faith in himself and a greater pride  he walked less softly among the grown dogs his attitude toward them was less compromising  not that he went out of his way looking for trouble  far from it  but upon his way he demanded consideration  he stood upon his right to go his way unmolested and to give trail to no dog  he had to be taken into account that was all  he was no longer to be disregarded and ignored as was the lot of puppies and as continued to be the lot of the puppies that were his teammates they got out of the way gave trail to the grown dogs and gave up meat to them under compulsion  but white fang uncompanionable solitary morose scarcely looking to right or left redoubtable forbidding of aspect remote and alien was accepted as an equal by his puzzled elders they quickly learned to leave him alone neither venturing hostile acts nor making overtures of friendliness  if they left him alone he left them alonea state of affairs that they found after a few encounters to be preeminently desirable  in midsummer white fang had an experience  trotting along in his silent way to investigate a new tepee which had been erected on the edge of the village while he was away with the hunters after moose he came full upon kiche  he paused and looked at her  he remembered her vaguely but he remembered her and that was more than could be said for her  she lifted her lip at him in the old snarl of menace and his memory became clear  his forgotten cubhood all that was associated with that familiar snarl rushed back to him  before he had known the gods she had been to him the centrepin of the universe  the old familiar feelings of that time came back upon him surged up within him  he bounded towards her joyously and she met him with shrewd fangs that laid his cheek open to the bone  he did not understand  he backed away bewildered and puzzled  but it was not kiches fault  a wolfmother was not made to remember her cubs of a year or so before  so she did not remember white fang  he was a strange animal an intruder and her present litter of puppies gave her the right to resent such intrusion  one of the puppies sprawled up to white fang  they were halfbrothers only they did not know it  white fang sniffed the puppy curiously whereupon kiche rushed upon him gashing his face a second time  he backed farther away  all the old memories and associations died down again and passed into the grave from which they had been resurrected  he looked at kiche licking her puppy and stopping now and then to snarl at him  she was without value to him  he had learned to get along without her  her meaning was forgotten  there was no place for her in his scheme of things as there was no place for him in hers  he was still standing stupid and bewildered the memories forgotten wondering what it was all about when kiche attacked him a third time intent on driving him away altogether from the vicinity  and white fang allowed himself to be driven away  this was a female of his kind and it was a law of his kind that the males must not fight the females  he did not know anything about this law for it was no generalisation of the mind not a something acquired by experience of the world  he knew it as a secret prompting as an urge of instinctof the same instinct that made him howl at the moon and stars of nights and that made him fear death and the unknown  the months went by  white fang grew stronger heavier and more compact while his character was developing along the lines laid down by his heredity and his environment  his heredity was a lifestuff that may be likened to clay  it possessed many possibilities was capable of being moulded into many different forms  environment served to model the clay to give it a particular form  thus had white fang never come in to the fires of man the wild would have moulded him into a true wolf  but the gods had given him a different environment and he was moulded into a dog that was rather wolfish but that was a dog and not a wolf  and so according to the clay of his nature and the pressure of his surroundings his character was being moulded into a certain particular shape  there was no escaping it  he was becoming more morose more uncompanionable more solitary more ferocious while the dogs were learning more and more that it was better to be at peace with him than at war and grey beaver was coming to prize him more greatly with the passage of each day  white fang seeming to sum up strength in all his qualities nevertheless suffered from one besetting weakness  he could not stand being laughed at  the laughter of men was a hateful thing  they might laugh among themselves about anything they pleased except himself and he did not mind  but the moment laughter was turned upon him he would fly into a most terrible rage  grave dignified sombre a laugh made him frantic to ridiculousness  it so outraged him and upset him that for hours he would behave like a demon  and woe to the dog that at such times ran foul of him  he knew the law too well to take it out of grey beaver behind grey beaver were a club and godhead  but behind the dogs there was nothing but space and into this space they flew when white fang came on the scene made mad by laughter  in the third year of his life there came a great famine to the mackenzie indians  in the summer the fish failed  in the winter the cariboo forsook their accustomed track  moose were scarce the rabbits almost disappeared hunting and preying animals perished  denied their usual foodsupply weakened by hunger they fell upon and devoured one another only the strong survived  white fangs gods were always hunting animals the old and the weak of them died of hunger  there was wailing in the village where the women and children went without in order that what little they had might go into the bellies of the lean and holloweyed hunters who trod the forest in the vain pursuit of meat  to such extremity were the gods driven that they ate the softtanned leather of their mocassins and mittens while the dogs ate the harnesses off their backs and the very whiplashes  also the dogs ate one another and also the gods ate the dogs  the weakest and the more worthless were eaten first  the dogs that still lived looked on and understood  a few of the boldest and wisest forsook the fires of the gods which had now become a shambles and fled into the forest where in the end they starved to death or were eaten by wolves  in this time of misery white fang too stole away into the woods  he was better fitted for the life than the other dogs for he had the training of his cubhood to guide him  especially adept did he become in stalking small living things  he would lie concealed for hours following every movement of a cautious treesquirrel waiting with a patience as huge as the hunger he suffered from until the squirrel ventured out upon the ground  even then white fang was not premature he waited until he was sure of striking before the squirrel could gain a treerefuge  then and not until then would he flash from his hiding place a grey projectile incredibly swift never failing its markthe fleeing squirrel that fled not fast enough  successful as he was with squirrels there was one difficulty that prevented him from living and growing fat on them  there were not enough squirrels  so he was driven to hunt still smaller things  so acute did his hunger become at times that he was not above rooting out woodmice from their burrows in the ground  nor did he scorn to do battle with a weasel as hungry as himself and many times more ferocious  in the worst pinches of the famine he stole back to the fires of the gods  but he did not go into the fires  he lurked in the forest avoiding discovery and robbing the snares at the rare intervals when game was caught  he even robbed grey beavers snare of a rabbit at a time when grey beaver staggered and tottered through the forest sitting down often to rest what of weakness and of shortness of breath  one day while fang encountered a young wolf gaunt and scrawny loose jointed with famine  had he not been hungry himself white fang might have gone with him and eventually found his way into the pack amongst his wild brethren  as it was he ran the young wolf down and killed and ate him  fortune seemed to favour him  always when hardest pressed for food he found something to kill  again when he was weak it was his luck that none of the larger preying animals chanced upon him  thus he was strong from the two days eating a lynx had afforded him when the hungry wolf pack ran full tilt upon him  it was a long cruel chase but he was better nourished than they and in the end outran them  and not only did he outrun them but circling widely back on his track he gathered in one of his exhausted pursuers  after that he left that part of the country and journeyed over to the valley wherein he had been born  here in the old lair he encountered kiche  up to her old tricks she too had fled the inhospitable fires of the gods and gone back to her old refuge to give birth to her young of this litter but one remained alive when white fang came upon the scene and this one was not destined to live long  young life had little chance in such a famine  kiches greeting of her grown son was anything but affectionate  but white fang did not mind  he had outgrown his mother  so he turned tail philosophically and trotted on up the stream  at the forks he took the turning to the left where he found the lair of the lynx with whom his mother and he had fought long before  here in the abandoned lair he settled down and rested for a day  during the early summer in the last days of the famine he met liplip who had likewise taken to the woods where he had eked out a miserable existence  white fang came upon him unexpectedly  trotting in opposite directions along the base of a high bluff they rounded a corner of rock and found themselves face to face  they paused with instant alarm and looked at each other suspiciously  white fang was in splendid condition  his hunting had been good and for a week he had eaten his fill  he was even gorged from his latest kill but in the moment he looked at liplip his hair rose on end all along his back  it was an involuntary bristling on his part the physical state that in the past had always accompanied the mental state produced in him by liplips bullying and persecution  as in the past he had bristled and snarled at sight of liplip so now and automatically he bristled and snarled  he did not waste any time  the thing was done thoroughly and with despatch  liplip essayed to back away but white fang struck him hard shoulder to shoulder  liplip was overthrown and rolled upon his back  white fangs teeth drove into the scrawny throat  there was a deathstruggle during which white fang walked around stifflegged and observant  then he resumed his course and trotted on along the base of the bluff  one day not long after he came to the edge of the forest where a narrow stretch of open land sloped down to the mackenzie  he had been over this ground before when it was bare but now a village occupied it still hidden amongst the trees he paused to study the situation  sights and sounds and scents were familiar to him  it was the old village changed to a new place  but sights and sounds and smells were different from those he had last had when he fled away from it  there was no whimpering nor wailing  contented sounds saluted his ear and when he heard the angry voice of a woman he knew it to be the anger that proceeds from a full stomach  and there was a smell in the air of fish  there was food  the famine was gone  he came out boldly from the forest and trotted into camp straight to grey beavers tepee  grey beaver was not there but klookooch welcomed him with glad cries and the whole of a freshcaught fish and he lay down to wait grey beavers coming     part iv   chapter ithe enemy of his kind   had there been in white fangs nature any possibility no matter how remote of his ever coming to fraternise with his kind such possibility was irretrievably destroyed when he was made leader of the sledteam  for now the dogs hated himhated him for the extra meat bestowed upon him by mitsah hated him for all the real and fancied favours he received hated him for that he fled always at the head of the team his waving brush of a tail and his perpetually retreating hindquarters for ever maddening their eyes  and white fang just as bitterly hated them back  being sledleader was anything but gratifying to him  to be compelled to run away before the yelling pack every dog of which for three years he had thrashed and mastered was almost more than he could endure  but endure it he must or perish and the life that was in him had no desire to perish out  the moment mitsah gave his order for the start that moment the whole team with eager savage cries sprang forward at white fang  there was no defence for him  if he turned upon them mitsah would throw the stinging lash of the whip into his face  only remained to him to run away  he could not encounter that howling horde with his tail and hindquarters  these were scarcely fit weapons with which to meet the many merciless fangs  so run away he did violating his own nature and pride with every leap he made and leaping all day long  one cannot violate the promptings of ones nature without having that nature recoil upon itself  such a recoil is like that of a hair made to grow out from the body turning unnaturally upon the direction of its growth and growing into the bodya rankling festering thing of hurt and so with white fang  every urge of his being impelled him to spring upon the pack that cried at his heels but it was the will of the gods that this should not be and behind the will to enforce it was the whip of cariboogut with its biting thirtyfoot lash  so white fang could only eat his heart in bitterness and develop a hatred and malice commensurate with the ferocity and indomitability of his nature  if ever a creature was the enemy of its kind white fang was that creature  he asked no quarter gave none  he was continually marred and scarred by the teeth of the pack and as continually he left his own marks upon the pack  unlike most leaders who when camp was made and the dogs were unhitched huddled near to the gods for protection white fang disdained such protection  he walked boldly about the camp inflicting punishment in the night for what he had suffered in the day in the time before he was made leader of the team the pack had learned to get out of his way  but now it was different  excited by the day long pursuit of him swayed subconsciously by the insistent iteration on their brains of the sight of him fleeing away mastered by the feeling of mastery enjoyed all day the dogs could not bring themselves to give way to him  when he appeared amongst them there was always a squabble  his progress was marked by snarl and snap and growl  the very atmosphere he breathed was surcharged with hatred and malice and this but served to increase the hatred and malice within him  when mitsah cried out his command for the team to stop white fang obeyed  at first this caused trouble for the other dogs  all of them would spring upon the hated leader only to find the tables turned  behind him would be mitsah the great whip singing in his hand  so the dogs came to understand that when the team stopped by order white fang was to be let alone  but when white fang stopped without orders then it was allowed them to spring upon him and destroy him if they could  after several experiences white fang never stopped without orders  he learned quickly  it was in the nature of things that he must learn quickly if he were to survive the unusually severe conditions under which life was vouchsafed him  but the dogs could never learn the lesson to leave him alone in camp each day pursuing him and crying defiance at him the lesson of the previous night was erased and that night would have to be learned over again to be as immediately forgotten  besides there was a greater consistence in their dislike of him  they sensed between themselves and him a difference of kindcause sufficient in itself for hostility  like him they were domesticated wolves  but they had been domesticated for generations  much of the wild had been lost so that to them the wild was the unknown the terrible the evermenacing and ever warring  but to him in appearance and action and impulse still clung the wild  he symbolised it was its personification so that when they showed their teeth to him they were defending themselves against the powers of destruction that lurked in the shadows of the forest and in the dark beyond the campfire  but there was one lesson the dogs did learn and that was to keep together  white fang was too terrible for any of them to face single handed  they met him with the massformation otherwise he would have killed them one by one in a night  as it was he never had a chance to kill them  he might roll a dog off its feet but the pack would be upon him before he could follow up and deliver the deadly throatstroke  at the first hint of conflict the whole team drew together and faced him the dogs had quarrels among themselves but these were forgotten when trouble was brewing with white fang  on the other hand try as they would they could not kill white fang  he was too quick for them too formidable too wise  he avoided tight places and always backed out of it when they bade fair to surround him while as for getting him off his feet there was no dog among them capable of doing the trick  his feet clung to the earth with the same tenacity that he clung to life  for that matter life and footing were synonymous in this unending warfare with the pack and none knew it better than white fang  so he became the enemy of his kind domesticated wolves that they were softened by the fires of man weakened in the sheltering shadow of mans strength  white fang was bitter and implacable  the clay of him was so moulded  he declared a vendetta against all dogs  and so terribly did he live this vendetta that grey beaver fierce savage himself could not but marvel at white fangs ferocity  never he swore had there been the like of this animal and the indians in strange villages swore likewise when they considered the tale of his killings amongst their dogs  when white fang was nearly five years old grey beaver took him on another great journey and long remembered was the havoc he worked amongst the dogs of the many villages along the mackenzie across the rockies and down the porcupine to the yukon  he revelled in the vengeance he wreaked upon his kind  they were ordinary unsuspecting dogs  they were not prepared for his swiftness and directness for his attack without warning  they did not know him for what he was a lightningflash of slaughter  they bristled up to him stifflegged and challenging while he wasting no time on elaborate preliminaries snapping into action like a steel spring was at their throats and destroying them before they knew what was happening and while they were yet in the throes of surprise  he became an adept at fighting  he economised  he never wasted his strength never tussled  he was in too quickly for that and if he missed was out again too quickly  the dislike of the wolf for close quarters was his to an unusual degree  he could not endure a prolonged contact with another body  it smacked of danger  it made him frantic he must be away free on his own legs touching no living thing  it was the wild still clinging to him asserting itself through him  this feeling had been accentuated by the ishmaelite life he had led from his puppyhood  danger lurked in contacts  it was the trap ever the trap the fear of it lurking deep in the life of him woven into the fibre of him  in consequence the strange dogs he encountered had no chance against him  he eluded their fangs  he got them or got away himself untouched in either event  in the natural course of things there were exceptions to this  there were times when several dogs pitching on to him punished him before he could get away and there were times when a single dog scored deeply on him  but these were accidents  in the main so efficient a fighter had he become he went his way unscathed  another advantage he possessed was that of correctly judging time and distance  not that he did this consciously however  he did not calculate such things  it was all automatic  his eyes saw correctly and the nerves carried the vision correctly to his brain  the parts of him were better adjusted than those of the average dog  they worked together more smoothly and steadily  his was a better far better nervous mental and muscular coordination  when his eyes conveyed to his brain the moving image of an action his brain without conscious effort knew the space that limited that action and the time required for its completion  thus he could avoid the leap of another dog or the drive of its fangs and at the same moment could seize the infinitesimal fraction of time in which to deliver his own attack  body and brain his was a more perfected mechanism  not that he was to be praised for it nature had been more generous to him than to the average animal that was all  it was in the summer that white fang arrived at fort yukon  grey beaver had crossed the great watershed between mackenzie and the yukon in the late winter and spent the spring in hunting among the western outlying spurs of the rockies  then after the breakup of the ice on the porcupine he had built a canoe and paddled down that stream to where it effected its junction with the yukon just under the artic circle  here stood the old hudsons bay company fort and here were many indians much food and unprecedented excitement  it was the summer of 1898 and thousands of goldhunters were going up the yukon to dawson and the klondike  still hundreds of miles from their goal nevertheless many of them had been on the way for a year and the least any of them had travelled to get that far was five thousand miles while some had come from the other side of the world  here grey beaver stopped  a whisper of the goldrush had reached his ears and he had come with several bales of furs and another of gutsewn mittens and moccasins  he would not have ventured so long a trip had he not expected generous profits  but what he had expected was nothing to what he realised  his wildest dreams had not exceeded a hundred per cent profit he made a thousand per cent  and like a true indian he settled down to trade carefully and slowly even if it took all summer and the rest of the winter to dispose of his goods  it was at fort yukon that white fang saw his first white men  as compared with the indians he had known they were to him another race of beings a race of superior gods  they impressed him as possessing superior power and it is on power that godhead rests  white fang did not reason it out did not in his mind make the sharp generalisation that the white gods were more powerful  it was a feeling nothing more and yet none the less potent  as in his puppyhood the looming bulks of the tepees manreared had affected him as manifestations of power so was he affected now by the houses and the huge fort all of massive logs  here was power  those white gods were strong  they possessed greater mastery over matter than the gods he had known most powerful among which was grey beaver  and yet grey beaver was as a childgod among these white skinned ones  to be sure white fang only felt these things  he was not conscious of them  yet it is upon feeling more often than thinking that animals act and every act white fang now performed was based upon the feeling that the white men were the superior gods  in the first place he was very suspicious of them  there was no telling what unknown terrors were theirs what unknown hurts they could administer  he was curious to observe them fearful of being noticed by them  for the first few hours he was content with slinking around and watching them from a safe distance  then he saw that no harm befell the dogs that were near to them and he came in closer  in turn he was an object of great curiosity to them  his wolfish appearance caught their eyes at once and they pointed him out to one another  this act of pointing put white fang on his guard and when they tried to approach him he showed his teeth and backed away  not one succeeded in laying a hand on him and it was well that they did not  white fang soon learned that very few of these godsnot more than a dozenlived at this place  every two or three days a steamer another and colossal manifestation of power came into the bank and stopped for several hours  the white men came from off these steamers and went away on them again  there seemed untold numbers of these white men  in the first day or so he saw more of them than he had seen indians in all his life and as the days went by they continued to come up the river stop and then go on up the river out of sight  but if the white gods were allpowerful their dogs did not amount to much  this white fang quickly discovered by mixing with those that came ashore with their masters  they were irregular shapes and sizes  some were shortleggedtoo short others were longleggedtoo long  they had hair instead of fur and a few had very little hair at that  and none of them knew how to fight  as an enemy of his kind it was in white fangs province to fight with them  this he did and he quickly achieved for them a mighty contempt they were soft and helpless made much noise and floundered around clumsily trying to accomplish by main strength what he accomplished by dexterity and cunning  they rushed bellowing at him  he sprang to the side  they did not know what had become of him and in that moment he struck them on the shoulder rolling them off their feet and delivering his stroke at the throat  sometimes this stroke was successful and a stricken dog rolled in the dirt to be pounced upon and torn to pieces by the pack of indian dogs that waited  white fang was wise  he had long since learned that the gods were made angry when their dogs were killed  the white men were no exception to this  so he was content when he had overthrown and slashed wide the throat of one of their dogs to drop back and let the pack go in and do the cruel finishing work  it was then that the white men rushed in visiting their wrath heavily on the pack while white fang went free he would stand off at a little distance and look on while stones clubs axes and all sorts of weapons fell upon his fellows  white fang was very wise  but his fellows grew wise in their own way and in this white fang grew wise with them  they learned that it was when a steamer first tied to the bank that they had their fun  after the first two or three strange dogs had been downed and destroyed the white men hustled their own animals back on board and wrecked savage vengeance on the offenders  one white man having seen his dog a setter torn to pieces before his eyes drew a revolver  he fired rapidly six times and six of the pack lay dead or dyinganother manifestation of power that sank deep into white fangs consciousness  white fang enjoyed it all  he did not love his kind and he was shrewd enough to escape hurt himself  at first the killing of the white mens dogs had been a diversion  after a time it became his occupation  there was no work for him to do  grey beaver was busy trading and getting wealthy  so white fang hung around the landing with the disreputable gang of indian dogs waiting for steamers  with the arrival of a steamer the fun began  after a few minutes by the time the white men had got over their surprise the gang scattered  the fun was over until the next steamer should arrive  but it can scarcely be said that white fang was a member of the gang  he did not mingle with it but remained aloof always himself and was even feared by it  it is true he worked with it  he picked the quarrel with the strange dog while the gang waited  and when he had overthrown the strange dog the gang went in to finish it  but it is equally true that he then withdrew leaving the gang to receive the punishment of the outraged gods  it did not require much exertion to pick these quarrels  all he had to do when the strange dogs came ashore was to show himself  when they saw him they rushed for him  it was their instinct  he was the wildthe unknown the terrible the evermenacing the thing that prowled in the darkness around the fires of the primeval world when they cowering close to the fires were reshaping their instincts learning to fear the wild out of which they had come and which they had deserted and betrayed generation by generation down all the generations had this fear of the wild been stamped into their natures  for centuries the wild had stood for terror and destruction  and during all this time free licence had been theirs from their masters to kill the things of the wild  in doing this they had protected both themselves and the gods whose companionship they shared  and so fresh from the soft southern world these dogs trotting down the gangplank and out upon the yukon shore had but to see white fang to experience the irresistible impulse to rush upon him and destroy him they might be townreared dogs but the instinctive fear of the wild was theirs just the same  not alone with their own eyes did they see the wolfish creature in the clear light of day standing before them  they saw him with the eyes of their ancestors and by their inherited memory they knew white fang for the wolf and they remembered the ancient feud  all of which served to make white fangs days enjoyable  if the sight of him drove these strange dogs upon him so much the better for him so much the worse for them  they looked upon him as legitimate prey and as legitimate prey he looked upon them  not for nothing had he first seen the light of day in a lonely lair and fought his first fights with the ptarmigan the weasel and the lynx  and not for nothing had his puppyhood been made bitter by the persecution of liplip and the whole puppy pack  it might have been otherwise and he would then have been otherwise  had liplip not existed he would have passed his puppyhood with the other puppies and grown up more doglike and with more liking for dogs  had grey beaver possessed the plummet of affection and love he might have sounded the deeps of white fangs nature and brought up to the surface all manner of kindly qualities  but these things had not been so  the clay of white fang had been moulded until he became what he was morose and lonely unloving and ferocious the enemy of all his kind    chapter iithe mad god   a small number of white men lived in fort yukon  these men had been long in the country  they called themselves sourdoughs and took great pride in so classifying themselves  for other men new in the land they felt nothing but disdain  the men who came ashore from the steamers were newcomers  they were known as chechaquos and they always wilted at the application of the name  they made their bread with bakingpowder this was the invidious distinction between them and the sourdoughs who forsooth made their bread from sourdough because they had no baking powder  all of which is neither here nor there  the men in the fort disdained the newcomers and enjoyed seeing them come to grief  especially did they enjoy the havoc worked amongst the newcomers dogs by white fang and his disreputable gang  when a steamer arrived the men of the fort made it a point always to come down to the bank and see the fun  they looked forward to it with as much anticipation as did the indian dogs while they were not slow to appreciate the savage and crafty part played by white fang  but there was one man amongst them who particularly enjoyed the sport  he would come running at the first sound of a steamboats whistle and when the last fight was over and white fang and the pack had scattered he would return slowly to the fort his face heavy with regret  sometimes when a soft southland dog went down shrieking its deathcry under the fangs of the pack this man would be unable to contain himself and would leap into the air and cry out with delight  and always he had a sharp and covetous eye for white fang  this man was called beauty by the other men of the fort  no one knew his first name and in general he was known in the country as beauty smith  but he was anything save a beauty  to antithesis was due his naming  he was preeminently unbeautiful  nature had been niggardly with him  he was a small man to begin with and upon his meagre frame was deposited an even more strikingly meagre head  its apex might be likened to a point  in fact in his boyhood before he had been named beauty by his fellows he had been called pinhead  backward from the apex his head slanted down to his neck and forward it slanted uncompromisingly to meet a low and remarkably wide forehead beginning here as though regretting her parsimony nature had spread his features with a lavish hand  his eyes were large and between them was the distance of two eyes  his face in relation to the rest of him was prodigious  in order to discover the necessary area nature had given him an enormous prognathous jaw  it was wide and heavy and protruded outward and down until it seemed to rest on his chest  possibly this appearance was due to the weariness of the slender neck unable properly to support so great a burden  this jaw gave the impression of ferocious determination  but something lacked  perhaps it was from excess  perhaps the jaw was too large  at any rate it was a lie  beauty smith was known far and wide as the weakest of weakkneed and snivelling cowards  to complete his description his teeth were large and yellow while the two eyeteeth larger than their fellows showed under his lean lips like fangs  his eyes were yellow and muddy as though nature had run short on pigments and squeezed together the dregs of all her tubes  it was the same with his hair sparse and irregular of growth muddyyellow and dirtyyellow rising on his head and sprouting out of his face in unexpected tufts and bunches in appearance like clumped and windblown grain  in short beauty smith was a monstrosity and the blame of it lay elsewhere  he was not responsible  the clay of him had been so moulded in the making  he did the cooking for the other men in the fort the dishwashing and the drudgery  they did not despise him  rather did they tolerate him in a broad human way as one tolerates any creature evilly treated in the making  also they feared him  his cowardly rages made them dread a shot in the back or poison in their coffee  but somebody had to do the cooking and whatever else his shortcomings beauty smith could cook  this was the man that looked at white fang delighted in his ferocious prowess and desired to possess him  he made overtures to white fang from the first  white fang began by ignoring him  later on when the overtures became more insistent white fang bristled and bared his teeth and backed away  he did not like the man  the feel of him was bad  he sensed the evil in him and feared the extended hand and the attempts at softspoken speech  because of all this he hated the man  with the simpler creatures good and bad are things simply understood the good stands for all things that bring easement and satisfaction and surcease from pain  therefore the good is liked  the bad stands for all things that are fraught with discomfort menace and hurt and is hated accordingly  white fangs feel of beauty smith was bad  from the mans distorted body and twisted mind in occult ways like mists rising from malarial marshes came emanations of the unhealth within  not by reasoning not by the five senses alone but by other and remoter and uncharted senses came the feeling to white fang that the man was ominous with evil pregnant with hurtfulness and therefore a thing bad and wisely to be hated  white fang was in grey beavers camp when beauty smith first visited it at the faint sound of his distant feet before he came in sight white fang knew who was coming and began to bristle  he had been lying down in an abandon of comfort but he arose quickly and as the man arrived slid away in true wolffashion to the edge of the camp  he did not know what they said but he could see the man and grey beaver talking together  once the man pointed at him and white fang snarled back as though the hand were just descending upon him instead of being as it was fifty feet away  the man laughed at this and white fang slunk away to the sheltering woods his head turned to observe as he glided softly over the ground  grey beaver refused to sell the dog  he had grown rich with his trading and stood in need of nothing  besides white fang was a valuable animal the strongest sleddog he had ever owned and the best leader furthermore there was no dog like him on the mackenzie nor the yukon  he could fight  he killed other dogs as easily as men killed mosquitoes beauty smiths eyes lighted up at this and he licked his thin lips with an eager tongue  no white fang was not for sale at any price  but beauty smith knew the ways of indians  he visited grey beavers camp often and hidden under his coat was always a black bottle or so  one of the potencies of whisky is the breeding of thirst  grey beaver got the thirst  his fevered membranes and burnt stomach began to clamour for more and more of the scorching fluid while his brain thrust all awry by the unwonted stimulant permitted him to go any length to obtain it  the money he had received for his furs and mittens and moccasins began to go it went faster and faster and the shorter his moneysack grew the shorter grew his temper  in the end his money and goods and temper were all gone  nothing remained to him but his thirst a prodigious possession in itself that grew more prodigious with every sober breath he drew  then it was that beauty smith had talk with him again about the sale of white fang but this time the price offered was in bottles not dollars and grey beavers ears were more eager to hear  you ketch um dog you take um all right was his last word  the bottles were delivered but after two days  you ketch um dog were beauty smiths words to grey beaver  white fang slunk into camp one evening and dropped down with a sigh of content  the dreaded white god was not there  for days his manifestations of desire to lay hands on him had been growing more insistent and during that time white fang had been compelled to avoid the camp  he did not know what evil was threatened by those insistent hands  he knew only that they did threaten evil of some sort and that it was best for him to keep out of their reach  but scarcely had he lain down when grey beaver staggered over to him and tied a leather thong around his neck  he sat down beside white fang holding the end of the thong in his hand  in the other hand he held a bottle which from time to time was inverted above his head to the accompaniment of gurgling noises  an hour of this passed when the vibrations of feet in contact with the ground foreran the one who approached  white fang heard it first and he was bristling with recognition while grey beaver still nodded stupidly white fang tried to draw the thong softly out of his masters hand but the relaxed fingers closed tightly and grey beaver roused himself  beauty smith strode into camp and stood over white fang  he snarled softly up at the thing of fear watching keenly the deportment of the hands  one hand extended outward and began to descend upon his head  his soft snarl grew tense and harsh  the hand continued slowly to descend while he crouched beneath it eyeing it malignantly his snarl growing shorter and shorter as with quickening breath it approached its culmination  suddenly he snapped striking with his fangs like a snake the hand was jerked back and the teeth came together emptily with a sharp click  beauty smith was frightened and angry  grey beaver clouted white fang alongside the head so that he cowered down close to the earth in respectful obedience  white fangs suspicious eyes followed every movement  he saw beauty smith go away and return with a stout club  then the end of the thong was given over to him by grey beaver  beauty smith started to walk away the thong grew taut  white fang resisted it  grey beaver clouted him right and left to make him get up and follow  he obeyed but with a rush hurling himself upon the stranger who was dragging him away  beauty smith did not jump away  he had been waiting for this  he swung the club smartly stopping the rush midway and smashing white fang down upon the ground  grey beaver laughed and nodded approval  beauty smith tightened the thong again and white fang crawled limply and dizzily to his feet  he did not rush a second time  one smash from the club was sufficient to convince him that the white god knew how to handle it and he was too wise to fight the inevitable  so he followed morosely at beauty smiths heels his tail between his legs yet snarling softly under his breath but beauty smith kept a wary eye on him and the club was held always ready to strike  at the fort beauty smith left him securely tied and went in to bed  white fang waited an hour  then he applied his teeth to the thong and in the space of ten seconds was free  he had wasted no time with his teeth there had been no useless gnawing  the thong was cut across diagonally almost as clean as though done by a knife  white fang looked up at the fort at the same time bristling and growling  then he turned and trotted back to grey beavers camp  he owed no allegiance to this strange and terrible god  he had given himself to grey beaver and to grey beaver he considered he still belonged  but what had occurred before was repeatedwith a difference  grey beaver again made him fast with a thong and in the morning turned him over to beauty smith  and here was where the difference came in  beauty smith gave him a beating  tied securely white fang could only rage futilely and endure the punishment  club and whip were both used upon him and he experienced the worst beating he had ever received in his life  even the big beating given him in his puppyhood by grey beaver was mild compared with this  beauty smith enjoyed the task  he delighted in it  he gloated over his victim and his eyes flamed dully as he swung the whip or club and listened to white fangs cries of pain and to his helpless bellows and snarls  for beauty smith was cruel in the way that cowards are cruel cringing and snivelling himself before the blows or angry speech of a man he revenged himself in turn upon creatures weaker than he  all life likes power and beauty smith was no exception  denied the expression of power amongst his own kind he fell back upon the lesser creatures and there vindicated the life that was in him  but beauty smith had not created himself and no blame was to be attached to him  he had come into the world with a twisted body and a brute intelligence this had constituted the clay of him and it had not been kindly moulded by the world  white fang knew why he was being beaten  when grey beaver tied the thong around his neck and passed the end of the thong into beauty smiths keeping white fang knew that it was his gods will for him to go with beauty smith  and when beauty smith left him tied outside the fort he knew that it was beauty smiths will that he should remain there therefore he had disobeyed the will of both the gods and earned the consequent punishment  he had seen dogs change owners in the past and he had seen the runaways beaten as he was being beaten  he was wise and yet in the nature of him there were forces greater than wisdom  one of these was fidelity  he did not love grey beaver yet even in the face of his will and his anger he was faithful to him  he could not help it this faithfulness was a quality of the clay that composed him  it was the quality that was peculiarly the possession of his kind the quality that set apart his species from all other species the quality that has enabled the wolf and the wild dog to come in from the open and be the companions of man  after the beating white fang was dragged back to the fort  but this time beauty smith left him tied with a stick  one does not give up a god easily and so with white fang  grey beaver was his own particular god and in spite of grey beavers will white fang still clung to him and would not give him up  grey beaver had betrayed and forsaken him but that had no effect upon him  not for nothing had he surrendered himself body and soul to grey beaver  there had been no reservation on white fangs part and the bond was not to be broken easily  so in the night when the men in the fort were asleep white fang applied his teeth to the stick that held him  the wood was seasoned and dry and it was tied so closely to his neck that he could scarcely get his teeth to it  it was only by the severest muscular exertion and neck arching that he succeeded in getting the wood between his teeth and barely between his teeth at that and it was only by the exercise of an immense patience extending through many hours that he succeeded in gnawing through the stick  this was something that dogs were not supposed to do  it was unprecedented  but white fang did it trotting away from the fort in the early morning with the end of the stick hanging to his neck  he was wise  but had he been merely wise he would not have gone back to grey beaver who had already twice betrayed him  but there was his faithfulness and he went back to be betrayed yet a third time  again he yielded to the tying of a thong around his neck by grey beaver and again beauty smith came to claim him  and this time he was beaten even more severely than before  grey beaver looked on stolidly while the white man wielded the whip  he gave no protection  it was no longer his dog  when the beating was over white fang was sick  a soft southland dog would have died under it but not he  his school of life had been sterner and he was himself of sterner stuff  he had too great vitality  his clutch on life was too strong  but he was very sick  at first he was unable to drag himself along and beauty smith had to wait halfanhour for him  and then blind and reeling he followed at beauty smiths heels back to the fort  but now he was tied with a chain that defied his teeth and he strove in vain by lunging to draw the staple from the timber into which it was driven  after a few days sober and bankrupt grey beaver departed up the porcupine on his long journey to the mackenzie  white fang remained on the yukon the property of a man more than half mad and all brute  but what is a dog to know in its consciousness of madness  to white fang beauty smith was a veritable if terrible god  he was a mad god at best but white fang knew nothing of madness he knew only that he must submit to the will of this new master obey his every whim and fancy    chapter iiithe reign of hate   under the tutelage of the mad god white fang became a fiend  he was kept chained in a pen at the rear of the fort and here beauty smith teased and irritated and drove him wild with petty torments  the man early discovered white fangs susceptibility to laughter and made it a point after painfully tricking him to laugh at him  this laughter was uproarious and scornful and at the same time the god pointed his finger derisively at white fang  at such times reason fled from white fang and in his transports of rage he was even more mad than beauty smith  formerly white fang had been merely the enemy of his kind withal a ferocious enemy  he now became the enemy of all things and more ferocious than ever  to such an extent was he tormented that he hated blindly and without the faintest spark of reason  he hated the chain that bound him the men who peered in at him through the slats of the pen the dogs that accompanied the men and that snarled malignantly at him in his helplessness  he hated the very wood of the pen that confined him  and first last and most of all he hated beauty smith  but beauty smith had a purpose in all that he did to white fang  one day a number of men gathered about the pen  beauty smith entered club in hand and took the chain off from white fangs neck  when his master had gone out white fang turned loose and tore around the pen trying to get at the men outside  he was magnificently terrible  fully five feet in length and standing two and onehalf feet at the shoulder he far outweighed a wolf of corresponding size  from his mother he had inherited the heavier proportions of the dog so that he weighed without any fat and without an ounce of superfluous flesh over ninety pounds  it was all muscle bone and sinewfighting flesh in the finest condition  the door of the pen was being opened again  white fang paused  something unusual was happening  he waited  the door was opened wider  then a huge dog was thrust inside and the door was slammed shut behind him white fang had never seen such a dog it was a mastiff but the size and fierce aspect of the intruder did not deter him  here was some thing not wood nor iron upon which to wreak his hate  he leaped in with a flash of fangs that ripped down the side of the mastiffs neck  the mastiff shook his head growled hoarsely and plunged at white fang  but white fang was here there and everywhere always evading and eluding and always leaping in and slashing with his fangs and leaping out again in time to escape punishment  the men outside shouted and applauded while beauty smith in an ecstasy of delight gloated over the ripping and mangling performed by white fang  there was no hope for the mastiff from the first  he was too ponderous and slow  in the end while beauty smith beat white fang back with a club the mastiff was dragged out by its owner  then there was a payment of bets and money clinked in beauty smiths hand  white fang came to look forward eagerly to the gathering of the men around his pen  it meant a fight and this was the only way that was now vouchsafed him of expressing the life that was in him  tormented incited to hate he was kept a prisoner so that there was no way of satisfying that hate except at the times his master saw fit to put another dog against him  beauty smith had estimated his powers well for he was invariably the victor  one day three dogs were turned in upon him in succession  another day a fullgrown wolf freshcaught from the wild was shoved in through the door of the pen  and on still another day two dogs were set against him at the same time  this was his severest fight and though in the end he killed them both he was himself half killed in doing it  in the fall of the year when the first snows were falling and mushice was running in the river beauty smith took passage for himself and white fang on a steamboat bound up the yukon to dawson  white fang had now achieved a reputation in the land  as the fighting wolf he was known far and wide and the cage in which he was kept on the steamboats deck was usually surrounded by curious men  he raged and snarled at them or lay quietly and studied them with cold hatred  why should he not hate them  he never asked himself the question  he knew only hate and lost himself in the passion of it  life had become a hell to him  he had not been made for the close confinement wild beasts endure at the hands of men  and yet it was in precisely this way that he was treated  men stared at him poked sticks between the bars to make him snarl and then laughed at him  they were his environment these men and they were moulding the clay of him into a more ferocious thing than had been intended by nature nevertheless nature had given him plasticity  where many another animal would have died or had its spirit broken he adjusted himself and lived and at no expense of the spirit  possibly beauty smith archfiend and tormentor was capable of breaking white fangs spirit but as yet there were no signs of his succeeding  if beauty smith had in him a devil white fang had another and the two of them raged against each other unceasingly  in the days before white fang had had the wisdom to cower down and submit to a man with a club in his hand but this wisdom now left him  the mere sight of beauty smith was sufficient to send him into transports of fury  and when they came to close quarters and he had been beaten back by the club he went on growling and snarling and showing his fangs  the last growl could never be extracted from him  no matter how terribly he was beaten he had always another growl and when beauty smith gave up and withdrew the defiant growl followed after him or white fang sprang at the bars of the cage bellowing his hatred  when the steamboat arrived at dawson white fang went ashore  but he still lived a public life in a cage surrounded by curious men  he was exhibited as the fighting wolf and men paid fifty cents in gold dust to see him  he was given no rest  did he lie down to sleep he was stirred up by a sharp stickso that the audience might get its moneys worth  in order to make the exhibition interesting he was kept in a rage most of the time  but worse than all this was the atmosphere in which he lived  he was regarded as the most fearful of wild beasts and this was borne in to him through the bars of the cage  every word every cautious action on the part of the men impressed upon him his own terrible ferocity  it was so much added fuel to the flame of his fierceness  there could be but one result and that was that his ferocity fed upon itself and increased  it was another instance of the plasticity of his clay of his capacity for being moulded by the pressure of environment  in addition to being exhibited he was a professional fighting animal  at irregular intervals whenever a fight could be arranged he was taken out of his cage and led off into the woods a few miles from town  usually this occurred at night so as to avoid interference from the mounted police of the territory  after a few hours of waiting when daylight had come the audience and the dog with which he was to fight arrived  in this manner it came about that he fought all sizes and breeds of dogs  it was a savage land the men were savage and the fights were usually to the death  since white fang continued to fight it is obvious that it was the other dogs that died  he never knew defeat  his early training when he fought with liplip and the whole puppypack stood him in good stead there was the tenacity with which he clung to the earth  no dog could make him lose his footing  this was the favourite trick of the wolf breedsto rush in upon him either directly or with an unexpected swerve in the hope of striking his shoulder and overthrowing him mackenzie hounds eskimo and labrador dogs huskies and malemutesall tried it on him and all failed  he was never known to lose his footing men told this to one another and looked each time to see it happen but white fang always disappointed them  then there was his lightning quickness  it gave him a tremendous advantage over his antagonists  no matter what their fighting experience they had never encountered a dog that moved so swiftly as he also to be reckoned with was the immediateness of his attack  the average dog was accustomed to the preliminaries of snarling and bristling and growling and the average dog was knocked off his feet and finished before he had begun to fight or recovered from his surprise  so often did this happen that it became the custom to hold white fang until the other dog went through its preliminaries was good and ready and even made the first attack  but greatest of all the advantages in white fangs favour was his experience  he knew more about fighting than did any of the dogs that faced him  he had fought more fights knew how to meet more tricks and methods and had more tricks himself while his own method was scarcely to be improved upon  as the time went by he had fewer and fewer fights  men despaired of matching him with an equal and beauty smith was compelled to pit wolves against him  these were trapped by the indians for the purpose and a fight between white fang and a wolf was always sure to draw a crowd once a fullgrown female lynx was secured and this time white fang fought for his life  her quickness matched his her ferocity equalled his while he fought with his fangs alone and she fought with her sharp clawed feet as well  but after the lynx all fighting ceased for white fang  there were no more animals with which to fightat least there was none considered worthy of fighting with him  so he remained on exhibition until spring when one tim keenan a farodealer arrived in the land  with him came the first bulldog that had ever entered the klondike  that this dog and white fang should come together was inevitable and for a week the anticipated fight was the mainspring of conversation in certain quarters of the town    chapter ivthe clinging death   beauty smith slipped the chain from his neck and stepped back  for once white fang did not make an immediate attack  he stood still ears pricked forward alert and curious surveying the strange animal that faced him  he had never seen such a dog before  tim keenan shoved the bulldog forward with a muttered go to it  the animal waddled toward the centre of the circle short and squat and ungainly  he came to a stop and blinked across at white fang  there were cries from the crowd of go to him cherokee  sick m cherokee  eat m up  but cherokee did not seem anxious to fight  he turned his head and blinked at the men who shouted at the same time wagging his stump of a tail goodnaturedly  he was not afraid but merely lazy  besides it did not seem to him that it was intended he should fight with the dog he saw before him  he was not used to fighting with that kind of dog and he was waiting for them to bring on the real dog  tim keenan stepped in and bent over cherokee fondling him on both sides of the shoulders with hands that rubbed against the grain of the hair and that made slight pushingforward movements  these were so many suggestions  also their effect was irritating for cherokee began to growl very softly deep down in his throat  there was a correspondence in rhythm between the growls and the movements of the mans hands  the growl rose in the throat with the culmination of each forwardpushing movement and ebbed down to start up afresh with the beginning of the next movement  the end of each movement was the accent of the rhythm the movement ending abruptly and the growling rising with a jerk  this was not without its effect on white fang  the hair began to rise on his neck and across the shoulders  tim keenan gave a final shove forward and stepped back again  as the impetus that carried cherokee forward died down he continued to go forward of his own volition in a swift bowlegged run  then white fang struck  a cry of startled admiration went up  he had covered the distance and gone in more like a cat than a dog and with the same catlike swiftness he had slashed with his fangs and leaped clear  the bulldog was bleeding back of one ear from a rip in his thick neck he gave no sign did not even snarl but turned and followed after white fang  the display on both sides the quickness of the one and the steadiness of the other had excited the partisan spirit of the crowd and the men were making new bets and increasing original bets  again and yet again white fang sprang in slashed and got away untouched and still his strange foe followed after him without too great haste not slowly but deliberately and determinedly in a businesslike sort of way there was purpose in his methodsomething for him to do that he was intent upon doing and from which nothing could distract him  his whole demeanour every action was stamped with this purpose  it puzzled white fang  never had he seen such a dog  it had no hair protection  it was soft and bled easily  there was no thick mat of fur to baffle white fangs teeth as they were often baffled by dogs of his own breed  each time that his teeth struck they sank easily into the yielding flesh while the animal did not seem able to defend itself another disconcerting thing was that it made no outcry such as he had been accustomed to with the other dogs he had fought  beyond a growl or a grunt the dog took its punishment silently  and never did it flag in its pursuit of him  not that cherokee was slow  he could turn and whirl swiftly enough but white fang was never there  cherokee was puzzled too  he had never fought before with a dog with which he could not close  the desire to close had always been mutual  but here was a dog that kept at a distance dancing and dodging here and there and all about  and when it did get its teeth into him it did not hold on but let go instantly and darted away again  but white fang could not get at the soft underside of the throat  the bulldog stood too short while its massive jaws were an added protection  white fang darted in and out unscathed while cherokees wounds increased  both sides of his neck and head were ripped and slashed  he bled freely but showed no signs of being disconcerted  he continued his plodding pursuit though once for the moment baffled he came to a full stop and blinked at the men who looked on at the same time wagging his stump of a tail as an expression of his willingness to fight  in that moment white fang was in upon him and out in passing ripping his trimmed remnant of an ear  with a slight manifestation of anger cherokee took up the pursuit again running on the inside of the circle white fang was making and striving to fasten his deadly grip on white fangs throat  the bulldog missed by a hairsbreadth and cries of praise went up as white fang doubled suddenly out of danger in the opposite direction  the time went by  white fang still danced on dodging and doubling leaping in and out and ever inflicting damage  and still the bulldog with grim certitude toiled after him  sooner or later he would accomplish his purpose get the grip that would win the battle  in the meantime he accepted all the punishment the other could deal him  his tufts of ears had become tassels his neck and shoulders were slashed in a score of places and his very lips were cut and bleedingall from these lightning snaps that were beyond his foreseeing and guarding  time and again white fang had attempted to knock cherokee off his feet but the difference in their height was too great  cherokee was too squat too close to the ground  white fang tried the trick once too often  the chance came in one of his quick doublings and countercirclings  he caught cherokee with head turned away as he whirled more slowly  his shoulder was exposed  white fang drove in upon it but his own shoulder was high above while he struck with such force that his momentum carried him on across over the others body  for the first time in his fighting history men saw white fang lose his footing his body turned a halfsomersault in the air and he would have landed on his back had he not twisted catlike still in the air in the effort to bring his feet to the earth  as it was he struck heavily on his side the next instant he was on his feet but in that instant cherokees teeth closed on his throat  it was not a good grip being too low down toward the chest but cherokee held on  white fang sprang to his feet and tore wildly around trying to shake off the bulldogs body  it made him frantic this clinging dragging weight  it bound his movements restricted his freedom  it was like the trap and all his instinct resented it and revolted against it it was a mad revolt  for several minutes he was to all intents insane the basic life that was in him took charge of him  the will to exist of his body surged over him  he was dominated by this mere fleshlove of life  all intelligence was gone  it was as though he had no brain  his reason was unseated by the blind yearning of the flesh to exist and move at all hazards to move to continue to move for movement was the expression of its existence  round and round he went whirling and turning and reversing trying to shake off the fiftypound weight that dragged at his throat  the bull dog did little but keep his grip  sometimes and rarely he managed to get his feet to the earth and for a moment to brace himself against white fang  but the next moment his footing would be lost and he would be dragging around in the whirl of one of white fangs mad gyrations cherokee identified himself with his instinct  he knew that he was doing the right thing by holding on and there came to him certain blissful thrills of satisfaction  at such moments he even closed his eyes and allowed his body to be hurled hither and thither willynilly careless of any hurt that might thereby come to it  that did not count  the grip was the thing and the grip he kept  white fang ceased only when he had tired himself out  he could do nothing and he could not understand  never in all his fighting had this thing happened  the dogs he had fought with did not fight that way with them it was snap and slash and get away snap and slash and get away  he lay partly on his side panting for breath  cherokee still holding his grip urged against him trying to get him over entirely on his side  white fang resisted and he could feel the jaws shifting their grip slightly relaxing and coming together again in a chewing movement each shift brought the grip closer to his throat  the bulldogs method was to hold what he had and when opportunity favoured to work in for more  opportunity favoured when white fang remained quiet  when white fang struggled cherokee was content merely to hold on  the bulging back of cherokees neck was the only portion of his body that white fangs teeth could reach  he got hold toward the base where the neck comes out from the shoulders but he did not know the chewing method of fighting nor were his jaws adapted to it  he spasmodically ripped and tore with his fangs for a space  then a change in their position diverted him  the bulldog had managed to roll him over on his back and still hanging on to his throat was on top of him  like a cat white fang bowed his hindquarters in and with the feet digging into his enemys abdomen above him he began to claw with long tearingstrokes cherokee might well have been disembowelled had he not quickly pivoted on his grip and got his body off of white fangs and at right angles to it  there was no escaping that grip  it was like fate itself and as inexorable  slowly it shifted up along the jugular  all that saved white fang from death was the loose skin of his neck and the thick fur that covered it  this served to form a large roll in cherokees mouth the fur of which wellnigh defied his teeth  but bit by bit whenever the chance offered he was getting more of the loose skin and fur in his mouth  the result was that he was slowly throttling white fang  the latters breath was drawn with greater and greater difficulty as the moments went by  it began to look as though the battle were over  the backers of cherokee waxed jubilant and offered ridiculous odds  white fangs backers were correspondingly depressed and refused bets of ten to one and twenty to one though one man was rash enough to close a wager of fifty to one this man was beauty smith  he took a step into the ring and pointed his finger at white fang  then he began to laugh derisively and scornfully this produced the desired effect  white fang went wild with rage  he called up his reserves of strength and gained his feet  as he struggled around the ring the fifty pounds of his foe ever dragging on his throat his anger passed on into panic  the basic life of him dominated him again and his intelligence fled before the will of his flesh to live round and round and back again stumbling and falling and rising even uprearing at times on his hindlegs and lifting his foe clear of the earth he struggled vainly to shake off the clinging death  at last he fell toppling backward exhausted and the bulldog promptly shifted his grip getting in closer mangling more and more of the fur folded flesh throttling white fang more severely than ever  shouts of applause went up for the victor and there were many cries of cherokee cherokee  to this cherokee responded by vigorous wagging of the stump of his tail  but the clamour of approval did not distract him  there was no sympathetic relation between his tail and his massive jaws  the one might wag but the others held their terrible grip on white fangs throat  it was at this time that a diversion came to the spectators  there was a jingle of bells  dogmushers cries were heard  everybody save beauty smith looked apprehensively the fear of the police strong upon them but they saw up the trail and not down two men running with sled and dogs  they were evidently coming down the creek from some prospecting trip  at sight of the crowd they stopped their dogs and came over and joined it curious to see the cause of the excitement  the dogmusher wore a moustache but the other a taller and younger man was smooth shaven his skin rosy from the pounding of his blood and the running in the frosty air  white fang had practically ceased struggling  now and again he resisted spasmodically and to no purpose  he could get little air and that little grew less and less under the merciless grip that ever tightened in spite of his armour of fur the great vein of his throat would have long since been torn open had not the first grip of the bulldog been so low down as to be practically on the chest  it had taken cherokee a long time to shift that grip upward and this had also tended further to clog his jaws with fur and skinfold  in the meantime the abysmal brute in beauty smith had been rising into his brain and mastering the small bit of sanity that he possessed at best  when he saw white fangs eyes beginning to glaze he knew beyond doubt that the fight was lost  then he broke loose  he sprang upon white fang and began savagely to kick him  there were hisses from the crowd and cries of protest but that was all  while this went on and beauty smith continued to kick white fang there was a commotion in the crowd  the tall young newcomer was forcing his way through shouldering men right and left without ceremony or gentleness  when he broke through into the ring beauty smith was just in the act of delivering another kick  all his weight was on one foot and he was in a state of unstable equilibrium  at that moment the newcomers fist landed a smashing blow full in his face  beauty smiths remaining leg left the ground and his whole body seemed to lift into the air as he turned over backward and struck the snow  the newcomer turned upon the crowd  you cowards he cried  you beasts  he was in a rage himselfa sane rage  his grey eyes seemed metallic and steellike as they flashed upon the crowd  beauty smith regained his feet and came toward him sniffling and cowardly  the newcomer did not understand  he did not know how abject a coward the other was and thought he was coming back intent on fighting  so with a you beast he smashed beauty smith over backward with a second blow in the face beauty smith decided that the snow was the safest place for him and lay where he had fallen making no effort to get up  come on matt lend a hand the newcomer called the dogmusher who had followed him into the ring  both men bent over the dogs  matt took hold of white fang ready to pull when cherokees jaws should be loosened  this the younger man endeavoured to accomplish by clutching the bulldogs jaws in his hands and trying to spread them  it was a vain undertaking  as he pulled and tugged and wrenched he kept exclaiming with every expulsion of breath beasts  the crowd began to grow unruly and some of the men were protesting against the spoiling of the sport but they were silenced when the newcomer lifted his head from his work for a moment and glared at them  you damn beasts he finally exploded and went back to his task  its no use mr scott you cant break m apart that way matt said at last  the pair paused and surveyed the locked dogs  aint bleedin much matt announced  aint got all the way in yet  but hes liable to any moment scott answered  there did you see that  he shifted his grip in a bit  the younger mans excitement and apprehension for white fang was growing he struck cherokee about the head savagely again and again  but that did not loosen the jaws  cherokee wagged the stump of his tail in advertisement that he understood the meaning of the blows but that he knew he was himself in the right and only doing his duty by keeping his grip  wont some of you help scott cried desperately at the crowd  but no help was offered  instead the crowd began sarcastically to cheer him on and showered him with facetious advice  youll have to get a pry matt counselled  the other reached into the holster at his hip drew his revolver and tried to thrust its muzzle between the bulldogs jaws  he shoved and shoved hard till the grating of the steel against the locked teeth could be distinctly heard  both men were on their knees bending over the dogs  tim keenan strode into the ring  he paused beside scott and touched him on the shoulder saying ominously  dont break them teeth stranger  then ill break his neck scott retorted continuing his shoving and wedging with the revolver muzzle  i said dont break them teeth the farodealer repeated more ominously than before  but if it was a bluff he intended it did not work  scott never desisted from his efforts though he looked up coolly and asked  your dog  the farodealer grunted  then get in here and break this grip  well stranger the other drawled irritatingly i dont mind telling you thats something i aint worked out for myself  i dont know how to turn the trick  then get out of the way was the reply and dont bother me  im busy  tim keenan continued standing over him but scott took no further notice of his presence  he had managed to get the muzzle in between the jaws on one side and was trying to get it out between the jaws on the other side  this accomplished he pried gently and carefully loosening the jaws a bit at a time while matt a bit at a time extricated white fangs mangled neck  stand by to receive your dog was scotts peremptory order to cherokees owner  the farodealer stooped down obediently and got a firm hold on cherokee  now scott warned giving the final pry  the dogs were drawn apart the bulldog struggling vigorously  take him away scott commanded and tim keenan dragged cherokee back into the crowd  white fang made several ineffectual efforts to get up  once he gained his feet but his legs were too weak to sustain him and he slowly wilted and sank back into the snow  his eyes were half closed and the surface of them was glassy  his jaws were apart and through them the tongue protruded draggled and limp  to all appearances he looked like a dog that had been strangled to death  matt examined him  just about all in he announced but hes breathin all right  beauty smith had regained his feet and come over to look at white fang  matt how much is a good sleddog worth scott asked  the dogmusher still on his knees and stooped over white fang calculated for a moment  three hundred dollars he answered  and how much for one thats all chewed up like this one scott asked nudging white fang with his foot  half of that was the dogmushers judgment  scott turned upon beauty smith  did you hear mr beast  im going to take your dog from you and im going to give you a hundred and fifty for him  he opened his pocketbook and counted out the bills  beauty smith put his hands behind his back refusing to touch the proffered money  i aint asellin he said  oh yes you are the other assured him  because im buying  heres your money  the dogs mine  beauty smith his hands still behind him began to back away  scott sprang toward him drawing his fist back to strike  beauty smith cowered down in anticipation of the blow  ive got my rights he whimpered  youve forfeited your rights to own that dog was the rejoinder  are you going to take the money or do i have to hit you again  all right beauty smith spoke up with the alacrity of fear  but i take the money under protest he added  the dogs a mint  i aint a goin to be robbed  a mans got his rights  correct scott answered passing the money over to him  a mans got his rights  but youre not a man  youre a beast  wait till i get back to dawson beauty smith threatened  ill have the law on you  if you open your mouth when you get back to dawson ill have you run out of town  understand  beauty smith replied with a grunt  understand the other thundered with abrupt fierceness  yes beauty smith grunted shrinking away  yes what  yes sir beauty smith snarled  look out  hell bite some one shouted and a guffaw of laughter went up  scott turned his back on him and returned to help the dogmusher who was working over white fang  some of the men were already departing others stood in groups looking on and talking  tim keenan joined one of the groups  whos that mug he asked  weedon scott some one answered  and who in hell is weedon scott the farodealer demanded  oh one of them crackerjack minin experts  hes in with all the big bugs  if you want to keep out of trouble youll steer clear of him thats my talk  hes all hunky with the officials  the gold commissioners a special pal of his  i thought he must be somebody was the farodealers comment  thats why i kept my hands offen him at the start    chapter vthe indomitable   its hopeless weedon scott confessed  he sat on the step of his cabin and stared at the dogmusher who responded with a shrug that was equally hopeless  together they looked at white fang at the end of his stretched chain bristling snarling ferocious straining to get at the sleddogs  having received sundry lessons from matt said lessons being imparted by means of a club the sleddogs had learned to leave white fang alone and even then they were lying down at a distance apparently oblivious of his existence  its a wolf and theres no taming it weedon scott announced  oh i dont know about that matt objected  might be a lot of dog in m for all you can tell  but theres one thing i know sure an that theres no gettin away from  the dogmusher paused and nodded his head confidentially at moosehide mountain  well dont be a miser with what you know scott said sharply after waiting a suitable length of time  spit it out  what is it  the dogmusher indicated white fang with a backward thrust of his thumb  wolf or dog its all the samehes ben tamed ready  no  i tell you yes an broke to harness  look close there  dye see them marks across the chest  youre right matt  he was a sleddog before beauty smith got hold of him  and theres not much reason against his bein a sleddog again  what dye think scott queried eagerly  then the hope died down as he added shaking his head weve had him two weeks now and if anything hes wilder than ever at the present moment  give m a chance matt counselled  turn m loose for a spell  the other looked at him incredulously  yes matt went on i know youve tried to but you didnt take a club  you try it then  the dogmusher secured a club and went over to the chained animal  white fang watched the club after the manner of a caged lion watching the whip of its trainer  see m keep his eye on that club matt said  thats a good sign  hes no fool  dont dast tackle me so long as i got that club handy  hes not clean crazy sure  as the mans hand approached his neck white fang bristled and snarled and crouched down  but while he eyed the approaching hand he at the same time contrived to keep track of the club in the other hand suspended threateningly above him  matt unsnapped the chain from the collar and stepped back  white fang could scarcely realise that he was free  many months had gone by since he passed into the possession of beauty smith and in all that period he had never known a moment of freedom except at the times he had been loosed to fight with other dogs  immediately after such fights he had always been imprisoned again  he did not know what to make of it  perhaps some new devilry of the gods was about to be perpetrated on him  he walked slowly and cautiously prepared to be assailed at any moment  he did not know what to do it was all so unprecedented  he took the precaution to sheer off from the two watching gods and walked carefully to the corner of the cabin nothing happened  he was plainly perplexed and he came back again pausing a dozen feet away and regarding the two men intently  wont he run away his new owner asked  matt shrugged his shoulders  got to take a gamble  only way to find out is to find out  poor devil scott murmured pityingly  what he needs is some show of human kindness he added turning and going into the cabin  he came out with a piece of meat which he tossed to white fang  he sprang away from it and from a distance studied it suspiciously  hiyu major matt shouted warningly but too late  major had made a spring for the meat  at the instant his jaws closed on it white fang struck him  he was overthrown  matt rushed in but quicker than he was white fang  major staggered to his feet but the blood spouting from his throat reddened the snow in a widening path  its too bad but it served him right scott said hastily  but matts foot had already started on its way to kick white fang  there was a leap a flash of teeth a sharp exclamation  white fang snarling fiercely scrambled backward for several yards while matt stooped and investigated his leg  he got me all right he announced pointing to the torn trousers and undercloths and the growing stain of red  i told you it was hopeless matt scott said in a discouraged voice ive thought about it off and on while not wanting to think of it  but weve come to it now  its the only thing to do  as he talked with reluctant movements he drew his revolver threw open the cylinder and assured himself of its contents  look here mr scott matt objected that dogs ben through hell  you cant expect m to come out a white an shinin angel  give m time  look at major the other rejoined  the dogmusher surveyed the stricken dog  he had sunk down on the snow in the circle of his blood and was plainly in the last gasp  served m right  you said so yourself mr scott  he tried to take white fangs meat an hes deado  that was to be expected  i wouldnt give two whoops in hell for a dog that wouldnt fight for his own meat  but look at yourself matt  its all right about the dogs but we must draw the line somewhere  served me right matt argued stubbornly  whatd i want to kick m for  you said yourself that hed done right  then i had no right to kick m  it would be a mercy to kill him scott insisted  hes untamable  now look here mr scott give the poor devil a fightin chance  he aint had no chance yet  hes just come through hell an this is the first time hes ben loose  give m a fair chance an if he dont deliver the goods ill kill m myself  there  god knows i dont want to kill him or have him killed scott answered putting away the revolver  well let him run loose and see what kindness can do for him  and heres a try at it  he walked over to white fang and began talking to him gently and soothingly  better have a club handy matt warned  scott shook his head and went on trying to win white fangs confidence  white fang was suspicious  something was impending  he had killed this gods dog bitten his companion god and what else was to be expected than some terrible punishment  but in the face of it he was indomitable he bristled and showed his teeth his eyes vigilant his whole body wary and prepared for anything  the god had no club so he suffered him to approach quite near  the gods hand had come out and was descending upon his head  white fang shrank together and grew tense as he crouched under it  here was danger some treachery or something  he knew the hands of the gods their proved mastery their cunning to hurt  besides there was his old antipathy to being touched  he snarled more menacingly crouched still lower and still the hand descended  he did not want to bite the hand and he endured the peril of it until his instinct surged up in him mastering him with its insatiable yearning for life  weedon scott had believed that he was quick enough to avoid any snap or slash  but he had yet to learn the remarkable quickness of white fang who struck with the certainty and swiftness of a coiled snake  scott cried out sharply with surprise catching his torn hand and holding it tightly in his other hand  matt uttered a great oath and sprang to his side  white fang crouched down and backed away bristling showing his fangs his eyes malignant with menace  now he could expect a beating as fearful as any he had received from beauty smith  here  what are you doing scott cried suddenly  matt had dashed into the cabin and come out with a rifle  nothin he said slowly with a careless calmness that was assumed only goin to keep that promise i made  i reckon its up to me to kill m as i said id do  no you dont  yes i do  watch me  as matt had pleaded for white fang when he had been bitten it was now weedon scotts turn to plead  you said to give him a chance  well give it to him  weve only just started and we cant quit at the beginning  it served me right this time  andlook at him  white fang near the corner of the cabin and forty feet away was snarling with bloodcurdling viciousness not at scott but at the dog musher  well ill be everlastingly goshswoggled was the dogmushers expression of astonishment  look at the intelligence of him scott went on hastily  he knows the meaning of firearms as well as you do  hes got intelligence and weve got to give that intelligence a chance  put up the gun  all right im willin matt agreed leaning the rifle against the woodpile  but will you look at that he exclaimed the next moment  white fang had quieted down and ceased snarling  this is worth investigatin  watch  matt reached for the rifle and at the same moment white fang snarled he stepped away from the rifle and white fangs lifted lips descended covering his teeth  now just for fun  matt took the rifle and began slowly to raise it to his shoulder  white fangs snarling began with the movement and increased as the movement approached its culmination  but the moment before the rifle came to a level on him he leaped sidewise behind the corner of the cabin  matt stood staring along the sights at the empty space of snow which had been occupied by white fang  the dogmusher put the rifle down solemnly then turned and looked at his employer  i agree with you mr scott  that dogs too intelligent to kill    chapter vithe lovemaster   as white fang watched weedon scott approach he bristled and snarled to advertise that he would not submit to punishment  twentyfour hours had passed since he had slashed open the hand that was now bandaged and held up by a sling to keep the blood out of it  in the past white fang had experienced delayed punishments and he apprehended that such a one was about to befall him  how could it be otherwise  he had committed what was to him sacrilege sunk his fangs into the holy flesh of a god and of a whiteskinned superior god at that  in the nature of things and of intercourse with gods something terrible awaited him  the god sat down several feet away  white fang could see nothing dangerous in that  when the gods administered punishment they stood on their legs  besides this god had no club no whip no firearm  and furthermore he himself was free  no chain nor stick bound him  he could escape into safety while the god was scrambling to his feet  in the meantime he would wait and see  the god remained quiet made no movement and white fangs snarl slowly dwindled to a growl that ebbed down in his throat and ceased  then the god spoke and at the first sound of his voice the hair rose on white fangs neck and the growl rushed up in his throat  but the god made no hostile movement and went on calmly talking  for a time white fang growled in unison with him a correspondence of rhythm being established between growl and voice  but the god talked on interminably  he talked to white fang as white fang had never been talked to before  he talked softly and soothingly with a gentleness that somehow somewhere touched white fang  in spite of himself and all the pricking warnings of his instinct white fang began to have confidence in this god  he had a feeling of security that was belied by all his experience with men  after a long time the god got up and went into the cabin  white fang scanned him apprehensively when he came out  he had neither whip nor club nor weapon  nor was his uninjured hand behind his back hiding something  he sat down as before in the same spot several feet away he held out a small piece of meat  white fang pricked his ears and investigated it suspiciously managing to look at the same time both at the meat and the god alert for any overt act his body tense and ready to spring away at the first sign of hostility  still the punishment delayed  the god merely held near to his nose a piece of meat  and about the meat there seemed nothing wrong  still white fang suspected and though the meat was proffered to him with short inviting thrusts of the hand he refused to touch it  the gods were all wise and there was no telling what masterful treachery lurked behind that apparently harmless piece of meat  in past experience especially in dealing with squaws meat and punishment had often been disastrously related  in the end the god tossed the meat on the snow at white fangs feet  he smelled the meat carefully but he did not look at it  while he smelled it he kept his eyes on the god  nothing happened  he took the meat into his mouth and swallowed it  still nothing happened  the god was actually offering him another piece of meat  again he refused to take it from the hand and again it was tossed to him  this was repeated a number of times  but there came a time when the god refused to toss it he kept it in his hand and steadfastly proffered it  the meat was good meat and white fang was hungry  bit by bit infinitely cautious he approached the hand  at last the time came that he decided to eat the meat from the hand  he never took his eyes from the god thrusting his head forward with ears flattened back and hair involuntarily rising and cresting on his neck  also a low growl rumbled in his throat as warning that he was not to be trifled with  he ate the meat and nothing happened  piece by piece he ate all the meat and nothing happened  still the punishment delayed  he licked his chops and waited  the god went on talking  in his voice was kindnesssomething of which white fang had no experience whatever and within him it aroused feelings which he had likewise never experienced before  he was aware of a certain strange satisfaction as though some need were being gratified as though some void in his being were being filled  then again came the prod of his instinct and the warning of past experience  the gods were ever crafty and they had unguessed ways of attaining their ends  ah he had thought so  there it came now the gods hand cunning to hurt thrusting out at him descending upon his head  but the god went on talking  his voice was soft and soothing  in spite of the menacing hand the voice inspired confidence  and in spite of the assuring voice the hand inspired distrust  white fang was torn by conflicting feelings impulses  it seemed he would fly to pieces so terrible was the control he was exerting holding together by an unwonted indecision the counter forces that struggled within him for mastery  he compromised  he snarled and bristled and flattened his ears  but he neither snapped nor sprang away  the hand descended  nearer and nearer it came  it touched the ends of his upstanding hair  he shrank down under it  it followed down after him pressing more closely against him shrinking almost shivering he still managed to hold himself together it was a torment this hand that touched him and violated his instinct he could not forget in a day all the evil that had been wrought him at the hands of men  but it was the will of the god and he strove to submit  the hand lifted and descended again in a patting caressing movement this continued but every time the hand lifted the hair lifted under it and every time the hand descended the ears flattened down and a cavernous growl surged in his throat  white fang growled and growled with insistent warning  by this means he announced that he was prepared to retaliate for any hurt he might receive  there was no telling when the gods ulterior motive might be disclosed  at any moment that soft confidenceinspiring voice might break forth in a roar of wrath that gentle and caressing hand transform itself into a vicelike grip to hold him helpless and administer punishment  but the god talked on softly and ever the hand rose and fell with non hostile pats  white fang experienced dual feelings  it was distasteful to his instinct  it restrained him opposed the will of him toward personal liberty  and yet it was not physically painful  on the contrary it was even pleasant in a physical way  the patting movement slowly and carefully changed to a rubbing of the ears about their bases and the physical pleasure even increased a little  yet he continued to fear and he stood on guard expectant of unguessed evil alternately suffering and enjoying as one feeling or the other came uppermost and swayed him  well ill be goshswoggled  so spoke matt coming out of the cabin his sleeves rolled up a pan of dirty dishwater in his hands arrested in the act of emptying the pan by the sight of weedon scott patting white fang  at the instant his voice broke the silence white fang leaped back snarling savagely at him  matt regarded his employer with grieved disapproval  if you dont mind my expressin my feelins mr scott ill make free to say youre seventeen kinds of a damn fool an all of em different an then some  weedon scott smiled with a superior air gained his feet and walked over to white fang  he talked soothingly to him but not for long then slowly put out his hand rested it on white fangs head and resumed the interrupted patting  white fang endured it keeping his eyes fixed suspiciously not upon the man that patted him but upon the man that stood in the doorway  you may be a number one tiptop minin expert all right all right the dogmusher delivered himself oracularly but you missed the chance of your life when you was a boy an didnt run off an join a circus  white fang snarled at the sound of his voice but this time did not leap away from under the hand that was caressing his head and the back of his neck with long soothing strokes  it was the beginning of the end for white fangthe ending of the old life and the reign of hate  a new and incomprehensibly fairer life was dawning  it required much thinking and endless patience on the part of weedon scott to accomplish this  and on the part of white fang it required nothing less than a revolution  he had to ignore the urges and promptings of instinct and reason defy experience give the lie to life itself  life as he had known it not only had had no place in it for much that he now did but all the currents had gone counter to those to which he now abandoned himself  in short when all things were considered he had to achieve an orientation far vaster than the one he had achieved at the time he came voluntarily in from the wild and accepted grey beaver as his lord  at that time he was a mere puppy soft from the making without form ready for the thumb of circumstance to begin its work upon him  but now it was different  the thumb of circumstance had done its work only too well  by it he had been formed and hardened into the fighting wolf fierce and implacable unloving and unlovable  to accomplish the change was like a reflux of being and this when the plasticity of youth was no longer his when the fibre of him had become tough and knotty when the warp and the woof of him had made of him an adamantine texture harsh and unyielding when the face of his spirit had become iron and all his instincts and axioms had crystallised into set rules cautions dislikes and desires  yet again in this new orientation it was the thumb of circumstance that pressed and prodded him softening that which had become hard and remoulding it into fairer form  weedon scott was in truth this thumb  he had gone to the roots of white fangs nature and with kindness touched to life potencies that had languished and wellnigh perished  one such potency was love  it took the place of like which latter had been the highest feeling that thrilled him in his intercourse with the gods  but this love did not come in a day  it began with like and out of it slowly developed  white fang did not run away though he was allowed to remain loose because he liked this new god  this was certainly better than the life he had lived in the cage of beauty smith and it was necessary that he should have some god  the lordship of man was a need of his nature  the seal of his dependence on man had been set upon him in that early day when he turned his back on the wild and crawled to grey beavers feet to receive the expected beating  this seal had been stamped upon him again and ineradicably on his second return from the wild when the long famine was over and there was fish once more in the village of grey beaver  and so because he needed a god and because he preferred weedon scott to beauty smith white fang remained  in acknowledgment of fealty he proceeded to take upon himself the guardianship of his masters property he prowled about the cabin while the sleddogs slept and the first night visitor to the cabin fought him off with a club until weedon scott came to the rescue  but white fang soon learned to differentiate between thieves and honest men to appraise the true value of step and carriage the man who travelled loudstepping the direct line to the cabin door he let alonethough he watched him vigilantly until the door opened and he received the endorsement of the master  but the man who went softly by circuitous ways peering with caution seeking after secrecythat was the man who received no suspension of judgment from white fang and who went away abruptly hurriedly and without dignity  weedon scott had set himself the task of redeeming white fangor rather of redeeming mankind from the wrong it had done white fang  it was a matter of principle and conscience  he felt that the ill done white fang was a debt incurred by man and that it must be paid  so he went out of his way to be especially kind to the fighting wolf  each day he made it a point to caress and pet white fang and to do it at length  at first suspicious and hostile white fang grew to like this petting but there was one thing that he never outgrewhis growling  growl he would from the moment the petting began till it ended  but it was a growl with a new note in it  a stranger could not hear this note and to such a stranger the growling of white fang was an exhibition of primordial savagery nerveracking and bloodcurdling  but white fangs throat had become harshfibred from the making of ferocious sounds through the many years since his first little rasp of anger in the lair of his cubhood and he could not soften the sounds of that throat now to express the gentleness he felt  nevertheless weedon scotts ear and sympathy were fine enough to catch the new note all but drowned in the fiercenessthe note that was the faintest hint of a croon of content and that none but he could hear  as the days went by the evolution of like into love was accelerated white fang himself began to grow aware of it though in his consciousness he knew not what love was  it manifested itself to him as a void in his beinga hungry aching yearning void that clamoured to be filled  it was a pain and an unrest and it received easement only by the touch of the new gods presence  at such times love was joy to him a wild keen thrilling satisfaction  but when away from his god the pain and the unrest returned the void in him sprang up and pressed against him with its emptiness and the hunger gnawed and gnawed unceasingly  white fang was in the process of finding himself  in spite of the maturity of his years and of the savage rigidity of the mould that had formed him his nature was undergoing an expansion  there was a burgeoning within him of strange feelings and unwonted impulses  his old code of conduct was changing  in the past he had liked comfort and surcease from pain disliked discomfort and pain and he had adjusted his actions accordingly  but now it was different  because of this new feeling within him he ofttimes elected discomfort and pain for the sake of his god  thus in the early morning instead of roaming and foraging or lying in a sheltered nook he would wait for hours on the cheerless cabinstoop for a sight of the gods face  at night when the god returned home white fang would leave the warm sleepingplace he had burrowed in the snow in order to receive the friendly snap of fingers and the word of greeting  meat even meat itself he would forego to be with his god to receive a caress from him or to accompany him down into the town  like had been replaced by love  and love was the plummet dropped down into the deeps of him where like had never gone  and responsive out of his deeps had come the new thinglove  that which was given unto him did he return  this was a god indeed a lovegod a warm and radiant god in whose light white fangs nature expanded as a flower expands under the sun  but white fang was not demonstrative  he was too old too firmly moulded to become adept at expressing himself in new ways  he was too selfpossessed too strongly poised in his own isolation  too long had he cultivated reticence aloofness and moroseness  he had never barked in his life and he could not now learn to bark a welcome when his god approached  he was never in the way never extravagant nor foolish in the expression of his love  he never ran to meet his god  he waited at a distance but he always waited was always there  his love partook of the nature of worship dumb inarticulate a silent adoration  only by the steady regard of his eyes did he express his love and by the unceasing following with his eyes of his gods every movement  also at times when his god looked at him and spoke to him he betrayed an awkward selfconsciousness caused by the struggle of his love to express itself and his physical inability to express it  he learned to adjust himself in many ways to his new mode of life  it was borne in upon him that he must let his masters dogs alone  yet his dominant nature asserted itself and he had first to thrash them into an acknowledgment of his superiority and leadership  this accomplished he had little trouble with them  they gave trail to him when he came and went or walked among them and when he asserted his will they obeyed  in the same way he came to tolerate mattas a possession of his master his master rarely fed him  matt did that it was his business yet white fang divined that it was his masters food he ate and that it was his master who thus fed him vicariously  matt it was who tried to put him into the harness and make him haul sled with the other dogs  but matt failed  it was not until weedon scott put the harness on white fang and worked him that he understood  he took it as his masters will that matt should drive him and work him just as he drove and worked his masters other dogs  different from the mackenzie toboggans were the klondike sleds with runners under them  and different was the method of driving the dogs there was no fanformation of the team  the dogs worked in single file one behind another hauling on double traces  and here in the klondike the leader was indeed the leader  the wisest as well as strongest dog was the leader and the team obeyed him and feared him  that white fang should quickly gain this post was inevitable  he could not be satisfied with less as matt learned after much inconvenience and trouble  white fang picked out the post for himself and matt backed his judgment with strong language after the experiment had been tried  but though he worked in the sled in the day white fang did not forego the guarding of his masters property in the night  thus he was on duty all the time ever vigilant and faithful the most valuable of all the dogs  makin free to spit out whats in me matt said one day i beg to state that you was a wise guy all right when you paid the price you did for that dog  you clean swindled beauty smith on top of pushin his face in with your fist  a recrudescence of anger glinted in weedon scotts grey eyes and he muttered savagely the beast  in the late spring a great trouble came to white fang  without warning the lovemaster disappeared  there had been warning but white fang was unversed in such things and did not understand the packing of a grip  he remembered afterwards that his packing had preceded the masters disappearance but at the time he suspected nothing  that night he waited for the master to return  at midnight the chill wind that blew drove him to shelter at the rear of the cabin  there he drowsed only half asleep his ears keyed for the first sound of the familiar step but at two in the morning his anxiety drove him out to the cold front stoop where he crouched and waited  but no master came  in the morning the door opened and matt stepped outside  white fang gazed at him wistfully  there was no common speech by which he might learn what he wanted to know  the days came and went but never the master  white fang who had never known sickness in his life became sick  he became very sick so sick that matt was finally compelled to bring him inside the cabin  also in writing to his employer matt devoted a postscript to white fang  weedon scott reading the letter down in circle city came upon the following  that dam wolf wont work  wont eat  aint got no spunk left  all the dogs is licking him  wants to know what has become of you and i dont know how to tell him  mebbe he is going to die  it was as matt had said  white fang had ceased eating lost heart and allowed every dog of the team to thrash him  in the cabin he lay on the floor near the stove without interest in food in matt nor in life matt might talk gently to him or swear at him it was all the same he never did more than turn his dull eyes upon the man then drop his head back to its customary position on his forepaws  and then one night matt reading to himself with moving lips and mumbled sounds was startled by a low whine from white fang  he had got upon his feet his ears cocked towards the door and he was listening intently  a moment later matt heard a footstep  the door opened and weedon scott stepped in  the two men shook hands  then scott looked around the room  wheres the wolf he asked  then he discovered him standing where he had been lying near to the stove  he had not rushed forward after the manner of other dogs  he stood watching and waiting  holy smoke matt exclaimed  look at m wag his tail  weedon scott strode half across the room toward him at the same time calling him  white fang came to him not with a great bound yet quickly  he was awakened from selfconsciousness but as he drew near his eyes took on a strange expression  something an incommunicable vastness of feeling rose up into his eyes as a light and shone forth  he never looked at me that way all the time you was gone matt commented  weedon scott did not hear  he was squatting down on his heels face to face with white fang and petting himrubbing at the roots of the ears making long caressing strokes down the neck to the shoulders tapping the spine gently with the balls of his fingers  and white fang was growling responsively the crooning note of the growl more pronounced than ever  but that was not all  what of his joy the great love in him ever surging and struggling to express itself succeeding in finding a new mode of expression  he suddenly thrust his head forward and nudged his way in between the masters arm and body  and here confined hidden from view all except his ears no longer growling he continued to nudge and snuggle  the two men looked at each other  scotts eyes were shining  gosh said matt in an awestricken voice  a moment later when he had recovered himself he said i always insisted that wolf was a dog  look at m  with the return of the lovemaster white fangs recovery was rapid  two nights and a day he spent in the cabin  then he sallied forth  the sled dogs had forgotten his prowess  they remembered only the latest which was his weakness and sickness  at the sight of him as he came out of the cabin they sprang upon him  talk about your roughhouses matt murmured gleefully standing in the doorway and looking on  give m hell you wolf  give m hellan then some  white fang did not need the encouragement  the return of the lovemaster was enough  life was flowing through him again splendid and indomitable  he fought from sheer joy finding in it an expression of much that he felt and that otherwise was without speech  there could be but one ending  the team dispersed in ignominious defeat and it was not until after dark that the dogs came sneaking back one by one by meekness and humility signifying their fealty to white fang  having learned to snuggle white fang was guilty of it often  it was the final word  he could not go beyond it  the one thing of which he had always been particularly jealous was his head  he had always disliked to have it touched  it was the wild in him the fear of hurt and of the trap that had given rise to the panicky impulses to avoid contacts  it was the mandate of his instinct that that head must be free  and now with the lovemaster his snuggling was the deliberate act of putting himself into a position of hopeless helplessness  it was an expression of perfect confidence of absolute selfsurrender as though he said i put myself into thy hands  work thou thy will with me  one night not long after the return scott and matt sat at a game of cribbage preliminary to going to bed  fifteentwo fifteenfour an a pair makes six mat was pegging up when there was an outcry and sound of snarling without  they looked at each other as they started to rise to their feet  the wolfs nailed somebody matt said  a wild scream of fear and anguish hastened them  bring a light scott shouted as he sprang outside  matt followed with the lamp and by its light they saw a man lying on his back in the snow  his arms were folded one above the other across his face and throat  thus he was trying to shield himself from white fangs teeth  and there was need for it  white fang was in a rage wickedly making his attack on the most vulnerable spot  from shoulder to wrist of the crossed arms the coatsleeve blue flannel shirt and undershirt were ripped in rags while the arms themselves were terribly slashed and streaming blood  all this the two men saw in the first instant  the next instant weedon scott had white fang by the throat and was dragging him clear  white fang struggled and snarled but made no attempt to bite while he quickly quieted down at a sharp word from the master  matt helped the man to his feet  as he arose he lowered his crossed arms exposing the bestial face of beauty smith  the dogmusher let go of him precipitately with action similar to that of a man who has picked up live fire  beauty smith blinked in the lamplight and looked about him  he caught sight of white fang and terror rushed into his face  at the same moment matt noticed two objects lying in the snow  he held the lamp close to them indicating them with his toe for his employers benefita steel dogchain and a stout club  weedon scott saw and nodded  not a word was spoken  the dogmusher laid his hand on beauty smiths shoulder and faced him to the right about  no word needed to be spoken  beauty smith started  in the meantime the lovemaster was patting white fang and talking to him  tried to steal you eh  and you wouldnt have it  well well he made a mistake didnt he  must a thought he had hold of seventeen devils the dogmusher sniggered  white fang still wrought up and bristling growled and growled the hair slowly lying down the crooning note remote and dim but growing in his throat     part v   chapter ithe long trail   it was in the air  white fang sensed the coming calamity even before there was tangible evidence of it  in vague ways it was borne in upon him that a change was impending  he knew not how nor why yet he got his feel of the oncoming event from the gods themselves  in ways subtler than they knew they betrayed their intentions to the wolfdog that haunted the cabinstoop and that though he never came inside the cabin knew what went on inside their brains  listen to that will you the dugmusher exclaimed at supper one night  weedon scott listened  through the door came a low anxious whine like a sobbing under the breath that had just grown audible  then came the long sniff as white fang reassured himself that his god was still inside and had not yet taken himself off in mysterious and solitary flight  i do believe that wolfs on to you the dogmusher said  weedon scott looked across at his companion with eyes that almost pleaded though this was given the lie by his words  what the devil can i do with a wolf in california he demanded  thats what i say matt answered  what the devil can you do with a wolf in california  but this did not satisfy weedon scott  the other seemed to be judging him in a noncommittal sort of way  white mans dogs would have no show against him scott went on  hed kill them on sight  if he didnt bankrupt me with damaged suits the authorities would take him away from me and electrocute him  hes a downright murderer i know was the dogmushers comment  weedon scott looked at him suspiciously  it would never do he said decisively  it would never do matt concurred  why youd have to hire a man specially to take care of m  the other suspicion was allayed  he nodded cheerfully  in the silence that followed the low halfsobbing whine was heard at the door and then the long questing sniff  theres no denyin he thinks a hell of a lot of you matt said  the other glared at him in sudden wrath  damn it all man  i know my own mind and whats best  im agreein with you only      only what scott snapped out  only     the dogmusher began softly then changed his mind and betrayed a rising anger of his own  well you neednt get so allfired het up about it  judgin by your actions oned think you didnt know your own mind  weedon scott debated with himself for a while and then said more gently you are right matt  i dont know my own mind and thats whats the trouble  why it would be rank ridiculousness for me to take that dog along he broke out after another pause  im agreein with you was matts answer and again his employer was not quite satisfied with him  but how in the name of the great sardanapolis he knows youre goin is what gets me the dogmusher continued innocently  its beyond me matt scott answered with a mournful shake of the head  then came the day when through the open cabin door white fang saw the fatal grip on the floor and the lovemaster packing things into it  also there were comings and goings and the erstwhile placid atmosphere of the cabin was vexed with strange perturbations and unrest  here was indubitable evidence  white fang had already scented it  he now reasoned it  his god was preparing for another flight  and since he had not taken him with him before so now he could look to be left behind  that night he lifted the long wolfhowl  as he had howled in his puppy days when he fled back from the wild to the village to find it vanished and naught but a rubbishheap to mark the site of grey beavers tepee so now he pointed his muzzle to the cold stars and told to them his woe  inside the cabin the two men had just gone to bed  hes gone off his food again matt remarked from his bunk  there was a grunt from weedon scotts bunk and a stir of blankets  from the way he cut up the other time you went away i wouldnt wonder this time but what he died  the blankets in the other bunk stirred irritably  oh shut up scott cried out through the darkness  you nag worse than a woman  im agreein with you the dogmusher answered and weedon scott was not quite sure whether or not the other had snickered  the next day white fangs anxiety and restlessness were even more pronounced  he dogged his masters heels whenever he left the cabin and haunted the front stoop when he remained inside  through the open door he could catch glimpses of the luggage on the floor  the grip had been joined by two large canvas bags and a box  matt was rolling the masters blankets and fur robe inside a small tarpaulin  white fang whined as he watched the operation  later on two indians arrived  he watched them closely as they shouldered the luggage and were led off down the hill by matt who carried the bedding and the grip  but white fang did not follow them  the master was still in the cabin  after a time matt returned  the master came to the door and called white fang inside  you poor devil he said gently rubbing white fangs ears and tapping his spine  im hitting the long trail old man where you cannot follow  now give me a growlthe last good goodbye growl  but white fang refused to growl  instead and after a wistful searching look he snuggled in burrowing his head out of sight between the masters arm and body  there she blows matt cried  from the yukon arose the hoarse bellowing of a river steamboat  youve got to cut it short  be sure and lock the front door  ill go out the back  get a move on  the two doors slammed at the same moment and weedon scott waited for matt to come around to the front  from inside the door came a low whining and sobbing  then there were long deepdrawn sniffs  you must take good care of him matt scott said as they started down the hill  write and let me know how he gets along  sure the dogmusher answered  but listen to that will you  both men stopped  white fang was howling as dogs howl when their masters lie dead  he was voicing an utter woe his cry bursting upward in great heartbreaking rushes dying down into quavering misery and bursting upward again with a rush upon rush of grief  the aurora was the first steamboat of the year for the outside and her decks were jammed with prosperous adventurers and broken gold seekers all equally as mad to get to the outside as they had been originally to get to the inside  near the gangplank scott was shaking hands with matt who was preparing to go ashore  but matts hand went limp in the others grasp as his gaze shot past and remained fixed on something behind him  scott turned to see  sitting on the deck several feet away and watching wistfully was white fang  the dogmusher swore softly in awestricken accents  scott could only look in wonder  did you lock the front door matt demanded  the other nodded and asked how about the back  you just bet i did was the fervent reply  white fang flattened his ears ingratiatingly but remained where he was making no attempt to approach  ill have to take m ashore with me  matt made a couple of steps toward white fang but the latter slid away from him  the dogmusher made a rush of it and white fang dodged between the legs of a group of men  ducking turning doubling he slid about the deck eluding the others efforts to capture him  but when the lovemaster spoke white fang came to him with prompt obedience  wont come to the hand thats fed m all these months the dogmusher muttered resentfully  and youyou aint never fed m after them first days of gettin acquainted  im blamed if i can see how he works it out that youre the boss  scott who had been patting white fang suddenly bent closer and pointed out freshmade cuts on his muzzle and a gash between the eyes  matt bent over and passed his hand along white fangs belly  we plump forgot the window  hes all cut an gouged underneath  must a butted clean through it bgosh  but weedon scott was not listening  he was thinking rapidly  the auroras whistle hooted a final announcement of departure  men were scurrying down the gangplank to the shore  matt loosened the bandana from his own neck and started to put it around white fangs  scott grasped the dogmushers hand  goodbye matt old man  about the wolfyou neednt write  you see ive      what the dogmusher exploded  you dont mean to say     the very thing i mean  heres your bandana  ill write to you about him  matt paused halfway down the gangplank  hell never stand the climate he shouted back  unless you clip m in warm weather  the gangplank was hauled in and the aurora swung out from the bank weedon scott waved a last goodbye  then he turned and bent over white fang standing by his side  now growl damn you growl he said as he patted the responsive head and rubbed the flattening ears    chapter iithe southland   white fang landed from the steamer in san francisco  he was appalled deep in him below any reasoning process or act of consciousness he had associated power with godhead  and never had the white men seemed such marvellous gods as now when he trod the slimy pavement of san francisco the log cabins he had known were replaced by towering buildings  the streets were crowded with perilswaggons carts automobiles great straining horses pulling huge trucks and monstrous cable and electric cars hooting and clanging through the midst screeching their insistent menace after the manner of the lynxes he had known in the northern woods  all this was the manifestation of power  through it all behind it all was man governing and controlling expressing himself as of old by his mastery over matter  it was colossal stunning  white fang was awed fear sat upon him  as in his cubhood he had been made to feel his smallness and puniness on the day he first came in from the wild to the village of grey beaver so now in his fullgrown stature and pride of strength he was made to feel small and puny  and there were so many gods  he was made dizzy by the swarming of them  the thunder of the streets smote upon his ears  he was bewildered by the tremendous and endless rush and movement of things  as never before he felt his dependence on the lovemaster close at whose heels he followed no matter what happened never losing sight of him  but white fang was to have no more than a nightmare vision of the cityan experience that was like a bad dream unreal and terrible that haunted him for long after in his dreams  he was put into a baggagecar by the master chained in a corner in the midst of heaped trunks and valises here a squat and brawny god held sway with much noise hurling trunks and boxes about dragging them in through the door and tossing them into the piles or flinging them out of the door smashing and crashing to other gods who awaited them  and here in this inferno of luggage was white fang deserted by the master  or at least white fang thought he was deserted until he smelled out the masters canvas clothesbags alongside of him and proceeded to mount guard over them  bout time you come growled the god of the car an hour later when weedon scott appeared at the door  that dog of yourn wont let me lay a finger on your stuff  white fang emerged from the car  he was astonished  the nightmare city was gone  the car had been to him no more than a room in a house and when he had entered it the city had been all around him  in the interval the city had disappeared  the roar of it no longer dinned upon his ears before him was smiling country streaming with sunshine lazy with quietude  but he had little time to marvel at the transformation  he accepted it as he accepted all the unaccountable doings and manifestations of the gods  it was their way  there was a carriage waiting  a man and a woman approached the master the womans arms went out and clutched the master around the necka hostile act  the next moment weedon scott had torn loose from the embrace and closed with white fang who had become a snarling raging demon  its all right mother scott was saying as he kept tight hold of white fang and placated him  he thought you were going to injure me and he wouldnt stand for it  its all right  its all right  hell learn soon enough  and in the meantime i may be permitted to love my son when his dog is not around she laughed though she was pale and weak from the fright  she looked at white fang who snarled and bristled and glared malevolently  hell have to learn and he shall without postponement scott said  he spoke softly to white fang until he had quieted him then his voice became firm  down sir  down with you  this had been one of the things taught him by the master and white fang obeyed though he lay down reluctantly and sullenly  now mother  scott opened his arms to her but kept his eyes on white fang  down he warned  down  white fang bristling silently halfcrouching as he rose sank back and watched the hostile act repeated  but no harm came of it nor of the embrace from the strange mangod that followed  then the clothesbags were taken into the carriage the strange gods and the lovemaster followed and white fang pursued now running vigilantly behind now bristling up to the running horses and warning them that he was there to see that no harm befell the god they dragged so swiftly across the earth  at the end of fifteen minutes the carriage swung in through a stone gateway and on between a double row of arched and interlacing walnut trees  on either side stretched lawns their broad sweep broken here and there by great sturdylimbed oaks  in the near distance in contrast with the younggreen of the tended grass sunburnt hayfields showed tan and gold while beyond were the tawny hills and upland pastures  from the head of the lawn on the first soft swell from the valleylevel looked down the deepporched manywindowed house  little opportunity was given white fang to see all this  hardly had the carriage entered the grounds when he was set upon by a sheepdog bright eyed sharpmuzzled righteously indignant and angry  it was between him and the master cutting him off  white fang snarled no warning but his hair bristled as he made his silent and deadly rush  this rush was never completed  he halted with awkward abruptness with stiff forelegs bracing himself against his momentum almost sitting down on his haunches so desirous was he of avoiding contact with the dog he was in the act of attacking  it was a female and the law of his kind thrust a barrier between  for him to attack her would require nothing less than a violation of his instinct  but with the sheepdog it was otherwise  being a female she possessed no such instinct  on the other hand being a sheepdog her instinctive fear of the wild and especially of the wolf was unusually keen  white fang was to her a wolf the hereditary marauder who had preyed upon her flocks from the time sheep were first herded and guarded by some dim ancestor of hers  and so as he abandoned his rush at her and braced himself to avoid the contact she sprang upon him  he snarled involuntarily as he felt her teeth in his shoulder but beyond this made no offer to hurt her  he backed away stifflegged with selfconsciousness and tried to go around her  he dodged this way and that and curved and turned but to no purpose  she remained always between him and the way he wanted to go  here collie called the strange man in the carriage  weedon scott laughed  never mind father  it is good discipline  white fang will have to learn many things and its just as well that he begins now  hell adjust himself all right  the carriage drove on and still collie blocked white fangs way  he tried to outrun her by leaving the drive and circling across the lawn but she ran on the inner and smaller circle and was always there facing him with her two rows of gleaming teeth  back he circled across the drive to the other lawn and again she headed him off  the carriage was bearing the master away  white fang caught glimpses of it disappearing amongst the trees  the situation was desperate  he essayed another circle  she followed running swiftly  and then suddenly he turned upon her  it was his old fighting trick  shoulder to shoulder he struck her squarely  not only was she overthrown  so fast had she been running that she rolled along now on her back now on her side as she struggled to stop clawing gravel with her feet and crying shrilly her hurt pride and indignation  white fang did not wait  the way was clear and that was all he had wanted  she took after him never ceasing her outcry  it was the straightaway now and when it came to real running white fang could teach her things  she ran frantically hysterically straining to the utmost advertising the effort she was making with every leap and all the time white fang slid smoothly away from her silently without effort gliding like a ghost over the ground  as he rounded the house to the portecochere he came upon the carriage  it had stopped and the master was alighting  at this moment still running at top speed white fang became suddenly aware of an attack from the side  it was a deerhound rushing upon him  white fang tried to face it  but he was going too fast and the hound was too close  it struck him on the side and such was his forward momentum and the unexpectedness of it white fang was hurled to the ground and rolled clear over  he came out of the tangle a spectacle of malignancy ears flattened back lips writhing nose wrinkling his teeth clipping together as the fangs barely missed the hounds soft throat  the master was running up but was too far away and it was collie that saved the hounds life  before white fang could spring in and deliver the fatal stroke and just as he was in the act of springing in collie arrived  she had been outmanoeuvred and outrun to say nothing of her having been unceremoniously tumbled in the gravel and her arrival was like that of a tornadomade up of offended dignity justifiable wrath and instinctive hatred for this marauder from the wild  she struck white fang at right angles in the midst of his spring and again he was knocked off his feet and rolled over  the next moment the master arrived and with one hand held white fang while the father called off the dogs  i say this is a pretty warm reception for a poor lone wolf from the arctic the master said while white fang calmed down under his caressing hand  in all his life hes only been known once to go off his feet and here hes been rolled twice in thirty seconds  the carriage had driven away and other strange gods had appeared from out the house  some of these stood respectfully at a distance but two of them women perpetrated the hostile act of clutching the master around the neck  white fang however was beginning to tolerate this act  no harm seemed to come of it while the noises the gods made were certainly not threatening  these gods also made overtures to white fang but he warned them off with a snarl and the master did likewise with word of mouth  at such times white fang leaned in close against the masters legs and received reassuring pats on the head  the hound under the command dick  lie down sir had gone up the steps and lain down to one side of the porch still growling and keeping a sullen watch on the intruder  collie had been taken in charge by one of the womangods who held arms around her neck and petted and caressed her but collie was very much perplexed and worried whining and restless outraged by the permitted presence of this wolf and confident that the gods were making a mistake  all the gods started up the steps to enter the house  white fang followed closely at the masters heels  dick on the porch growled and white fang on the steps bristled and growled back  take collie inside and leave the two of them to fight it out suggested scotts father  after that theyll be friends  then white fang to show his friendship will have to be chief mourner at the funeral laughed the master  the elder scott looked incredulously first at white fang then at dick and finally at his son  you mean     weedon nodded his head  i mean just that  youd have a dead dick inside one minutetwo minutes at the farthest  he turned to white fang  come on you wolf  its you thatll have to come inside  white fang walked stifflegged up the steps and across the porch with tail rigidly erect keeping his eyes on dick to guard against a flank attack and at the same time prepared for whatever fierce manifestation of the unknown that might pounce out upon him from the interior of the house  but no thing of fear pounced out and when he had gained the inside he scouted carefully around looking at it and finding it not then he lay down with a contented grunt at the masters feet observing all that went on ever ready to spring to his feet and fight for life with the terrors he felt must lurk under the traproof of the dwelling    chapter iiithe gods domain   not only was white fang adaptable by nature but he had travelled much and knew the meaning and necessity of adjustment  here in sierra vista which was the name of judge scotts place white fang quickly began to make himself at home  he had no further serious trouble with the dogs they knew more about the ways of the southland gods than did he and in their eyes he had qualified when he accompanied the gods inside the house  wolf that he was and unprecedented as it was the gods had sanctioned his presence and they the dogs of the gods could only recognise this sanction  dick perforce had to go through a few stiff formalities at first after which he calmly accepted white fang as an addition to the premises  had dick had his way they would have been good friends  all but white fang was averse to friendship  all he asked of other dogs was to be let alone  his whole life he had kept aloof from his kind and he still desired to keep aloof  dicks overtures bothered him so he snarled dick away  in the north he had learned the lesson that he must let the masters dogs alone and he did not forget that lesson now  but he insisted on his own privacy and selfseclusion and so thoroughly ignored dick that that goodnatured creature finally gave him up and scarcely took as much interest in him as in the hitchingpost near the stable  not so with collie  while she accepted him because it was the mandate of the gods that was no reason that she should leave him in peace  woven into her being was the memory of countless crimes he and his had perpetrated against her ancestry  not in a day nor a generation were the ravaged sheepfolds to be forgotten  all this was a spur to her pricking her to retaliation  she could not fly in the face of the gods who permitted him but that did not prevent her from making life miserable for him in petty ways  a feud ages old was between them and she for one would see to it that he was reminded  so collie took advantage of her sex to pick upon white fang and maltreat him  his instinct would not permit him to attack her while her persistence would not permit him to ignore her  when she rushed at him he turned his furprotected shoulder to her sharp teeth and walked away stifflegged and stately  when she forced him too hard he was compelled to go about in a circle his shoulder presented to her his head turned from her and on his face and in his eyes a patient and bored expression sometimes however a nip on his hindquarters hastened his retreat and made it anything but stately  but as a rule he managed to maintain a dignity that was almost solemnity  he ignored her existence whenever it was possible and made it a point to keep out of her way  when he saw or heard her coming he got up and walked off  there was much in other matters for white fang to learn  life in the northland was simplicity itself when compared with the complicated affairs of sierra vista  first of all he had to learn the family of the master  in a way he was prepared to do this  as mitsah and klookooch had belonged to grey beaver sharing his food his fire and his blankets so now at sierra vista belonged to the lovemaster all the denizens of the house  but in this matter there was a difference and many differences  sierra vista was a far vaster affair than the tepee of grey beaver  there were many persons to be considered  there was judge scott and there was his wife  there were the masters two sisters beth and mary  there was his wife alice and then there were his children weedon and maud toddlers of four and six  there was no way for anybody to tell him about all these people and of bloodties and relationship he knew nothing whatever and never would be capable of knowing  yet he quickly worked it out that all of them belonged to the master  then by observation whenever opportunity offered by study of action speech and the very intonations of the voice he slowly learned the intimacy and the degree of favour they enjoyed with the master  and by this ascertained standard white fang treated them accordingly  what was of value to the master he valued what was dear to the master was to be cherished by white fang and guarded carefully  thus it was with the two children  all his life he had disliked children  he hated and feared their hands  the lessons were not tender that he had learned of their tyranny and cruelty in the days of the indian villages  when weedon and maud had first approached him he growled warningly and looked malignant  a cuff from the master and a sharp word had then compelled him to permit their caresses though he growled and growled under their tiny hands and in the growl there was no crooning note  later he observed that the boy and girl were of great value in the masters eyes  then it was that no cuff nor sharp word was necessary before they could pat him  yet white fang was never effusively affectionate  he yielded to the masters children with an ill but honest grace and endured their fooling as one would endure a painful operation  when he could no longer endure he would get up and stalk determinedly away from them  but after a time he grew even to like the children  still he was not demonstrative  he would not go up to them  on the other hand instead of walking away at sight of them he waited for them to come to him  and still later it was noticed that a pleased light came into his eyes when he saw them approaching and that he looked after them with an appearance of curious regret when they left him for other amusements  all this was a matter of development and took time  next in his regard after the children was judge scott  there were two reasons possibly for this  first he was evidently a valuable possession of the masters and next he was undemonstrative  white fang liked to lie at his feet on the wide porch when he read the newspaper from time to time favouring white fang with a look or a worduntroublesome tokens that he recognised white fangs presence and existence  but this was only when the master was not around  when the master appeared all other beings ceased to exist so far as white fang was concerned  white fang allowed all the members of the family to pet him and make much of him but he never gave to them what he gave to the master  no caress of theirs could put the lovecroon into his throat and try as they would they could never persuade him into snuggling against them  this expression of abandon and surrender of absolute trust he reserved for the master alone  in fact he never regarded the members of the family in any other light than possessions of the lovemaster  also white fang had early come to differentiate between the family and the servants of the household  the latter were afraid of him while he merely refrained from attacking them  this because he considered that they were likewise possessions of the master  between white fang and them existed a neutrality and no more  they cooked for the master and washed the dishes and did other things just as matt had done up in the klondike  they were in short appurtenances of the household  outside the household there was even more for white fang to learn  the masters domain was wide and complex yet it had its metes and bounds the land itself ceased at the county road  outside was the common domain of all godsthe roads and streets  then inside other fences were the particular domains of other gods  a myriad laws governed all these things and determined conduct yet he did not know the speech of the gods nor was there any way for him to learn save by experience  he obeyed his natural impulses until they ran him counter to some law  when this had been done a few times he learned the law and after that observed it  but most potent in his education was the cuff of the masters hand the censure of the masters voice  because of white fangs very great love a cuff from the master hurt him far more than any beating grey beaver or beauty smith had ever given him  they had hurt only the flesh of him beneath the flesh the spirit had still raged splendid and invincible but with the master the cuff was always too light to hurt the flesh  yet it went deeper  it was an expression of the masters disapproval and white fangs spirit wilted under it  in point of fact the cuff was rarely administered  the masters voice was sufficient  by it white fang knew whether he did right or not  by it he trimmed his conduct and adjusted his actions  it was the compass by which he steered and learned to chart the manners of a new land and life  in the northland the only domesticated animal was the dog  all other animals lived in the wild and were when not too formidable lawful spoil for any dog  all his days white fang had foraged among the live things for food  it did not enter his head that in the southland it was otherwise  but this he was to learn early in his residence in santa clara valley  sauntering around the corner of the house in the early morning he came upon a chicken that had escaped from the chickenyard white fangs natural impulse was to eat it  a couple of bounds a flash of teeth and a frightened squawk and he had scooped in the adventurous fowl  it was farmbred and fat and tender and white fang licked his chops and decided that such fare was good  later in the day he chanced upon another stray chicken near the stables one of the grooms ran to the rescue  he did not know white fangs breed so for weapon he took a light buggywhip  at the first cut of the whip white fang left the chicken for the man  a club might have stopped white fang but not a whip  silently without flinching he took a second cut in his forward rush and as he leaped for the throat the groom cried out my god and staggered backward  he dropped the whip and shielded his throat with his arms  in consequence his forearm was ripped open to the bone  the man was badly frightened  it was not so much white fangs ferocity as it was his silence that unnerved the groom  still protecting his throat and face with his torn and bleeding arm he tried to retreat to the barn  and it would have gone hard with him had not collie appeared on the scene  as she had saved dicks life she now saved the grooms she rushed upon white fang in frenzied wrath  she had been right  she had known better than the blundering gods  all her suspicions were justified  here was the ancient marauder up to his old tricks again  the groom escaped into the stables and white fang backed away before collies wicked teeth or presented his shoulder to them and circled round and round  but collie did not give over as was her wont after a decent interval of chastisement  on the contrary she grew more excited and angry every moment until in the end white fang flung dignity to the winds and frankly fled away from her across the fields  hell learn to leave chickens alone the master said  but i cant give him the lesson until i catch him in the act  two nights later came the act but on a more generous scale than the master had anticipated  white fang had observed closely the chickenyards and the habits of the chickens  in the nighttime after they had gone to roost he climbed to the top of a pile of newly hauled lumber  from there he gained the roof of a chickenhouse passed over the ridgepole and dropped to the ground inside  a moment later he was inside the house and the slaughter began  in the morning when the master came out on to the porch fifty white leghorn hens laid out in a row by the groom greeted his eyes  he whistled to himself softly first with surprise and then at the end with admiration  his eyes were likewise greeted by white fang but about the latter there were no signs of shame nor guilt  he carried himself with pride as though forsooth he had achieved a deed praiseworthy and meritorious  there was about him no consciousness of sin  the masters lips tightened as he faced the disagreeable task  then he talked harshly to the unwitting culprit and in his voice there was nothing but godlike wrath  also he held white fangs nose down to the slain hens and at the same time cuffed him soundly  white fang never raided a chickenroost again  it was against the law and he had learned it  then the master took him into the chickenyards white fangs natural impulse when he saw the live food fluttering about him and under his very nose was to spring upon it  he obeyed the impulse but was checked by the masters voice  they continued in the yards for half an hour  time and again the impulse surged over white fang and each time as he yielded to it he was checked by the masters voice  thus it was he learned the law and ere he left the domain of the chickens he had learned to ignore their existence  you can never cure a chickenkiller  judge scott shook his head sadly at luncheon table when his son narrated the lesson he had given white fang  once theyve got the habit and the taste of blood     again he shook his head sadly  but weedon scott did not agree with his father  ill tell you what ill do he challenged finally  ill lock white fang in with the chickens all afternoon  but think of the chickens objected the judge  and furthermore the son went on for every chicken he kills ill pay you one dollar gold coin of the realm  but you should penalise father too interpose beth  her sister seconded her and a chorus of approval arose from around the table  judge scott nodded his head in agreement  all right weedon scott pondered for a moment  and if at the end of the afternoon white fang hasnt harmed a chicken for every ten minutes of the time he has spent in the yard you will have to say to him gravely and with deliberation just as if you were sitting on the bench and solemnly passing judgment white fang you are smarter than i thought  from hidden points of vantage the family watched the performance  but it was a fizzle  locked in the yard and there deserted by the master white fang lay down and went to sleep  once he got up and walked over to the trough for a drink of water  the chickens he calmly ignored  so far as he was concerned they did not exist  at four oclock he executed a running jump gained the roof of the chickenhouse and leaped to the ground outside whence he sauntered gravely to the house  he had learned the law  and on the porch before the delighted family judge scott face to face with white fang said slowly and solemnly sixteen times white fang you are smarter than i thought  but it was the multiplicity of laws that befuddled white fang and often brought him into disgrace  he had to learn that he must not touch the chickens that belonged to other gods  then there were cats and rabbits and turkeys all these he must let alone  in fact when he had but partly learned the law his impression was that he must leave all live things alone  out in the backpasture a quail could flutter up under his nose unharmed  all tense and trembling with eagerness and desire he mastered his instinct and stood still  he was obeying the will of the gods  and then one day again out in the backpasture he saw dick start a jackrabbit and run it  the master himself was looking on and did not interfere  nay he encouraged white fang to join in the chase  and thus he learned that there was no taboo on jackrabbits  in the end he worked out the complete law  between him and all domestic animals there must be no hostilities  if not amity at least neutrality must obtain  but the other animalsthe squirrels and quail and cottontails were creatures of the wild who had never yielded allegiance to man  they were the lawful prey of any dog  it was only the tame that the gods protected and between the tame deadly strife was not permitted  the gods held the power of life and death over their subjects and the gods were jealous of their power  life was complex in the santa clara valley after the simplicities of the northland  and the chief thing demanded by these intricacies of civilisation was control restrainta poise of self that was as delicate as the fluttering of gossamer wings and at the same time as rigid as steel  life had a thousand faces and white fang found he must meet them allthus when he went to town in to san jose running behind the carriage or loafing about the streets when the carriage stopped  life flowed past him deep and wide and varied continually impinging upon his senses demanding of him instant and endless adjustments and correspondences and compelling him almost always to suppress his natural impulses  there were butchershops where meat hung within reach  this meat he must not touch  there were cats at the houses the master visited that must be let alone  and there were dogs everywhere that snarled at him and that he must not attack  and then on the crowded sidewalks there were persons innumerable whose attention he attracted  they would stop and look at him point him out to one another examine him talk of him and worst of all pat him  and these perilous contacts from all these strange hands he must endure  yet this endurance he achieved furthermore he got over being awkward and selfconscious  in a lofty way he received the attentions of the multitudes of strange gods  with condescension he accepted their condescension  on the other hand there was something about him that prevented great familiarity  they patted him on the head and passed on contented and pleased with their own daring  but it was not all easy for white fang  running behind the carriage in the outskirts of san jose he encountered certain small boys who made a practice of flinging stones at him  yet he knew that it was not permitted him to pursue and drag them down  here he was compelled to violate his instinct of selfpreservation and violate it he did for he was becoming tame and qualifying himself for civilisation  nevertheless white fang was not quite satisfied with the arrangement  he had no abstract ideas about justice and fair play  but there is a certain sense of equity that resides in life and it was this sense in him that resented the unfairness of his being permitted no defence against the stonethrowers  he forgot that in the covenant entered into between him and the gods they were pledged to care for him and defend him  but one day the master sprang from the carriage whip in hand and gave the stonethrowers a thrashing  after that they threw stones no more and white fang understood and was satisfied  one other experience of similar nature was his  on the way to town hanging around the saloon at the crossroads were three dogs that made a practice of rushing out upon him when he went by  knowing his deadly method of fighting the master had never ceased impressing upon white fang the law that he must not fight  as a result having learned the lesson well white fang was hard put whenever he passed the crossroads saloon  after the first rush each time his snarl kept the three dogs at a distance but they trailed along behind yelping and bickering and insulting him  this endured for some time  the men at the saloon even urged the dogs on to attack white fang  one day they openly sicked the dogs on him  the master stopped the carriage  go to it he said to white fang  but white fang could not believe  he looked at the master and he looked at the dogs  then he looked back eagerly and questioningly at the master  the master nodded his head  go to them old fellow  eat them up  white fang no longer hesitated  he turned and leaped silently among his enemies  all three faced him  there was a great snarling and growling a clashing of teeth and a flurry of bodies  the dust of the road arose in a cloud and screened the battle  but at the end of several minutes two dogs were struggling in the dirt and the third was in full flight  he leaped a ditch went through a rail fence and fled across a field  white fang followed sliding over the ground in wolf fashion and with wolf speed swiftly and without noise and in the centre of the field he dragged down and slew the dog  with this triple killing his main troubles with dogs ceased  the word went up and down the valley and men saw to it that their dogs did not molest the fighting wolf    chapter ivthe call of kind   the months came and went  there was plenty of food and no work in the southland and white fang lived fat and prosperous and happy  not alone was he in the geographical southland for he was in the southland of life  human kindness was like a sun shining upon him and he flourished like a flower planted in good soil  and yet he remained somehow different from other dogs  he knew the law even better than did the dogs that had known no other life and he observed the law more punctiliously but still there was about him a suggestion of lurking ferocity as though the wild still lingered in him and the wolf in him merely slept  he never chummed with other dogs  lonely he had lived so far as his kind was concerned and lonely he would continue to live  in his puppyhood under the persecution of liplip and the puppypack and in his fighting days with beauty smith he had acquired a fixed aversion for dogs  the natural course of his life had been diverted and recoiling from his kind he had clung to the human  besides all southland dogs looked upon him with suspicion  he aroused in them their instinctive fear of the wild and they greeted him always with snarl and growl and belligerent hatred  he on the other hand learned that it was not necessary to use his teeth upon them  his naked fangs and writhing lips were uniformly efficacious rarely failing to send a bellowing onrushing dog back on its haunches  but there was one trial in white fangs lifecollie  she never gave him a moments peace  she was not so amenable to the law as he  she defied all efforts of the master to make her become friends with white fang ever in his ears was sounding her sharp and nervous snarl  she had never forgiven him the chickenkilling episode and persistently held to the belief that his intentions were bad  she found him guilty before the act and treated him accordingly  she became a pest to him like a policeman following him around the stable and the hounds and if he even so much as glanced curiously at a pigeon or chicken bursting into an outcry of indignation and wrath  his favourite way of ignoring her was to lie down with his head on his forepaws and pretend sleep  this always dumfounded and silenced her  with the exception of collie all things went well with white fang  he had learned control and poise and he knew the law  he achieved a staidness and calmness and philosophic tolerance  he no longer lived in a hostile environment  danger and hurt and death did not lurk everywhere about him  in time the unknown as a thing of terror and menace ever impending faded away  life was soft and easy  it flowed along smoothly and neither fear nor foe lurked by the way  he missed the snow without being aware of it  an unduly long summer would have been his thought had he thought about it as it was he merely missed the snow in a vague subconscious way  in the same fashion especially in the heat of summer when he suffered from the sun he experienced faint longings for the northland  their only effect upon him however was to make him uneasy and restless without his knowing what was the matter  white fang had never been very demonstrative  beyond his snuggling and the throwing of a crooning note into his lovegrowl he had no way of expressing his love  yet it was given him to discover a third way  he had always been susceptible to the laughter of the gods  laughter had affected him with madness made him frantic with rage  but he did not have it in him to be angry with the lovemaster and when that god elected to laugh at him in a goodnatured bantering way he was nonplussed  he could feel the pricking and stinging of the old anger as it strove to rise up in him but it strove against love  he could not be angry yet he had to do something  at first he was dignified and the master laughed the harder  then he tried to be more dignified and the master laughed harder than before  in the end the master laughed him out of his dignity  his jaws slightly parted his lips lifted a little and a quizzical expression that was more love than humour came into his eyes  he had learned to laugh  likewise he learned to romp with the master to be tumbled down and rolled over and be the victim of innumerable rough tricks  in return he feigned anger bristling and growling ferociously and clipping his teeth together in snaps that had all the seeming of deadly intention  but he never forgot himself  those snaps were always delivered on the empty air  at the end of such a romp when blow and cuff and snap and snarl were last and furious they would break off suddenly and stand several feet apart glaring at each other  and then just as suddenly like the sun rising on a stormy sea they would begin to laugh  this would always culminate with the masters arms going around white fangs neck and shoulders while the latter crooned and growled his lovesong  but nobody else ever romped with white fang  he did not permit it  he stood on his dignity and when they attempted it his warning snarl and bristling mane were anything but playful  that he allowed the master these liberties was no reason that he should be a common dog loving here and loving there everybodys property for a romp and good time  he loved with single heart and refused to cheapen himself or his love  the master went out on horseback a great deal and to accompany him was one of white fangs chief duties in life  in the northland he had evidenced his fealty by toiling in the harness but there were no sleds in the southland nor did dogs pack burdens on their backs  so he rendered fealty in the new way by running with the masters horse  the longest day never played white fang out  his was the gait of the wolf smooth tireless and effortless and at the end of fifty miles he would come in jauntily ahead of the horse  it was in connection with the riding that white fang achieved one other mode of expressionremarkable in that he did it but twice in all his life  the first time occurred when the master was trying to teach a spirited thoroughbred the method of opening and closing gates without the riders dismounting  time and again and many times he ranged the horse up to the gate in the effort to close it and each time the horse became frightened and backed and plunged away  it grew more nervous and excited every moment  when it reared the master put the spurs to it and made it drop its forelegs back to earth whereupon it would begin kicking with its hindlegs  white fang watched the performance with increasing anxiety until he could contain himself no longer when he sprang in front of the horse and barked savagely and warningly  though he often tried to bark thereafter and the master encouraged him he succeeded only once and then it was not in the masters presence  a scamper across the pasture a jackrabbit rising suddenly under the horses feet a violent sheer a stumble a fall to earth and a broken leg for the master was the cause of it  white fang sprang in a rage at the throat of the offending horse but was checked by the masters voice  home  go home the master commanded when he had ascertained his injury  white fang was disinclined to desert him  the master thought of writing a note but searched his pockets vainly for pencil and paper  again he commanded white fang to go home  the latter regarded him wistfully started away then returned and whined softly  the master talked to him gently but seriously and he cocked his ears and listened with painful intentness  thats all right old fellow you just run along home ran the talk go on home and tell them whats happened to me  home with you you wolf  get along home  white fang knew the meaning of home and though he did not understand the remainder of the masters language he knew it was his will that he should go home  he turned and trotted reluctantly away  then he stopped undecided and looked back over his shoulder  go home came the sharp command and this time he obeyed  the family was on the porch taking the cool of the afternoon when white fang arrived  he came in among them panting covered with dust  weedons back weedons mother announced  the children welcomed white fang with glad cries and ran to meet him  he avoided them and passed down the porch but they cornered him against a rockingchair and the railing  he growled and tried to push by them their mother looked apprehensively in their direction  i confess he makes me nervous around the children she said  i have a dread that he will turn upon them unexpectedly some day  growling savagely white fang sprang out of the corner overturning the boy and the girl  the mother called them to her and comforted them telling them not to bother white fang  a wolf is a wolf commented judge scott  there is no trusting one  but he is not all wolf interposed beth standing for her brother in his absence  you have only weedons opinion for that rejoined the judge  he merely surmises that there is some strain of dog in white fang but as he will tell you himself he knows nothing about it  as for his appearance  he did not finish his sentence  white fang stood before him growling fiercely  go away  lie down sir judge scott commanded  white fang turned to the lovemasters wife  she screamed with fright as he seized her dress in his teeth and dragged on it till the frail fabric tore away  by this time he had become the centre of interest  he had ceased from his growling and stood head up looking into their faces  his throat worked spasmodically but made no sound while he struggled with all his body convulsed with the effort to rid himself of the incommunicable something that strained for utterance  i hope he is not going mad said weedons mother  i told weedon that i was afraid the warm climate would not agree with an arctic animal  hes trying to speak i do believe beth announced  at this moment speech came to white fang rushing up in a great burst of barking  something has happened to weedon his wife said decisively  they were all on their feet now and white fang ran down the steps looking back for them to follow  for the second and last time in his life he had barked and made himself understood  after this event he found a warmer place in the hearts of the sierra vista people and even the groom whose arm he had slashed admitted that he was a wise dog even if he was a wolf  judge scott still held to the same opinion and proved it to everybodys dissatisfaction by measurements and descriptions taken from the encyclopaedia and various works on natural history  the days came and went streaming their unbroken sunshine over the santa clara valley  but as they grew shorter and white fangs second winter in the southland came on he made a strange discovery  collies teeth were no longer sharp  there was a playfulness about her nips and a gentleness that prevented them from really hurting him  he forgot that she had made life a burden to him and when she disported herself around him he responded solemnly striving to be playful and becoming no more than ridiculous  one day she led him off on a long chase through the backpasture land into the woods  it was the afternoon that the master was to ride and white fang knew it  the horse stood saddled and waiting at the door white fang hesitated  but there was that in him deeper than all the law he had learned than the customs that had moulded him than his love for the master than the very will to live of himself and when in the moment of his indecision collie nipped him and scampered off he turned and followed after  the master rode alone that day and in the woods side by side white fang ran with collie as his mother kiche and old one eye had run long years before in the silent northland forest    chapter vthe sleeping wolf   it was about this time that the newspapers were full of the daring escape of a convict from san quentin prison  he was a ferocious man  he had been illmade in the making  he had not been born right and he had not been helped any by the moulding he had received at the hands of society the hands of society are harsh and this man was a striking sample of its handiwork  he was a beasta human beast it is true but nevertheless so terrible a beast that he can best be characterised as carnivorous  in san quentin prison he had proved incorrigible  punishment failed to break his spirit  he could die dumbmad and fighting to the last but he could not live and be beaten  the more fiercely he fought the more harshly society handled him and the only effect of harshness was to make him fiercer  straightjackets starvation and beatings and clubbings were the wrong treatment for jim hall but it was the treatment he received  it was the treatment he had received from the time he was a little pulpy boy in a san francisco slumsoft clay in the hands of society and ready to be formed into something  it was during jim halls third term in prison that he encountered a guard that was almost as great a beast as he  the guard treated him unfairly lied about him to the warden lost his credits persecuted him  the difference between them was that the guard carried a bunch of keys and a revolver  jim hall had only his naked hands and his teeth  but he sprang upon the guard one day and used his teeth on the others throat just like any jungle animal  after this jim hall went to live in the incorrigible cell  he lived there three years  the cell was of iron the floor the walls the roof he never left this cell  he never saw the sky nor the sunshine  day was a twilight and night was a black silence  he was in an iron tomb buried alive  he saw no human face spoke to no human thing  when his food was shoved in to him he growled like a wild animal  he hated all things for days and nights he bellowed his rage at the universe  for weeks and months he never made a sound in the black silence eating his very soul he was a man and a monstrosity as fearful a thing of fear as ever gibbered in the visions of a maddened brain  and then one night he escaped  the warders said it was impossible but nevertheless the cell was empty and half in half out of it lay the body of a dead guard  two other dead guards marked his trail through the prison to the outer walls and he had killed with his hands to avoid noise  he was armed with the weapons of the slain guardsa live arsenal that fled through the hills pursued by the organised might of society  a heavy price of gold was upon his head  avaricious farmers hunted him with shotguns  his blood might pay off a mortgage or send a son to college  publicspirited citizens took down their rifles and went out after him  a pack of bloodhounds followed the way of his bleeding feet and the sleuthhounds of the law the paid fighting animals of society with telephone and telegraph and special train clung to his trail night and day  sometimes they came upon him and men faced him like heroes or stampeded through barbedwire fences to the delight of the commonwealth reading the account at the breakfast table  it was after such encounters that the dead and wounded were carted back to the towns and their places filled by men eager for the manhunt  and then jim hall disappeared  the bloodhounds vainly quested on the lost trail  inoffensive ranchers in remote valleys were held up by armed men and compelled to identify themselves  while the remains of jim hall were discovered on a dozen mountainsides by greedy claimants for blood money  in the meantime the newspapers were read at sierra vista not so much with interest as with anxiety  the women were afraid  judge scott pooh poohed and laughed but not with reason for it was in his last days on the bench that jim hall had stood before him and received sentence  and in open courtroom before all men jim hall had proclaimed that the day would come when he would wreak vengeance on the judge that sentenced him  for once jim hall was right  he was innocent of the crime for which he was sentenced  it was a case in the parlance of thieves and police of railroading  jim hall was being railroaded to prison for a crime he had not committed  because of the two prior convictions against him judge scott imposed upon him a sentence of fifty years  judge scott did not know all things and he did not know that he was party to a police conspiracy that the evidence was hatched and perjured that jim hall was guiltless of the crime charged  and jim hall on the other hand did not know that judge scott was merely ignorant  jim hall believed that the judge knew all about it and was hand in glove with the police in the perpetration of the monstrous injustice  so it was when the doom of fifty years of living death was uttered by judge scott that jim hall hating all things in the society that misused him rose up and raged in the courtroom until dragged down by half a dozen of his blue coated enemies  to him judge scott was the keystone in the arch of injustice and upon judge scott he emptied the vials of his wrath and hurled the threats of his revenge yet to come  then jim hall went to his living death    and escaped  of all this white fang knew nothing  but between him and alice the masters wife there existed a secret  each night after sierra vista had gone to bed she rose and let in white fang to sleep in the big hall now white fang was not a housedog nor was he permitted to sleep in the house so each morning early she slipped down and let him out before the family was awake  on one such night while all the house slept white fang awoke and lay very quietly  and very quietly he smelled the air and read the message it bore of a strange gods presence  and to his ears came sounds of the strange gods movements  white fang burst into no furious outcry  it was not his way  the strange god walked softly but more softly walked white fang for he had no clothes to rub against the flesh of his body he followed silently  in the wild he had hunted live meat that was infinitely timid and he knew the advantage of surprise  the strange god paused at the foot of the great staircase and listened and white fang was as dead so without movement was he as he watched and waited  up that staircase the way led to the lovemaster and to the love masters dearest possessions  white fang bristled but waited  the strange gods foot lifted  he was beginning the ascent  then it was that white fang struck  he gave no warning with no snarl anticipated his own action  into the air he lifted his body in the spring that landed him on the strange gods back  white fang clung with his forepaws to the mans shoulders at the same time burying his fangs into the back of the mans neck  he clung on for a moment long enough to drag the god over backward  together they crashed to the floor  white fang leaped clear and as the man struggled to rise was in again with the slashing fangs  sierra vista awoke in alarm  the noise from downstairs was as that of a score of battling fiends  there were revolver shots  a mans voice screamed once in horror and anguish  there was a great snarling and growling and over all arose a smashing and crashing of furniture and glass  but almost as quickly as it had arisen the commotion died away  the struggle had not lasted more than three minutes  the frightened household clustered at the top of the stairway  from below as from out an abyss of blackness came up a gurgling sound as of air bubbling through water  sometimes this gurgle became sibilant almost a whistle but this too quickly died down and ceased  then naught came up out of the blackness save a heavy panting of some creature struggling sorely for air  weedon scott pressed a button and the staircase and downstairs hall were flooded with light  then he and judge scott revolvers in hand cautiously descended  there was no need for this caution  white fang had done his work  in the midst of the wreckage of overthrown and smashed furniture partly on his side his face hidden by an arm lay a man  weedon scott bent over removed the arm and turned the mans face upward  a gaping throat explained the manner of his death  jim hall said judge scott and father and son looked significantly at each other  then they turned to white fang  he too was lying on his side  his eyes were closed but the lids slightly lifted in an effort to look at them as they bent over him and the tail was perceptibly agitated in a vain effort to wag  weedon scott patted him and his throat rumbled an acknowledging growl  but it was a weak growl at best and it quickly ceased  his eyelids drooped and went shut and his whole body seemed to relax and flatten out upon the floor  hes all in poor devil muttered the master  well see about that asserted the judge as he started for the telephone  frankly he has one chance in a thousand announced the surgeon after he had worked an hour and a half on white fang  dawn was breaking through the windows and dimming the electric lights with the exception of the children the whole family was gathered about the surgeon to hear his verdict  one broken hindleg he went on  three broken ribs one at least of which has pierced the lungs  he has lost nearly all the blood in his body  there is a large likelihood of internal injuries  he must have been jumped upon  to say nothing of three bullet holes clear through him  one chance in a thousand is really optimistic  he hasnt a chance in ten thousand  but he mustnt lose any chance that might be of help to him judge scott exclaimed  never mind expense  put him under the xrayanything weedon telegraph at once to san francisco for doctor nichols  no reflection on you doctor you understand but he must have the advantage of every chance  the surgeon smiled indulgently  of course i understand  he deserves all that can be done for him  he must be nursed as you would nurse a human being a sick child  and dont forget what i told you about temperature  ill be back at ten oclock again  white fang received the nursing  judge scotts suggestion of a trained nurse was indignantly clamoured down by the girls who themselves undertook the task  and white fang won out on the one chance in ten thousand denied him by the surgeon  the latter was not to be censured for his misjudgment  all his life he had tended and operated on the soft humans of civilisation who lived sheltered lives and had descended out of many sheltered generations compared with white fang they were frail and flabby and clutched life without any strength in their grip  white fang had come straight from the wild where the weak perish early and shelter is vouchsafed to none in neither his father nor his mother was there any weakness nor in the generations before them  a constitution of iron and the vitality of the wild were white fangs inheritance and he clung to life the whole of him and every part of him in spirit and in flesh with the tenacity that of old belonged to all creatures  bound down a prisoner denied even movement by the plaster casts and bandages white fang lingered out the weeks  he slept long hours and dreamed much and through his mind passed an unending pageant of northland visions  all the ghosts of the past arose and were with him once again he lived in the lair with kiche crept trembling to the knees of grey beaver to tender his allegiance ran for his life before liplip and all the howling bedlam of the puppypack  he ran again through the silence hunting his living food through the months of famine and again he ran at the head of the team the gutwhips of mitsah and grey beaver snapping behind their voices crying ra raa when they came to a narrow passage and the team closed together like a fan to go through  he lived again all his days with beauty smith and the fights he had fought  at such times he whimpered and snarled in his sleep and they that looked on said that his dreams were bad  but there was one particular nightmare from which he sufferedthe clanking clanging monsters of electric cars that were to him colossal screaming lynxes  he would lie in a screen of bushes watching for a squirrel to venture far enough out on the ground from its treerefuge then when he sprang out upon it it would transform itself into an electric car menacing and terrible towering over him like a mountain screaming and clanging and spitting fire at him  it was the same when he challenged the hawk down out of the sky  down out of the blue it would rush as it dropped upon him changing itself into the ubiquitous electric car  or again he would be in the pen of beauty smith  outside the pen men would be gathering and he knew that a fight was on  he watched the door for his antagonist to enter  the door would open and thrust in upon him would come the awful electric car  a thousand times this occurred and each time the terror it inspired was as vivid and great as ever  then came the day when the last bandage and the last plaster cast were taken off  it was a gala day  all sierra vista was gathered around  the master rubbed his ears and he crooned his lovegrowl  the masters wife called him the blessed wolf which name was taken up with acclaim and all the women called him the blessed wolf  he tried to rise to his feet and after several attempts fell down from weakness  he had lain so long that his muscles had lost their cunning and all the strength had gone out of them  he felt a little shame because of his weakness as though forsooth he were failing the gods in the service he owed them  because of this he made heroic efforts to arise and at last he stood on his four legs tottering and swaying back and forth  the blessed wolf chorused the women  judge scott surveyed them triumphantly  out of your own mouths be it he said  just as i contended right along  no mere dog could have done what he did  hes a wolf  a blessed wolf amended the judges wife  yes blessed wolf agreed the judge  and henceforth that shall be my name for him  hell have to learn to walk again said the surgeon so he might as well start in right now  it wont hurt him  take him outside  and outside he went like a king with all sierra vista about him and tending on him  he was very weak and when he reached the lawn he lay down and rested for a while  then the procession started on little spurts of strength coming into white fangs muscles as he used them and the blood began to surge through them  the stables were reached and there in the doorway lay collie a halfdozen pudgy puppies playing about her in the sun  white fang looked on with a wondering eye  collie snarled warningly at him and he was careful to keep his distance  the master with his toe helped one sprawling puppy toward him  he bristled suspiciously but the master warned him that all was well  collie clasped in the arms of one of the women watched him jealously and with a snarl warned him that all was not well  the puppy sprawled in front of him  he cocked his ears and watched it curiously  then their noses touched and he felt the warm little tongue of the puppy on his jowl  white fangs tongue went out he knew not why and he licked the puppys face  handclapping and pleased cries from the gods greeted the performance  he was surprised and looked at them in a puzzled way  then his weakness asserted itself and he lay down his ears cocked his head on one side as he watched the puppy  the other puppies came sprawling toward him to collies great disgust and he gravely permitted them to clamber and tumble over him  at first amid the applause of the gods he betrayed a trifle of his old selfconsciousness and awkwardness  this passed away as the puppies antics and mauling continued and he lay with halfshut patient eyes drowsing in the sun
