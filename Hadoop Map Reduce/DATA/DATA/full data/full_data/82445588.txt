editors of these publications i   am indebted for courteous permission to reproduce the stories in their                               present form     reginald in russia   reginald sat in a corner of the princess’s salon and tried to forgive the furniture which started out with an obvious intention of being louis quinze but relapsed at frequent intervals into wilhelm ii  he classified the princess with that distinct type of woman that looks as if it habitually went out to feed hens in the rain  her name was olga she kept what she hoped and believed to be a foxterrier and professed what she thought were socialist opinions  it is not necessary to be called olga if you are a russian princess in fact reginald knew quite a number who were called vera but the foxterrier and the socialism are essential  “the countess lomshen keeps a bulldog” said the princess suddenly  “in england is it more chic to have a bulldog than a foxterrier”  reginald threw his mind back over the canine fashions of the last ten years and gave an evasive answer  “do you think her handsome the countess lomshen” asked the princess  reginald thought the countess’s complexion suggested an exclusive diet of macaroons and pale sherry  he said so  “but that cannot be possible” said the princess triumphantly “i’ve seen her eating fishsoup at donon’s”  the princess always defended a friend’s complexion if it was really bad with her as with a great many of her sex charity began at homeliness and did not generally progress much farther  reginald withdrew his macaroon and sherry theory and became interested in a case of miniatures  “that” said the princess “that is the old princess lorikoff  she lived in millionaya street near the winter palace and was one of the court ladies of the old russian school  her knowledge of people and events was extremely limited but she used to patronise every one who came in contact with her  there was a story that when she died and left the millionaya for heaven she addressed st peter in her formal staccato french ‘je suis la princesse lorikoff  il me donne grand plaisir à faire votre connaissance  je vous en prie me présenter au bon dieu’ st peter made the desired introduction and the princess addressed le bon dieu ‘je suis la princesse lorikoff  il me donne grand plaisir à faire votre connaissance  on a souvent parlé de vous à l’église de la rue million’”  “only the old and the clergy of established churches know how to be flippant gracefully” commented reginald “which reminds me that in the anglican church in a certain foreign capital which shall be nameless i was present the other day when one of the junior chaplains was preaching in aid of distressed somethings or other and he brought a really eloquent passage to a close with the remark ‘the tears of the afflicted to what shall i liken them—to diamonds’  the other junior chaplain who had been dozing out of professional jealousy awoke with a start and asked hurriedly ‘shall i play to diamonds partner’  it didn’t improve matters when the senior chaplain remarked dreamily but with painful distinctness ‘double diamonds’  every one looked at the preacher half expecting him to redouble but he contented himself with scoring what points he could under the circumstances”  “you english are always so frivolous” said the princess  “in russia we have too many troubles to permit of our being lighthearted”  reginald gave a delicate shiver such as an italian greyhound might give in contemplating the approach of an ice age of which he personally disapproved and resigned himself to the inevitable political discussion  “nothing that you hear about us in england is true” was the princess’s hopeful beginning  “i always refused to learn russian geography at school” observed reginald “i was certain some of the names must be wrong”  “everything is wrong with our system of government” continued the princess placidly  “the bureaucrats think only of their pockets and the people are exploited and plundered in every direction and everything is mismanaged”  “with us” said reginald “a cabinet usually gets the credit of being depraved and worthless beyond the bounds of human conception by the time it has been in office about four years”  “but if it is a bad government you can turn it out at the elections” argued the princess  “as far as i remember we generally do” said reginald  “but here it is dreadful every one goes to such extremes  in england you never go to extremes”  “we go to the albert hall” explained reginald  “there is always a seesaw with us between repression and violence” continued the princess “and the pity of it is the people are really not in the least inclined to be anything but peaceable  nowhere will you find people more goodnatured or family circles where there is more affection”  “there i agree with you” said reginald  “i know a boy who lives somewhere on the french quay who is a case in point  his hair curls naturally especially on sundays and he plays bridge well even for a russian which is saying much  i don’t think he has any other accomplishments but his family affection is really of a very high order when his maternal grandmother died he didn’t go as far as to give up bridge altogether but he declared on nothing but black suits for the next three months  that i think was really beautiful”  the princess was not impressed  “i think you must be very selfindulgent and live only for amusement” she said “a life of pleasureseeking and cardplaying and dissipation brings only dissatisfaction  you will find that out some day”  “oh i know it turns out that way sometimes” assented reginald “forbidden fizz is often the sweetest”  but the remark was wasted on the princess who preferred champagne that had at least a suggestion of dissolved barleysugar  “i hope you will come and see me again” she said in a tone that prevented the hope from becoming too infectious adding as a happy afterthought “you must come to stay with us in the country”  her particular part of the country was a few hundred versts the other side of tamboff with some fifteen miles of agrarian disturbance between her and the nearest neighbour  reginald felt that there is some privacy which should be sacred from intrusion     the reticence of lady anne   egbert came into the large dimly lit drawingroom with the air of a man who is not certain whether he is entering a dovecote or a bomb factory and is prepared for either eventuality  the little domestic quarrel over the luncheontable had not been fought to a definite finish and the question was how far lady anne was in a mood to renew or forgo hostilities  her pose in the armchair by the teatable was rather elaborately rigid in the gloom of a december afternoon egbert’s pincenez did not materially help him to discern the expression of her face  by way of breaking whatever ice might be floating on the surface he made a remark about a dim religious light  he or lady anne were accustomed to make that remark between 430 and 6 on winter and late autumn evenings it was a part of their married life  there was no recognised rejoinder to it and lady anne made none  don tarquinio lay astretch on the persian rug basking in the firelight with superb indifference to the possible illhumour of lady anne  his pedigree was as flawlessly persian as the rug and his ruff was coming into the glory of its second winter  the pageboy who had renaissance tendencies had christened him don tarquinio  left to themselves egbert and lady anne would unfailingly have called him fluff but they were not obstinate  egbert poured himself out some tea  as the silence gave no sign of breaking on lady anne’s initiative he braced himself for another yermak effort  “my remark at lunch had a purely academic application” he announced “you seem to put an unnecessarily personal significance into it”  lady anne maintained her defensive barrier of silence  the bullfinch lazily filled in the interval with an air from iphigénie en tauride egbert recognised it immediately because it was the only air the bullfinch whistled and he had come to them with the reputation for whistling it  both egbert and lady anne would have preferred something from the yeomen of the guard which was their favourite opera  in matters artistic they had a similarity of taste  they leaned towards the honest and explicit in art a picture for instance that told its own story with generous assistance from its title  a riderless warhorse with harness in obvious disarray staggering into a courtyard full of pale swooning women and marginally noted “bad news” suggested to their minds a distinct interpretation of some military catastrophe  they could see what it was meant to convey and explain it to friends of duller intelligence  the silence continued  as a rule lady anne’s displeasure became articulate and markedly voluble after four minutes of introductory muteness  egbert seized the milkjug and poured some of its contents into don tarquinio’s saucer as the saucer was already full to the brim an unsightly overflow was the result  don tarquinio looked on with a surprised interest that evanesced into elaborate unconsciousness when he was appealed to by egbert to come and drink up some of the spilt matter don tarquinio was prepared to play many rôles in life but a vacuum carpetcleaner was not one of them  “don’t you think we’re being rather foolish” said egbert cheerfully  if lady anne thought so she didn’t say so  “i dare say the fault has been partly on my side” continued egbert with evaporating cheerfulness  “after all i’m only human you know  you seem to forget that i’m only human”  he insisted on the point as if there had been unfounded suggestions that he was built on satyr lines with goat continuations where the human left off  the bullfinch recommenced its air from iphigénie en tauride  egbert began to feel depressed  lady anne was not drinking her tea  perhaps she was feeling unwell  but when lady anne felt unwell she was not wont to be reticent on the subject  “no one knows what i suffer from indigestion” was one of her favourite statements but the lack of knowledge can only have been caused by defective listening the amount of information available on the subject would have supplied material for a monograph  evidently lady anne was not feeling unwell  egbert began to think he was being unreasonably dealt with naturally he began to make concessions  “i dare say” he observed taking as central a position on the hearthrug as don tarquinio could be persuaded to concede him “i may have been to blame  i am willing if i can thereby restore things to a happier standpoint to undertake to lead a better life”  he wondered vaguely how it would be possible  temptations came to him in middle age tentatively and without insistence like a neglected butcherboy who asks for a christmas box in february for no more hopeful reason that than he didn’t get one in december  he had no more idea of succumbing to them than he had of purchasing the fishknives and fur boas that ladies are impelled to sacrifice through the medium of advertisement columns during twelve months of the year  still there was something impressive in this unaskedfor renunciation of possibly latent enormities  lady anne showed no sign of being impressed  egbert looked at her nervously through his glasses  to get the worst of an argument with her was no new experience  to get the worst of a monologue was a humiliating novelty  “i shall go and dress for diner” he announced in a voice into which he intended some shade of sternness to creep  at the door a final access of weakness impelled him to make a further appeal  “aren’t we being very silly”  “a fool” was don tarquinio’s mental comment as the door closed on egbert’s retreat  then he lifted his velvet forepaws in the air and leapt lightly on to a bookshelf immediately under the bullfinch’s cage it was the first time he had seemed to notice the bird’s existence but he was carrying out a longformed theory of action with the precision of mature deliberation  the bullfinch who had fancied himself something of a despot depressed himself of a sudden into a third of his normal displacement then he fell to a helpless wingbeating and shrill cheeping  he had cost twentyseven shillings without the cage but lady anne made no sign of interfering  she had been dead for two hours     the lost sanjak   the prison chaplain entered the condemned’s cell for the last time to give such consolation as he might  “the only consolation i crave for” said the condemned “is to tell my story in its entirety to some one who will at least give it a respectful hearing”  “we must not be too long over it” said the chaplain looking at his watch  the condemned repressed a shiver and commenced  “most people will be of opinion that i am paying the penalty of my own violent deeds  in reality i am a victim to a lack of specialisation in my education and character”  “lack of specialisation” said the chaplain  “yes  if i had been known as one of the few men in england familiar with the fauna of the outer hebrides or able to repeat stanzas of camoens’ poetry in the original i should have had no difficulty in proving my identity in the crisis when my identity became a matter of life and death for me  but my education was merely a moderately good one and my temperament was of the general order that avoids specialisation  i know a little in a general way about gardening and history and old masters but i could never tell you offhand whether ‘stella van der loopen’ was a chrysanthemum or a heroine of the american war of independence or something by romney in the louvre”  the chaplain shifted uneasily in his seat  now that the alternatives had been suggested they all seemed dreadfully possible  “i fell in love or thought i did with the local doctor’s wife” continued the condemned  “why i should have done so i cannot say for i do not remember that she possessed any particular attractions of mind or body  on looking back at past events if seems to me that she must have been distinctly ordinary but i suppose the doctor had fallen in love with her once and what man had done man can do  she appeared to be pleased with the attentions which i paid her and to that extent i suppose i might say she encouraged me but i think she was honestly unaware that i meant anything more than a little neighbourly interest when one is face to face with death one wishes to be just”  the chaplain murmured approval  “at any rate she was genuinely horrified when i took advantage of the doctor’s absence one evening to declare what i believed to be my passion  she begged me to pass out of her life and i could scarcely do otherwise than agree though i hadn’t the dimmest idea of how it was to be done  in novels and plays i knew it was a regular occurrence and if you mistook a lady’s sentiments or intentions you went off to india and did things on the frontier as a matter of course  as i stumbled along the doctor’s carriagedrive i had no very clear idea as to what my line of action was to be but i had a vague feeling that i must look at the times atlas before going to bed then on the dark and lonely highway i came suddenly on a dead body”  the chaplain’s interest in the story visibly quickened  “judging by the clothes it wore the corpse was that of a salvation army captain  some shocking accident seemed to have struck him down and the head was crushed and battered out of all human semblance  probably i thought a motorcar fatality and then with a sudden overmastering insistence came another thought that here was a remarkable opportunity for losing my identity and passing out of the life of the doctor’s wife for ever  no tiresome and risky voyage to distant lands but a mere exchange of clothes and identity with the unknown victim of an unwitnessed accident  with considerable difficulty i undressed the corpse and clothed it anew in my own garments  any one who has valeted a dead salvation army captain in an uncertain light will appreciate the difficulty  with the idea presumably of inducing the doctor’s wife to leave her husband’s rooftree for some habitation which would be run at my expense i had crammed my pockets with a store of banknotes which represented a good deal of my immediate worldly wealth  when therefore i stole away into the world in the guise of a nameless salvationist i was not without resources which would easily support so humble a rôle for a considerable period  i tramped to a neighbouring markettown and late as the hour was the production of a few shillings procured me supper and a night’s lodging in a cheap coffeehouse  the next day i started forth on an aimless course of wandering from one small town to another  i was already somewhat disgusted with the upshot of my sudden freak in a few hours’ time i was considerably more so  in the contentsbill of a local news sheet i read the announcement of my own murder at the hands of some person unknown on buying a copy of the paper for a detailed account of the tragedy which at first had aroused in me a certain grim amusement i found that the deed ascribed to a wandering salvationist of doubtful antecedents who had been seen lurking in the roadway near the scene of the crime  i was no longer amused  the matter promised to be embarrassing  what i had mistaken for a motor accident was evidently a case of savage assault and murder and until the real culprit was found i should have much difficulty in explaining my intrusion into the affair  of course i could establish my own identity but how without disagreeably involving the doctor’s wife could i give any adequate reason for changing clothes with the murdered man  while my brain worked feverishly at this problem i subconsciously obeyed a secondary instinct—to get as far away as possible from the scene of the crime and to get rid at all costs of my incriminating uniform  there i found a difficulty  i tried two or three obscure clothes shops but my entrance invariably aroused an attitude of hostile suspicion in the proprietors and on one excuse or another they avoided serving me with the now ardently desired change of clothing  the uniform that i had so thoughtlessly donned seemed as difficult to get out of as the fatal shirt of—you know i forget the creature’s name”  “yes yes” said the chaplain hurriedly  “go on with your story”  “somehow until i could get out of those compromising garments i felt it would not be safe to surrender myself to the police  the thing that puzzled me was why no attempt was made to arrest me since there was no question as to the suspicion which followed me like an inseparable shadow wherever i went  stares nudgings whisperings and even loudspoken remarks of ‘that’s ’im’ greeted my every appearance and the meanest and most deserted eatinghouse that i patronised soon became filled with a crowd of furtively watching customers  i began to sympathise with the feeling of royal personages trying to do a little private shopping under the unsparing scrutiny of an irrepressible public and still with all this inarticulate shadowing which weighed on my nerves almost worse than open hostility would have done no attempt was made to interfere with my liberty  later on i discovered the reason  at the time of the murder on the lonely highway a series of important bloodhound trials had been taking place in the near neighbourhood and some dozen and a half couples of trained animals had been put on the track of the supposed murderer—on my track  one of our most publicspirited london dailies had offered a princely prize to the owner of the pair that should first track me down and betting on the chances of the respective competitors became rife throughout the land  the dogs ranged far and wide over about thirteen counties and though my own movements had become by this time perfectly wellknown to police and public alike the sporting instincts of the nation stepped in to prevent my premature arrest  “give the dogs a chance” was the prevailing sentiment whenever some ambitious local constable wished to put an end to my drawnout evasion of justice  my final capture by the winning pair was not a very dramatic episode in fact i’m not sure that they would have taken any notice of me if i hadn’t spoken to them and patted them but the event gave rise to an extraordinary amount of partisan excitement  the owner of the pair who were next nearest up at the finish was an american and he lodged a protest on the ground that an otterhound had married into the family of the winning pair six generations ago and that the prize had been offered to the first pair of bloodhounds to capture the murderer and that a dog that had 164th part of otterhound blood in it couldn’t technically be considered a bloodhound  i forget how the matter was ultimately settled but it aroused a tremendous amount of acrimonious discussion on both sides of the atlantic  my own contribution to the controversy consisted in pointing out that the whole dispute was beside the mark as the actual murderer had not yet been captured but i soon discovered that on this point there was not the least divergence of public or expert opinion  i had looked forward apprehensively to the proving of my identity and the establishment of my motives as a disagreeable necessity i speedily found out that the most disagreeable part of the business was that it couldn’t be done  when i saw in the glass the haggard and hunted expression which the experiences of the past few weeks had stamped on my erstwhile placid countenance i could scarcely feel surprised that the few friends and relations i possessed refused to recognise me in my altered guise and persisted in their obstinate but widely shared belief that it was i who had been done to death on the highway  to make matters worse infinitely worse an aunt of the really murdered man an appalling female of an obviously low order of intelligence identified me as her nephew and gave the authorities a lurid account of my depraved youth and of her laudable but unavailing efforts to spank me into a better way  i believe it was even proposed to search me for fingerprints”  “but” said the chaplain “surely your educational attainments—”  “that was just the crucial point” said the condemned “that was where my lack of specialisation told so fatally against me  the dead salvationist whose identity i had so lightly and so disastrously adopted had possessed a veneer of cheap modern education  it should have been easy to demonstrate that my learning was on altogether another plane to his but in my nervousness i bungled miserably over test after test that was put to me  the little french i had ever known deserted me i could not render a simple phrase about the gooseberry of the gardener into that language because i had forgotten the french for gooseberry”  the chaplain again wriggled uneasily in his seat  “and then” resumed the condemned “came the final discomfiture  in our village we had a modest little debating club and i remembered having promised chiefly i suppose to please and impress the doctor’s wife to give a sketchy kind of lecture on the balkan crisis  i had relied on being able to get up my facts from one or two standard works and the backnumbers of certain periodicals  the prosecution had made a careful note of the circumstance that the man whom i claimed to be—and actually was—had posed locally as some sort of secondhand authority on balkan affairs and in the midst of a string of questions on indifferent topics the examining counsel asked me with a diabolical suddenness if i could tell the court the whereabouts of novibazar  i felt the question to be a crucial one something told me that the answer was st petersburg or baker street  i hesitated looked helplessly round at the sea of tensely expectant faces pulled myself together and chose baker street  and then i knew that everything was lost  the prosecution had no difficulty in demonstrating that an individual even moderately versed in the affairs of the near east could never have so unceremoniously dislocated novibazar from its accustomed corner of the map  it was an answer which the salvation army captain might conceivably have made—and i made it  the circumstantial evidence connecting the salvationist with the crime was overwhelmingly convincing and i had inextricably identified myself with the salvationist  and thus it comes to pass that in ten minutes’ time i shall be hanged by the neck until i am dead in expiation of the murder of myself which murder never took place and of which in any case i am innocent”                                        when the chaplain returned to his quarters some fifteen minutes later the black flag was floating over the prison tower  breakfast was waiting for him in the diningroom but he first passed into his library and taking up the times atlas consulted a map of the balkan peninsula  “a thing like that” he observed closing the volume with a snap “might happen to any one”     the sex that doesn’t shop   the opening of a large new centre for west end shopping particularly feminine shopping suggests the reflection do women ever really shop of course it is a wellattested fact that they go forth shopping as assiduously as a bee goes flowervisiting but do they shop in the practical sense of the word  granted the money time and energy a resolute course of shopping transactions would naturally result in having one’s ordinary domestic needs unfailingly supplied whereas it is notorious that women servants and housewives of all classes make it almost a point of honour not to be supplied with everyday necessities “we shall be out of starch by thursday” they say with fatalistic foreboding and by thursday they are out of starch  they have predicted almost to a minute the moment when their supply would give out and if thursday happens to be early closing day their triumph is complete  a shop where starch is stored for retail purposes possibly stands at their very door but the feminine mind has rejected such an obvious source for replenishing a dwindling stock  “we don’t deal there” places it at once beyond the pale of human resort  and it is noteworthy that just as a sheepworrying dog seldom molests the flocks in his near neighbourhood so a woman rarely deals with shops in her immediate vicinity  the more remote the source of supply the more fixed seems to be the resolve to run short of the commodity  the ark had probably not quitted its last moorings five minutes before some feminine voice gloatingly recorded a shortage of birdseed  a few days ago two lady acquaintances of mine were confessing to some mental uneasiness because a friend had called just before lunchtime and they had been unable to ask her to stop and share their meal as with a touch of legitimate pride “there was nothing in the house”  i pointed out that they lived in a street that bristled with provision shops and that it would have been easy to mobilise a very passable luncheon in less than five minutes  “that” they said with quiet dignity “would not have occurred to us” and i felt that i had suggested something bordering on the indecent  but it is in catering for her literary wants that a woman’s shopping capacity breaks down most completely  if you have perchance produced a book which has met with some little measure of success you are certain to get a letter from some lady whom you scarcely known to bow to asking you “how it can be got”  she knows the name of the book its author and who published it but how to get into actual contact with it is still an unsolved problem to her  you write back pointing out that to have recourse to an ironmonger or a corndealer will only entail delay and disappointment and suggest an application to a bookseller as the most hopeful thing you can think of  in a day or two she writes again “it is all right i have borrowed it from your aunt”  here of course we have an example of the beyondshopper one who has learned the better way but the helplessness exists even when such bypaths of relief are closed  a lady who lives in the west end was expressing to me the other day her interest in west highland terriers and her desire to know more about the breed so when a few days later i came across an exhaustive article on that subject in the current number of one of our best known outdoorlife weeklies i mentioned that circumstance in a letter giving the date of that number  “i cannot get the paper” was her telephoned response  and she couldn’t  she lived in a city where newsagents are numbered i suppose by the thousand and she must have passed dozens of such shops in her daily shopping excursions but as far as she was concerned that article on west highland terriers might as well have been written in a missal stored away in some buddhist monastery in eastern thibet  the brutal directness of the masculine shopper arouses a certain combative derision in the feminine onlooker  a cat that spreads one shrewmouse over the greater part of a long summer afternoon and then possibly loses him doubtless feels the same contempt for the terrier who compresses his rat into ten seconds of the strenuous life  i was finishing off a short list of purchases a few afternoons ago when i was discovered by a lady of my acquaintance whom swerving aside from the lead given us by her godparents thirty years ago we will call agatha  “you’re surely not buying blottingpaper here” she exclaimed in an agitated whisper and she seemed so genuinely concerned that i stayed my hand  “let me take you to winks and pinks” she said as soon as we were out of the building “they’ve got such lovely shades of blottingpaper—pearl and heliotrope and momie and crushed—”  “but i want ordinary white blottingpaper” i said  “never mind  they know me at winks and pinks” she replied inconsequently  agatha apparently has an idea that blottingpaper is only sold in small quantities to persons of known reputation who may be trusted not to put it to dangerous or improper uses  after walking some two hundred yards she began to feel that her tea was of more immediate importance than my blottingpaper  “what do you want blottingpaper for” she asked suddenly  i explained patiently  “i use it to dry up the ink of wet manuscript without smudging the writing  probably a chinese invention of the second century before christ but i’m not sure  the only other use for it that i can think of is to roll it into a ball for a kitten to play with”  “but you haven’t got a kitten” said agatha with a feminine desire for stating the entire truth on most occasions  “a stray one might come in at any moment” i replied  anyway i didn’t get the blottingpaper     the bloodfeud of toadwater a westcountry epic   the cricks lived at toadwater and in the same lonely upland spot fate had pitched the home of the saunderses and for miles around these two dwellings there was never a neighbour or a chimney or even a buryingground to bring a sense of cheerful communion or social intercourse  nothing but fields and spinneys and barns lanes and wastelands  such was toadwater and even so toadwater had its history  thrust away in the benighted hinterland of a scattered market district it might have been supposed that these two detached items of the great human family would have leaned towards one another in a fellowship begotten of kindred circumstances and a common isolation from the outer world  and perhaps it had been so once but the way of things had brought it otherwise  indeed otherwise  fate which had linked the two families in such unavoidable association of habitat had ordained that the crick household should nourish and maintain among its earthly possessions sundry head of domestic fowls while to the saunderses was given a disposition towards the cultivation of garden crops  herein lay the material ready to hand for the coming of feud and illblood  for the grudge between the man of herbs and the man of live stock is no new thing you will find traces of it in the fourth chapter of genesis  and one sunny afternoon in late springtime the feud came—came as such things mostly do come with seeming aimlessness and triviality  one of the crick hens in obedience to the nomadic instincts of her kind wearied of her legitimate scratchingground and flew over the low wall that divided the holdings of the neighbours  and there on the yonder side with a hurried consciousness that her time and opportunities might be limited the misguided bird scratched and scraped and beaked and delved in the soft yielding bed that had been prepared for the solace and wellbeing of a colony of seedling onions  little showers of earthmould and rootfibres went spraying before the hen and behind her and every minute the area of her operations widened  the onions suffered considerably  mrs saunders sauntering at this luckless moment down the garden path in order to fill her soul with reproaches at the iniquity of the weeds which grew faster than she or her good man cared to remove them stopped in mute discomfiture before the presence of a more magnificent grievance  and then in the hour of her calamity she turned instinctively to the great mother and gathered in her capacious hands large clods of the hard brown soil that lay at her feet  with a terrible sincerity of purpose though with a contemptible inadequacy of aim she rained her earth bolts at the marauder and the bursting pellets called forth a flood of cackling protest and panic from the hastily departing fowl  calmness under misfortune is not an attribute of either henfolk or womenkind and while mrs saunders declaimed over her onion bed such portions of the slang dictionary as are permitted by the nonconformist conscience to be said or sung the vasco da gama fowl was waking the echoes of toadwater with crescendo bursts of throat music which compelled attention to her griefs  mrs crick had a long family and was therefore licensed in the eyes of her world to have a short temper and when some of her ubiquitous offspring had informed her with the authority of eyewitnesses that her neighbour had so far forgotten herself as to heave stones at her hen—her best hen the best layer in the countryside—her thoughts clothed themselves in language “unbecoming to a christian woman”—so at least said mrs saunders to whom most of the language was applied  nor was she on her part surprised at mrs crick’s conduct in letting her hens stray into other body’s gardens and then abusing of them seeing as how she remembered things against mrs crick—and the latter simultaneously had recollections of lurking episodes in the past of susan saunders that were nothing to her credit  “fond memory when all things fade we fly to thee” and in the paling light of an april afternoon the two women confronted each other from their respective sides of the party wall recalling with shuddering breath the blots and blemishes of their neighbour’s family record  there was that aunt of mrs crick’s who had died a pauper in exeter workhouse—every one knew that mrs saunders’ uncle on her mother’s side drank himself to death—then there was that bristol cousin of mrs crick’s  from the shrill triumph with which his name was dragged in his crime must have been pilfering from a cathedral at least but as both remembrancers were speaking at once it was difficult to distinguish his infamy from the scandal which beclouded the memory of mrs saunders’ brother’s wife’s mother—who may have been a regicide and was certainly not a nice person as mrs crick painted her  and then with an air of accumulating and irresistible conviction each belligerent informed the other that she was no lady—after which they withdrew in a great silence feeling that nothing further remained to be said  the chaffinches clinked in the apple trees and the bees droned round the berberis bushes and the waning sunlight slanted pleasantly across the garden plots but between the neighbour households had sprung up a barrier of hate permeating and permanent  the male heads of the families were necessarily drawn into the quarrel and the children on either side were forbidden to have anything to do with the unhallowed offspring of the other party  as they had to travel a good three miles along the same road to school every day this was awkward but such things have to be  thus all communication between the households was sundered  except the cats  much as mrs saunders might deplore it rumour persistently pointed to the crick hecat as the presumable father of sundry kittens of which the saunders shecat was indisputably the mother  mrs saunders drowned the kittens but the disgrace remained  summer succeeded spring and winter summer but the feud outlasted the waning seasons  once indeed it seemed as though the healing influences of religion might restore to toadwater its erstwhile peace the hostile families found themselves side by side in the soulkindling atmosphere of a revival tea where hymns were blended with a beverage that came of tealeaves and hot water and took after the latter parent and where ghostly counsel was tempered by garnishings of solidly fashioned buns—and here wrought up by the environment of festive piety mrs saunders so far unbent as to remark guardedly to mrs crick that the evening had been a fine one  mrs crick under the influence of her ninth cup of tea and her fourth hymn ventured on the hope that it might continue fine but a maladroit allusion on the part of the saunders good man to the backwardness of garden crops brought the feud stalking forth from its corner with all its old bitterness  mrs saunders joined heartily in the singing of the final hymn which told of peace and joy and archangels and golden glories but her thoughts were dwelling on the pauper aunt of exeter  years have rolled away and some of the actors in this wayside drama have passed into the unknown other onions have arisen have flourished have gone their way and the offending hen has long since expiated her misdeeds and lain with trussed feet and a look of ineffable peace under the arched roof of barnstaple market  but the bloodfeud of toadwater survives to this day     a young turkish catastrophe in two scenes   the minister for fine arts to whose department had been lately added the new subsection of electoral engineering paid a business visit to the grand vizier  according to eastern etiquette they discoursed for a while on indifferent subjects  the minister only checked himself in time from making a passing reference to the marathon race remembering that the vizier had a persian grandmother and might consider any allusion to marathon as somewhat tactless  presently the minister broached the subject of his interview  “under the new constitution are women to have votes” he asked suddenly  “to have votes  women” exclaimed the vizier in some astonishment  “my dear pasha the new departure has a flavour of the absurd as it is don’t let’s try and make it altogether ridiculous  women have no souls and no intelligence why on earth should they have votes”  “i know it sounds absurd” said the minister “but they are seriously considering the idea in the west”  “then they must have a larger equipment of seriousness than i gave them credit for  after a lifetime of specialised effort in maintaining my gravity i can scarcely restrain an inclination to smile at the suggestion  why out womenfolk in most cases don’t know how to read or write  how could they perform the operation of voting”  “they could be shown the names of the candidates and where to make their cross”  “i beg your pardon” interrupted the vizier  “their crescent i mean” corrected the minister  “it would be to the liking of the young turkish party” he added  “oh well” said the vizier “if we are to do the thing at all we may as well go the whole h” he pulled up just as he was uttering the name of an unclean animal and continued “the complete camel  i will issue instructions that womenfolk are to have votes”                                        the poll was drawing to a close in the lakoumistan division  the candidate of the young turkish party was known to be three or four hundred votes ahead and he was already drafting his address returning thanks to the electors  his victory had been almost a foregone conclusion for he had set in motion all the approved electioneering machinery of the west  he had even employed motorcars  few of his supporters had gone to the poll in these vehicles but thanks to the intelligent driving of his chauffeurs many of his opponents had gone to their graves or to the local hospitals or otherwise abstained from voting  and then something unlookedfor happened  the rival candidate ali the blest arrived on the scene with his wives and womenfolk who numbered roughly six hundred  ali had wasted little effort on election literature but had been heard to remark that every vote given to his opponent meant another sack thrown into the bosphorus  the young turkish candidate who had conformed to the western custom of one wife and hardly any mistresses stood by helplessly while his adversary’s poll swelled to a triumphant majority  “cristabel columbus” he exclaimed invoking in some confusion the name of a distinguished pioneer “who would have thought it”  “strange” mused ali “that one who harangued so clamorously about the secret ballot should have overlooked the veiled vote”  and walking homeward with his constituents he murmured in his beard an improvisation on the heretic poet of persia      “one rich in metaphors his cause contrives     to urge with edged words like kabul knives     and i who worst him in this sorry game     was never rich in anything but—wives”     judkin of the parcels   a figure in an indefinite tweed suit carrying brownpaper parcels  that is what we met suddenly at the bend of a muddy dorsetshire lane and the roan mare stared and obviously thought of a curtsey  the mare is roadshy with intervals of stolidity and there is no telling what she will pass and what she won’t  we call her redford  that was my first meeting with judkin and the next time the circumstances were the same the same muddy lane the same rather apologetic figure in the tweed suit the same—or very similar—parcels  only this time the roan looked straight in front of her  whether i asked the groom or whether he advanced the information i forget but someway i gradually reconstructed the lifehistory of this trudger of the lanes  it was much the same no doubt as that of many others who are from time to time pointed out to one as having been aforetime in crack cavalry regiments and noted performers in the saddle men who have breathed into their lungs the wonder of the east have romped through life as through a cotillon have had a thrust perhaps at the viceroy’s cup and done fantastic horsefleshy things around the gulf of aden  and then a golden stream has dried up the sunlight has faded suddenly out of things and the gods have nodded “go”  and they have not gone  they have turned instead to the muddy lanes and cheap villas and the markeddown ills of life to watch pear trees growing and to encourage hens for their eggs  and judkin was even as these others the wine had been suddenly spilt from his cup of life and he had stayed to suck at the dregs which the wise throw away  in the days of his scorn for most things he would have stared the roan mare and her turnout out of all pretension to smartness as he would have frozen a cheap claret behind its cork or a plain woman behind her veil and now he was walking stoically through the mud in a tweed suit that would eventually go on to the gardener’s boy and would perhaps fit him  the dear gods who know the end before the beginning were perhaps growing a gardener’s boy somewhere to fit the garments and judkin was only a caretaker inhabiting a portion of them  that is what i like to think and i am probably wrong  and judkin whose clothes had been to him once more than a religion scarcely less sacred than a family quarrel would carry those parcels back to his villa and to the wife who awaited him and them—a wife who may for all we know to the contrary have had a figure once and perhaps has yet a heart of gold—of ninecarat gold let us say at the least—but assuredly a soul of tape  and he that has fetched and carried will explain how it has fared with him in his dealings and if he has brought the wrong sort of sugar or thread he will wheedle away the displeasure from that leaden face as a pastrycook girl will drive bluebottles off a stale bun  and that man has known what it was to coax the fret of a thoroughbred to soothe its toss and sweat as it danced beneath him in the glee and chafe of its pulses and the glory of its thews  he has been in the raw places of the earth where the desert beasts have whimpered their unthinkable psalmody and their eyes have shone back the reflex of the midnight stars—and he can immerse himself in the tending of an incubator  it is horrible and wrong and yet when i have met him in the lanes his face has worn a look of tedious cheerfulness that might pass for happiness  has judkin of the parcels found something in the lees of life that i have missed in going to and fro over many waters  is there more wisdom in his perverseness than in the madness of the wise  the dear gods know  i don’t think i saw judkin more than three times all told and always the lane was our point of contact but as the roan mare was taking me to the station one heavy cloudsmeared day i passed a dulllooking villa that the groom or instinct told me was judkin’s home  from beyond a hedge of ragged elderbushes could be heard the thud thud of a spade with an occasional clink and pause as if some one had picked out a stone and thrown it to a distance and i knew that he was doing nameless things to the roots of a pear tree  near by him i felt sure would be lying a large and late vegetable marrow and its largeness and lateness would be a theme of conversation at luncheon  it would be suggested that it should grace the harvest thanksgiving service the harvest having been so generally unsatisfactory it would be unfair to let the farmers supply all the material for rejoicing  and while i was speeding townwards along the rails judkin would be plodding his way to the vicarage bearing a vegetable marrow and a basketful of dahlias  the basket to be returned     gabrielernest   “there is a wild beast in your woods” said the artist cunningham as he was being driven to the station  it was the only remark he had made during the drive but as van cheele had talked incessantly his companion’s silence had not been noticeable  “a stray fox or two and some resident weasels  nothing more formidable” said van cheele  the artist said nothing  “what did you mean about a wild beast” said van cheele later when they were on the platform  “nothing  my imagination  here is the train” said cunningham  that afternoon van cheele went for one of his frequent rambles through his woodland property  he had a stuffed bittern in his study and knew the names of quite a number of wild flowers so his aunt had possibly some justification in describing him as a great naturalist  at any rate he was a great walker  it was his custom to take mental notes of everything he saw during his walks not so much for the purpose of assisting contemporary science as to provide topics for conversation afterwards  when the bluebells began to show themselves in flower he made a point of informing every one of the fact the season of the year might have warned his hearers of the likelihood of such an occurrence but at least they felt that he was being absolutely frank with them  what van cheele saw on this particular afternoon was however something far removed from his ordinary range of experience  on a shelf of smooth stone overhanging a deep pool in the hollow of an oak coppice a boy of about sixteen lay asprawl drying his wet brown limbs luxuriously in the sun  his wet hair parted by a recent dive lay close to his head and his lightbrown eyes so light that there was an almost tigerish gleam in them were turned towards van cheele with a certain lazy watchfulness it was an unexpected apparition and van cheele found himself engaged in the novel process of thinking before he spoke  where on earth could this wildlooking boy hail from  the miller’s wife had lost a child some two months ago supposed to have been swept away by the millrace but that had been a mere baby not a halfgrown lad  “what are you doing there” he demanded  “obviously sunning myself” replied the boy  “where do you live”  “here in these woods”  “you can’t live in the woods” said van cheele  “they are very nice woods” said the boy with a touch of patronage in his voice  “but where do you sleep at night”  “i don’t sleep at night that’s my busiest time”  van cheele began to have an irritated feeling that he was grappling with a problem that was eluding him  “what do you feed on” he asked  “flesh” said the boy and he pronounced the word with slow relish as though he were tasting it  “flesh  what flesh”  “since it interests you rabbits wildfowl hares poultry lambs in their season children when i can get any they’re usually too well locked in at night when i do most of my hunting  it’s quite two months since i tasted childflesh”  ignoring the chaffing nature of the last remark van cheele tried to draw the boy on the subject of possible poaching operations  “you’re talking rather through your hat when you speak of feeding on hares”  considering the nature of the boy’s toilet the simile was hardly an apt one  “our hillside hares aren’t easily caught”  “at night i hunt on four feet” was the somewhat cryptic response  “i suppose you mean that you hunt with a dog” hazarded van cheele  the boy rolled slowly over on to his back and laughed a weird low laugh that was pleasantly like a chuckle and disagreeably like a snarl  “i don’t fancy any dog would be very anxious for my company especially at night”  van cheele began to feel that there was something positively uncanny about the strangeeyed strangetongued youngster  “i can’t have you staying in these woods” he declared authoritatively  “i fancy you’d rather have me here than in your house” said the boy  the prospect of this wild nude animal in van cheele’s primly ordered house was certainly an alarming one  “if you don’t go  i shall have to make you” said van cheele  the boy turned like a flash plunged into the pool and in a moment had flung his wet and glistening body halfway up the bank where van cheele was standing  in an otter the movement would not have been remarkable in a boy van cheele found it sufficiently startling  his foot slipped as he made an involuntarily backward movement and he found himself almost prostrate on the slippery weedgrown bank with those tigerish yellow eyes not very far from his own  almost instinctively he half raised his hand to his throat  they boy laughed again a laugh in which the snarl had nearly driven out the chuckle and then with another of his astonishing lightning movements plunged out of view into a yielding tangle of weed and fern  “what an extraordinary wild animal” said van cheele as he picked himself up  and then he recalled cunningham’s remark “there is a wild beast in your woods”  walking slowly homeward van cheele began to turn over in his mind various local occurrences which might be traceable to the existence of this astonishing young savage  something had been thinning the game in the woods lately poultry had been missing from the farms hares were growing unaccountably scarcer and complaints had reached him of lambs being carried off bodily from the hills  was it possible that this wild boy was really hunting the countryside in company with some clever poacher dogs  he had spoken of hunting “fourfooted” by night but then again he had hinted strangely at no dog caring to come near him “especially at night”  it was certainly puzzling  and then as van cheele ran his mind over the various depredations that had been committed during the last month or two he came suddenly to a dead stop alike in his walk and his speculations  the child missing from the mill two months ago—the accepted theory was that it had tumbled into the millrace and been swept away but the mother had always declared she had heard a shriek on the hill side of the house in the opposite direction from the water  it was unthinkable of course but he wished that the boy had not made that uncanny remark about childflesh eaten two months ago  such dreadful things should not be said even in fun  van cheele contrary to his usual wont did not feel disposed to be communicative about his discovery in the wood  his position as a parish councillor and justice of the peace seemed somehow compromised by the fact that he was harbouring a personality of such doubtful repute on his property there was even a possibility that a heavy bill of damages for raided lambs and poultry might be laid at his door  at dinner that night he was quite unusually silent  “where’s your voice gone to” said his aunt  “one would think you had seen a wolf”  van cheele who was not familiar with the old saying thought the remark rather foolish if he had seen a wolf on his property his tongue would have been extraordinarily busy with the subject  at breakfast next morning van cheele was conscious that his feeling of uneasiness regarding yesterday’s episode had not wholly disappeared and he resolved to go by train to the neighbouring cathedral town hunt up cunningham and learn from him what he had really seen that had prompted the remark about a wild beast in the woods  with this resolution taken his usual cheerfulness partially returned and he hummed a bright little melody as he sauntered to the morningroom for his customary cigarette as he entered the room the melody made way abruptly for a pious invocation  gracefully asprawl on the ottoman in an attitude of almost exaggerated repose was the boy of the woods  he was drier than when van cheele had last seen him but no other alteration was noticeable in his toilet  “how dare you come here” asked van cheele furiously  “you told me i was not to stay in the woods” said the boy calmly  “but not to come here  supposing my aunt should see you”  and with a view to minimising that catastrophe van cheele hastily obscured as much of his unwelcome guest as possible under the folds of a morning post  at that moment his aunt entered the room  “this is a poor boy who has lost his way—and lost his memory  he doesn’t know who he is or where he comes from” explained van cheele desperately glancing apprehensively at the waif’s face to see whether he was going to add inconvenient candour to his other savage propensities  miss van cheele was enormously interested  “perhaps his underlinen is marked” she suggested  “he seems to have lost most of that too” said van cheele making frantic little grabs at the morning post to keep it in its place  a naked homeless child appealed to miss van cheele as warmly as a stray kitten or derelict puppy would have done  “we must do all we can for him” she decided and in a very short time a messenger dispatched to the rectory where a pageboy was kept had returned with a suit of pantry clothes and the necessary accessories of shirt shoes collar etc  clothed clean and groomed the boy lost none of his uncanniness in van cheele’s eyes but his aunt found him sweet  “we must call him something till we know who he really is” she said “gabrielernest i think those are nice suitable names”  van cheele agreed but he privately doubted whether they were being grafted on to a nice suitable child  his misgivings were not diminished by the fact that his staid and elderly spaniel had bolted out of the house at the first incoming of the boy and now obstinately remained shivering and yapping at the farther end of the orchard while the canary usually as vocally industrious as van cheele himself had put itself on an allowance of frightened cheeps  more than ever he was resolved to consult cunningham without loss of time  as he drove off to the station his aunt was arranging that gabrielernest should help her to entertain the infant members of her sundayschool class at tea that afternoon  cunningham was not at first disposed to be communicative  “my mother died of some brain trouble” he explained “so you will understand why i am averse to dwelling on anything of an impossibly fantastic nature that i may see or think that i have seen”  “but what did you see” persisted van cheele  “what i thought i saw was something so extraordinary that no really sane man could dignify it with the credit of having actually happened  i was standing the last evening i was with you halfhidden in the hedgegrowth by the orchard gate watching the dying glow of the sunset suddenly i became aware of a naked boy a bather from some neighbouring pool i took him to be who was standing out on the bare hillside also watching the sunset  his pose was so suggestive of some wild faun of pagan myth that i instantly wanted to engage him as a model and in another moment i think i should have hailed him  but just then the sun dipped out of view and all the orange and pink slid out of the landscape leaving it cold and grey  and at the same moment an astounding thing happened—the boy vanished too”  “what vanished away into nothing” asked van cheele excitedly  “no that is the dreadful part of it” answered the artist “on the open hillside where the boy had been standing a second ago stood a large wolf blackish in colour with gleaming fangs and cruel yellow eyes you may think—”  but van cheele did not stop for anything as futile as thought  already he was tearing at top speed towards the station  he dismissed the idea of a telegram  “gabrielernest is a werewolf” was a hopelessly inadequate effort at conveying the situation and his aunt would think it was a code message to which he had omitted to give her the key  his one hope was that he might reach home before sundown  the cab which he chartered at the other end of the railway journey bore him with what seemed exasperating slowness along the country roads which were pink and mauve with the flush of the sinking sun  his aunt was putting away some unfinished jams and cake when he arrived  “where is gabrielernest” he almost screamed  “he is taking the little toop child home” said his aunt  “it was getting so late i thought it wasn’t safe to let it go back alone  what a lovely sunset isn’t it”  but van cheele although not oblivious of the glow in the western sky did not stay to discuss its beauties  at a speed for which he was scarcely geared he raced along the narrow lane that led to the home of the toops  on one side ran the swift current of the millstream on the other rose the stretch of bare hillside  a dwindling rim of red sun showed still on the skyline and the next turning must bring him in view of the illassorted couple he was pursuing  then the colour went suddenly out of things and a grey light settled itself with a quick shiver over the landscape  van cheele heard a shrill wail of fear and stopped running  nothing was ever seen again of the toop child or gabrielernest but the latter’s discarded garments were found lying in the road so it was assumed that the child had fallen into the water and that the boy had stripped and jumped in in a vain endeavour to save it  van cheele and some workmen who were near by at the time testified to having heard a child scream loudly just near the spot where the clothes were found mrs toop who had eleven other children was decently resigned to her bereavement but miss van cheele sincerely mourned her lost foundling it was on her initiative that a memorial brass was put up in the parish church to “gabrielernest an unknown boy who bravely sacrificed his life for another”  van cheele gave way to his aunt in most things but he flatly refused to subscribe to the gabrielernest memorial     the saint and the goblin   the little stone saint occupied a retired niche in a side aisle of the old cathedral  no one quite remembered who he had been but that in a way was a guarantee of respectability  at least so the goblin said  the goblin was a very fine specimen of quaint stone carving and lived up in the corbel on the wall opposite the niche of the little saint  he was connected with some of the best cathedral folk such as the queer carvings in the choir stalls and chancel screen and even the gargoyles high up on the roof  all the fantastic beasts and manikins that sprawled and twisted in wood or stone or lead overhead in the arches or away down in the crypt were in some way akin to him consequently he was a person of recognised importance in the cathedral world  the little stone saint and the goblin got on very well together though they looked at most things from different points of view  the saint was a philanthropist in an old fashioned way he thought the world as he saw it was good but might be improved  in particular he pitied the church mice who were miserably poor  the goblin on the other hand was of opinion that the world as he knew it was bad but had better be let alone  it was the function of the church mice to be poor  “all the same” said the saint “i feel very sorry for them”  “of course you do” said the goblin “it’s your function to feel sorry for them  if they were to leave off being poor you couldn’t fulfil your functions  you’d be a sinecure”  he rather hoped that the saint would ask him what a sinecure meant but the latter took refuge in a stony silence  the goblin might be right but still he thought he would like to do something for the church mice before winter came on they were so very poor  whilst he was thinking the matter over he was startled by something falling between his feet with a hard metallic clatter  it was a bright new thaler one of the cathedral jackdaws who collected such things had flown in with it to a stone cornice just above his niche and the banging of the sacristy door had startled him into dropping it  since the invention of gunpowder the family nerves were not what they had been  “what have you got there” asked the goblin  “a silver thaler” said the saint  “really” he continued “it is most fortunate now i can do something for the church mice”  “how will you manage it” asked the goblin  the saint considered  “i will appear in a vision to the vergeress who sweeps the floors  i will tell her that she will find a silver thaler between my feet and that she must take it and buy a measure of corn and put it on my shrine when she finds the money she will know that it was a true dream and she will take care to follow my directions  then the mice will have food all the winter”  “of course you can do that” observed the goblin  “now i can only appear to people after they have had a heavy supper of indigestible things  my opportunities with the vergeress would be limited  there is some advantage in being a saint after all”  all this while the coin was lying at the saint’s feet  it was clean and glittering and had the elector’s arms beautifully stamped upon it  the saint began to reflect that such an opportunity was too rare to be hastily disposed of  perhaps indiscriminate charity might be harmful to the church mice  after all it was their function to be poor the goblin had said so and the goblin was generally right  “i’ve been thinking” he said to that personage “that perhaps it would be really better if i ordered a thaler’s worth of candles to be placed on my shrine instead of the corn”  he often wished for the look of the thing that people would sometimes burn candles at his shrine but as they had forgotten who he was it was not considered a profitable speculation to pay him that attention  “candles would be more orthodox” said the goblin  “more orthodox certainly” agreed the saint “and the mice could have the ends to eat candleends are most fattening”  the goblin was too well bred to wink besides being a stone goblin it was out of the question                                        “well if it ain’t there sure enough” said the vergeress next morning she took the shining coin down from the dusty niche and turned it over and over in her grimy hands  then she put it to her mouth and bit it  “she can’t be going to eat it” thought the saint and fixed her with his stoniest stare  “well” said the woman in a somewhat shriller key “who’d have thought it  a saint too”  then she did an unaccountable thing  she hunted an old piece of tape out of her pocket and tied to crosswise with a big loop round the thaler and hung it round the neck of the little saint  then she went away  “the only possible explanation” said the goblin “is that it’s a bad one”                                        “what is that decoration your neighbour is wearing” asked a wyvern that was wrought into the capital of an adjacent pillar  the saint was ready to cry with mortification only being of stone he couldn’t  “it’s a coin of—ahem—fabulous value” replied the goblin tactfully  and the news went round the cathedral that the shrine of the little stone saint had been enriched by a priceless offering  “after all it’s something to have the conscience of a goblin” said the saint to himself  the church mice were as poor as ever  but that was their function     the soul of laploshka   laploshka was one of the meanest men i have ever met and quite one of the most entertaining  he said horrid things about other people in such a charming way that one forgave him for the equally horrid things he said about oneself behind one’s back  hating anything in the way of illnatured gossip ourselves we are always grateful to those who do it for us and do it well  and laploshka did it really well  naturally laploshka had a large circle of acquaintances and as he exercised some care in their selection it followed that an appreciable proportion were men whose bank balances enabled them to acquiesce indulgently in his rather onesided views on hospitality  thus although possessed of only moderate means he was able to live comfortably within his income and still more comfortably within those of various tolerantly disposed associates  but towards the poor or to those of the same limited resources as himself his attitude was one of watchful anxiety he seemed to be haunted by a besetting fear lest some fraction of a shilling or franc or whatever the prevailing coinage might be should be diverted from his pocket or service into that of a hardup companion  a twofranc cigar would be cheerfully offered to a wealthy patron on the principle of doing evil that good may come but i have known him indulge in agonies of perjury rather than admit the incriminating possession of a copper coin when change was needed to tip a waiter  the coin would have been duly returned at the earliest opportunity—he would have taken means to insure against forgetfulness on the part of the borrower—but accidents might happen and even the temporary estrangement from his penny or sou was a calamity to be avoided  the knowledge of this amiable weakness offered a perpetual temptation to play upon laploshka’s fears of involuntary generosity  to offer him a lift in a cab and pretend not to have enough money to pay the fair to fluster him with a request for a sixpence when his hand was full of silver just received in change these were a few of the petty torments that ingenuity prompted as occasion afforded  to do justice to laploshka’s resourcefulness it must be admitted that he always emerged somehow or other from the most embarrassing dilemma without in any way compromising his reputation for saying “no”  but the gods send opportunities at some time to most men and mine came one evening when laploshka and i were supping together in a cheap boulevard restaurant except when he was the bidden guest of some one with an irreproachable income laploshka was wont to curb his appetite for high living on such fortunate occasions he let it go on an easy snaffle  at the conclusion of the meal a somewhat urgent message called me away and without heeding my companion’s agitated protest i called back cruelly “pay my share i’ll settle with you tomorrow”  early on the morrow laploshka hunted me down by instinct as i walked along a side street that i hardly ever frequented  he had the air of a man who had not slept  “you owe me two francs from last night” was his breathless greeting  i spoke evasively of the situation in portugal where more trouble seemed brewing  but laploshka listened with the abstraction of the deaf adder and quickly returned to the subject of the two francs  “i’m afraid i must owe it to you” i said lightly and brutally  “i haven’t a sou in the world” and i added mendaciously “i’m going away for six months or perhaps longer”  laploshka said nothing but his eyes bulged a little and his cheeks took on the mottled hues of an ethnographical map of the balkan peninsula that same day at sundown he died  “failure of the heart’s action” was the doctor’s verdict but i who knew better knew that he died of grief  there arose the problem of what to do with his two francs  to have killed laploshka was one thing to have kept his beloved money would have argued a callousness of feeling of which i am not capable  the ordinary solution of giving it to the poor would by no means fit the present situation for nothing would have distressed the dead man more than such a misuse of his property  on the other hand the bestowal of two francs on the rich was an operation which called for some tact  an easy way out of the difficulty seemed however to present itself the following sunday as i was wedged into the cosmopolitan crowd which filled the sideaisle of one of the most popular paris churches  a collectingbag for “the poor of monsieur le curé” was buffeting its tortuous way across the seemingly impenetrable human sea and a german in front of me who evidently did not wish his appreciation of the magnificent music to be marred by a suggestion of payment made audible criticisms to his companion on the claims of the said charity  “they do not want money” he said “they have too much money  they have no poor  they are all pampered”  if that were really the case my way seemed clear  i dropped laploshka’s two francs into the bag with a murmured blessing on the rich of monsieur le curé  some three weeks later chance had taken me to vienna and i sat one evening regaling myself in a humble but excellent little gasthaus up in the wahringer quarter  the appointments were primitive but the schnitzel the beer and the cheese could not have been improved on good cheer brought good custom and with the exception of one small table near the door every place was occupied  halfway through my meal i happened to glance in the direction of that empty seat and saw that it was no longer empty  poring over the bill of fare with the absorbed scrutiny of one who seeks the cheapest among the cheap was laploshka once he looked across at me with a comprehensive glance at my repast as though to say “it is my two francs you are eating” and then looked swiftly away  evidently the poor of monsieur le curé had been genuine poor  the schnitzel turned to leather in my mouth the beer seemed tepid i left the emmenthaler untasted  my one idea was to get away from the room away from the table where that was seated and as i fled i felt laploshka’s reproachful eyes watching the amount that i gave to the piccolo—out of his two francs  i lunched next day at an expensive restaurant which i felt sure that the living laploshka would never have entered on his own account and i hoped that the dead laploshka would observe the same barriers  i was not mistaken but as i came out i found him miserably studying the bill of fare stuck up on the portals  then he slowly made his way over to a milkhall  for the first time in my experience i missed the charm and gaiety of vienna life  after that in paris or london or wherever i happened to be i continued to see a good deal of laploshka  if i had a seat in a box at a theatre i was always conscious of his eyes furtively watching me from the dim recesses of the gallery  as i turned into my club on a rainy afternoon i would see him taking inadequate shelter in a doorway opposite  even if i indulged in the modest luxury of a penny chair in the park he generally confronted me from one of the free benches never staring at me but always elaborately conscious of my presence  my friends began to comment on my changed looks and advised me to leave off heaps of things  i should have liked to have left off laploshka  on a certain sunday—it was probably easter for the crush was worse than ever—i was again wedged into the crowd listening to the music in the fashionable paris church and again the collectionbag was buffeting its way across the human sea  an english lady behind me was making ineffectual efforts to convey a coin into the still distant bag so i took the money at her request and helped it forward to its destination it was a twofranc piece  a swift inspiration came to me and i merely dropped my own sou into the bag and slid the silver coin into my pocket i had withdrawn laploshka’s two francs from the poor who should never have had the legacy  as i backed away from the crowd i heard a woman’s voice say “i don’t believe he put my money in the bag  there are swarms of people in paris like that”  but my mind was lighter that it had been for a long time  the delicate mission of bestowing the retrieved sum on the deserving rich still confronted me  again i trusted to the inspiration of accident and again fortune favoured me  a shower drove me two days later into one of the historic churches on the left bank of the seine and there i found peering at the old woodcarvings the baron r one of the wealthiest and most shabbily dressed men in paris  it was now or never putting a strong american inflection into the french which i usually talked with an unmistakable british accent i catechised the baron as to the date of the church’s building its dimensions and other details which an american tourist would be certain to want to know  having acquired such information as the baron was able to impart on short notice i solemnly placed the twofranc piece in his hand with the hearty assurance that it was “pour vous” and turned to go  the baron was slightly taken aback but accepted the situation with a good grace walking over to a small box fixed in the wall he dropped laploshka’s two francs into the slot  over the box was the inscription “pour les pauvres de m le curé”  that evening at the crowded corner by the cafe de la paix i caught a fleeting glimpse of laploshka  he smiled slightly raised his hat and vanished  i never saw him again  after all the money had been given to the deserving rich and the soul of laploshka was at peace     the bag   “the major is coming in to tea” said mrs hoopington to her niece “he’s just gone round to the stables with his horse  be as bright and lively as you can the poor man’s got a fit of the glooms”  major pallaby was a victim of circumstances over which he had no control and of his temper over which he had very little  he had taken on the mastership of the pexdale hounds in succession to a highly popular man who had fallen foul of his committee and the major found himself confronted with the overt hostility of at least half the hunt while his lack of tact and amiability had done much to alienate the remainder hence subscriptions were beginning to fall off foxes grew provokingly scarcer and wire obtruded itself with increasing frequency  the major could plead reasonable excuse for his fit of the glooms  in ranging herself as a partisan on the side of major pallaby mrs hoopington had been largely influenced by the fact that she had made up her mind to marry him at an early date  against his notorious bad temper she set his three thousand a year and his prospective succession to a baronetcy gave a casting vote in his favour  the major’s plans on the subject of matrimony were not at present in such an advanced stage as mrs hoopington’s but he was beginning to find his way over to hoopington hall with a frequency that was already being commented on  “he had a wretchedly thin field out again yesterday” said mrs hoopington  “why you didn’t bring one or two hunting men down with you instead of that stupid russian boy i can’t think”  “vladimir isn’t stupid” protested her niece “he’s one of the most amusing boys i ever met  just compare him for a moment with some of your heavy hunting men—”  “anyhow my dear norah he can’t ride”  “russians never can but he shoots”  “yes and what does he shoot  yesterday he brought home a woodpecker in his gamebag”  “but he’d shot three pheasants and some rabbits as well”  “that’s no excuse for including a woodpecker in his gamebag”  “foreigners go in for mixed bags more than we do  a grand duke pots a vulture just as seriously as we should stalk a bustard  anyhow i’ve explained to vladimir that certain birds are beneath his dignity as a sportsman  and as he’s only nineteen of course his dignity is a sure thing to appeal to”  mrs hoopington sniffed  most people with whom vladimir came in contact found his high spirits infectious but his present hostess was guaranteed immune against infection of that sort  “i hear him coming in now” she observed  “i shall go and get ready for tea  we’re going to have it here in the hall  entertain the major if he comes in before i’m down and above all be bright”  norah was dependent on her aunt’s good graces for many little things that made life worth living and she was conscious of a feeling of discomfiture because the russian youth whom she had brought down as a welcome element of change in the countryhouse routine was not making a good impression  that young gentleman however was supremely unconscious of any shortcomings and burst into the hall tired and less sprucely groomed than usual but distinctly radiant  his gamebag looked comfortably full  “guess what i have shot” he demanded  “pheasants woodpigeons rabbits” hazarded norah  “no a large beast i don’t know what you call it in english  brown with a darkish tail”  norah changed colour  “does it live in a tree and eat nuts” she asked hoping that the use of the adjective “large” might be an exaggeration  vladimir laughed  “oh no not a biyelka”  “does it swim and eat fish” asked norah with a fervent prayer in her heart that it might turn out to be an otter  “no” said vladimir busy with the straps of his gamebag “it lives in the woods and eats rabbits and chickens”  norah sat down suddenly and hid her face in her hands  “merciful heaven” she wailed “he’s shot a fox”  vladimir looked up at her in consternation  in a torrent of agitated words she tried to explain the horror of the situation  the boy understood nothing but was thoroughly alarmed  “hide it hide it” said norah frantically pointing to the still unopened bag  “my aunt and the major will be here in a moment  throw it on the top of that chest they won’t see it there”  vladimir swung the bag with fair aim but the strap caught in its flight on the outstanding point of an antler fixed in the wall and the bag with its terrible burden remained suspended just above the alcove where tea would presently be laid  at that moment mrs hoopington and the major entered the hall  “the major is going to draw our covers tomorrow” announced the lady with a certain heavy satisfaction  “smithers is confident that we’ll be able to show him some sport he swears he’s seen a fox in the nut copse three times this week”  “i’m sure i hope so i hope so” said the major moodily  “i must break this sequence of blank days  one hears so often that a fox has settled down as a tenant for life in certain covers and then when you go to turn him out there isn’t a trace of him  i’m certain a fox was shot or trapped in lady widden’s woods the very day before we drew them”  “major if any one tried that game on in my woods they’d get short shrift” said mrs hoopington  norah found her way mechanically to the teatable and made her fingers frantically busy in rearranging the parsley round the sandwich dish  on one side of her loomed the morose countenance of the major on the other she was conscious of the scared miserable eyes of vladimir  and above it all hung that  she dared not raise her eyes above the level of the teatable and she almost expected to see a spot of accusing vulpine blood drip down and stain the whiteness of the cloth  her aunt’s manner signalled to her the repeated message to “be bright” for the present she was fully occupied in keeping her teeth from chattering  “what did you shoot today” asked mrs hoopington suddenly of the unusually silent vladimir  “nothing—nothing worth speaking of” said the boy  norah’s heart which had stood still for a space made up for lost time with a most disturbing bound  “i wish you’d find something that was worth speaking about” said the hostess “every one seems to have lost their tongues”  “when did smithers last see that fox” said the major  “yesterday morning a fine dogfox with a dark brush” confided mrs hoopington  “aha we’ll have a good gallop after that brush tomorrow” said the major with a transient gleam of good humour  and then gloomy silence settled again round the teatable a silence broken only by despondent munchings and the occasional feverish rattle of a teaspoon in its saucer a diversion was at last afforded by mrs hoopington’s foxterrier which had jumped on to a vacant chair the better to survey the delicacies of the table and was now sniffing in an upward direction at something apparently more interesting than cold teacake  “what is exciting him” asked his mistress as the dog suddenly broke into short angry barks with a running accompaniment of tremulous whines  “why” she continued “it’s your gamebag vladimir  what have you got in it”  “by gad” said the major who was now standing up “there’s a pretty warm scent”  and then a simultaneous idea flashed on himself and mrs hoopington their faces flushed to distinct but harmonious tones of purple and with one accusing voice they screamed “you’ve shot the fox”  norah tried hastily to palliate vladimir’s misdeed in their eyes but it is doubtful whether they heard her  the major’s fury clothed and reclothed itself in words as frantically as a woman up in town for one day’s shopping tries on a succession of garments  he reviled and railed at fate and the general scheme of things he pitied himself with a strong deep pity too poignent for tears he condemned every one with whom he had ever come in contact to endless and abnormal punishments  in fact he conveyed the impression that if a destroying angel had been lent to him for a week it would have had very little time for private study in the lulls of his outcry could be heard the querulous monotone of mrs hoopington and the sharp staccato barking of the foxterrier  vladimir who did not understand a tithe of what was being said sat fondling a cigarette and repeating under his breath from time to time a vigorous english adjective which he had long ago taken affectionately into his vocabulary  his mind strayed back to the youth in the old russian folktale who shot an enchanted bird with dramatic results  meanwhile the major roaming round the hall like an imprisoned cyclone had caught sight of and joyfully pounced on the telephone apparatus and lost no time in ringing up the hunt secretary and announcing his resignation of the mastership  a servant had by this time brought his horse round to the door and in a few seconds mrs hoopington’s shrill monotone had the field to itself  but after the major’s display her best efforts at vocal violence missed their full effect it was as though one had come straight out from a wagner opera into a rather tame thunderstorm  realising perhaps that her tirades were something of an anticlimax mrs hoopington broke suddenly into some rather necessary tears and marched out of the room leaving behind her a silence almost as terrible as the turmoil which had preceded it  “what shall i do with—that” asked vladimir at last  “bury it” said norah  “just plain burial” said vladimir rather relieved  he had almost expected that some of the local clergy would have insisted on being present or that a salute might have to be fired over the grave  and thus it came to pass that in the dusk of a november evening the russian boy murmuring a few of the prayers of his church for luck gave hasty but decent burial to a large polecat under the lilac trees at hoopington     the strategist   mrs jallatt’s young people’s parties were severely exclusive it came cheaper that way because you could ask fewer to them  mrs jallatt didn’t study cheapness but somehow she generally attained it  “there’ll be about ten girls” speculated rollo as he drove to the function “and i suppose four fellows unless the wrotsleys bring their cousin which heaven forbid  that would mean jack and me against three of them”  rollo and the wrotsley brethren had maintained an undying feud almost from nursery days  they only met now and then in the holidays and the meeting was usually tragic for whichever happened to have the fewest backers on hand  rollo was counting tonight on the presence of a devoted and muscular partisan to hold an even balance  as he arrived he heard his prospective champion’s sister apologising to the hostess for the unavoidable absence of her brother a moment later he noted that the wrotsleys had brought their cousin  two against three would have been exciting and possibly unpleasant one against three promised to be about as amusing as a visit to the dentist rollo ordered his carriage for as early as was decently possible and faced the company with a smile that he imagined the better sort of aristocrat would have worn when mounting to the guillotine  “so glad you were able to come” said the elder wrotsley heartily  “now you children will like to play games i suppose” said mrs jallatt by way of giving things a start and as they were too wellbred to contradict her there only remained the question of what they were to play at  “i know of a good game” said the elder wrotsley innocently  “the fellows leave the room and think of a word then they come back again and the girls have to find out what the word is”  rollo knew the game  he would have suggested it himself if his faction had been in the majority  “it doesn’t promise to be very exciting” sniffed the superior dolores sneep as the boys filed out of the room  rollo thought differently  he trusted to providence that wrotsley had nothing worse than knotted handkerchiefs at his disposal  the wordchoosers locked themselves in the library to ensure that their deliberations should not be interrupted  providence turned out to be not even decently neutral on a rack on the library wall were a dogwhip and a whalebone ridingswitch  rollo thought it criminal negligence to leave such weapons of precision lying about  he was given a choice of evils and chose the dogwhip the next minute or so he spent in wondering how he could have made such a stupid selection  then they went back to the languidly expectant females  “the word’s ‘camel’” announced the wrotsley cousin blunderingly  “you stupid” screamed the girls “we’ve got to guess the word  now you’ll have to go back and think of another”  “not for worlds” said rollo “i mean the word isn’t really camel we were rotting  pretend it’s dromedary” he whispered to the others  “i heard them say ‘dromedary’  i heard them  i don’t care what you say i heard them” squealed the odious dolores  “with ears as long as hers one would hear anything” thought rollo savagely  “we shall have to go back i suppose” said the elder wrotsley resignedly  the conclave locked itself once more into the library  “look here i’m not going through that dogwhip business again” protested rollo  “certainly not dear” said the elder wrotsley “we’ll try the whalebone switch this time and you’ll know which hurts most  it’s only by personal experience that one finds out these things”  it was swiftly borne in upon rollo that his earlier selection of the dogwhip had been a really sound one  the conclave gave his underlip time to steady itself while it debated the choice of the necessary word “mustang” was no good as half the girls wouldn’t know what it meant finally “quagga” was pitched on  “you must come and sit down over here” chorused the investigating committee on their return but rollo was obdurate in insisting that the questioned person always stood up  on the whole it was a relief when the game was ended and supper was announced  mrs jallatt did not stint her young guests but the more expensive delicacies of her suppertable were never unnecessarily duplicated and it was usually good policy to take what you wanted while it was still there  on this occasion she had provided sixteen peaches to “go round” among fourteen children it was really not her fault that the two wrotsleys and their cousin foreseeing the long foodless drive home had each quietly pocketed an extra peach but it was distinctly trying for dolores and the fat and goodnatured agnes blaik to be left with one peach between them  “i suppose we had better halve it” said dolores sourly  but agnes was fat first and goodnatured afterwards those were her guiding principles in life  she was profuse in her sympathy for dolores but she hastily devoured the peach explaining that it would spoil it to divide it the juice ran out so  “now what would you all like to do” demanded mrs jallatt by way of diversion  “the professional conjurer whom i had engaged has failed me at the last moment  can any of you recite”  there were symptoms of a general panic  dolores was known to recite “locksley hall” on the least provocation  there had been occasions when her opening line “comrades leave me here a little” had been taken as a literal injunction by a large section of her hearers  there was a murmur of relief when rollo hastily declared that he could do a few conjuring tricks  he had never done one in his life but those two visits to the library had goaded him to unusual recklessness  “you’ve seen conjuring chaps take coins and cards out of people” he announced “well i’m going to take more interesting things out of some of you  mice for instance”  “not mice”  a shrill protest rose as he had foreseen from the majority of his audience  “well fruit them”  the amended proposal was received with approval  agnes positively beamed  without more ado rollo made straight for his trio of enemies plunged his hand successively into their breastpockets and produced three peaches there was no applause but no amount of handclapping would have given the performer as much pleasure as the silence which greeted his coup  “of course we were in the know” said the wrotsley cousin lamely  “that’s done it” chuckled rollo to himself  “if they had been confederates they would have sworn they knew nothing about it” said dolores with piercing conviction  “do you know any more tricks” asked mrs jallatt hurriedly  rollo did not  he hinted that he might have changed the three peaches into something else but agnes had already converted one into girlfood so nothing more could be done in that direction  “i know a game” said the elder wrotsley heavily “where the fellows go out of the room and think of some character in history then they come back and act him and the girls have to guess who it’s meant for”  “i’m afraid i must be going” said rollo to his hostess  “your carriage won’t be here for another twenty minutes” said mrs jallatt  “it’s such a fine evening i think i’ll walk and meet it”  “it’s raining rather steadily at present  you’ve just time to play that historical game”  “we haven’t heard dolores recite” said rollo desperately as soon as he had said it he realised his mistake  confronted with the alternative of “locksley hall” public opinion declared unanimously for the history game  rollo played his last card  in an undertone meant apparently for the wrotsley boy but carefully pitched to reach agnes he observed—  “all right old man we’ll go and finish those chocolates we left in the library”  “i think it’s only fair that the girls should take their turn in going out” exclaimed agnes briskly  she was great on fairness  “nonsense” said the others “there are too many of us”  “well four of us can go  i’ll be one of them”  and agnes darted off towards the library followed by three less eager damsels  rollo sank into a chair and smiled ever so faintly at the wrotsleys just a momentary baring of the teeth an otter escaping from the fangs of the hounds into the safety of a deep pool might have given a similar demonstration of feelings  from the library came the sound of moving furniture  agnes was leaving nothing unturned in her quest for the mythical chocolates  and then came a more blessed sound wheels crunching wet gravel  “it has been a most enjoyable evening” said rollo to his hostess     cross currents   vanessa pennington had a husband who was poor with few extenuating circumstances and an admirer who though comfortably rich was cumbered with a sense of honour  his wealth made him welcome in vanessa’s eyes but his code of what was right impelled him to go away and forget her or at the most to think of her in the intervals of doing a great many other things  and although alaric clyde loved vanessa and thought he should always go on loving her he gradually and unconsciously allowed himself to be wooed and won by a more alluring mistress he fancied that his continued shunning of the haunts of men was a selfimposed exile but his heart was caught in the spell of the wilderness and the wilderness was kind and beautiful to him  when one is young and strong and unfettered the wild earth can be very kind and very beautiful  witness the legion of men who were once young and unfettered and now eat out their souls in dustbins because having erstwhile known and loved the wilderness they broke from her thrall and turned aside into beaten paths  in the high waste places of the world clyde roamed and hunted and dreamed deathdealing and gracious as some god of hellas moving with his horses and servants and fourfooted camp followers from one dwelling ground to another a welcome guest among wild primitive village folk and nomads a friend and slayer of the fleet shy beasts around him  by the shores of misty upland lakes he shot the wild fowl that had winged their way to him across half the old world beyond bokhara he watched the wild aryan horsemen at their gambols watched too in some dimlit teahouse one of those beautiful uncouth dances that one can never wholly forget or making a wide cast down to the valley of the tigris swam and rolled in its snowcooled racing waters  vanessa meanwhile in a bayswater back street was making out the weekly laundry list attending bargain sales and in her more adventurous moments trying new ways of cooking whiting  occasionally she went to bridge parties where if the play was not illuminating at least one learned a great deal about the private life of some of the royal and imperial houses  vanessa in a way was glad that clyde had done the proper thing  she had a strong natural bias towards respectability though she would have preferred to have been respectable in smarter surroundings where her example would have done more good  to be beyond reproach was one thing but it would have been nicer to have been nearer to the park  and then of a sudden her regard for respectability and clyde’s sense of what was right were thrown on the scrapheap of unnecessary things  they had been useful and highly important in their time but the death of vanessa’s husband made them of no immediate moment  the news of the altered condition of things followed clyde with leisurely persistence from one place of call to another and at last ran him to a standstill somewhere in the orenburg steppe  he would have found it exceedingly difficult to analyse his feelings on receipt of the tidings the fates had unexpectedly and perhaps just a little officiously removed an obstacle from his path  he supposed he was overjoyed but he missed the feeling of elation which he had experienced some four months ago when he had bagged a snowleopard with a lucky shot after a day’s fruitless stalking  of course he would go back and ask vanessa to marry him but he was determined on enforcing a condition on no account would he desert his newer love  vanessa would have to agree to come out into the wilderness with him  the lady hailed the return of her lover with even more relief than had been occasioned by his departure  the death of john pennington had left his widow in circumstances which were more straitened than ever and the park had receded even from her notepaper where it had long been retained as a courtesy title on the principle that addresses are given to us to conceal our whereabouts  certainly she was more independent now than heretofore but independence which means so much to many women was of little account to vanessa who came under the heading of the mere female she made little ado about accepting clyde’s condition and announced herself ready to follow him to the end of the world as the world was round she nourished a complacent idea that in the ordinary course of things one would find oneself in the neighbourhood of hyde park corner sooner or later no matter how far afield one wandered  east of budapest her complacency began to filter away and when she saw her husband treating the black sea with a familiarity which she had never been able to assume towards the english channel misgivings began to crowd in upon her  adventures which would have presented an amusing and enticing aspect to a betterbred woman aroused in vanessa only the twin sensations of fright and discomfort  flies bit her and she was persuaded that it was only sheer boredom that prevented camels from doing the same  clyde did his best and a very good best it was to infuse something of the banquet into their prolonged desert picnics but even snowcooled heidsieck lost its flavour when you were convinced that the dusky cupbearer who served it with such reverent elegance was only waiting a convenient opportunity to cut your throat  it was useless for clyde to give yussuf a character for devotion such as is rarely found in any western servant  vanessa was well enough educated to know that all duskyskinned people take human life as unconcernedly as bayswater folk take singing lessons  and with a growing irritation and querulousness on her part came a further disenchantment born of the inability of husband and wife to find a common ground of interest  the habits and migrations of the sand grouse the folklore and customs of tartars and turkomans the points of a cossack pony—these were matter which evoked only a bored indifference in vanessa  on the other hand clyde was not thrilled on being informed that the queen of spain detested mauve or that a certain royal duchess for whose tastes he was never likely to be called on to cater nursed a violent but perfectly respectable passion for beef olives  vanessa began to arrive at the conclusion that a husband who added a roving disposition to a settled income was a mixed blessing  it was one thing to go to the end of the world it was quite another thing to make oneself at home there  even respectability seemed to lose some of its virtue when one practised it in a tent  bored and disillusioned with the drift of her new life vanessa was undisguisedly glad when distraction offered itself in the person of mr dobrinton a chance acquaintance whom they had first run against in the primitive hostelry of a benighted caucasian town  dobrinton was elaborately british in deference perhaps to the memory of his mother who was said to have derived part of her origin from an english governess who had come to lemberg a long way back in the last century  if you had called him dobrinski when off his guard he would probably have responded readily enough holding no doubt that the end crowns all he had taken a slight liberty with the family patronymic  to look at mr dobrinton was not a very attractive specimen of masculine humanity but in vanessa’s eyes he was a link with that civilisation which clyde seemed so ready to ignore and forgo  he could sing “yipiaddy” and spoke of several duchesses as if he knew them—in his more inspired moments almost as if they knew him  he even pointed out blemishes in the cuisine or cellar departments of some of the more august london restaurants a species of higher criticism which was listened to by vanessa in awestricken admiration  and above all he sympathised at first discreetly afterwards with more latitude with her fretful discontent at clyde’s nomadic instincts  business connected with oilwells had brought dobrinton to the neighbourhood of baku the pleasure of appealing to an appreciative female audience induced him to deflect his return journey so as to coincide a good deal with his new aquaintances’ line of march  and while clyde trafficked with persian horsedealers or hunted the wild grey pigs in their lairs and added to his notes on central asian gamefowl dobrinton and the lady discussed the ethics of desert respectability from points of view that showed a daily tendency to converge  and one evening clyde dined alone reading between the courses a long letter from vanessa justifying her action in flitting to more civilised lands with a more congenial companion  it was distinctly evil luck for vanessa who really was thoroughly respectable at heart that she and her lover should run into the hands of kurdish brigands on the first day of their flight  to be mewed up in a squalid kurdish village in close companionship with a man who was only your husband by adoption and to have the attention of all europe drawn to your plight was about the least respectable thing that could happen and there were international complications which made things worse “english lady and her husband of foreign nationality held by kurdish brigands who demand ransom” had been the report of the nearest consul although dobrinton was british at heart the other portions of him belonged to the habsburgs and though the habsburgs took no great pride or pleasure in this particular unit of their wide and varied possessions and would gladly have exchanged him for some interesting bird or mammal for the schoenbrunn park the code of international dignity demanded that they should display a decent solicitude for his restoration  and while the foreign offices of the two countries were taking the usual steps to secure the release of their respective subjects a further horrible complication ensued  clyde following on the track of the fugitives not with any special desire to overtake them but with a dim feeling that it was expected of him fell into the hands of the same community of brigands  diplomacy while anxious to do its best for a lady in misfortune showed signs of becoming restive at this expansion of its task as a frivolous young gentleman in downing street remarked “any husband of mrs dobrinton’s we shall be glad to extricate but let us know how many there are of them”  for a woman who valued respectability vanessa really had no luck  meanwhile the situation of the captives was not free from embarrassment when clyde explained to the kurdish headmen the nature of his relationship with the runaway couple they were gravely sympathetic but vetoed any idea of summary vengeance since the habsburgs would be sure to insist on the delivery of dobrinton alive and in a reasonably undamaged condition  they did not object to clyde administering a beating to his rival for half an hour every monday and thursday but dobrinton turned such a sickly green when he heard of this arrangement that the chief was obliged to withdraw the concession  and so in the cramped quarters of a mountain hut the illassorted trio watched the insufferable hours crawl slowly by  dobrinton was too frightened to be conversational vanessa was too mortified to open her lips and clyde was moodily silent  the little limberg négociant plucked up heart once to give a quavering rendering of “yipiaddy” but when he reached the statement “home was never like this” vanessa tearfully begged him to stop  and silence fastened itself with growing insistence on the three captives who were so tragically herded together thrice a day they drew near to one another to swallow the meal that had been prepared for them like desert beasts meeting in mute suspended hostility at the drinking pool and then drew back to resume the vigil of waiting  clyde was less carefully watched than the others  “jealousy will keep him to the woman’s side” thought his kurdish captors  they did not know that his wilder truer love was calling to him with a hundred voices from beyond the village bounds  and one evening finding that he was not getting the attention to which he was entitled clyde slipped away down the mountain side and resumed his study of central asian gamefowl  the remaining captives were guarded henceforth with greater rigour but dobrinton at any rate scarcely regretted clyde’s departure  the long arm or perhaps one might better say the long purse of diplomacy at last effected the release of the prisoners but the habsburgs were never to enjoy the guerdon of their outlay  on the quay of the little black sea port where the rescued pair came once more into contact with civilisation dobrinton was bitten by a dog which was assumed to be mad though it may only have been indiscriminating  the victim did not wait for symptoms of rabies to declare themselves but died forthwith of fright and vanessa made the homeward journey alone conscious somehow of a sense of slightly restored respectability  clyde in the intervals of correcting the proofs of his book on the gamefowl of central asia found time to press a divorce suit through the courts and as soon as possible hied him away to the congenial solitudes of the gobi desert to collect material for a work on the fauna of that region vanessa by virtue perhaps of her earlier intimacy with the cooking rites of the whiting obtained a place on the kitchen staff of a west end club it was not brilliant but at least it was within two minutes of the

all these years  this is fate  em fate  nothing of the sort it’s only me  you men are always such fatalists  i deferred my departure three whole weeks in order to come out in the same boat that i saw you were travelling by  i bribed the steward to put out chairs side by side in an unfrequented corner and i took enormous pains to be looking particularly attractive this morning and then you say “this is fate”  i am looking particularly attractive am i not  maj more than ever  time has only added a ripeness to your charms  em i knew you’d put it exactly in those words  the phraseology of lovemaking is awfully limited isn’t it  after all the chief charm is in the fact of being made love to  you are making love to me aren’t you  maj emily dearest i had already begun making advances even before you sat down here  i also bribed the steward to put our seats together in a secluded corner  “you may consider it done sir” was his reply that was immediately after breakfast  em how like a man to have his breakfast first  i attended to the seat business as soon as i left my cabin  maj don’t be unreasonable  it was only at breakfast that i discovered your blessed presence on the boat  i paid violent and unusual attention to a flapper all through the meal in order to make you jealous she’s probably in her cabin writing reams about me to a fellowflapper at this very moment  em you needn’t have taken all that trouble to make me jealous dickie  you did that years ago when you married another woman  maj well you had gone and married another man—a widower too at that  em well there’s no particular harm in marrying a widower i suppose i’m ready to do it again if i meet a really nice one  maj look here emily it’s not fair to go at that rate  you’re a lap ahead of me the whole time  it’s my place to propose to you all you’ve got to do is to say “yes”  em well i’ve practically said it already so we needn’t dawdle over that part  maj oh well—  they look at each other then suddenly embrace with considerable energy  maj we deadheated it that time  suddenly jumping to his feet oh d i’d forgotten  em forgotten what  maj the children  i ought to have told you  do you mind children  em not in moderate quantities  how many have you got  maj counting hurriedly on his fingers five  em five  maj anxiously is that too many  em it’s rather a number  the worst of it is i’ve some myself  maj many  em eight  maj eight in six years  oh emily  em only four were my own  the other four were by my husband’s first marriage  still that practically makes eight  maj and eight and five make thirteen  we can’t start our married life with thirteen children it would be most unlucky  walks up and down in agitation  some way must be found out of this  if we could only bring them down to twelve  thirteen is so horribly unlucky  em isn’t there some way by which we could part with one or two don’t the french want more children  i’ve often seen articles about it in the figaro  maj i fancy they want french children  mine don’t even speak french  em there’s always a chance that one of them might turn out depraved and vicious and then you could disown him  i’ve heard of that being done  maj but good gracious you’ve got to educate him first  you can’t expect a boy to be vicious till he’s been to a good school  em why couldn’t he be naturally depraved  lots of boys are  maj only when they inherit it from depraved parents  you don’t suppose there’s any depravity in me do you  em it sometimes skips a generation you know  weren’t any of your family bad  maj there was an aunt who was never spoken of  em there you are  maj but one can’t build too much on that  in midvictorian days they labelled all sorts of things as unspeakable that we should speak about quite tolerantly  i dare say this particular aunt had only married a unitarian or rode to hounds on both sides of her horse or something of that sort  anyhow we can’t wait indefinitely for one of the children to take after a doubtfully depraved greataunt  something else must be thought of  em don’t people ever adopt children from other families  maj i’ve heard of it being done by childless couples and those sort of people—  em hush  some one’s coming  who is it  maj mrs palypaget  em the very person  maj what to adopt a child  hasn’t she got any  em only one miserable henbaby  maj let’s sound her on the subject  enter mrs palypaget r  ah good morning  mrs palypaget  i was just wondering at breakfast where did we meet last  mrs pp at the criterion wasn’t it  drops into vacant chair  maj at the criterion of course  mrs pp i was dining with lord and lady slugford  charming people but so mean  they took us afterwards to the velodrome to see some dancer interpreting mendelssohn’s “song without clothes” we were all packed up in a little box near the roof and you may imagine how hot it was  it was like a turkish bath  and of course one couldn’t see anything  maj then it was not like a turkish bath  mrs pp major  em we were just talking of you when you joined us  mrs pp really  nothing very dreadful i hope  em oh dear no  it’s too early on the voyage for that sort of thing we were feeling rather sorry for you  mrs pp sorry for me  whatever for  maj your childless hearth and all that you know  no little pattering feet  mrs pp major  how dare you  i’ve got my little girl i suppose you know  her feet can patter as well as other children’s  maj only one pair of feet  mrs pp certainly  my child isn’t a centipede  considering the way they move us about in those horrid jungle stations without a decent bungalow to set one’s foot in i consider i’ve got a hearthless child rather than a childless hearth  thank you for your sympathy all the same  i dare say it was well meant  impertinence often is  em dear mrs palypaget we were only feeling sorry for your sweet little girl when she grows older you know  no little brothers and sisters to play with  mrs pp mrs carewe this conversation strikes me as being indelicate to say the least of it  i’ve only been married two and a half years and my family is naturally a small one  maj isn’t it rather an exaggeration to talk of one little female child as a family  a family suggests numbers  mrs pp really major you language is extraordinary  i dare say i’ve only got a little female child as you call it at present—  maj oh it won’t change into a boy later on if that’s what you’re counting on  take our word for it we’ve had so much more experience in these affairs than you have  once a female always a female  nature is not infallible but she always abides by her mistakes  mrs pp rising major dumbarton these boats are uncomfortably small but i trust we shall find ample accommodation for avoiding each other’s society during the rest of the voyage  the same wish applies to you mrs carewe  exit mrs palypaget l  maj what an unnatural mother  sinks into chair  em i wouldn’t trust a child with any one who had a temper like hers oh dickie why did you go and have such a large family  you always said you wanted me to be the mother of your children  maj i wasn’t going to wait while you were founding and fostering dynasties in other directions  why you couldn’t be content to have children of your own without collecting them like batches of postage stamps i can’t think  the idea of marrying a man with four children  em well you’re asking me to marry one with five  maj five  springing to his feet  did i say five  em you certainly said five  maj oh emily supposing i’ve miscounted them  listen now keep count with me  richard—that’s after me of course  em one  maj albertvictor—that must have been in coronation year  em two  maj maud  she’s called after—  em never mind who’s she’s called after  three  maj and gerald  em four  maj that’s the lot  em are you sure  maj i swear that’s the lot  i must have counted albertvictor as two  em richard  maj emily                               they embrace     the mouse   theodoric voler had been brought up from infancy to the confines of middle age by a fond mother whose chief solicitude had been to keep him screened from what she called the coarser realities of life  when she died she left theodoric alone in a world that was as real as ever and a good deal coarser than he considered it had any need to be  to a man of his temperament and upbringing even a simple railway journey was crammed with petty annoyances and minor discords and as he settled himself down in a secondclass compartment one september morning he was conscious of ruffled feelings and general mental discomposure  he had been staying at a country vicarage the inmates of which had been certainly neither brutal nor bacchanalian but their supervision of the domestic establishment had been of that lax order which invites disaster  the pony carriage that was to take him to the station had never been properly ordered and when the moment for his departure drew near the handyman who should have produced the required article was nowhere to be found in this emergency theodoric to his mute but very intense disgust found himself obliged to collaborate with the vicar’s daughter in the task of harnessing the pony which necessitated groping about in an illlighted outhouse called a stable and smelling very like one—except in patches where it smelt of mice  without being actually afraid of mice theodoric classed them among the coarser incidents of life and considered that providence with a little exercise of moral courage might long ago have recognised that they were not indispensable and have withdrawn them from circulation  as the train glided out of the station theodoric’s nervous imagination accused himself of exhaling a weak odour of stableyard and possibly of displaying a mouldy straw or two on his usually wellbrushed garments  fortunately the only other occupant of the compartment a lady of about the same age as himself seemed inclined for slumber rather than scrutiny the train was not due to stop till the terminus was reached in about an hour’s time and the carriage was of the oldfashioned sort that held no communication with a corridor therefore no further travelling companions were likely to intrude on theodoric’s semiprivacy and yet the train had scarcely attained its normal speed before he became reluctantly but vividly aware that he was not alone with the slumbering lady he was not even alone in his own clothes  a warm creeping movement over his flesh betrayed the unwelcome and highly resented presence unseen but poignant of a strayed mouse that had evidently dashed into its present retreat during the episode of the pony harnessing  furtive stamps and shakes and wildly directed pinches failed to dislodge the intruder whose motto indeed seemed to be excelsior and the lawful occupant of the clothes lay back against the cushions and endeavoured rapidly to evolve some means for putting an end to the dual ownership  it was unthinkable that he should continue for the space of a whole hour in the horrible position of a rowton house for vagrant mice already his imagination had at least doubled the numbers of the alien invasion  on the other hand nothing less drastic than partial disrobing would ease him of his tormentor and to undress in the presence of a lady even for so laudable a purpose was an idea that made his eartips tingle in a blush of abject shame  he had never been able to bring himself even to the mild exposure of openwork socks in the presence of the fair sex  and yet—the lady in this case was to all appearances soundly and securely asleep the mouse on the other hand seemed to be trying to crowd a wanderjahr into a few strenuous minutes if there is any truth in the theory of transmigration this particular mouse must certainly have been in a former state a member of the alpine club  sometimes in its eagerness it lost its footing and slipped for half an inch or so and then in fright or more probably temper it bit theodoric was goaded into the most audacious undertaking of his life crimsoning to the hue of a beetroot and keeping an agonised watch on his slumbering fellowtraveller he swiftly and noiselessly secured the ends of his railwayrug to the racks on either side of the carriage so that a substantial curtain hung athwart the compartment  in the narrow dressingroom that he had thus improvised he proceeded with violent haste to extricate himself partially and the mouse entirely from the surrounding casings of tweed and halfwool  as the unravelled mouse gave a wild leap to the floor the rug slipping its fastening at either end also came down with a heartcurdling flop and almost simultaneously the awakened sleeper opened her eyes  with a movement almost quicker than the mouse’s theodoric pounced on the rug and hauled its ample folds chinhigh over his dismantled person as he collapsed into the further corner of the carriage  the blood raced and beat in the veins of his neck and forehead while he waited dumbly for the communicationcord to be pulled  the lady however contented herself with a silent stare at her strangely muffled companion  how much had she seen theodoric queried to himself and in any case what on earth must she think of his present posture  “i think i have caught a chill” he ventured desperately  “really i’m sorry” she replied  “i was just going to ask you if you would open this window”  “i fancy it’s malaria” he added his teeth chattering slightly as much from fright as from a desire to support his theory  “i’ve got some brandy in my holdall if you’ll kindly reach it down for me” said his companion  “not for worlds—i mean i never take anything for it” he assured her earnestly  “i suppose you caught it in the tropics”  theodoric whose acquaintance with the tropics was limited to an annual present of a chest of tea from an uncle in ceylon felt that even the malaria was slipping from him  would it be possible he wondered to disclose the real state of affairs to her in small instalments  “are you afraid of mice” he ventured growing if possible more scarlet in the face  “not unless they came in quantities like those that ate up bishop hatto why do you ask”  “i had one crawling inside my clothes just now” said theodoric in a voice that hardly seemed his own  “it was a most awkward situation”  “it must have been if you wear your clothes at all tight” she observed “but mice have strange ideas of comfort”  “i had to get rid of it while you were asleep” he continued then with a gulp he added “it was getting rid of it that brought me to—to this”  “surely leaving off one small mouse wouldn’t bring on a chill” she exclaimed with a levity that theodoric accounted abominable  evidently she had detected something of his predicament and was enjoying his confusion  all the blood in his body seemed to have mobilised in one concentrated blush and an agony of abasement worse than a myriad mice crept up and down over his soul  and then as reflection began to assert itself sheer terror took the place of humiliation  with every minute that passed the train was rushing nearer to the crowded and bustling terminus where dozens of prying eyes would be exchanged for the one paralysing pair that watched him from the further corner of the carriage there was one slender despairing chance which the next few minutes must decide  his fellowtraveller might relapse into a blessed slumber  but as the minutes throbbed by that chance ebbed away  the furtive glance which theodoric stole at her from time to time disclosed only an unwinking wakefulness  “i think we must be getting near now” she presently observed  theodoric had already noted with growing terror the recurring stacks of small ugly dwellings that heralded the journey’s end  the words acted as a signal  like a hunted beast breaking cover and dashing madly towards some other haven of momentary safety he threw aside his rug and struggled frantically into his dishevelled garments  he was conscious of dull surburban stations racing past the window of a choking hammering sensation in his throat and heart and of an icy silence in that corner towards which he dared not look  then as he sank back in his seat clothed and almost delirious the train slowed down to a final crawl and the woman spoke  “would you be so kind” she asked “as to get me a porter to put me into a cab  it’s a shame to trouble you when you’re feeling unwell but being blind makes one so helpless at a railway station”
