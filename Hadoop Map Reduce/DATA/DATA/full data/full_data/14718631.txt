14718631	through the magic door  by arthur conan doyle     i   i care not how humble your bookshelf may be nor how lowly the room which it adorns close the door of that room behind you shut off with it all the cares of the outer world plunge back into the soothing company of the great dead and then you are through the magic portal into that fair land whither worry and vexation can follow you no more you have left all that is vulgar and all that is sordid behind you there stand your noble silent comrades waiting in their ranks pass your eye down their files choose your man and then you have but to hold up your hand to him and away you go together into dreamland surely there would be something eerie about a line of books were it not that familiarity has deadened our sense of it each is a mummified soul embalmed in cerecloth and natron of leather and printers ink each cover of a true book enfolds the concentrated essence of a man the personalities of the writers have faded into the thinnest shadows as their bodies into impalpable dust yet here are their very spirits at your command  it is our familiarity also which has lessened our perception of the miraculous good fortune which we enjoy let us suppose that we were suddenly to learn that shakespeare had returned to earth and that he would favour any of us with an hour of his wit and his fancy how eagerly we would seek him out and yet we have himthe very best of himat our elbows from week to week and hardly trouble ourselves to put out our hands to beckon him down no matter what mood a man may be in when once he has passed through the magic door he can summon the worlds greatest to sympathize with him in it if he be thoughtful here are the kings of thought if he be dreamy here are the masters of fancy or is it amusement that he lacks he can signal to any one of the worlds great storytellers and out comes the dead man and holds him enthralled by the hour the dead are such good company that one may come to think too little of the living it is a real and a pressing danger with many of us that we should never find our own thoughts and our own souls but be ever obsessed by the dead yet secondhand romance and secondhand emotion are surely better than the dull soulkilling monotony which life brings to most of the human race but best of all when the dead mans wisdom and strength in the living of our own strenuous days  come through the magic door with me and sit here on the green settee where you can see the old oak case with its untidy lines of volumes smoking is not forbidden would you care to hear me talk of them well i ask nothing better for there is no volume there which is not a dear personal friend and what can a man talk of more pleasantly than that the other books are over yonder but these are my own favouritesthe ones i care to reread and to have near my elbow there is not a tattered cover which does not bring its mellow memories to me  some of them represent those little sacrifices which make a possession dearer you see the line of old brown volumes at the bottom every one of those represents a lunch they were bought in my student days when times were not too affluent threepence was my modest allowance for my midday sandwich and glass of beer but as luck would have it my way to the classes led past the most fascinating bookshop in the world outside the door of it stood a large tub filled with an everchanging litter of tattered books with a card above which announced that any volume therein could be purchased for the identical sum which i carried in my pocket as i approached it a combat ever raged betwixt the hunger of a youthful body and that of an inquiring and omnivorous mind five times out of six the animal won but when the mental prevailed then there was an entrancing five minutes digging among outofdate almanacs volumes of scotch theology and tables of logarithms until one found something which made it all worth while if you will look over these titles you will see that i did not do so very badly four volumes of gordons tacitus life is too short to read originals so long as there are good translations sir william temples essays addisons works swifts tale of a tub clarendons history gil blas buckinghams poems churchills poems life of baconnot so bad for the old threepenny tub  they were not always in such plebeian company look at the thickness of the rich leather and the richness of the dim gold lettering once they adorned the shelves of some noble library and even among the odd almanacs and the sermons they bore the traces of their former greatness like the faded silk dress of the reduced gentlewoman a present pathos but a glory of the past  reading is made too easy nowadays with cheap paper editions and free libraries a man does not appreciate at its full worth the thing that comes to him without effort who now ever gets the thrill which carlyle felt when he hurried home with the six volumes of gibbons history under his arm his mind just starving for want of food to devour them at the rate of one a day a book should be your very own before you can really get the taste of it and unless you have worked for it you will never have the true inward pride of possession  if i had to choose the one book out of all that line from which i have had most pleasure and most profit i should point to yonder stained copy of macaulays essays it seems entwined into my whole life as i look backwards it was my comrade in my student days it has been with me on the sweltering gold coast and it formed part of my humble kit when i went awhaling in the arctic honest scotch harpooners have addled their brains over it and you may still see the grease stains where the second engineer grappled with frederick the great tattered and dirty and worn no giltedged moroccobound volume could ever take its place for me  what a noble gateway this book forms through which one may approach the study either of letters or of history milton machiavelli hallam southey bunyan byron johnson pitt hampden clive hastings chathamwhat nuclei for thought with a good grip of each how pleasant and easy to fill in all that lies between the short vivid sentences the broad sweep of allusion the exact detail they all throw a glamour round the subject and should make the least studious of readers desire to go further if macaulays hand cannot lead a man upon those pleasant paths then indeed he may give up all hope of ever finding them  when i was a senior schoolboy this booknot this very volume for it had an even more tattered predecessoropened up a new world to me history had been a lesson and abhorrent suddenly the task and the drudgery became an incursion into an enchanted land a land of colour and beauty with a kind wise guide to point the path in that great style of his i loved even the faultsindeed now that i come to think of it it was the faults which i loved best no sentence could be too stiff with rich embroidery and no antithesis too flowery it pleased me to read that a universal shout of laughter from the tagus to the vistula informed the pope that the days of the crusades were past and i was delighted to learn that lady jerningham kept a vase in which people placed foolish verses and mr dash wrote verses which were fit to be placed in lady jerninghams vase those were the kind of sentences which used to fill me with a vague but enduring pleasure like chords which linger in the musicians ear a man likes a plainer literary diet as he grows older but still as i glance over the essays i am filled with admiration and wonder at the alternate power of handling a great subject and of adorning it by delightful detailjust a bold sweep of the brush and then the most delicate stippling as he leads you down the path he for ever indicates the alluring sidetracks which branch away from it an admirable if somewhat oldfashioned literary and historical education night be effected by working through every book which is alluded to in the essays i should be curious however to know the exact age of the youth when he came to the end of his studies  i wish macaulay had written a historical novel i am convinced that it would have been a great one i do not know if he had the power of drawing an imaginary character but he certainly had the gift of reconstructing a dead celebrity to a remarkable degree look at the simple halfparagraph in which he gives us johnson and his atmosphere was ever a more definite picture given in a shorter space    as we close it the clubroom is before us and the table   on which stand the omelet for nugent and the lemons for   johnson there are assembled those heads which live for ever   on the canvas of reynolds there are the spectacles of burke   and the tall thin form of langton the courtly sneer of   beauclerk and the beaming smile of garrick gibbon tapping   his snuffbox and sir joshua with his trumpet in his ear   in the foreground is that strange figure which is as familiar   to us as the figures of those among whom we have been brought   upthe gigantic body the huge massy face seamed with the   scars of disease the brown coat the black worsted stockings   the grey wig with the scorched foretop the dirty hands the   nails bitten and pared to the quick we see the eyes and mouth   moving with convulsive twitches we see the heavy form rolling   we hear it puffing and then comes the why sir and the   what then sir and the no sir and the you dont see   your way through the question sir  it is etched into your memory for ever  i can remember that when i visited london at the age of sixteen the first thing i did after housing my luggage was to make a pilgrimage to macaulays grave where he lies in westminster abbey just under the shadow of addison and amid the dust of the poets whom he had loved so well it was the one great object of interest which london held for me and so it might well be when i think of all i owe him it is not merely the knowledge and the stimulation of fresh interests but it is the charming gentlemanly tone the broad liberal outlook the general absence of bigotry and of prejudice my judgment now confirms all that i felt for him then  my fourvolume edition of the history stands as you see to the right of the essays do you recollect the third chapter of that workthe one which reconstructs the england of the seventeenth century it has always seemed to me the very highwater mark of macaulays powers with its marvellous mixture of precise fact and romantic phrasing the population of towns the statistics of commerce the prosaic facts of life are all transmuted into wonder and interest by the handling of the master you feel that he could have cast a glamour over the multiplication table had he set himself to do so take a single concrete example of what i mean the fact that a londoner in the country or a countryman in london felt equally out of place in those days of difficult travel would seem to hardly require stating and to afford no opportunity of leaving a strong impression upon the readers mind see what macaulay makes of it though it is no more than a hundred other paragraphs which discuss a hundred various points    a cockney in a rural village was stared at as much as if he   had intruded into a kraal of hottentots on the other hand   when the lord of a lincolnshire or shropshire manor appeared   in fleet street he was as easily distinguished from the   resident population as a turk or a lascar his dress his gait   his accent the manner in which he gazed at the shops stumbled   into gutters ran against the porters and stood under the   waterspouts marked him out as an excellent subject for the   operations of swindlers and banterers bullies jostled him into   the kennel hackney coachmen splashed him from head to foot   thieves explored with perfect security the huge pockets of his   horsemans coat while he stood entranced by the splendour of   the lord mayors show moneydroppers sore from the carts   tail introduced themselves to him and appeared to him the   most honest friendly gentlemen that he had ever seen painted   women the refuse of lewkner lane and whetstone park passed   themselves on him for countesses and maids of honour if he   asked his way to st james his informants sent him to mile   end if he went into a shop he was instantly discerned to be   a fit purchaser of everything that nobody else would buy of   secondhand embroidery copper rings and watches that would   not go if he rambled into any fashionable coffeehouse he   became a mark for the insolent derision of fops and the grave   waggery of templars enraged and mortified he soon returned   to his mansion and there in the homage of his tenants and   the conversation of his boon companions found consolation for   the vexations and humiliations which he had undergone there   he was once more a great man and saw nothing above himself   except when at the assizes he took his seat on the bench near   the judge or when at the muster of the militia he saluted the   lord lieutenant  on the whole i should put this detached chapter of description at the very head of his essays though it happens to occur in another volume the history as a whole does not as it seems to me reach the same level as the shorter articles one cannot but feel that it is a brilliant piece of special pleading from a fervid whig and that there must be more to be said for the other side than is there set forth some of the essays are tinged also no doubt by his own political and religious limitations the best are those which get right away into the broad fields of literature and philosophy johnson walpole madame darblay addison and the two great indian ones clive and warren hastings are my own favourites frederick the great too must surely stand in the first rank only one would i wish to eliminate it is the diabolically clever criticism upon montgomery one would have wished to think that macaulays heart was too kind and his soul too gentle to pen so bitter an attack bad work will sink of its own weight it is not necessary to souse the author as well one would think more highly of the man if he had not done that savage bit of work  i dont know why talking of macaulay always makes me think of scott whose books in a faded olivebacked line have a shelf you see of their own perhaps it is that they both had so great an influence and woke such admiration in me or perhaps it is the real similarity in the minds and characters of the two men you dont see it you say well just think of scotts border ballads and then of macaulays lays the machines must be alike when the products are so similar each was the only man who could possibly have written the poems of the other what swing and dash in both of them what a love of all that is and noble and martial so simple and yet so strong but there are minds on which strength and simplicity are thrown away they think that unless a thing is obscure it must be superficial whereas it is often the shallow stream which is turbid and the deep which is clear do you remember the fatuous criticism of matthew arnold upon the glorious lays where he calls out is this poetry after quoting     and how can man die better       than facing fearful odds     for the ashes of his fathers       and the temples of his gods  in trying to show that macaulay had not the poetic sense he was really showing that he himself had not the dramatic sense the baldness of the idea and of the language had evidently offended him but this is exactly where the true merit lies macaulay is giving the rough blunt words with which a simpleminded soldier appeals to two comrades to help him in a deed of valour any highflown sentiment would have been absolutely out of character the lines are i think taken with their context admirable ballad poetry and have just the dramatic quality and sense which a ballad poet must have that opinion of arnolds shook my faith in his judgment and yet i would forgive a good deal to the man who wrote     one more charge and then be dumb       when the forts of folly fall     may the victors when they come       find my body near the wall  not a bad verse that for ones life aspiration  this is one of the things which human society has not yet understoodthe value of a noble inspiriting text when it does we shall meet them everywhere engraved on appropriate places and our progress through the streets will be brightened and ennobled by one continual series of beautiful mental impulses and images reflected into our souls from the printed thoughts which meet our eyes to think that we should walk with empty listless minds while all this splendid material is running to waste i do not mean mere scriptural texts for they do not bear the same meaning to all though what human creature can fail to be spurred onwards by work while it is day for the night cometh when no man can work but i mean those beautiful thoughtswho can say that they are uninspired thoughtswhich may be gathered from a hundred authors to match a hundred uses a fine thought in fine language is a most precious jewel and should not be hid away but be exposed for use and ornament to take the nearest example there is a horsetrough across the road from my house a plain stone trough and no man could pass it with any feelings save vague discontent at its ugliness but suppose that on its front slab you print the verse of coleridge     he prayeth best who loveth best       all things both great and small     for the dear lord who fashioned him       he knows and loveth all  i fear i may misquote for i have not the ancient mariner at my elbow but even as it stands does it not elevate the horsetrough we all do this i suppose in a small way for ourselves there are few men who have not some chosen quotations printed on their study mantelpieces or better still in their hearts carlyles transcription of rest rest shall i not have all eternity to rest in is a pretty good spur to a weary man but what we need is a more general application of the same thing for public and not for private use until people understand that a graven thought is as beautiful an ornament as any graven image striking through the eye right deep down into the soul  however all this has nothing to do with macaulays glorious lays save that when you want some flowers of manliness and patriotism you can pluck quite a bouquet out of those i had the good fortune to learn the lay of horatius off by heart when i was a child and it stamped itself on my plastic mind so that even now i can reel off almost the whole of it goldsmith said that in conversation he was like the man who had a thousand pounds in the bank but could not compete with the man who had an actual sixpence in his pocket so the ballad that you bear in your mind outweighs the whole bookshelf which waits for reference but i want you now to move your eye a little farther down the shelf to the line of olivegreen volumes that is my edition of scott but surely i must give you a little breathing space before i venture upon them    ii   it is a great thing to start life with a small number of really good books which are your very own you may not appreciate them at first you may pine for your novel of crude and unadulterated adventure you may and will give it the preference when you can but the dull days come and the rainy days come and always you are driven to fill up the chinks of your reading with the worthy books which wait so patiently for your notice and then suddenly on a day which marks an epoch in your life you understand the difference you see like a flash how the one stands for nothing and the other for literature from that day onwards you may return to your crudities but at least you do so with some standard of comparison in your mind you can never be the same as you were before then gradually the good thing becomes more dear to you it builds itself up with your growing mind it becomes a part of your better self and so at last you can look as i do now at the old covers and love them for all that they have meant in the past yes it was the olivegreen line of scotts novels which started me on to rhapsody they were the first books i ever ownedlong long before i could appreciate or even understand them but at last i realized what a treasure they were in my boyhood i read them by surreptitious candleends in the dead of the night when the sense of crime added a new zest to the story perhaps you have observed that my ivanhoe is of a different edition from the others the first copy was left in the grass by the side of a stream fell into the water and was eventually picked up three days later swollen and decomposed upon a mudbank i think i may say however that i had worn it out before i lost it indeed it was perhaps as well that it was some years before it was replaced for my instinct was always to read it again instead of breaking fresh ground  i remember the late james payn telling the anecdote that he and two literary friends agreed to write down what scene in fiction they thought the most dramatic and that on examining the papers it was found that all three had chosen the same it was the moment when the unknown knight at ashbydelazouch riding past the pavilions of the lesser men strikes with the sharp end of his lance in a challenge to mortal combat the shield of the formidable templar it was indeed a splendid moment what matter that no templar was allowed by the rules of his order to take part in so secular and frivolous an affair as a tournament it is the privilege of great masters to make things so and it is a churlish thing to gainsay it was it not wendell holmes who described the prosaic man who enters a drawingroom with a couple of facts like illconditioned bulldogs at his heels ready to let them loose on any play of fancy the great writer can never go wrong if shakespeare gives a seacoast to bohemia or if victor hugo calls an english prizefighter mr jimjohnjackwell it was so and thats an end of it there is no second line of rails at that point said an editor to a minor author i make a second line said the author and he was within his rights if he can carry his readers conviction with him  but this is a digression from ivanhoe what a book it is the second greatest historical novel in our language i think every successive reading has deepened my admiration for it scotts soldiers are always as good as his women with exceptions are weak but here while the soldiers are at their very best the romantic figure of rebecca redeems the female side of the story from the usual commonplace routine scott drew manly men because he was a manly man himself and found the task a sympathetic one  he drew young heroines because a convention demanded it which he had never the hardihood to break it is only when we get him for a dozen chapters on end with a minimum of petticoatin the long stretch for example from the beginning of the tournament to the end of the friar tuck incidentthat we realize the height of continued romantic narrative to which he could attain i dont think in the whole range of our literature we have a finer sustained flight than that  there is i admit an intolerable amount of redundant verbiage in scotts novels those endless and unnecessary introductions make the shell very thick before you come to the oyster they are often admirable in themselves learned witty picturesque but with no relation or proportion to the story which they are supposed to introduce like so much of our english fiction they are very good matter in a very bad place digression and want of method and order are traditional national sins fancy introducing an essay on how to live on nothing a year as thackeray did in vanity fair or sandwiching in a ghost story as dickens has dared to do as well might a dramatic author rush up to the footlights and begin telling anecdotes while his play was suspending its action and his characters waiting wearily behind him it is all wrong though every great name can be quoted in support of it our sense of form is lamentably lacking and sir walter sinned with the rest but get past all that to a crisis in the real story and who finds the terse phrase the short fireword so surely as he do you remember when the reckless sergeant of dragoons stands at last before the grim puritan upon whose head a price has been set a thousand marks or a bed of heather says he as he draws the puritan draws also the sword of the lord and of gideon says he no verbiage there but the very spirit of either man and of either party in the few stern words which haunt your mind bows and bills cry the saxon varangians as the moslem horse charges home you feel it is just what they must have cried even more terse and businesslike was the actual battlecry of the fathers of the same men on that longdrawn day when they fought under the red dragon of wessex on the low ridge at hastings out out they roared as the norman chivalry broke upon them terse strong prosaicthe very genius of the race was in the cry  is it that the higher emotions are not there or is it that they are damped down and covered over as too precious to be exhibited something of each perhaps i once met the widow of the man who as a young signal midshipman had taken nelsons famous message from the signal yeoman and communicated it to the ships company the officers were impressed the men were not duty they muttered weve always done it why not anything in the least highfalutin would depress not exalt a british company it is the under statement which delights them german troops can march to battle singing luthers hymns frenchmen will work themselves into a frenzy by a song of glory and of fatherland our martial poets need not trouble to imitateor at least need not imagine that if they do so they will ever supply a want to the british soldier our sailors working the heavy guns in south africa sang heres another lump of sugar for the bird i saw a regiment go into action to the refrain of a little bit off the top the martial poet aforesaid unless he had the genius and the insight of a kipling would have wasted a good deal of ink before he had got down to such chants as these the russians are not unlike us in this respect i remember reading of some column ascending a breach and singing lustily from start to finish until a few survivors were left victorious upon the crest with the song still going a spectator inquired what wondrous chant it was which had warmed them to such a deed of valour and he found that the exact meaning of the words endlessly repeated was ivan is in the garden picking cabbages the fact is i suppose that a mere monotonous sound may take the place of the tomtom of savage warfare and hypnotize the soldier into valour  our cousins across the atlantic have the same blending of the comic with their most serious work take the songs which they sang during the most bloody war which the angloceltic race has ever wagedthe only war in which it could have been said that they were stretched to their uttermost and showed their true formtramp tramp tramp john browns body marching through georgiaall had a playful humour running through them only one exception do i know and that is the most tremendous warsong i can recall even an outsider in time of peace can hardly read it without emotion i mean of course julia ward howes warsong of the republic with the choral opening line mine eyes have seen the glory of the coming of the lord if that were ever sung upon a battlefield the effect must have been terrific  a long digression is it not but that is the worst of the thoughts at the other side of the magic door you cant pull one out without a dozen being entangled with it but it was scotts soldiers that i was talking of and i was saying that there is nothing theatrical no posing no heroics the thing of all others which the hero abominates but just the short bluff word and the simple manly ways with every expression and metaphor drawn from within his natural range of thought what a pity it is that he with his keen appreciation of the soldier gave us so little of those soldiers who were his own contemporariesthe finest perhaps that the world has ever seen it is true that he wrote a life of the great soldier emperor but that was the one piece of hackwork of his career how could a tory patriot whose whole training had been to look upon napoleon as a malignant demon do justice to such a theme but the europe of those days was full of material which he of all men could have drawn with a sympathetic hand what would we not give for a portrait of one of murats lightcavalrymen or of a grenadier of the old guard drawn with the same bold strokes as the rittmeister of gustavus or the archers of the french kings guard in quentin durward  in his visit to paris scott must have seen many of those iron men who during the preceding twenty years had been the scourge and also the redemption of europe to us the soldiers who scowled at him from the sidewalks in 1814 would have been as interesting and as much romantic figures of the past as the mailclad knights or ruffling cavaliers of his novels a picture from the life of a peninsular veteran with his views upon the duke would be as striking as dugald dalgetty from the german wars but then no man ever does realize the true interest of the age in which he happens to live all sense of proportion is lost and the little thing hardby obscures the great thing at a distance it is easy in the dark to confuse the firefly and the star fancy for example the old masters seeking their subjects in inn parlours or st sebastians while columbus was discovering america before their very faces  i have said that i think ivanhoe the best of scotts novels i suppose most people would subscribe to that but how about the second best it speaks well for their general average that there is hardly one among them which might not find some admirers who would vote it to a place of honour to the scottishborn man those novels which deal with scottish life and character have a quality of raciness which gives them a place apart there is a rich humour of the soil in such books as old mortality the antiquary and rob roy which puts them in a different class from the others his old scottish women are next to his soldiers the best series of types that he has drawn at the same time it must be admitted that merit which is associated with dialect has such limitations that it can never take the same place as work which makes an equal appeal to all the world on the whole perhaps quentin durward on account of its wider interests its strong characterdrawing and the european importance of the events and people described would have my vote for the second place it is the father of all those swordandcape novels which have formed so numerous an addition to the light literature of the last century the pictures of charles the bold and of the unspeakable louis are extraordinarily vivid i can see those two deadly enemies watching the hounds chasing the herald and clinging to each other in the convulsion of their cruel mirth more clearly than most things which my eyes have actually rested upon  the portrait of louis with his astuteness his cruelty his superstition and his cowardice is followed closely from comines and is the more effective when set up against his bluff and warlike rival it is not often that historical characters work out in their actual physique exactly as one would picture them to be but in the high church of innsbruck i have seen effigies of louis and charles which might have walked from the very pages of scottlouis thin ascetic varminty and charles with the head of a prizefighter it is hard on us when a portrait upsets all our preconceived ideas when for example we see in the national portrait gallery a man with a noble olivetinted poetic face and with a start read beneath it that it is the wicked judge jeffreys occasionally however as at innsbruck we are absolutely satisfied i have before me on the mantelpiece yonder a portrait of a painting which represents queen marys bothwell take it down and look at it mark the big head fit to conceive large schemes the strong animal face made to captivate a sensitive feminine woman the brutally forceful featuresthe mouth with a suggestion of wild boars tusks behind it the beard which could bristle with fury the whole man and his lifehistory are revealed in that picture i wonder if scott had ever seen the original which hangs at the hepburn family seat  personally i have always had a very high opinion of a novel which the critics have used somewhat harshly and which came almost the last from his tired pen i mean count robert of paris i am convinced that if it had been the first instead of the last of the series it would have attracted as much attention as waverley i can understand the state of mind of the expert who cried out in mingled admiration and despair i have studied the conditions of byzantine society all my life and here comes a scotch lawyer who makes the whole thing clear to me in a flash many men could draw with more or less success norman england or mediaeval france but to reconstruct a whole dead civilization in so plausible a way with such dignity and such minuteness of detail is i should think a most wonderful tour de force his failing health showed itself before the end of the novel but had the latter half equalled the first and contained scenes of such humour as anna comnena reading aloud her fathers exploits or of such majesty as the account of the muster of the crusaders upon the shores of the bosphorus then the book could not have been gainsaid its rightful place in the very front rank of the novels  i would that he had carried on his narrative and given us a glimpse of the actual progress of the first crusade what an incident was ever anything in the worlds history like it it had what historical incidents seldom have a definite beginning middle and end from the halfcrazed preaching of peter down to the fall of jerusalem those leaders it would take a second homer to do them justice godfrey the perfect soldier and leader bohemund the unscrupulous and formidable tancred the ideal knight errant robert of normandy the halfmad hero here is material so rich that one feels one is not worthy to handle it what richest imagination could ever evolve anything more marvellous and thrilling than the actual historical facts  but what a glorious brotherhood the novels are think of the pure romance of the talisman the exquisite picture of hebridean life in the pirate the splendid reproduction of elizabethan england in kenilworth the rich humour of the legend of montrose above all bear in mind that in all that splendid series written in a coarse age there is not one word to offend the most sensitive car and it is borne in upon one how great and noble a man was walter scott and how high the service which he did for literature and for humanity  for that reason his life is good reading and there it is on the same shelf as the novels lockhart was of course his soninlaw and his admiring friend the ideal biographer should be a perfectly impartial man with a sympathetic mind but a stern determination to tell the absolute truth one would like the frail human side of a man as well as the other i cannot believe that anyone in the world was ever quite so good as the subject of most of our biographies surely these worthy people swore a little sometimes or had a keen eye for a pretty face or opened the second bottle when they would have done better to stop at the first or did something to make us feel that they were men and brothers they need not go the length of the lady who began a biography of her deceased husband with the wordsd was a dirty man but the books certainly would be more readable and the subjects more lovable too if we had greater light and shade in the picture  but i am sure that the more one knew of scott the more one would have admired him he lived in a drinking age and in a drinking country and i have not a doubt that he took an allowance of toddy occasionally of an evening which would have laid his feeble successors under the table his last years at least poor fellow were abstemious enough when he sipped his barleywater while the others passed the decanter but what a highsouled chivalrous gentleman he was with how fine a sense of honour translating itself not into empty phrases but into years of labour and denial you remember how he became sleeping partner in a printing house and so involved himself in its failure there was a legal but very little moral claim against him and no one could have blamed him had he cleared the account by a bankruptcy which would have enabled him to become a rich man again within a few years yet he took the whole burden upon himself and bore it for the rest of his life spending his work his time and his health in the one long effort to save his honour from the shadow of a stain it was nearly a hundred thousand pounds i think which he passed on to the creditorsa great record a hundred thousand pounds with his life thrown in  and what a power of work he had it was superhuman only the man who has tried to write fiction himself knows what it means when it is recorded that scott produced two of his long novels in one single year i remember reading in some book of reminiscenceson second thoughts it was in lockhart himselfhow the writer had lodged in some rooms in castle street edinburgh and how he had seen all evening the silhouette of a man outlined on the blind of the opposite house all evening the man wrote and the observer could see the shadow hand conveying the sheets of paper from the desk to the pile at the side he went to a party and returned but still the hand was moving the sheets next morning he was told that the rooms opposite were occupied by walter scott  a curious glimpse into the psychology of the writer of fiction is shown by the fact that he wrote two of his booksgood ones tooat a time when his health was such that he could not afterwards remember one word of them and listened to them when they were read to him as if he were hearing the work of another man apparently the simplest processes of the brain such as ordinary memory were in complete abeyance and yet the very highest and most complex facultyimagination in its supreme formwas absolutely unimpaired it is an extraordinary fact and one to be pondered over it gives some support to the feeling which every writer of imaginative work must have that his supreme work comes to him in some strange way from without and that he is only the medium for placing it upon the paper the creative thoughtthe germ thought from which a larger growth is to come flies through his brain like a bullet he is surprised at his own idea with no conscious sense of having originated it and here we have a man with all other brain functions paralyzed producing this magnificent work is it possible that we are indeed but conduit pipes from the infinite reservoir of the unknown certainly it is always our best work which leaves the least sense of personal effort  and to pursue this line of thought is it possible that frail physical powers and an unstable nervous system by keeping a mans materialism at its lowest render him a more fitting agent for these spiritual uses it is an old tag that     great genius is to madness close allied     and thin partitions do those rooms divide  but apart from genius even a moderate faculty for imaginative work seems to me to weaken seriously the ties between the soul and the body  look at the british poets of a century ago chatterton burns shelley keats byron burns was the oldest of that brilliant band yet burns was only thirtyeight when he passed away burned out as his brother terribly expressed it shelley it is true died by accident and chatterton by poison but suicide is in itself a sign of a morbid state it is true that rogers lived to be almost a centenarian but he was banker first and poet afterwards wordsworth tennyson and browning have all raised the average age of the poets but for some reason the novelists especially of late years have a deplorable record they will end by being scheduled with the whitelead workers and other dangerous trades look at the really shocking case of the young americans for example what a band of promising young writers have in a few years been swept away there was the author of that admirable book david harum there was frank norris a man who had in him i think the seeds of greatness more than almost any living writer his pit seemed to me one of the finest american novels he also died a premature death then there was stephen cranea man who had also done most brilliant work and there was harold frederic another mastercraftsman is there any profession in the world which in proportion to its numbers could show such losses as that in the meantime out of our own men robert louis stevenson is gone and henry seton merriman and many another  even those great men who are usually spoken of as if they had rounded off their career were really premature in their end thackeray for example in spite of his snowy head was only 52 dickens attained the age of 58 on the whole sir walter with his 61 years of life although he never wrote a novel until he was over 40 had fortunately for the world a longer working career than most of his brethren  he employed his creative faculty for about twenty years which is as much i suppose as shakespeare did the bard of avon is another example of the limited tenure which genius has of life though i believe that he outlived the greater part of his own family who were not a healthy stock he died i should judge of some nervous disease that is shown by the progressive degeneration of his signature probably it was locomotor ataxy which is the special scourge of the imaginative man heine daudet and how many more were its victims as to the tradition first mentioned long after his death that he died of a fever contracted from a drinking bout it is absurd on the face of it since no such fever is known to science but a very moderate drinking bout would be extremely likely to bring a chronic nervous complaint to a disastrous end  one other remark upon scott before i pass on from that line of green volumes which has made me so digressive and so garrulous no account of his character is complete which does not deal with the strange secretive vein which ran through his nature not only did he stretch the truth on many occasions in order to conceal the fact that he was the author of the famous novels but even intimate friends who met him day by day were not aware that he was the man about whom the whole of europe was talking even his wife was ignorant of his pecuniary liabilities until the crash of the ballantyne firm told her for the first time that they were sharers in the ruin a psychologist might trace this strange twist of his mind in the numerous elfish fenellalike characters who flit about and keep their irritating secret through the long chapters of so many of his novels  its a sad book lockharts life it leaves gloom in the mind the sight of this weary giant staggering along burdened with debt overladen with work his wife dead his nerves broken and nothing intact but his honour is one of the most moving in the history of literature but they pass these clouds and all that is left is the memory of the supremely noble man who would not be bent but faced fate to the last and died in his tracks without a whimper he sampled every human emotion great was his joy and great his success great was his downfall and bitter his grief but of all the sons of men i dont think there are many greater than he who lies under the great slab at dryburgh    iii   we can pass the long green ranks of the waverley novels and lockharts life which flanks them here is heavier metal in the four big grey volumes beyond they are an oldfashioned largeprint edition of boswells life of johnson i emphasize the large print for that is the weak point of most of the cheap editions of english classics which come now into the market with subjects which are in the least archaic or abstruse you need good clear type to help you on your way the other is good neither for your eyes nor for your temper better pay a little more and have a book that is made for use  that book interests mefascinates meand yet i wish i could join heartily in that chorus of praise which the kindhearted old bully has enjoyed it is difficult to follow his own advice and to clear ones mind of cant upon the subject for when you have been accustomed to look at him through the sympathetic glasses of macaulay or of boswell it is hard to take them off to rub ones eyes and to have a good honest stare on ones own account at the mans actual words deeds and limitations if you try it you are left with the oddest mixture of impressions how could one express it save that this is john bull taken to literaturethe exaggerated john bull of the caricaturistswith every quality good or evil at its highest here are the rough crust over a kindly heart the explosive temper the arrogance the insular narrowness the want of sympathy and insight the rudeness of perception the positiveness the overbearing bluster the strong deepseated religious principle and every other characteristic of the cruder rougher john bull who was the great grandfather of the present goodnatured johnnie  if boswell had not lived i wonder how much we should hear now of his huge friend with scotch persistence he has succeeded in inoculating the whole world with his hero worship it was most natural that he should himself admire him the relations between the two men were delightful and reflect all credit upon each but they are not a safe basis from which any third person could argue when they met boswell was in his twentythird and johnson in his fiftyfourth year the one was a keen young scot with a mind which was reverent and impressionable the other was a figure from a past generation with his fame already made from the moment of meeting the one was bound to exercise an absolute ascendency over the other which made unbiassed criticism far more difficult than it would be between ordinary father and son up to the end this was the unbroken relation between them  it is all very well to poohpooh boswell as macaulay has done but it is not by chance that a man writes the best biography in the language he had some great and rare literary qualities one was a clear and vivid style more flexible and saxon than that of his great model another was a remarkable discretion which hardly once permitted a fault of taste in this whole enormous book where he must have had to pick his steps with pitfalls on every side of him they say that he was a fool and a coxcomb in private life he is never so with a pen in his hand of all his numerous arguments with johnson where he ventured some little squeak of remonstrance before the roaring no sir came to silence him there are few in which his views were not as experience proved the wiser on the question of slavery he was in the wrong but i could quote from memory at least a dozen cases including such vital subjects as the american revolution the hanoverian dynasty religious toleration and so on where boswells views were those which survived  but where he excels as a biographer is in telling you just those little things that you want to know how often you read the life of a man and are left without the remotest idea of his personality it is not so here the man lives again there is a short description of johnsons personit is not in the life but in the tour to the hebrides the very next book upon the shelf which is typical of his vivid portraiture may i take it down and read you a paragraph of it    his person was large robust i may say approaching to the   gigantic and grown unwieldy from corpulency his countenance   was naturally of the cast of an ancient statue but somewhat   disfigured by the scars of kings evil he was now in his   sixtyfourth year and was become a little dull of hearing his   sight had always been somewhat weak yet so much does mind   govern and even supply the deficiencies of organs that his   perceptions were uncommonly quick and accurate his head and   sometimes also his body shook with a kind of motion like   the effect of palsy he appeared to be frequently disturbed   by cramps or convulsive contractions of the nature of that   distemper called st vitus dance he wore a full suit of   plain brown clothes with twisted hair buttons of the same   colour a large bushy greyish wig a plain shirt black worsted   stockings and silver buckles upon this tour when journeying he   wore boots and a very wide brown cloth greatcoat with pockets   which might almost have held the two volumes of his folio   dictionary and he carried in his hand a large english oak   stick  you must admit that if one cannot reconstruct the great samuel after that it is not mr boswells faultand it is but one of a dozen equally vivid glimpses which he gives us of his hero it is just these penpictures of his of the big uncouth man with his grunts and his groans his gargantuan appetite his twenty cups of tea and his tricks with the orangepeel and the lampposts which fascinate the reader and have given johnson a far broader literary vogue than his writings could have done  for after all which of those writings can be said to have any life today not rasselas surelythat stilted romance the lives of the poets are but a succession of prefaces and the ramblers of ephemeral essays there is the monstrous drudgery of the dictionary a huge piece of spadework a monument to industry but inconceivable to genius london has a few vigorous lines and the journey to the hebrides some spirited pages this with a number of political and other pamphlets was the main output of his lifetime surely it must be admitted that it is not enough to justify his predominant place in english literature and that we must turn to his humble muchridiculed biographer for the real explanation  and then there was his talk what was it which gave it such distinction his clearcut positiveness upon every subject but this is a sign of a narrow finalityimpossible to the man of sympathy and of imagination who sees the other side of every question and understands what a little island the greatest human knowledge must be in the ocean of infinite possibilities which surround us look at the results did ever any single man the very dullest of the race stand convicted of so many incredible blunders it recalls the remark of bagehot that if at any time the views of the most learned could be stamped upon the whole human race the result would be to propagate the most absurd errors he was asked what became of swallows in the winter rolling and wheezing the oracle answered swallows said he certainly sleep all the winter a number of them conglobulate together by flying round and round and then all in a heap throw themselves under water and lie in the bed of a river boswell gravely dockets the information however if i remember right even so sound a naturalist as white of selborne had his doubts about the swallows more wonderful are johnsons misjudgments of his fellowauthors there if anywhere one would have expected to find a sense of proportion yet his conclusions would seem monstrous to a modern taste shakespeare he said never wrote six consecutive good lines he would only admit two good verses in grays exquisite elegy written in a country churchyard where it would take a very acid critic to find two bad ones tristram shandy would not live hamlet was gabble swifts gullivers travels was poor stuff and he never wrote anything good except a tale of a tub voltaire was illiterate rousseau was a scoundrel deists like hume priestley or gibbon could not be honest men  and his political opinions they sound now like a caricature i suppose even in those days they were reactionary a poor man has no honour charles the second was a good king governments should turn out of the civil service all who were on the other side judges in india should be encouraged to trade no country is the richer on account of trade i wonder if adam smith was in the company when this proposition was laid down a landed proprietor should turn out those tenants who did not vote as he wished it is not good for a labourer to have his wages raised when the balance of trade is against a country the margin must be paid in current coin those were a few of his convictions  and then his prejudices most of us have some unreasoning aversion in our more generous moments we are not proud of it but consider those of johnson when they were all eliminated there was not so very much left he hated whigs he disliked scotsmen he detested nonconformists a young lady who joined them was an odious wench he loathed americans so he walked his narrow line belching fire and fury at everything to the right or the left of it macaulays posthumous admiration is all very well but had they met in life macaulay would have contrived to unite under one hat nearly everything that johnson abominated  it cannot be said that these prejudices were founded on any strong principle or that they could not be altered where his own personal interests demanded it this is one of the weak points of his record in his dictionary he abused pensions and pensioners as a means by which the state imposed slavery upon hirelings when he wrote the unfortunate definition a pension must have seemed a most improbable contingency but when george iii either through policy or charity offered him one a little later he made no hesitation in accepting it one would have liked to feel that the violent expression of his convictions represented a real intensity of feeling but the facts in this instance seem against it  he was a great talkerbut his talk was more properly a monologue it was a discursive essay with perhaps a few marginal notes from his subdued audience how could one talk on equal terms with a man who could not brook contradiction or even argument upon the most vital questions in life would goldsmith defend his literary views or burke his whiggism or gibbon his deism there was no common ground of philosophic toleration on which one could stand if he could not argue he would be rude or as goldsmith put it if his pistol missed fire he would knock you down with the butt end in the face of that rhinoceros laugh there was an end of gentle argument napoleon said that all the other kings would say ouf when they heard he was dead and so i cannot help thinking that the older men of johnsons circle must have given a sigh of relief when at last they could speak freely on that which was near their hearts without the danger of a scene where why no sir was very likely to ripen into let us have no more ont certainly one would like to get behind boswells account and to hear a chat between such men as burke and reynolds as to the difference in the freedom and atmosphere of the club on an evening when the formidable doctor was not there as compared to one when he was  no smallest estimate of his character is fair which does not make due allowance for the terrible experiences of his youth and early middle age his spirit was as scarred as his face he was fiftythree when the pension was given him and up to then his existence had been spent in one constant struggle for the first necessities of life for the daily meal and the nightly bed he had seen his comrades of letters die of actual privation from childhood he had known no happiness the half blind gawky youth with dirty linen and twitching limbs had always whether in the streets of lichfield the quadrangle of pembroke or the coffeehouses of london been an object of mingled pity and amusement with a proud and sensitive soul every day of his life must have brought some bitter humiliation such an experience must either break a mans spirit or embitter it and here no doubt was the secret of that roughness that carelessness for the sensibilities of others which caused boswells father to christen him ursa major if his nature was in any way warped it must be admitted that terrific forces had gone to the rending of it his good was innate his evil the result of a dreadful experience  and he had some great qualities memory was the chief of them he had read omnivorously and all that he had read he remembered not merely in the vague general way in which we remember what we read but with every particular of place and date if it were poetry he could quote it by the page latin or english such a memory has its enormous advantage but it carries with it its corresponding defect with the mind so crammed with other peoples goods how can you have room for any fresh manufactures of your own a great memory is i think often fatal to originality in spite of scott and some other exceptions the slate must be clear before you put your own writing upon it when did johnson ever discover an original thought when did he ever reach forward into the future or throw any fresh light upon those enigmas with which mankind is faced overloaded with the past he had space for nothing else modern developments of every sort cast no first herald rays upon his mind he journeyed in france a few years before the greatest cataclysm that the world has ever known and his mind arrested by much that was trivial never once responded to the stormsignals which must surely have been visible around him we read that an amiable monsieur sansterre showed him over his brewery and supplied him with statistics as to his output of beer it was the same foulmouthed sansterre who struck up the drums to drown louis voice at the scaffold the association shows how near the unconscious sage was to the edge of that precipice and how little his learning availed him in discerning it  he would have been a great lawyer or divine nothing one would think could have kept him from canterbury or from the woolsack in either case his memory his learning his dignity and his inherent sense of piety and justice would have sent him straight to the top his brain working within its own limitations was remarkable there is no more wonderful proof of this than his opinions on questions of scotch law as given to boswell and as used by the latter before the scotch judges that an outsider with no special training should at short notice write such weighty opinions crammed with argument and reason is i think as remarkable a tour de force as literature can show  above all he really was a very kindhearted man and that must count for much his was a large charity and it came from a small purse the rooms of his house became a sort of harbour of refuge in which several strange battered hulks found their last moorings there were the blind mr levett and the acidulous mrs williams and the colourless mrs de moulins all old and ailinga trying group amid which to spend ones days his guinea was always ready for the poor acquaintance and no poet was so humble that he might not preface his book with a dedication whose ponderous and sonorous sentences bore the hallmark of their maker it is the rough kindly man the man who bore the poor streetwalker home upon his shoulders who makes one forget or at least forgive the dogmatic pedantic doctor of the club  there is always to me something of interest in the view which a great man takes of old age and death it is the practical test of how far the philosophy of his life has been a sound one hume saw death afar and met it with unostentatious calm johnsons mind flinched from that dread opponent his letters and his talk during his latter years are one long cry of fear it was not cowardice for physically he was one of the most stouthearted men that ever lived there were no limits to his courage it was spiritual diffidence coupled with an actual belief in the possibilities of the other world which a more humane and liberal theology has done something to soften how strange to see him cling so desperately to that crazy body with its gout its asthma its st vitus dance and its six gallons of dropsy what could be the attraction of an existence where eight hours of every day were spent groaning in a chair and sixteen wheezing in a bed i would give one of these legs said he for another year of life none the less when the hour did at last strike no man could have borne himself with more simple dignity and courage say what you will of him and resent him how you may you can never open those four grey volumes without getting some mental stimulus some desire for wider reading some insight into human learning or character which should leave you a better and a wiser man    iv   next to my johnsoniana are my gibbonstwo editions if you please for my old complete one being somewhat crabbed in the print i could not resist getting a set of burys new sixvolume presentment of the history in reading that book you dont want to be handicapped in any way you want fair type clear paper and a light volume you are not to read it lightly but with some earnestness of purpose and keenness for knowledge with a classical atlas at your elbow and a notebook hard by taking easy stages and harking back every now and then to keep your grip of the past and to link it up with what follows there are no thrills in it you wont be kept out of your bed at night nor will you forget your appointments during the day but you will feel a certain sedate pleasure in the doing of it and when it is done you will have gained something which you can never losesomething solid something definite something that will make you broader and deeper than before  were i condemned to spend a year upon a desert island and allowed only one book for my companion it is certainly that which i should choose for consider how enormous is its scope and what food for thought is contained within those volumes it covers a thousand years of the worlds history it is full and good and accurate its standpoint is broadly philosophic its style dignified with our more elastic methods we may consider his manner pompous but he lived in an age when johnsons turgid periods had corrupted our literature for my own part i do not dislike gibbons pomposity a paragraph should be measured and sonorous if it ventures to describe the advance of a roman legion or the debate of a greek senate you are wafted upwards with this lucid and just spirit by your side upholding and instructing you beneath you are warring nations the clash of races the rise and fall of dynasties the conflict of creeds serene you float above them all and ever as the panorama flows past the weighty measured unemotional voice whispers the true meaning of the scene into your ear  it is a most mighty story that is told you begin with a description of the state of the roman empire when the early caesars were on the throne and when it was undisputed mistress of the world you pass down the line of the emperors with their strange alternations of greatness and profligacy descending occasionally to criminal lunacy when the empire went rotten it began at the top and it took centuries to corrupt the man behind the spear neither did a religion of peace affect him much for in spite of the adoption of christianity roman history was still written in blood the new creed had only added a fresh cause of quarrel and violence to the many which already existed and the wars of angry nations were mild compared to those of excited sectaries  then came the mighty rushing wind from without blowing from the waste places of the world destroying confounding whirling madly through the old order leaving broken chaos behind it but finally cleansing and purifying that which was stale and corrupt a stormcentre somewhere in the north of china did suddenly what it may very well do again the human volcano blew its top off and europe was covered by the destructive debris the absurd point is that it was not the conquerors who overran the roman empire but it was the terrified fugitives who like a drove of stampeded cattle blundered over everything which barred their way it was a wild dramatic timethe time of the formation of the modern races of europe the nations came whirling in out of the north and east like duststorms and amid the seeming chaos each was blended with its neighbour so as to toughen the fibre of the whole the fickle gaul got his steadying from the franks the steady saxon got his touch of refinement from the norman the italian got a fresh lease of life from the lombard and the ostrogoth the corrupt greek made way for the manly and earnest mahommedan everywhere one seems to see a great hand blending the seeds and so one can now save only that emigration has taken the place of war it does not for example take much prophetic power to say that something very great is being built up on the other side of the atlantic when on an angloceltic basis you see the italian the hun and the scandinavian being added you feel that there is no human quality which may not be thereby evolved  but to revert to gibbon the next stage is the flight of empire from rome to byzantium even as the angloceltic power might find its centre some day not in london but in chicago or toronto there is the whole strange story of the tidal wave of mahommedanism from the south submerging all north africa spreading right and left to india on the one side and to spain on the other finally washing right over the walls of byzantium until it the bulwark of christianity became what it is now the advanced european fortress of the moslem such is the tremendous narrative covering half the worlds known history which can all be acquired and made part of yourself by the aid of that humble atlas pencil and notebook already recommended  when all is so interesting it is hard to pick examples but to me there has always seemed to be something peculiarly impressive in the first entrance of a new race on to the stage of history it has something of the glamour which hangs round the early youth of a great man you remember how the russians made their debutcame down the great rivers and appeared at the bosphorus in two hundred canoes from which they endeavoured to board the imperial galleys singular that a thousand years have passed and that the ambition of the russians is still to carry out the task at which their skinclad ancestors failed or the turks again you may recall the characteristic ferocity with which they opened their career a handful of them were on some mission to the emperor the town was besieged from the landward side by the barbarians and the asiatics obtained leave to take part in a skirmish the first turk galloped out shot a barbarian with his arrow and then lying down beside him proceeded to suck his blood which so horrified the mans comrades that they could not be brought to face such uncanny adversaries so from opposite sides those two great races arrived at the city which was to be the stronghold of the one and the ambition of the other for so many centuries  and then even more interesting than the races which arrive are those that disappear there is something there which appeals most powerfully to the imagination take for example the fate of those vandals who conquered the north of africa they were a german tribe blueeyed and flaxenhaired from somewhere in the elbe country suddenly they too were seized with the strange wandering madness which was epidemic at the time away they went on the line of least resistance which is always from north to south and from east to west southwest was the course of the vandalsa course which must have been continued through pure love of adventure since in the thousands of miles which they traversed there were many fair restingplaces if that were only their quest  they crossed the south of france conquered spain and finally the more adventurous passed over into africa where they occupied the old roman province for two or three generations they held it much as the english hold india and their numbers were at the least some hundreds of thousands presently the roman empire gave one of those flickers which showed that there was still some fire among the ashes belisarius landed in africa and reconquered the province the vandals were cut off from the sea and fled inland whither did they carry those blue eyes and that flaxen hair were they exterminated by the negroes or did they amalgamate with them travellers have brought back stories from the mountains of the moon of a negroid race with light eyes and hair is it possible that here we have some trace of the vanished germans  it recalls the parallel case of the lost settlements in greenland that also has always seemed to me to be one of the most romantic questions in historythe more so perhaps as i have strained my eyes to see across the icefloes the greenland coast at the point or near it where the old eyrbyggia must have stood that was the scandinavian city founded by colonists from iceland which grew to be a considerable place so much so that they sent to denmark for a bishop that would be in the fourteenth century the bishop coming out to his see found that he was unable to reach it on account of a climatic change which had brought down the ice and filled the strait between iceland and greenland from that day to this no one has been able to say what has become of these old scandinavians who were at the time be it remembered the most civilized and advanced race in europe they may have been overwhelmed by the esquimaux the despised skroelingor they may have amalgamated with themor conceivably they might have held their own very little is known yet of that portion of the coast it would be strange if some nansen or peary were to stumble upon the remains of the old colony and find possibly in that antiseptic atmosphere a complete mummy of some bygone civilization  but once more to return to gibbon what a mind it must have been which first planned and then with the incessant labour of twenty years carried out that enormous work there was no classical author so little known no byzantine historian so diffuse no monkish chronicle so crabbed that they were not assimilated and worked into their appropriate place in the huge framework great application great perseverance great attention to detail was needed in all this but the coral polyp has all those qualities and somehow in the heart of his own creation the individuality of the man himself becomes as insignificant and as much overlooked as that of the little creature that builds the reef a thousand know gibbons work for one who cares anything for gibbon  and on the whole this is justified by the facts some men are greater than their work their work only represents one facet of their character and there may be a dozen others all remarkable and uniting to make one complex and unique creature it was not so with gibbon he was a coldblooded man with a brain which seemed to have grown at the expense of his heart i cannot recall in his life one generous impulse one ardent enthusiasm save for the classics his excellent judgment was never clouded by the haze of human emotionor at least it was such an emotion as was well under the control of his will could anything be more laudableor less lovable he abandons his girl at the order of his father and sums it up that he sighs as a lover but obeys as a son the father dies and he records the fact with the remark that the tears of a son are seldom lasting the terrible spectacle of the french revolution excited in his mind only a feeling of selfpity because his retreat in switzerland was invaded by the unhappy refugees just as a grumpy country gentleman in england might complain that he was annoyed by the trippers there is a touch of dislike in all the allusions which boswell makes to gibbonoften without even mentioning his nameand one cannot read the great historians life without understanding why  i should think that few men have been born with the material for selfsufficient contentment more completely within himself than edward gibbon he had every gift which a great scholar should have an insatiable thirst for learning in every form immense industry a retentive memory and that broadly philosophic temperament which enables a man to rise above the partisan and to become the impartial critic of human affairs it is true that at the time he was looked upon as bitterly prejudiced in the matter of religious thought but his views are familiar to modern philosophy and would shock no susceptibilities in these more liberal and more virtuous days turn him up in that encyclopedia and see what the latest word is upon his contentions upon the famous fifteenth and sixteenth chapters it is not necessary to dwell says the biographer because at this time of day no christian apologist dreams of denying the substantial truth of any of the more important allegations of gibbon christians may complain of the suppression of some circumstances which might influence the general result and they must remonstrate against the unfair construction of their case but they no longer refuse to hear any reasonable evidence tending to show that persecution was less severe than had been once believed and they have slowly learned that they can afford to concede the validity of all the secondary causes assigned by gibbon and even of others still more discreditable the fact is as the historian has again and again admitted that his account of the secondary causes which contributed to the progress and establishment of christianity leaves the question as to the natural or supernatural origin of christianity practically untouched this is all very well but in that case how about the century of abuse which has been showered upon the historian some posthumous apology would seem to be called for  physically gibbon was as small as johnson was large but there was a curious affinity in their bodily ailments johnson as a youth was ulcerated and tortured by the kings evil in spite of the royal touch gibbon gives us a concise but lurid account of his own boyhood    i was successively afflicted by lethargies and fevers by   opposite tendencies to a consumptive and dropsical habit   by a contraction of my nerves a fistula in my eye and the   bite of a dog most vehemently suspected of madness every   practitioner was called to my aid the fees of the doctors   were swelled by the bills of the apothecaries and surgeons   there was a time when i swallowed more physic than food and   my body is still marked by the indelible scars of lancets   issues and caustics  such is his melancholy report the fact is that the england of that day seems to have been very full of that hereditary form of chronic illhealth which we call by the general name of struma how far the harddrinking habits in vogue for a century or so before had anything to do with it i cannot say nor can i trace a connection between struma and learning but one has only to compare this account of gibbon with johnsons nervous twitches his scarred face and his st vitus dance to realize that these the two most solid english writers of their generation were each heir to the same gruesome inheritance  i wonder if there is any picture extant of gibbon in the character of subaltern in the south hampshire militia with his small frame his huge head his round chubby face and the pretentious uniform he must have looked a most extraordinary figure never was there so round a peg in a square hole his father a man of a very different type held a commission and this led to poor gibbon becoming a soldier in spite of himself war had broken out the regiment was mustered and the unfortunate student to his own utter dismay was kept under arms until the conclusion of hostilities for three years he was divorced from his books and loudly and bitterly did he resent it the south hampshire militia never saw the enemy which is perhaps as well for them even gibbon himself pokes fun at them but after three years under canvas it is probable that his men had more cause to smile at their bookworm captain than he at his men his hand closed much more readily on a penhandle than on a swordhilt in his lament one of the items is that his colonels example encouraged the daily practice of hard and even excessive drinking which gave him the gout the loss of so many busy and idle hours were not compensated for by any elegant pleasure says he and my temper was insensibly soured by the society of rustic officers who were alike deficient in the knowledge of scholars and the manners of gentlemen the picture of gibbon flushed with wine at the messtable with these harddrinking squires around him must certainly have been a curious one he admits however that he found consolations as well as hardships in his spell of soldiering it made him an englishman once more it improved his health it changed the current of his thoughts it was even useful to him as an historian in a celebrated and characteristic sentence he says the discipline and evolutions of a modern battalion gave me a clearer notion of the phalanx and the legions and the captain of the hampshire grenadiers has not been useless to the historian of the roman empire  if we dont know all about gibbon it is not his fault for he wrote no fewer than six accounts of his own career each differing from the other and all equally bad a man must have more heart and soul than gibbon to write a good autobiography it is the most difficult of all human compositions calling for a mixture of tact discretion and frankness which make an almost impossible blend gibbon in spite of his foreign education was a very typical englishman in many ways with the reticence selfrespect and selfconsciousness of the race no british autobiography has ever been frank and consequently no british autobiography has ever been good trollopes perhaps is as good as any that i know but of all forms of literature it is the one least adapted to the national genius you could not imagine a british rousseau still less a british benvenuto cellini in one way it is to the credit of the race that it should be so if we do as much evil as our neighbours we at least have grace enough to be ashamed of it and to suppress its publication  there on the left of gibbon is my fine edition lord braybrookes of pepys diary that is in truth the greatest autobiography in our language and yet it was not deliberately written as such when mr pepys jotted down from day to day every quaint or mean thought which came into his head he would have been very much surprised had any one told him that he was doing a work quite unique in our literature yet his involuntary autobiography compiled for some obscure reason or for private reference but certainly never meant for publication is as much the first in that line of literature as boswells book among biographies or gibbons among histories  as a race we are too afraid of giving ourselves away ever to produce a good autobiography we resent the charge of national hypocrisy and yet of all nations we are the least frank as to our own emotionsespecially on certain sides of them those affairs of the heart for example which are such an index to a mans character and so profoundly modify his lifewhat space do they fill in any mans autobiography perhaps in gibbons case the omission matters little for save in the instance of his wellcontrolled passion for the future madame neckar his heart was never an organ which gave him much trouble the fact is that when the british author tells his own story he tries to make himself respectable and the more respectable a man is the less interesting does he become rousseau may prove himself a maudlin degenerate cellini may stand selfconvicted as an amorous ruffian if they are not respectable they are thoroughly human and interesting all the same  the wonderful thing about mr pepys is that a man should succeed in making himself seem so insignificant when really he must have been a man of considerable character and attainments who would guess it who read all these trivial comments these catalogues of what he had for dinner these inane domestic confidencesall the more interesting for their inanity the effect left upon the mind is of some grotesque character in a play fussy selfconscious blustering with women timid with men dressproud purseproud trimming in politics and in religion a garrulous gossip immersed always in trifles and yet though this was the daybyday man the yearbyyear man was a very different person a devoted civil servant an eloquent orator an excellent writer a capable musician and a ripe scholar who accumulated 3000 volumesa large private library in those daysand had the public spirit to leave them all to his university you can forgive old pepys a good deal of his philandering when you remember that he was the only official of the navy office who stuck to his post during the worst days of the plague he may have beenindeed he assuredly wasa coward but the coward who has sense of duty enough to overcome his cowardice is the most truly brave of mankind  but the one amazing thing which will never be explained about pepys is what on earth induced him to go to the incredible labour of writing down in shorthand cipher not only all the trivialities of his life but even his own very gross delinquencies which any other man would have been only too glad to forget the diary was kept for about ten years and was abandoned because the strain upon his eyes of the crabbed shorthand was helping to destroy his sight i suppose that he became so familiar with it that he wrote it and read it as easily as he did ordinary script but even so it was a huge labour to compile these books of strange manuscript was it an effort to leave some memorial of his own existence to single him out from all the countless sons of men in such a case he would assuredly have left directions in somebodys care with a reference to it in the deed by which he bequeathed his library to cambridge in that way he could have ensured having his diary read at any date he chose to name after his death but no allusion to it was left and if it had not been for the ingenuity and perseverance of a single scholar the dusty volumes would still lie unread in some top shelf of the pepysian library publicity then was not his object what could it have been the only alternative is reference and selfinformation you will observe in his character a curious vein of method and order by which he loved to be for ever estimating his exact wealth cataloguing his books or scheduling his possessions it is conceivable that this systematic recording of his deedseven of his misdeedswas in some sort analogous sprung from a morbid tidiness of mind it may be a weak explanation but it is difficult to advance another one  one minor point which must strike the reader of pepys is how musical a nation the english of that day appear to have been every one seems to have had command of some instrument many of several partsinging was common there is not much of charles the seconds days which we need envy but there at least they seem to have had the advantage of us it was real music toomusic of dignity and tendernesswith words which were worthy of such treatment this cult may have been the last remains of those mediaeval prereformation days when the english church choirs were as i have read somewhere the most famous in europe a strange thing this for a land which in the whole of last century has produced no single master of the first rank  what national change is it which has driven music from the land has life become so serious that song has passed out of it in southern climes one hears poor folk sing for pure lightness of heart in england alas the sound of a poor mans voice raised in song means only too surely that he is drunk and yet it is consoling to know that the germ of the old powers is always there ready to sprout forth if they be nourished and cultivated if our cathedral choirs were the best in the old catholic days it is equally true i believe that our orchestral associations are now the best in europe so at least the german papers said on the occasion of the recent visit of a north of england choir but one cannot read pepys without knowing that the general musical habit is much less cultivated now than of old    v   it is a long jump from samuel pepys to george borrowfrom one pole of the human character to the otherand yet they are in contact on the shelf of my favourite authors there is something wonderful i think about the land of cornwall that long peninsula extending out into the ocean has caught all sorts of strange floating things and has held them there in isolation until they have woven themselves into the texture of the cornish race what is this strange strain which lurks down yonder and every now and then throws up a great man with singular unenglish ways and features for all the world to marvel at it is not celtic nor is it the dark old iberian further and deeper lie the springs is it not semitic phoenician the roving men of tyre with noble southern faces and oriental imaginations who have in faroff days forgotten their blue mediterranean and settled on the granite shores of the northern sea  whence came the wonderful face and great personality of henry irving how strong how beautiful how unsaxon it was i only know that his mother was a cornish woman whence came the intense glowing imagination of the brontesso unlike the missaustenlike calm of their predecessors again i only know that their mother was a cornish woman whence came this huge elfin creature george borrow with his eagle head perched on his rocklike shoulders brownfaced whiteheaded a king among men where did he get that remarkable face those strange mental gifts which place him by himself in literature once more his father was a cornishman yes there is something strange and weird and great lurking down yonder in the great peninsula which juts into the western sea borrow may if he so pleases call himself an east anglianan english englishman as he loved to term itbut is it a coincidence that the one east anglian born of cornish blood was the one who showed these strange qualities the birth was accidental the qualities throw back to the twilight of the world  there are some authors from whom i shrink because they are so voluminous that i feel that do what i may i can never hope to be well read in their works therefore and very weakly i avoid them altogether there is balzac for example with his hundred odd volumes i am told that some of them are masterpieces and the rest potboilers but that no one is agreed which is which such an author makes an undue claim upon the little span of mortal years because he asks too much one is inclined to give him nothing at all dumas too i stand on the edge of him and look at that huge crop and content myself with a sample here and there but no one could raise this objection to borrow a months readingeven for a leisurely readerwill master all that he has written there are lavengro the bible in spain romany rye and finally if you wish to go further wild wales only four booksnot much to found a great reputation uponbut then there are no other four books quite like them in the language  he was a very strange man bigoted prejudiced obstinate inclined to be sulky as wayward as a man could be so far his catalogue of qualities does not seem to pick him as a winner but he had one great and rare gift he preserved through all his days a sense of the great wonder and mystery of lifethe child sense which is so quickly dulled not only did he retain it himself but he was wordmaster enough to make other people hark back to it also as he writes you cannot help seeing through his eyes and nothing which his eyes saw or his ear heard was ever dull or commonplace it was all strange mystic with some deeper meaning struggling always to the light if he chronicled his conversation with a washerwoman there was something arresting in the words he said something singular in her reply if he met a man in a publichouse one felt after reading his account that one would wish to know more of that man if he approached a town he saw and made you seenot a collection of commonplace houses or frowsy streets but something very strange and wonderful the winding river the noble bridge the old castle the shadows of the dead every human being every object was not so much a thing in itself as a symbol and reminder of the past he looked through a man at that which the man represented was his name welsh then in an instant the individual is forgotten and he is off dragging you in his train to ancient britons intrusive saxons unheardof bards owen glendower mountain raiders and a thousand fascinating things or is it a danish name he leaves the individual in all his modern commonplace while he flies off to huge skulls at hythe in parenthesis i may remark that i have examined the said skulls with some care and they seemed to me to be rather below the human average to vikings berserkers varangians harald haardraada and the innate wickedness of the pope to borrow all roads lead to rome  but my word what english the fellow could write what an organroll he could get into his sentences how nervous and vital and vivid it all is  there is music in every line of it if you have been blessed with an ear for the music of prose take the chapter in lavengro of how the screaming horror came upon his spirit when he was encamped in the dingle the man who wrote that has caught the true mantle of bunyan and defoe and observe the art of it under all the simplicitynotice for example the curious weird effect produced by the studied repetition of the word dingle coming ever round and round like the masternote in a chime or take the passage about britain towards the end of the bible in spain i hate quoting from these masterpieces if only for the very selfish reason that my poor setting cannot afford to show up brilliants none the less cost what it may let me transcribe that one noble piece of impassioned prose    o england long long may it be ere the sun of thy glory sink   beneath the wave of darkness though gloomy and portentous   clouds are now gathering rapidly around thee still still   may it please the almighty to disperse them and to grant thee   a futurity longer in duration and still brighter in renown   than thy past or if thy doom be at hand may that doom be   a noble one and worthy of her who has been styled the old   queen of the waters may thou sink if thou dost sink amidst   blood and flame with a mighty noise causing more than one   nation to participate in thy downfall of all fates may it   please the lord to preserve thee from a disgraceful and a   slow decay becoming ere extinct a scorn and a mockery for   those selfsame foes who now though they envy and abhor thee   still fear thee nay even against their will honour and   respect thee remove from thee the false prophets who   have seen vanity and divined lies who have daubed thy wall   with untempered mortar that it may fall who see visions   of peace where there is no peace who have strengthened the   hands of the wicked and made the heart of the righteous sad   oh do this and fear not the result for either shall   thy end be a majestic and an enviable one or god shall   perpetuate thy reign upon the waters thou old queen  or take the fight with the flaming tinman its too long for quotationbut read it read every word of it where in the language can you find a stronger more condensed and more restrained narrative i have seen with my own eyes many a noble fight more than one international battle where the best of two great countries have been pitted against each otheryet the secondhand impression of borrows description leaves a more vivid remembrance upon my mind than any of them this is the real witchcraft of letters  he was a great fighter himself he has left a secure reputation in other than literary circlescircles which would have been amazed to learn that he was a writer of books with his natural advantages his six foot three of height and his staglike agility he could hardly fail to be formidable but he was a scientific sparrer as well though he had i have been told a curious sprawling fashion of his own and how his heart was in ithow he loved the fighting men you remember his thumbnail sketches of his heroes if you dont i must quote one and if you do you will be glad to read it again    theres cribb the champion of england and perhaps the best   man in england there he is with his huge massive figure   and face wonderfully like that of a lion there is belcher   the younger not the mighty one who is gone to his place   but the teucer belcher the most scientific pugilist that   ever entered a ring only wanting strength to be i wont say   what he appears to walk before me now as he did that   evening with his white hat white great coat thin genteel   figure springy step and keen determined eye crosses him   what a contrast grim savage shelton who has a civil word   for nobody and a hard blow for anybody hard one blow   given with the proper play of his athletic arm will unsense   a giant yonder individual who strolls about with his hands   behind him supporting his brown coat lappets undersized   and who looks anything but what he is is the king of the   lightweights socalledrandall the terrible randall   who has irish blood in his veins not the better for that   nor the worse and not far from him is his last antagonist   ned turner who though beaten by him still thinks himself   as good a man in which he is perhaps right for it was   a near thing but how shall i name them all they were   there by dozens and all tremendous in their way there   was bulldog hudson and fearless scroggins who beat the   conqueror of sam the jew there was black richmondno   he was not there but i knew him well he was the most   dangerous of blacks even with a broken thigh there was   purcell who could never conquer until all seemed over with   him there waswhat shall i name thee last ay why not   i believe that thou art the last of all that strong family   still above the sod where mayst thou long continuetrue   piece of english stufftom of bedford hail to thee tom   of bedford or by whatever name it may please thee to be   called spring or winter hail to thee sixfoot englishman   of the brown eye worthy to have carried a sixfoot bow at   flodden where englands yeomen triumphed over scotlands   king his clans and chivalry hail to thee last of english   bruisers after all the many victories which thou hast   achievedtrue english victories unbought by yellow gold  those are words from the heart long may it be before we lose the fighting blood which has come to us from of old in a world of peace we shall at last be able to root it from our natures in a world which is armed to the teeth it is the last and only guarantee of our future neither our numbers nor our wealth nor the waters which guard us can hold us safe if once the old iron passes from our spirit barbarous perhapsbut there are possibilities for barbarism and none in this wide world for effeminacy  borrows views of literature and of literary men were curious publisher and brother author he hated them with a fine comprehensive hatred in all his books i cannot recall a word of commendation to any living writer nor has he posthumous praise for those of the generation immediately preceding southey indeed he commends with what most would regard as exaggerated warmth but for the rest he who lived when dickens thackeray and tennyson were all in their glorious prime looks fixedly past them at some obscure dane or forgotten welshman the reason was i expect that his proud soul was bitterly wounded by his own early failures and slow recognition he knew himself to be a chief in the clan and when the clan heeded him not he withdrew in haughty disdain look at his proud sensitive face and you hold the key to his life  harking back and talking of pugilism i recall an incident which gave me pleasure a friend of mine read a pugilistic novel called rodney stone to a famous australian prizefighter stretched upon a bed of mortal sickness the dying gladiator listened with intent interest but keen professional criticism to the combats of the novel the reader had got to the point where the young amateur fights the brutal berks berks is winded but holds his adversary off with a stiff left arm the amateurs second in the story an old prizefighter shouts some advice to him as to how to deal with the situation thats right by  hes got him yelled the stricken man in the bed who cares for critics after that  you can see my own devotion to the ring in that trio of brown volumes which stand appropriately enough upon the flank of borrow they are the three volumes of pugilistica given me years ago by my old friend robert barr a mine in which you can never pick for half an hour without striking it rich alas for the horrible slang of those days the vapid witless corinthian talk with its ogles and its fogles its pointless jokes its maddening habit of italicizing a word or two in every sentence even these stern and desperate encounters fit sports for the men of albuera and waterloo become dull and vulgar in that dreadful jargon you have to tum to hazlitts account of the encounter between the gasman and the bristol bull to feel the savage strength of it all it is a hardened reader who does not wince even in print before that frightful righthander which felled the giant and left him in red ruin from eyebrow to jaw but even if there be no hazlitt present to describe such a combat it is a poor imagination which is not fired by the deeds of the humble heroes who lived once so vividly upon earth and now only appeal to faithful ones in these littleread pages they were picturesque creatures men of great force of character and will who reached the limits of human bravery and endurance there is jackson on the cover gold upon brown gentleman jackson jackson of the balustrade calf and the noble head who wrote his name with an 88pound weight dangling from his little finger  here is a penportrait of him by one who knew him well    i can see him now as i saw him in 84 walking down holborn   hill towards smithfield he had on a scarlet coat worked   in gold at the buttonholes ruffles and frill of fine lace   a small white stock no collar they were not then invented   a looped hat with a broad black band buff kneebreeches   and long silk strings striped white silk stockings pumps   and paste buckles his waistcoat was pale blue satin   sprigged with white it was impossible to look on his fine   ample chest his noble shoulders his waist if anything   too small his large but not too large hips his balustrade   calf and beautifully turned but not over delicate ankle   his firm foot and peculiarly small hand without thinking   that nature had sent him on earth as a model on he went   at a good five miles and a half an hour the envy of all   men and the admiration of all women  now that is a discriminating portraita portrait which really helps you to see that which the writer sets out to describe after reading it one can understand why even in reminiscent sporting descriptions of those old days amid all the tonis and bills and jacks it is always mr john jackson he was the friend and instructor of byron and of half the bloods in town jackson it was who in the heat of combat seized the jew mendoza by the hair and so ensured that the pugs for ever afterwards should be a closecropped race inside you see the square face of old broughton the supreme fighting man of the eighteenth century the man whose humble ambition it was to begin with the pivot man of the prussian guard and work his way through the regiment he had a chronicler the good captain godfrey who has written some english which would take some beating how about this passage    he stops as regularly as the swordsman and carries his blows   truly in the line he steps not back distrusting of himself   to stop a blow and puddle in the return with an arm unaided   by his body producing but flyflap blows no broughton steps   boldly and firmly in bids a welcome to the coming blow   receives it with his guardian arm then with a general   summons of his swelling muscles and his firm body seconding   his arm and supplying it with all its weight pours the   piledriving force upon his man  one would like a little more from the gallant captain poor broughton he fought once too often why damn you youre beat cried the royal duke not beat your highness but i cant see my man cried the blinded old hero alas there is the tragedy of the ring as it is of life the wave of youth surges ever upwards and the wave that went before is swept sobbing on to the shingle youth will be served said the terse old pugs but what so sad as the downfall of the old champion wise tom springtom of bedford as borrow calls himhad the wit to leave the ring unconquered in the prime of his fame cribb also stood out as a champion but broughton slack belcher and the resttheir end was one common tragedy  the latter days of the fighting men were often curious and unexpected though as a rule they were shortlived for the alternation of the excess of their normal existence and the asceticism of their training undermined their constitution their popularity among both men and women was their undoing and the king of the ring went down at last before that deadliest of lightweights the microbe of tubercle or some equally fatal and perhaps less reputable bacillus the crockiest of spectators had a better chance of life than the magnificent young athlete whom he had come to admire jem belcher died at 30 hooper at 31 pearce the game chicken at 32 turner at 35 hudson at 38 randall the nonpareil at 34 occasionally when they did reach mature age their lives took the strangest turns gully as is well known became a wealthy man and member for pontefract in the reform parliament humphries developed into a successful coal merchant jack martin became a convinced teetotaller and vegetarian jem ward the black diamond developed considerable powers as an artist cribb spring langan and many others were successful publicans strangest of all perhaps was broughton who spent his old age haunting every sale of old pictures and bricabrac one who saw him has recorded his impression of the silent old gentleman clad in oldfashioned garb with his catalogue in his handbroughton once the terror of england and now the harmless and gentle collector  many of them as was but natural died violent deaths some by accident and a few by their own hands no man of the first class ever died in the ring the nearest approach to it was the singular and mournful fate which befell simon byrne the brave irishman who had the misfortune to cause the death of his antagonist angus mackay and afterwards met his own end at the hands of deaf burke neither byrne nor mackay could however be said to be boxers of the very first rank it certainly would appear if we may argue from the prizering that the human machine becomes more delicate and is more sensitive to jar or shock in the early days a fatal end to a fight was exceedingly rare gradually such tragedies became rather more common until now even with the gloves they have shocked us by their frequency and we feel that the rude play of our forefathers is indeed too rough for a more highly organized generation still it may help us to clear our minds of cant if we remember that within two or three years the huntingfield and the steeplechase claim more victims than the prizering has done in two centuries  many of these men had served their country well with that strength and courage which brought them fame cribb was if i mistake not in the royal navy so was the terrible dwarf scroggins all chest and shoulders whose springing hits for many a year carried all before them until the canny welshman ned turner stopped his career only to be stopped in turn by the brilliant irishman jack randall shaw who stood high among the heavyweights was cut to pieces by the french cuirassiers in the first charge at waterloo the brutal berks died greatly in the breach of badajos the lives of these men stood for something and that was just the one supreme thing which the times called foran unflinching endurance which could bear up against a world in arms look at jem belcherbeautiful heroic jem a manlier byronbut there this is not an essay on the old prizering and one mans lore is another mans bore let us pass those three lowdown unjustifiable fascinating volumes and on to nobler topics beyond    vi   which are the great short stories of the english language not a bad basis for a debate this i am sure of that there are far fewer supremely good short stories than there are supremely good long books it takes more exquisite skill to carve the cameo than the statue but the strangest thing is that the two excellences seem to be separate and even antagonistic skill in the one by no means ensures skill in the other the great masters of our literature fielding scott dickens thackeray reade have left no single short story of outstanding merit behind them with the possible exception of wandering willies tale in red gauntlet on the other hand men who have been very great in the short story stevenson poe and bret harte have written no great book the champion sprinter is seldom a fivemiler as well  well now if you had to choose your team whom would you put in you have not really a large choice what are the points by which you judge them you want strength novelty compactness intensity of interest a single vivid impression left upon the mind poe is the master of all i may remark by the way that it is the sight of his green cover the next in order upon my favourite shelf which has started this train of thought poe is to my mind the supreme original short story writer of all time his brain was like a seedpod full of seeds which flew carelessly around and from which have sprung nearly all our modern types of story just think of what he did in his offhand prodigal fashion seldom troubling to repeat a success but pushing on to some new achievement to him must be ascribed the monstrous progeny of writers on the detection of crimequorum pars parva fui each may find some little development of his own but his main art must trace back to those admirable stories of monsieur dupin so wonderful in their masterful force their reticence their quick dramatic point after all mental acuteness is the one quality which can be ascribed to the ideal detective and when that has once been admirably done succeeding writers must necessarily be content for all time to follow in the same main track but not only is poe the originator of the detective story all treasurehunting cryptogramsolving yarns trace back to his gold bug just as all pseudoscientific verneandwells stories have their prototypes in the voyage to the moon and the case of monsieur valdemar if every man who receives a cheque for a story which owes its springs to poe were to pay tithe to a monument for the master he would have a pyramid as big as that of cheops  and yet i could only give him two places in my team one would be for the gold bug the other for the murder in the rue morgue i do not see how either of those could be bettered but i would not admit perfect excellence to any other of his stories these two have a proportion and a perspective which are lacking in the others the horror or weirdness of the idea intensified by the coolness of the narrator and of the principal actor dupin in the one case and le grand in the other the same may be said of bret harte also one of those great short story tellers who proved himself incapable of a longer flight he was always like one of his own goldminers who struck a rich pocket but found no continuous reef the pocket was alas a very limited one but the gold was of the best the luck of roaring camp and tennessees partner are both i think worthy of a place among my immortals they are it is true so tinged with dickens as to be almost parodies of the master but they have a symmetry and satisfying completeness as short stories to which dickens himself never attained the man who can read those two stories without a gulp in the throat is not a man i envy  and stevenson surely he shall have two places also for where is a finer sense of what the short story can do he wrote in my judgment two masterpieces in his life and each of them is essentially a short story though the one happened to be published as a volume the one is dr jekyll and mr hyde which whether you take it as a vivid narrative or as a wonderfully deep and true allegory is a supremely fine bit of work the other story of my choice would be the pavilion on the linksthe very model of dramatic narrative that story stamped itself so clearly on my brain when i read it in cornhill that when i came across it again many years afterwards in volume form i was able instantly to recognize two small modifications of the texteach very much for the worsefrom the original form they were small things but they seemed somehow like a chip on a perfect statue surely it is only a very fine work of art which could leave so definite an impression as that of course there are a dozen other of his stories which would put the average writers best work to shame all with the strange stevenson glamour upon them of which i may discourse later but only to those two would i be disposed to admit that complete excellence which would pass them into such a team as this  and who else if it be not an impertinence to mention a contemporary i should certainly have a brace from rudyard kipling his power his compression his dramatic sense his way of glowing suddenly into a vivid flame all mark him as a great master but which are we to choose from that long and varied collection many of which have claims to the highest speaking from memory i should say that the stories of his which have impressed me most are the drums of the fore and aft the man who would be king the man who was and the brushwood boy perhaps on the whole it is the first two which i should choose to add to my list of masterpieces  they are stories which invite criticism and yet defy it the great batsman at cricket is the man who can play an unorthodox game take every liberty which is denied to inferior players and yet succeed brilliantly in the face of his disregard of law so it is here i should think the model of these stories is the most dangerous that any young writer could follow there is digression that most deadly fault in the short narrative there is incoherence there is want of proportion which makes the story stand still for pages and bound forward in a few sentences but genius overrides all that just as the great cricketer hooks the off ball and glides the straight one to leg there is a dash an exuberance a fullblooded confident mastery which carries everything before it yes no team of immortals would be complete which did not contain at least two representatives of kipling  and now whom nathaniel hawthorne never appealed in the highest degree to me the fault i am sure is my own but i always seemed to crave stronger fare than he gave me it was too subtle too elusive for effect indeed i have been more affected by some of the short work of his son julian though i can quite understand the high artistic claims which the senior writer has and the delicate charm of his style there is bulwer lytton as a claimant his haunted and the haunters is the very best ghost story that i know as such i should include it in my list there was a story too in one of the old blackwoodsmetempsychosis it was called which left so deep an impression upon my mind that i should be inclined though it is many years since i read it to number it with the best another story which has the characteristics of great work is grant allens john creedy so good a story upon so philosophic a basis deserves a place among the best there is some firstclass work to be picked also from the contemporary work of wells and of quillercouch which reaches a high standard one little sketchold oeson in noughts and crossesis in my opinion as good as anything of the kind which i have ever read  and all this didactic talk comes from looking at that old green cover of poe i am sure that if i had to name the few books which have really influenced my own life i should have to put this one second only to macaulays essays i read it young when my mind was plastic it stimulated my imagination and set before me a supreme example of dignity and force in the methods of telling a story it is not altogether a healthy influence perhaps it turns the thoughts too forcibly to the morbid and the strange  he was a saturnine creature devoid of humour and geniality with a love for the grotesque and the terrible the reader must himself furnish the counteracting qualities or poe may become a dangerous comrade we know along what perilous tracks and into what deadly quagmires his strange mind led him down to that grey october sunday morning when he was picked up a dying man on the sidewalk at baltimore at an age which should have seen him at the very prime of his strength and his manhood  i have said that i look upon poe as the worlds supreme short story writer his nearest rival i should say was maupassant the great norman never rose to the extreme force and originality of the american but he had a natural inherited power an inborn instinct towards the right way of making his effects which mark him as a great master he produced stories because it was in him to do so as naturally and as perfectly as an apple tree produces apples what a fine sensitive artistic touch it is how easily and delicately the points are made how clear and nervous is his style and how free from that redundancy which disfigures so much of our english work he pares it down to the quick all the time  i cannot write the name of maupassant without recalling what was either a spiritual interposition or an extraordinary coincidence in my own life i had been travelling in switzerland and had visited among other places that gemmi pass where a huge cliff separates a french from a german canton on the summit of this cliff was a small inn where we broke our journey it was explained to us that although the inn was inhabited all the year round still for about three months in winter it was utterly isolated because it could at any time only be approached by winding paths on the mountain side and when these became obliterated by snow it was impossible either to come up or to descend they could see the lights in the valley beneath them but were as lonely as if they lived in the moon so curious a situation naturally appealed to ones imagination and i speedily began to build up a short story in my own mind depending upon a group of strong antagonistic characters being penned up in this inn loathing each other and yet utterly unable to get away from each others society every day bringing them nearer to tragedy for a week or so as i travelled i was turning over the idea  at the end of that time i returned through france having nothing to read i happened to buy a volume of maupassants tales which i had never seen before the first story was called lauberge the innand as i ran my eye down the printed page i was amazed to see the two words kandersteg and gemmi pass i settled down and read it with evergrowing amazement the scene was laid in the inn i had visited the plot depended on the isolation of a group of people through the snowfall everything that i imagined was there save that maupassant had brought in a savage hound  of course the genesis of the thing is clear enough he had chanced to visit the inn and had been impressed as i had been by the same train of thought all that is quite intelligible but what is perfectly marvellous is that in that short journey i should have chanced to buy the one book in all the world which would prevent me from making a public fool of myself for who would ever have believed that my work was not an imitation i do not think that the hypothesis of coincidence can cover the facts it is one of several incidents in my life which have convinced me of spiritual interpositionof the promptings of some beneficent force outside ourselves which tries to help us where it can the old catholic doctrine of the guardian angel is not only a beautiful one but has in it i believe a real basis of truth  or is it that our subliminal ego to use the jargon of the new psychology or our astral in the terms of the new theology can learn and convey to the mind that which our own known senses are unable to apprehend but that is too long a side track for us to turn down it  when maupassant chose he could run poe close in that domain of the strange and weird which the american had made so entirely his own have you read maupassants story called le horla that is as good a bit of diablerie as you could wish for and the frenchman has of course far the broader range he has a keen sense of humour breaking out beyond all decorum in some of his stories but giving a pleasant subflavour to all of them and yet when all is said who can doubt that the austere and dreadful american is far the greater and more original mind of the two  talking of weird american stories have you ever read any of the works of ambrose bierce i have one of his works there in the midst of life this man had a flavour quite his own and was a great artist in his way it is not cheering reading but it leaves its mark upon you and that is the proof of good work  i have often wondered where poe got his style there is a sombre majesty about his best work as if it were carved from polished jet which is peculiarly his own i dare say if i took down that volume i could light anywhere upon a paragraph which would show you what i mean this is the kind of thing    now there are fine tales in the volumes of the magiin the   ironbound melancholy volumes of the magi therein i say   are glorious histories of the heaven and of the earth and   of the mighty seaand of the genius that overruled the sea   and the earth and the lofty heaven there were much lore   too in the sayings which were said by the sybils and holy   holy things were heard of old by the dim leaves which trembled   round dodona but as allah liveth that fable which the demon   told me as he sat by my side in the shadow of the tomb i   hold to be the most wonderful of all or this sentence   and then did we the seven start from our seats in horror   and stand trembling and aghast for the tones in the voice   of the shadow were not the tones of any one being but of   a multitude of beings and varying in their cadences from   syllable to syllable fell duskily upon our ears in the   wellremembered and familiar accents of many thousand departed   friends  is there not a sense of austere dignity no man invents a style it always derives back from some influence or as is more usual it is a compromise between several influences i cannot trace poes and yet if hazlitt and de quincey had set forth to tell weird stories they might have developed something of the kind  now by your leave we will pass on to my noble edition of the cloister and the hearth the next volume on the left  i notice in glancing over my rambling remarks that i classed ivanhoe as the second historical novel of the century i dare say there are many who would give esmond the first place and i can quite understand their position although it is not my own i recognize the beauty of the style the consistency of the characterdrawing the absolutely perfect queen anne atmosphere there was never an historical novel written by a man who knew his period so thoroughly but great as these virtues are they are not the essential in a novel the essential in a novel is interest though addison unkindly remarked that the real essential was that the pastrycooks should never run short of paper now esmond is in my opinion exceedingly interesting during the campaigns in the lowlands and when our machiavelian hero the duke comes in and also whenever lord mohun shows his illomened face but there are long stretches of the story which are heavy reading a preeminently good novel must always advance and never mark time ivanhoe never halts for an instant and that just makes its superiority as a novel over esmond though as a piece of literature i think the latter is the more perfect  no if i had three votes i should plump them all for the cloister and the hearth as being our greatest historical novel and indeed as being our greatest novel of any sort i think i may claim to have read most of the more famous foreign novels of last century and speaking only for myself and within the limits of my reading i have been more impressed by that book of reades and by tolstois peace and war than by any others they seem to me to stand at the very top of the centurys fiction there is a certain resemblance in the twothe sense of space the number of figures the way in which characters drop in and drop out the englishman is the more romantic the russian is the more real and earnest but they are both great  think of what reade does in that one book he takes the reader by the hand and he leads him away into the middle ages and not a conventional studybuilt middle age but a period quivering with life full of folk who are as human and real as a busload in oxford street he takes him through holland he shows him the painters the dykes the life he leads him down the long line of the rhine the spinal marrow of mediaeval europe he shows him the dawn of printing the beginnings of freedom the life of the great mercantile cities of south germany the state of italy the artistlife of rome the monastic institutions on the eve of the reformation and all this between the covers of one book so naturally introduced too and told with such vividness and spirit apart from the huge scope of it the mere study of gerards own nature his rise his fall his regeneration the whole pitiable tragedy at the end make the book a great one it contains i think a blending of knowledge with imagination which makes it stand alone in our literature let any one read the autobiography of benvenuto cellini and then charles reades picture of mediaeval roman life if he wishes to appreciate the way in which reade has collected his rough ore and has then smelted it all down in his fiery imagination it is a good thing to have the industry to collect facts it is a greater and a rarer one to have the tact to know how to use them when you have got them to be exact without pedantry and thorough without being dull that should be the ideal of the writer of historical romance  reade is one of the most perplexing figures in our literature never was there a man so hard to place at his best he is the best we have at his worst he is below the level of surreyside melodrama but his best have weak pieces and his worst have good there is always silk among his cotton and cotton among his silk but for all his flaws the man who in addition to the great book of which i have already spoken wrote it is never too late to mend hard cash foul play and griffith gaunt must always stand in the very first rank of our novelists  there is a quality of heart about his work which i recognize nowhere else he so absolutely loves his own heroes and heroines while he so cordially detests his own villains that he sweeps your emotions along with his own no one has ever spoken warmly enough of the humanity and the lovability of his women it is a rare giftvery rare for a manthis power of drawing a human and delightful girl if there is a better one in nineteenthcentury fiction than julia dodd i have never had the pleasure of meeting her a man who could draw a character so delicate and so delightful and yet could write such an episode as that of the robber inn in the cloister and the hearth adventurous romance in its highest form has such a range of power as is granted to few men my hat is always ready to come off to charles reade    vii   it is good to have the magic door shut behind us on the other side of that door are the world and its troubles hopes and fears headaches and heartaches ambitions and disappointments but within as you lie back on the green settee and face the long lines of your silent soothing comrades there is only peace of spirit and rest of mind in the company of the great dead learn to love learn to admire them learn to know what their comradeship means for until you have done so the greatest solace and anodyne god has given to man have not yet shed their blessing upon you here behind this magic door is the rest house where you may forget the past enjoy the present and prepare for the future  you who have sat with me before upon the green settee are familiar with the upper shelf with the tattered macaulay the dapper gibbon the drab boswell the olivegreen scott the pied borrow and all the goodly company who rub shoulders yonder by the way how one wishes that ones dear friends would only be friends also with each other why should borrow snarl so churlishly at scott one would have thought that noble spirit and romantic fancy would have charmed the huge vagrant and yet there is no word too bitter for the younger man to use towards the elder the fact is that borrow had one dangerous virus in hima poison which distorts the whole visionfor he was a bigoted sectarian in religion seeing no virtue outside his own interpretation of the great riddle downright heathendom the bloodstained berserk or the chaunting druid appealed to his mind through his imagination but the man of his own creed and time who differed from him in minutiae of ritual or in the interpretation of mystic passages was at once evil to the bone and he had no charity of any sort for such a person scott therefore with his reverent regard for old usages became at once hateful in his eyes in any case he was a disappointed man the big borrow and i cannot remember that he ever had much to say that was good of any brother author only in the bards of wales and in the scalds of the sagas did he seem to find his kindred spirits though it has been suggested that his complex nature took this means of informing the world that he could read both cymric and norse but we must not be unkind behind the magic doorand yet to be charitable to the uncharitable is surely the crown of virtue  so much for the top line concerning which i have already gossipped for six sittings but there is no surcease for you reader for as you see there is a second line and yet a third all equally dear to my heart and all appealing in the same degree to my emotions and to my memory be as patient as you may while i talk of these old friends and tell you why i love them and all that they have meant to me in the past if you picked any book from that line you would be picking a little fibre also from my mind very small no doubt and yet an intimate and essential part of what is now myself hereditary impulses personal experiences booksthose are the three forces which go to the making of man these are the books  this second line consists as you see of novelists of the eighteenth century or those of them whom i regard as essential after all putting aside single books such as sternes tristram shandy goldsmiths vicar of wakefield and miss burneys evelina there are only three authors who count and they in turn wrote only three books each of firstrate importance so that by the mastery of nine books one might claim to have a fairly broad view of this most important and distinctive branch of english literature the three men are of course fielding richardson and smollett the books are richardsons clarissa harlowe pamela and sir charles grandison fieldings tom jones joseph andrews and amelia smolletts peregrine pickle humphrey clinker and roderick random there we have the real work of the three great contemporaries who illuminated the middle of the eighteenth centuryonly nine volumes in all let us walk round these nine volumes therefore and see whether we cannot discriminate and throw a little light after this interval of a hundred and fifty years upon their comparative aims and how far they have justified them by the permanent value of their work a fat little bookseller in the city a rakehell wit of noble blood and a rugged scotch surgeon from the navythose are the three strange immortals who now challenge a comparisonthe three men who dominate the fiction of their century and to whom we owe it that the life and the types of that century are familiar to us their fifth generation  it is not a subject to be dogmatic upon for i can imagine that these three writers would appeal quite differently to every temperament and that whichever one might desire to champion one could find arguments to sustain ones choice yet i cannot think that any large section of the critical public could maintain that smollett was on the same level as the other two ethically he is gross though his grossness is accompanied by a fullblooded humour which is more mirthcompelling than the more polished wit of his rivals i can remember in callow boyhoodpuris omnia purareading peregrine pickle and laughing until i cried over the banquet in the fashion of the ancients i read it again in my manhood with the same effect though with a greater appreciation of its inherent bestiality that merit a gross primitive merit he has in a high degree but in no other respect can he challenge comparison with either fielding or richardson his view of life is far more limited his characters less varied his incidents less distinctive and his thoughts less deep assuredly i for one should award him the third place in the trio  but how about richardson and fielding there is indeed a competition of giants let us take the points of each in turn and then compare them with each other  there is one characteristic the rarest and subtlest of all which each of them had in a supreme degree each could draw the most delightful womenthe most perfect women i think in the whole range of our literature if the eighteenthcentury women were like that then the eighteenthcentury men got a great deal more than they ever deserved they had such a charming little dignity of their own such good sense and yet such dear pretty dainty ways so human and so charming that even now they become our ideals one cannot come to know them without a double emotion one of respectful devotion towards themselves and the other of abhorrence for the herd of swine who surrounded them pamela harriet byron clarissa amelia and sophia western were all equally delightful and it was not the negative charm of the innocent and colourless woman the amiable doll of the nineteenth century but it was a beauty of nature depending upon an alert mind clear and strong principles true womanly feelings and complete feminine charm in this respect our rival authors may claim a tie for i could not give a preference to one set of these perfect creatures over another the plump little printer and the wornout manabouttown had each a supreme woman in his mind  but their men alas what a drop is there to say that we are all capable of doing what tom jones didas i have seen statedis the worst form of inverted cant the cant which makes us out worse than we are it is a libel on mankind to say that a man who truly loves a woman is usually false to her and above all a libel that he should be false in the vile fashion which aroused good tom newcomes indignation tom jones was no more fit to touch the hem of sophias dress than captain booth was to be the mate of amelia never once has fielding drawn a gentleman save perhaps squire alworthy a lusty brawling goodhearted material creature was the best that he could fashion where in his heroes is there one touch of distinction of spirituality of nobility here i think that the plebeian printer has done very much better than the aristocrat sir charles grandison is a very noble typespoiled a little by overcoddling on the part of his creator perhaps but a very highsouled and exquisite gentleman all the same had he married sophia or amelia i should not have forbidden the banns even the persevering mr b and the too amorous lovelace were in spite of their aberrations men of gentle nature and had possibilities of greatness and tenderness within them yes i cannot doubt that richardson drew the higher type of manand that in grandison he has done what has seldom or never been bettered  richardson was also the subtler and deeper writer in my opinion he concerns himself with fine consistent characterdrawing and with a very searching analysis of the human heart which is done so easily and in such simple english that the depth and truth of it only come upon reflection he condescends to none of those scuffles and buffetings and pantomime rallies which enliven but cheapen many of fieldings pages the latter has it may be granted a broader view of life he had personal acquaintance of circles far above and also far below any which the douce citizen who was his rival had ever been able or willing to explore his pictures of low london life the prison scenes in amelia the thieves kitchens in jonathan wild the sponging houses and the slums are as vivid and as complete as those of his friend hogarththe most british of artists even as fielding was the most british of writers but the greatest and most permanent facts of life are to be found in the smallest circles two men and a woman may furnish either the tragedian or the comedian with the most satisfying theme and so although his range was limited richardson knew very clearly and very thoroughly just that knowledge which was essential for his purpose pamela the perfect woman of humble life clarissa the perfect lady grandison the ideal gentlemanthese were the three figures on which he lavished his most loving art and now after one hundred and fifty years i do not know where we may find more satisfying types  he was prolix it may be admitted but who could bear to have him cut he loved to sit down and tell you just all about it his use of letters for his narratives made this gossipy style more easy first he writes and he tells all that passed you have his letter she at the same time writes to her friend and also states her views this also you see the friends in each case reply and you have the advantage of their comments and advice you really do know all about it before you finish it may be a little wearisome at first if you have been accustomed to a more hustling style with fireworks in every chapter but gradually it creates an atmosphere in which you live and you come to know these people with their characters and their troubles as you know no others of the dreamfolk of fiction three times as long as an ordinary book no doubt but why grudge the time what is the hurry surely it is better to read one masterpiece than three books which will leave no permanent impression on the mind  it was all attuned to the sedate life of that the last of the quiet centuries in the lonely countryhouse with few letters and fewer papers do you suppose that the readers ever complained of the length of a book or could have too much of the happy pamela or of the unhappy clarissa it is only under extraordinary circumstances that one can now get into that receptive frame of mind which was normal then such an occasion is recorded by macaulay when he tells how in some indian hill station where books were rare he let loose a copy of clarissa the effect was what might have been expected richardson in a suitable environment went through the community like a mild fever they lived him and dreamed him until the whole episode passed into literary history never to be forgotten by those who experienced it it is tuned for every ear that beautiful style is so correct and yet so simple that there is no page which a scholar may not applaud nor a servantmaid understand  of course there are obvious disadvantages to the tale which is told in letters scott reverted to it in guy mannering and there are other conspicuous successes but vividness is always gained at the expense of a strain upon the readers goodnature and credulity one feels that these constant details these long conversations could not possibly have been recorded in such a fashion the indignant and dishevelled heroine could not sit down and record her escape with such cool minuteness of description richardson does it as well as it could be done but it remains intrinsically faulty fielding using the third person broke all the fetters which bound his rival and gave a freedom and personal authority to the novel which it had never before enjoyed there at least he is the master  and yet on the whole my balance inclines towards richardson though i dare say i am one in a hundred in thinking so first of all beyond anything i may have already urged he had the supreme credit of having been the first surely the originator should have a higher place than the imitator even if in imitating he should also improve and amplify it is richardson and not fielding who is the father of the english novel the man who first saw that without romantic gallantry and without bizarre imaginings enthralling stories may be made from everyday life told in everyday language this was his great new departure so entirely was fielding his imitator or rather perhaps his parodist that with supreme audacity some would say brazen impudence he used poor richardsons own characters taken from pamela in his own first novel joseph andrews and used them too for the unkind purpose of ridiculing them as a matter of literary ethics it is as if thackeray wrote a novel bringing in pickwick and sam weller in order to show what faulty characters these were it is no wonder that even the gentle little printer grew wroth and alluded to his rival as a somewhat unscrupulous man  and then there is the vexed question of morals surely in talking of this also there is a good deal of inverted cant among a certain class of critics the inference appears to be that there is some subtle connection between immorality and art as if the handling of the lewd or the depicting of it were in some sort the hallmark of the true artist it is not difficult to handle or depict on the contrary it is so easy and so essentially dramatic in many of its forms that the temptation to employ it is ever present it is the easiest and cheapest of all methods of creating a spurious effect the difficulty does not lie in doing it the difficulty lies in avoiding it but one tries to avoid it because on the face of it there is no reason why a writer should cease to be a gentleman or that he should write for a womans eyes that which he would be justly knocked down for having said in a womans ears but you must draw the world as it is why must you surely it is just in selection and restraint that the artist is shown it is true that in a coarser age great writers heeded no restrictions but life itself had fewer restrictions then we are of our own age and must live up to it  but must these sides of life be absolutely excluded by no means our decency need not weaken into prudery it all lies in the spirit in which it is done no one who wished to lecture on these various spirits could preach on a better text than these three great rivals richardson fielding and smollett it is possible to draw vice with some freedom for the purpose of condemning it such a writer is a moralist and there is no better example than richardson again it is possible to draw vice with neither sympathy nor disapprobation but simply as a fact which is there such a writer is a realist and such was fielding once more it is possible to draw vice in order to extract amusement from it such a man is a coarse humorist and such was smollett lastly it is possible to draw vice in order to show sympathy with it such a man is a wicked man and there were many among the writers of the restoration but of all reasons that exist for treating this side of life richardsons were the best and nowhere do we find it more deftly done  apart from his writings there must have been something very noble about fielding as a man he was a better hero than any that he drew alone he accepted the task of cleansing london at that time the most dangerous and lawless of european capitals hogarths pictures give some notion of it in the prefielding days the low roughs the highborn bullies the drunkenness the villainies the thieves kitchens with their riverside trapdoors down which the body is thrust this was the augean stable which had to be cleaned and poor hercules was weak and frail and physically more fitted for a sickroom than for such a task it cost him his life for he died at 47 worn out with his own exertions it might well have cost him his life in more dramatic fashion for he had become a marked man to the criminal classes and he headed his own searchparties when on the information of some bribed rascal a new den of villainy was exposed but he carried his point in little more than a year the thing was done and london turned from the most rowdy to what it has ever since remained the most lawabiding of european capitals has any man ever left a finer monument behind him  if you want the real human fielding you will find him not in the novels where his real kindliness is too often veiled by a mock cynicism but in his diary of his voyage to lisbon he knew that his health was irretrievably ruined and that his years were numbered those are the days when one sees a man as he is when he has no longer a motive for affectation or pretence in the immediate presence of the most tremendous of all realities yet sitting in the shadow of death fielding displayed a quiet gentle courage and constancy of mind which show how splendid a nature had been shrouded by his earlier frailties  just one word upon another eighteenthcentury novel before i finish this somewhat didactic chat you will admit that i have never prosed so much before but the period and the subject seem to encourage it i skip sterne for i have no great sympathy with his finicky methods and i skip miss burneys novels as being feminine reflections of the great masters who had just preceded her but goldsmiths vicar of wakefield surely deserves one paragraph to itself there is a book which is tinged throughout as was all goldsmiths work with a beautiful nature no one who had not a fine heart could have written it just as no one without a fine heart could have written the deserted village how strange it is to think of old johnson patronizing or snubbing the shrinking irishman when both in poetry in fiction and in the drama the latter has proved himself far the greater man but here is an objectlesson of how the facts of life may be treated without offence nothing is shirked it is all faced and duly recorded yet if i wished to set before the sensitive mind of a young girl a book which would prepare her for life without in any way contaminating her delicacy of feeling there is no book which i should choose so readily as the vicar of wakefield  so much for the eighteenthcentury novelists they have a shelf of their own in the case and a corner of their own in my brain for years you may never think of them and then suddenly some stray word or train of thought leads straight to them and you look at them and love them and rejoice that you know them but let us pass to something which may interest you more  if statistics could be taken in the various free libraries of the kingdom to prove the comparative popularity of different novelists with the public i think that it is quite certain that mr george meredith would come out very low indeed if on the other hand a number of authors were convened to determine which of their fellowcraftsmen they considered the greatest and the most stimulating to their own minds i am equally confident that mr meredith would have a vast preponderance of votes indeed his only conceivable rival would be mr hardy it becomes an interesting study therefore why there should be such a divergence of opinion as to his merits and what the qualities are which have repelled so many readers and yet have attracted those whose opinion must be allowed to have a special weight  the most obvious reason is his complete unconventionality the public read to be amused the novelist reads to have new light thrown upon his art to read meredith is not a mere amusement it is an intellectual exercise a kind of mental dumbbell with which you develop your thinking powers your mind is in a state of tension the whole time that you are reading him  if you will follow my nose as the sportsman follows that of his pointer you will observe that these remarks are excited by the presence of my beloved richard feverel which lurks in yonder corner what a great book it is how wise and how witty others of the masters novels may be more characteristic or more profound but for my own part it is the one which i would always present to the newcomer who had not yet come under the influence i think that i should put it third after vanity fair and the cloister and the hearth if i had to name the three novels which i admire most in the victorian era the book was published i believe in 1859 and it is almost incredible and says little for the discrimination of critics or public that it was nearly twenty years before a second edition was needed  but there are never effects without causes however inadequate the cause may be what was it that stood in the way of the books success undoubtedly it was the style and yet it is subdued and tempered here with little of the luxuriance and exuberance which it attained in the later works but it was an innovation and it stalled off both the public and the critics they regarded it no doubt as an affectation as carlyles had been considered twenty years before forgetting that in the case of an original genius style is an organic thing part of the man as much as the colour of his eyes it is not to quote carlyle a shirt to be taken on and off at pleasure but a skin eternally fixed and this strange powerful style how is it to be described best perhaps in his own strong words when he spoke of carlyle with perhaps the arriere pensee that the words would apply as strongly to himself  his favourite author says he was one writing on heroes in a style resembling either early architecture or utter dilapidation so loose and rough it seemed a windintheorchard style that tumbled down here and there an appreciable fruit with uncouth bluster sentences without commencements running to abrupt endings and smoke like waves against a seawall learned dictionary words giving a hand to street slang and accents falling on them haphazard like slant rays from driving clouds all the pages in a breeze the whole book producing a kind of electrical agitation in the mind and joints  what a wonderful description and example of style and how vivid is the impression left by such expressions as all the pages in a breeze as a comment on carlyle and as a sample of meredith the passage is equally perfect  well richard feverel has come into its own at last i confess to having a strong belief in the critical discernment of the public i do not think good work is often overlooked literature like water finds its true level opinion is slow to form but it sets true at last i am sure that if the critics were to unite to praise a bad book or to damn a good one they could and continually do have a fiveyear influence but it would in no wise affect the final result sheridan said that if all the fleas in his bed had been unanimous they could have pushed him out of it i do not think that any unanimity of critics has ever pushed a good book out of literature  among the minor excellences of richard feverelexcuse the prolixity of an enthusiastare the scattered aphorisms which are worthy of a place among our british proverbs what could be more exquisite than this who rises from prayer a better man his prayer is answered or this expediency is mans wisdom doing right is gods or all great thoughts come from the heart good are the words the coward amongst us is he who sneers at the failings of humanity and a healthy optimism rings in the phrase there is for the mind but one grasp of happiness from that uppermost pinnacle of wisdom whence we see that this world is well designed in more playful mood is woman is the last thing which will be civilized by man let us hurry away abruptly for he who starts quotation from richard feverel is lost  he has as you see a goodly line of his brothers beside him there are the italian ones sandra belloni and vittoria there is rhoda fleming which carried stevenson off his critical feet beauchamps career too dealing with obsolete politics no great writer should spend himself upon a temporary theme it is like the beauty who is painted in some passing fashion of gown she tends to become obsolete along with her frame here also is the dainty diana the egoist with immortal willoughby pattern eternal type of masculine selfishness and harry richmond the first chapters of which are in my opinion among the finest pieces of narrative prose in the language that great mind would have worked in any form which his age had favoured he is a novelist by accident as an elizabethan he would have been a great dramatist under queen anne a great essayist but whatever medium he worked in he must equally have thrown the image of a great brain and a great soul    viii   we have left our eighteenthcentury novelistsfielding richardson and smollettsafely behind us with all their solidity and their audacity their sincerity and their coarseness of fibre they have brought us as you perceive to the end of the shelf what not wearied ready for yet another let us run down this next row then and i will tell you a few things which may be of interest though they will be dull enough if you have not been born with that love of books in your heart which is among the choicest gifts of the gods if that is wanting then one might as well play music to the deaf or walk round the academy with the colourblind as appeal to the booksense of an unfortunate who has it not  there is this old brown volume in the corner how it got there i cannot imagine for it is one of those which i bought for threepence out of the remnant box in edinburgh and its weatherbeaten comrades are up yonder in the back gallery while this one has elbowed its way among the quality in the stalls but it is worth a word or two take it out and handle it see how swarthy it is how squat with how bulletproof a cover of scaling leather now open the flyleaf ex libris guilielmi whyte 1672 in faded yellow ink i wonder who william whyte may have been and what he did upon earth in the reign of the merry monarch a pragmatical seventeenthcentury lawyer i should judge by that hard angular writing the date of issue is 1642 so it was printed just about the time when the pilgrim fathers were settling down into their new american home and the first charless head was still firm upon his shoulders though a little puzzled no doubt at what was going on around it the book is in latinthough cicero might not have admitted itand it treats of the laws of warfare  i picture some pedantic dugald dalgetty bearing it about under his buff coat or down in his holster and turning up the reference for every fresh emergency which occurred hullo heres a well says he i wonder if i may poison it out comes the book and he runs a dirty forefinger down the index ob fas est aquam hostis venere etc tut tut its not allowed but here are some of the enemy in a barn what about that ob fas est hostem incendio etc yes he says we may quick ambrose up with the straw and the tinder box warfare was no childs play about the time when tilly sacked magdeburg and cromwell turned his hand from the mash tub to the sword it might not be much better now in a long campaign when men were hardened and embittered many of these laws are unrepealed and it is less than a century since highly disciplined british troops claimed their dreadful rights at badajos and rodrigo recent european wars have been so short that discipline and humanity have not had time to go to pieces but a long war would show that man is ever the same and that civilization is the thinnest of veneers  now you see that whole row of books which takes you at one sweep nearly across the shelf i am rather proud of those for they are my collection of napoleonic military memoirs there is a story told of an illiterate millionaire who gave a wholesale dealer an order for a copy of all books in any language treating of any aspect of napoleons career he thought it would fill a case in his library he was somewhat taken aback however when in a few weeks he received a message from the dealer that he had got 40000 volumes and awaited instructions as to whether he should send them on as an instalment or wait for a complete set the figures may not be exact but at least they bring home the impossibility of exhausting the subject and the danger of losing ones self for years in a huge labyrinth of reading which may end by leaving no very definite impression upon your mind but one might perhaps take a corner of it as i have done here in the military memoirs and there one might hope to get some finality  here is marbot at this endthe first of all soldier books in the world this is the complete threevolume french edition with red and gold cover smart and debonnaire like its author here he is in one frontispiece with his pleasant round boyish face as a captain of his beloved chasseurs and here in the other is the grizzled old bulldog as a full general looking as full of fight as ever it was a real blow to me when some one began to throw doubts upon the authenticity of marbots memoirs homer may be dissolved into a crowd of skinclad bards even shakespeare may be jostled in his throne of honour by plausible baconians but the human the gallant the inimitable marbot his book is that which gives us the best picture by far of the napoleonic soldiers and to me they are even more interesting than their great leader though his must ever be the most singular figure in history but those soldiers with their huge shakoes their hairy knapsacks and their hearts of steelwhat men they were and what a latent power there must be in this french nation which could go on pouring out the blood of its sons for twentythree years with hardly a pause  it took all that time to work off the hot ferment which the revolution had left in mens veins and they were not exhausted for the very last fight which the french fought was the finest of all proud as we are of our infantry at waterloo it was really with the french cavalry that the greenest laurels of that great epic rested they got the better of our own cavalry they took our guns again and again they swept a large portion of our allies from the field and finally they rode off unbroken and as full of fight as ever read gronows memoirs that chatty little yellow volume yonder which brings all that age back to us more vividly than any more pretentious work and you will find the chivalrous admiration which our officers expressed at the fine performance of the french horsemen  it must be admitted that looking back upon history we have not always been good allies nor yet generous copartners in the battlefield the first is the fault of our politics where one party rejoices to break what the other has bound the makers of the treaty are staunch enough as the tories were under pitt and castlereagh or the whigs at the time of queen anne but sooner or later the others must come in at the end of the marlborough wars we suddenly vamped up a peace and left our allies in the lurch on account of a change in domestic politics we did the same with frederick the great and would have done it in the napoleonic days if fox could have controlled the country and as to our partners of the battlefield how little we have ever said that is hearty as to the splendid staunchness of the prussians at waterloo you have to read the frenchman houssaye to get a central view and to understand the part they played think of old blucher seventy years old and ridden over by a regiment of charging cavalry the day before yet swearing that he would come to wellington if he had to be strapped to his horse he nobly redeemed his promise  the loss of the prussians at waterloo was not far short of our own you would not know it to read our historians and then the abuse of our belgian allies has been overdone some of them fought splendidly and one brigade of infantry had a share in the critical instant when the battle was turned this also you would not learn from british sources look at our portuguese allies also they trained into magnificent troops and one of wellingtons earnest desires was to have ten thousand of them for his waterloo campaign it was a portuguese who first topped the rampart of badajos they have never had their due credit nor have the spaniards either for though often defeated it was their unconquerable pertinacity which played a great part in the struggle no i do not think that we are very amiable partners but i suppose that all national history may be open to a similar charge  it must be confessed that marbots details are occasionally a little hard to believe never in the pages of lever has there been such a series of hairbreadth escapes and daredevil exploits surely he stretched it a little sometimes you may remember his adventure at eylaui think it was eylauhow a cannonball striking the top of his helmet paralyzed him by the concussion of his spine and how on a russian officer running forward to cut him down his horse bit the mans face nearly off this was the famous charger which savaged everything until marbot having bought it for next to nothing cured it by thrusting a boiling leg of mutton into its mouth when it tried to bite him it certainly does need a robust faith to get over these incidents and yet when one reflects upon the hundreds of battles and skirmishes which a napoleonic officer must have enduredhow they must have been the uninterrupted routine of his life from the first dark hair upon his lip to the first grey one upon his head it is presumptuous to say what may or may not have been possible in such unparalleled careers at any rate be it fact or fictionfact it is in my opinion with some artistic touching up of the high lightsthere are few books which i could not spare from my shelves better than the memoirs of the gallant marbot  i dwell upon this particular book because it is the best but take the whole line and there is not one which is not full of interest marbot gives you the point of view of the officer so does de segur and de fezensac and colonel gonville each in some different branch of the service but some are from the pens of the men in the ranks and they are even more graphic than the others here for example are the papers of good old cogniet who was a grenadier of the guard and could neither read nor write until after the great wars were over a tougher soldier never went into battle here is sergeant bourgogne also with his dreadful account of that nightmare campaign in russia and the gallant chevillet trumpeter of chasseurs with his matteroffact account of all that he saw where the daily combat is sandwiched in betwixt the real business of the day which was foraging for his frugal breakfast and supper there is no better writing and no easier reading than the records of these men of action  a briton cannot help asking himself as he realizes what men these were what would have happened if 150000 cogniets and bourgognes with marbots to lead them and the great captain of all time in the prime of his vigour at their head had made their landing in kent for months it was touchandgo a single naval slip which left the channel clear would have been followed by an embarkation from boulogne which had been brought by constant practice to so incredibly fine a point that the last horse was aboard within two hours of the start any evening might have seen the whole host upon the pevensey flats what then we know what humbert did with a handful of men in ireland and the story is not reassuring conquest of course is unthinkable the world in arms could not do that but napoleon never thought of the conquest of britain he has expressly disclaimed it what he did contemplate was a gigantic raid in which he would do so much damage that for years to come england would be occupied at home in picking up the pieces instead of having energy to spend abroad in thwarting his continental plans  portsmouth plymouth and sheerness in flames with london either levelled to the ground or ransomed at his own figurethat was a more feasible programme then with the united fleets of conquered europe at his back enormous armies and an inexhaustible treasury swollen with the ransom of britain he could turn to that conquest of america which would win back the old colonies of france and leave him master of the world if the worst happened and he had met his waterloo upon the south downs he would have done again what he did in egypt and once more in russia hurried back to france in a swift vessel and still had force enough to hold his own upon the continent it would no doubt have been a big stake to lay upon the table150000 of his bestbut he could play again if he lost while if he won he cleared the board a fine gameif little nelson had not stopped it and with one blow fixed the edge of salt water as the limit of napoleons power  theres the cast of a medal on the top of that cabinet which will bring it all close home to you it is taken from the die of the medal which napoleon had arranged to issue on the day that he reached london it serves at any rate to show that his great muster was not a bluff but that he really did mean serious business on one side is his head on the other france is engaged in strangling and throwing to earth a curious fishtailed creature which stands for perfidious albion frappe a londres is printed on one part of it and la descente dans angleterre upon another struck to commemorate a conquest it remains now as a souvenir of a fiasco but it was a close call  by the way talking of napoleons flight from egypt did you ever see a curious little book called if i remember right intercepted letters no i have no copy upon this shelf but a friend is more fortunate it shows the almost incredible hatred which existed at the end of the eighteenth century between the two nations descending even to the most petty personal annoyance on this occasion the british government intercepted a mailbag of letters coming from french officers in egypt to their friends at home and they either published them or at least allowed them to be published in the hope no doubt of causing domestic complications was ever a more despicable action but who knows what other injuries had been inflicted to draw forth such a retaliation i have myself seen a burned and mutilated british mail lying where de wet had left it but suppose the refinement of his vengeance had gone so far as to publish it what a thunderbolt it might have been  as to the french officers i have read their letters though even after a century one had a feeling of guilt when one did so but on the whole they are a credit to the writers and give the impression of a noble and chivalrous set of men whether they were all addressed to the right people is another matter and therein lay the poisoned sting of this most unbritish affair as to the monstrous things which were done upon the other side remember the arrest of all the poor british tourists and commercials who chanced to be in france when the war was renewed in 1803 they had run over in all trust and confidence for a little outing and change of air they certainly got it for napoleons steel grip fell upon them and they rejoined their families in 1814 he must have had a heart of adamant and a will of iron look at his conduct over the naval prisoners the natural proceeding would have been to exchange them for some reason he did not think it good policy to do so all representations from the british government were set aside save in the case of the higher officers hence the miseries of the hulks and the dreadful prison barracks in england hence also the unhappy idlers of verdun what splendid loyalty there must have been in those humble frenchmen which never allowed them for one instant to turn bitterly upon the author of all their great misfortunes it is all brought vividly home by the description of their prisons given by borrow in lavengro this is the passage    what a strange appearance had those mighty casernes with   their blank blind walls without windows or grating and   their slanting roofs out of which through orifices where   the tiles had been removed would be protruded dozens of   grim heads feasting their prisonsick eyes on the wide   expanse of country unfolded from their airy height ah   there was much misery in those casernes and from those   roofs doubtless many a wistful look was turned in the   direction of lovely france much had the poor inmates to   endure and much to complain of to the disgrace of england   be it saidof england in general so kind and bountiful   rations of carrion meat and bread from which i have seen   the very hounds occasionally turn away were unworthy   entertainment even for the most ruffian enemy when helpless   and captive and such alas was the fare in those casernes   and then those visits or rather ruthless inroads called   in the slang of the place strawplait hunts when in   pursuit of a contraband article which the prisoners   in order to procure themselves a few of the necessaries   and comforts of existence were in the habit of making   redcoated battalions were marched into the prisons who   with the bayonets point carried havoc and ruin into every   poor convenience which ingenious wretchedness had been   endeavouring to raise around it and then the triumphant   exit with the miserable booty and worst of all the accursed   bonfire on the barrack parade of the plait contraband   beneath the view of glaring eyeballs from those lofty roofs   amid the hurrahs of the troops frequently drowned in the   curses poured down from above like a tempestshower or in   the terrific warwhoop of vive lempereur  there is a little vignette of napoleons men in captivity here is another which is worth preserving of the bearing of his veterans when wounded on the field of battle it is from mercers recollections of the battle of waterloo mercer had spent the day firing case into the french cavalry at ranges from fifty to two hundred yards losing twothirds of his own battery in the process in the evening he had a look at some of his own grim handiwork    i had satisfied my curiosity at hougoumont and was retracing   my steps up the hill when my attention was called to a group   of wounded frenchmen by the calm dignified and soldierlike   oration addressed by one of them to the rest i cannot like   livy compose a fine harangue for my hero and of course i   could not retain the precise words but the import of them was   to exhort them to bear their sufferings with fortitude not   to repine like women or children at what every soldier   should have made up his mind to suffer as the fortune of   war but above all to remember that they were surrounded by   englishmen before whom they ought to be doubly careful not   to disgrace themselves by displaying such an unsoldierlike   want of fortitude    the speaker was sitting on the ground with his lance stuck   upright beside himan old veteran with thick bushy grizzly   beard countenance like a liona lancer of the old guard   and no doubt had fought in many a field one hand was   flourished in the air as he spoke the other severed at the   wrist lay on the earth beside him one ball caseshot   probably had entered his body another had broken his leg   his suffering after a night of exposure so mangled must   have been great yet he betrayed it not his bearing was   that of a roman or perhaps an indian warrior and i could   fancy him concluding appropriately his speech in the words   of the mexican king and i too am i on a bed of roses  what a load of moral responsibility upon one man but his mind was insensible to moral responsibility surely if it had not been it must have been crushed beneath it now if you want to understand the character of napoleonbut surely i must take a fresh start before i launch on so portentous a subject as that  but before i leave the military men let me for the credit of my own country after that infamous incident of the letters indicate these six wellthumbed volumes of napiers history this is the story of the great peninsular war by one who fought through it himself and in no history has a more chivalrous and manly account been given of ones enemy indeed napier seems to me to push it too far for his admiration appears to extend not only to the gallant soldiers who opposed him but to the character and to the ultimate aims of their leader he was in fact a political follower of charles james fox and his heart seems to have been with the enemy even at the moment when he led his men most desperately against them in the verdict of history the action of those men who in their honest zeal for freedom inflamed somewhat by political strife turned against their own country when it was in truth the champion of freedom and approved of a military despot of the most uncompromising kind seems wildly foolish  but if napiers politics may seem strange his soldiering was splendid and his prose among the very best that i know there are passages in that workthe one which describes the breach of badajos that of the charge of the fusiliers at albuera and that of the french advance at fuentes donorowhich once read haunt the mind for ever the book is a worthy monument of a great national epic alas for the pregnant sentence with which it closes so ended the great war and with it all memory of the services of the veterans was there ever a british war of which the same might not have been written  the quotation which i have given from mercers book turns my thoughts in the direction of the british military reminiscences of that period less numerous less varied and less central than the french but full of character and interest all the same i have found that if i am turned loose in a large library after hesitating over covers for half an hour or so it is usually a book of soldier memoirs which i take down man is never so interesting as when he is thoroughly in earnest and no one is so earnest as he whose life is at stake upon the event but of all types of soldier the best is the man who is keen upon his work and yet has general culture which enables him to see that work in its due perspective and to sympathize with the gentler aspirations of mankind such a man is mercer an icecool fighter with a sense of discipline and decorum which prevented him from moving when a bombshell was fizzing between his feet and yet a man of thoughtful and philosophic temperament with a weakness for solitary musings for children and for flowers he has written for all time the classic account of a great battle seen from the point of view of a battery commander many others of wellingtons soldiers wrote their personal reminiscences you can get them as i have them there in the pleasant abridgement of wellingtons men admirably edited by dr fitchettanton the highlander harris the rifleman and kincaid of the same corps it is a most singular fate which has made an australian nonconformist clergyman the most sympathetic and eloquent reconstructor of those old heroes but it is a noble example of that unity of the british race which in fifty scattered lands still mourns or rejoices over the same historic record  and just one word before i close down this overlong and too discursive chatter on the subject of yonder twin red volumes which flank the shelf they are maxwells history of wellington and i do not think you will find a better or more readable one the reader must ever feel towards the great soldier what his own immediate followers felt respect rather than affection ones failure to attain a more affectionate emotion is alleviated by the knowledge that it was the last thing which he invited or desired dont be a damned fool sir was his exhortation to the good citizen who had paid him a compliment it was a curious callous nature brusque and limited the hardest huntsman learns to love his hounds but he showed no affection and a good deal of contempt for the men who had been his instruments they are the scum of the earth said he all english soldiers are fellows who have enlisted for drink that is the plain factthey have all enlisted for drink his general orders were full of undeserved reproaches at a time when the most lavish praise could hardly have met the real deserts of his army when the wars were done he saw little save in his official capacity of his old comradesinarms and yet from majorgeneral to drummerboy he was the man whom they would all have elected to serve under had the work to be done once more as one of them said the sight of his long nose was worth ten thousand men on a field of battle they were themselves a leathery breed and cared little for the gentler amenities so long as the french were well drubbed  his mind which was comprehensive and alert in warfare was singularly limited in civil affairs as a statesman he was so constant an example of devotion to duty selfsacrifice and high disinterested character that the country was the better for his presence but he fiercely opposed catholic emancipation the reform bill and everything upon which our modern life is founded he could never be brought to see that a pyramid should stand on its base and not on its apex and that the larger the pyramid the broader should be the base even in military affairs he was averse from every change and i know of no improvements which came from his initiative during all those years when his authority was supreme the floggings which broke a mans spirit and selfrespect the leathern stock which hampered his movements all the old traditional regime found a champion in him on the other hand he strongly opposed the introduction of the percussion cap as opposed to the flint and steel in the musket neither in war nor in politics did he rightly judge the future  and yet in reading his letters and dispatches one is surprised sometimes at the incisive thought and its vigorous expression there is a passage in which he describes the way in which his soldiers would occasionally desert into some town which he was besieging they knew he writes that they must be taken for when we lay our bloody hands upon a place we are sure to take it sooner or later but they liked being dry and under cover and then that extraordinary caprice which always pervades the english character our deserters are very badly treated by the enemy those who deserted in france were treated as the lowest of mortals slaves and scavengers nothing but english caprice can account for it just what makes our noblemen associate with stagecoach drivers and become stagecoach drivers themselves after reading that passage how often does the phrase the extraordinary caprice which always pervades the english character come back as one observes some fresh manifestation of it  but let not my last note upon the great duke be a carping one rather let my final sentence be one which will remind you of his frugal and abstemious life his carpetless floor and little camp bed his precise courtesy which left no humblest letter unanswered his courage which never flinched his tenacity which never faltered his sense of duty which made his life one long unselfish effort on behalf of what seemed to him to be the highest interest of the state go down and stand by the huge granite sarcophagus in the dim light of the crypt of st pauls and in the hush of that austere spot cast back your mind to the days when little england alone stood firm against the greatest soldier and the greatest army that the world has ever known then you feel what this dead man stood for and you pray that we may still find such another amongst us when the clouds gather once again  you see that the literature of waterloo is well represented in my small military library of all books dealing with the personal view of the matter i think that sibornes letters which is a collection of the narratives of surviving officers made by siborne in the year 1827 is the most interesting gronows account is also very vivid and interesting of the strategical narratives houssayes book is my favourite taken from the french point of view it gets the actions of the allies in truer perspective than any english or german account can do but there is a fascination about that great combat which makes every narrative that bears upon it of enthralling interest  wellington used to say that too much was made of it and that one would imagine that the british army had never fought a battle before it was a characteristic speech but it must be admitted that the british army never had as a matter of fact for many centuries fought a battle which was finally decisive of a great european war there lies the perennial interest of the incident that it was the last act of that longdrawn drama and that to the very fall of the curtain no man could tell how the play would endthe nearest run thing that ever you sawthat was the victors description it is a singular thing that during those twentyfive years of incessant fighting the material and methods of warfare made so little progress so far as i know there was no great change in either between 1789 and 1805 the breechloader heavy artillery the ironclad all great advances in the art of war have been invented in time of peace there are some improvements so obvious and at the same time so valuable that it is extraordinary that they were not adopted signalling for example whether by heliograph or by flagwaving would have made an immense difference in the napoleonic campaigns the principle of the semaphore was well known and belgium with its numerous windmills would seem to be furnished with natural semaphores yet in the four days during which the campaign of waterloo was fought the whole scheme of military operations on both sides was again and again imperilled and finally in the case of the french brought to utter ruin by lack of that intelligence which could so easily have been conveyed june 18th was at intervals a sunshiny daya fourinch glass mirror would have put napoleon in communication with gruchy and the whole history of europe might have been altered wellington himself suffered dreadfully from defective information which might have been easily supplied the unexpected presence of the french army was first discovered at four in the morning of june 15 it was of enormous importance to get the news rapidly to wellington at brussels that he might instantly concentrate his scattered forces on the best line of resistanceyet through the folly of sending only a single messenger this vital information did not reach him until three in the afternoon the distance being thirty miles again when blucher was defeated at ligny on the 16th it was of enormous importance that wellington should know at once the line of his retreat so as to prevent the french from driving a wedge between them the single prussian officer who was despatched with this information was wounded and never reached his destination and it was only next day that wellington learned the prussian plans on what tiny things does history depend    ix   the contemplation of my fine little regiment of french military memoirs had brought me to the question of napoleon himself and you see that i have a very fair line dealing with him also there is scotts life which is not entirely a success his ink was too precious to be shed in such a venture but here are the three volumes of the physician bourriennethat bourrienne who knew him so well does any one ever know a man so well as his doctor they are quite excellent and admirably translated meneval alsothe patient menevalwho wrote for untold hours to dictation at ordinary talking speed and yet was expected to be legible and to make no mistakes at least his master could not fairly criticize his legibility for is it not on record that when napoleons holograph account of an engagement was laid before the president of the senate the worthy man thought that it was a drawn plan of the battle meneval survived his master and has left an excellent and intimate account of him there is constants account also written from that point of view in which it is proverbial that no man is a hero but of all the vivid terrible pictures of napoleon the most haunting is by a man who never saw him and whose book was not directly dealing with him i mean taines account of him in the first volume of les origines de la france contemporaine you can never forget it when once you have read it he produces his effect in a wonderful and to me a novel way he does not for example say in mere crude words that napoleon had a more than mediaeval italian cunning he presents a succession of documentsgives a series of contemporary instances to prove it then having got that fixed in your head by blow after blow he passes on to another phase of his character his coldhearted amorousness his power of work his spoiled child wilfulness or some other quality and piles up his illustrations of that instead for example of saying that the emperor had a marvellous memory for detail we have the account of the head of artillery laying the list of all the guns in france before his master who looked over it and remarked yes but you have omitted two in a fort near dieppe so the man is gradually etched in with indelible ink it is a wonderful figure of which you are conscious in the end the figure of an archangel but surely of an archangel of darkness  we will after taines method take one fact and let it speak for itself napoleon left a legacy in a codicil to his will to a man who tried to assassinate wellington there is the mediaeval italian again he was no more a corsican than the englishman born in india is a hindoo read the lives of the borgias the sforzas the medicis and of all the lustful cruel broadminded artloving talented despots of the little italian states including genoa from which the buonapartes migrated there at once you get the real descent of the man with all the stigmata clear upon himthe outward calm the inward passion the layer of snow above the volcano everything which characterized the old despots of his native land the pupils of machiavelli but all raised to the dimensions of genius you can whitewash him as you may but you will never get a layer thick enough to cover the stain of that coldblooded deliberate endorsement of his noble adversarys assassination  another book which gives an extraordinarily vivid picture of the man is this onethe memoirs of madame de remusat she was in daily contact with him at the court and she studied him with those quick critical eyes of a clever woman the most unerring things in life when they are not blinded by love if you have read those pages you feel that you know him as if you had yourself seen and talked with him his singular mixture of the small and the great his huge sweep of imagination his very limited knowledge his intense egotism his impatience of obstacles his boorishness his gross impertinence to women his diabolical playing upon the weak side of every one with whom he came in contactthey make up among them one of the most striking of historical portraits  most of my books deal with the days of his greatness but here you see is a threevolume account of those weary years at st helena who can help pitying the mewed eagle and yet if you play the great game you must pay a stake this was the same man who had a royal duke shot in a ditch because he was a danger to his throne was not he himself a danger to every throne in europe why so harsh a retreat as st helena you say remember that he had been put in a milder one before that he had broken away from it and that the lives of fifty thousand men had paid for the mistaken leniency all this is forgotten now and the pathetic picture of the modern prometheus chained to his rock and devoured by the vultures of his own bitter thoughts is the one impression which the world has retained it is always so much easier to follow the emotions than the reason especially where a cheap magnanimity and secondhand generosity are involved but reason must still insist that europes treatment of napoleon was not vindictive and that hudson lowe was a man who tried to live up to the trust which had been committed to him by his country  it was certainly not a post from which any one would hope for credit if he were slack and easygoing all would be well but there would be the chance of a second flight with its consequences if he were strict and assiduous he would be assuredly represented as a petty tyrant i am glad when you are on outpost said lowes general in some campaign for then i am sure of a sound rest he was on outpost at st helena and because he was true to his duties europe france included had a sound rest but he purchased it at the price of his own reputation the greatest schemer in the world having nothing else on which to vent his energies turned them all to the task of vilifying his guardian it was natural enough that he who had never known control should not brook it now it is natural also that sentimentalists who have not thought of the details should take the emperors point of view what is deplorable however is that our own people should be misled by onesided accounts and that they should throw to the wolves a man who was serving his country in a post of anxiety and danger with such responsibility upon him as few could ever have endured let them remember montholons remark an angel from heaven would not have satisfied us let them recall also that lowe with ample material never once troubled to state his own case je fais mon devoir et suis indifferent pour le reste said he in his interview with the emperor they were no idle words  apart from this particular epoch french literature which is so rich in all its branches is richest of all in its memoirs whenever there was anything of interest going forward there was always some kindly gossip who knew all about it and was ready to set it down for the benefit of posterity our own history has not nearly enough of these charming sidelights look at our sailors in the napoleonic wars for example they played an epochmaking part for nearly twenty years freedom was a refugee upon the seas had our navy been swept away then all europe would have been one organized despotism at times everybody was against us fighting against their own direct interests under the pressure of that terrible hand we fought on the waters with the french with the spaniards with the danes with the russians with the turks even with our american kinsmen middies grew into postcaptains and admirals into dotards during that prolonged struggle and what have we in literature to show for it all marryats novels many of which are founded upon personal experience nelsons and collingwoods letters lord cochranes biographythat is about all i wish we had more of collingwood for he wielded a fine pen do you remember the sonorous opening of his trafalgar message to his captains    the ever to be lamented death of lord viscount nelson duke   of bronte the commanderinchief who fell in the action of   the 21st in the arms of victory covered with glory whose   memory will be ever dear to the british navy and the british   nation whose zeal for the honour of his king and for the   interests of his country will be ever held up as a shining   example for a british seamanleaves to me a duty to return   thanks etc etc  it was a worthy sentence to carry such a message written too in a raging tempest with sinking vessels all around him but in the main it is a poor crop from such a soil no doubt our sailors were too busy to do much writing but none the less one wonders that among so many thousands there were not some to understand what a treasure their experiences would be to their descendants i can call to mind the old threedeckers which used to rot in portsmouth harbour and i have often thought could they tell their tales what a missing chapter in our literature they could supply  it is not only in napoleonic memoirs that the french are so fortunate the almost equally interesting age of louis xiv produced an even more wonderful series if you go deeply into the subject you are amazed by their number and you feel as if every one at the court of the roi soleil had done what he or she could to give away their neighbours just to take the more obvious there are st simons memoirsthose in themselves give us a more comprehensive and intimate view of the age than anything i know of which treats of the times of queen victoria then there is st evremond who is nearly as complete do you want the view of a woman of quality there are the letters of madame de sevigne eight volumes of them perhaps the most wonderful series of letters that any woman has ever penned do you want the confessions of a rake of the period here are the too salacious memoirs of the mischievous duc de roquelaure not reading for the nursery certainly not even for the boudoir but a strange and very intimate picture of the times all these books fit into each other for the characters of the one reappear in the others you come to know them quite familiarly before you have finished their loves and their hates their duels their intrigues and their ultimate fortunes if you do not care to go so deeply into it you have only to put julia pardoes fourvolumed court of louis xiv upon your shelf and you will find a very admirable condensationor a distillation rather for most of the salt is left behind there is another book toothat big one on the bottom shelfwhich holds it all between its brown and gold covers an extravagance thatfor it cost me some sovereignsbut it is something to have the portraits of all that wonderful galaxy of louis of the devout maintenon of the frail montespan of bossuet fenelon moliere racine pascal conde turenne and all the saints and sinners of the age if you want to make yourself a present and chance upon a copy of the court and times of louis xiv you will never think that your money has been wasted  well i have bored you unduly my patient friend with my love of memoirs napoleonic and otherwise which give a touch of human interest to the arid records of history not that history should be arid it ought to be the most interesting subject upon earth the story of ourselves of our forefathers of the human race the events which made us what we are and wherein if weismanns views hold the field some microscopic fraction of this very body which for the instant we chance to inhabit may have borne a part but unfortunately the power of accumulating knowledge and that of imparting it are two very different things and the uninspired historian becomes merely the dignified compiler of an enlarged almanac worst of all when a man does come along with fancy and imagination who can breathe the breath of life into the dry bones it is the fashion for the dryasdusts to belabour him as one who has wandered away from the orthodox path and must necessarily be inaccurate so froude was attacked so also macaulay in his day but both will be read when the pedants are forgotten if i were asked my very ideal of how history should be written i think i should point to those two rows on yonder shelf the one mcarthys history of our own times the other leckys history of england in the eighteenth century curious that each should have been written by an irishman and that though of opposite politics and living in an age when irish affairs have caused such bitterness both should be conspicuous not merely for all literary graces but for that broad toleration which sees every side of a question and handles every problem from the point of view of the philosophic observer and never of the sectarian partisan  by the way talking of history have you read parkmans works he was i think among the very greatest of the historians and yet one seldom hears his name a new england man by birth and writing principally of the early history of the american settlements and of french canada it is perhaps excusable that he should have no great vogue in england but even among americans i have found many who have not read him there are four of his volumes in green and gold down yonder the jesuits in canada and frontenac but there are others all of them well worth reading pioneers of france montcalm and wolfe discovery of the great west etc some day i hope to have a complete set  taking only that one book the jesuits in canada it is worth a reputation in itself and how noble a tribute is this which a man of puritan blood pays to that wonderful order he shows how in the heyday of their enthusiasm these brave soldiers of the cross invaded canada as they did china and every other place where danger was to be faced and a horrible death to be found i dont care what faith a man may profess or whether he be a christian at all but he cannot read these true records without feeling that the very highest that man has ever evolved in sanctity and devotion was to be found among these marvellous men they were indeed the pioneers of civilization for apart from doctrines they brought among the savages the highest european culture and in their own deportment an objectlesson of how chastely austerely and nobly men could live france has sent myriads of brave men on to her battlefields but in all her long record of glory i do not think that she can point to any courage so steadfast and so absolutely heroic as that of the men of the iroquois mission  how nobly they lived makes the body of the book how serenely they died forms the end to it it is a tale which cannot even now be read without a shuddera nightmare of horrors fanaticism may brace a man to hurl himself into oblivion as the mahdis hordes did before khartoum but one feels that it is at least a higher development of such emotion where men slowly and in cold blood endure so thankless a life and welcome so dreadful an end every faith can equally boast its martyrsa painful thought since it shows how many thousands must have given their blood for errorbut in testifying to their faith these brave men have testified to something more important still to the subjugation of the body and to the absolute supremacy of the dominating spirit  the story of father jogue is but one of many and yet it is worth recounting as showing the spirit of the men he also was on the iroquois mission and was so tortured and mutilated by his sweet parishioners that the very dogs used to howl at his distorted figure he made his way back to france not for any reason of personal rest or recuperation but because he needed a special dispensation to say mass the catholic church has a regulation that a priest shall not be deformed so that the savages with their knives had wrought better than they knew he received his dispensation and was sent for by louis xiv who asked him what he could do for him no doubt the assembled courtiers expected to hear him ask for the next vacant bishopric what he did actually ask for as the highest favour was to be sent back to the iroquois mission where the savages signalized his arrival by burning him alive  parkman is worth reading if it were only for his account of the indians perhaps the very strangest thing about them and the most unaccountable is their small numbers the iroquois were one of the most formidable of tribes they were of the five nations whose scalpingparties wandered over an expanse of thousands of square miles yet there is good reason to doubt whether the whole five nations could have put as many thousand warriors in the field it was the same with all the other tribes of northern americans both in the east the north and the west their numbers were always insignificant and yet they had that huge country to themselves the best of climates and plenty of food why was it that they did not people it thickly it may be taken as a striking example of the purpose and design which run through the affairs of men that at the very moment when the old world was ready to overflow the new world was empty to receive it had north america been peopled as china is peopled the europeans might have founded some settlements but could never have taken possession of the continent buffon has made the striking remark that the creative power appeared to have never had great vigour in america he alluded to the abundance of the flora and fauna as compared with that of other great divisions of the earths surface whether the numbers of the indians are an illustration of the same fact or whether there is some special cause is beyond my very modest scientific attainments when one reflects upon the countless herds of bison which used to cover the western plains or marks in the present day the race statistics of the french canadians at one end of the continent and of the southern negro at the other it seems absurd to suppose that there is any geographical reason against nature being as prolific here as elsewhere however these be deeper waters and with your leave we will get back into my usual sixinch wadingdepth once more    x   i dont know how those two little books got in there they are henleys song of the sword and book of verses they ought to be over yonder in the rather limited poetry section perhaps it is that i like his work so whether it be prose or verse and so have put them ready to my hand he was a remarkable man a man who was very much greater than his work great as some of his work was i have seldom known a personality more magnetic and stimulating you left his presence as a battery leaves a generating station charged up and full he made you feel what a lot of work there was to be done and how glorious it was to be able to do it and how needful to get started upon it that very hour with the frame and the vitality of a giant he was cruelly bereft of all outlet for his strength and so distilled it off in hot words in warm sympathy in strong prejudices in all manner of human and stimulating emotions much of the time and energy which might have built an imperishable name for himself was spent in encouraging others but it was not waste for he left his broad thumbmark upon all that passed beneath it a dozen secondhand henleys are fortifying our literature today  alas that we have so little of his very best for that very best was the finest of our time few poets ever wrote sixteen consecutive lines more noble and more strong than those which begin with the wellknown quatrain     out of the night that covers me       black as the pit from pole to pole     i thank whatever gods there be       for my unconquerable soul  it is grand literature and it is grand pluck too for it came from a man who through no fault of his own had been pruned and pruned again like an illgrown shrub by the surgeons knife when he said     in the fell clutch of circumstance       i have not winced nor cried aloud     beneath the bludgeonings of chance       my head is bloody but unbowed  it was not what lady byron called the mimic woe of the poet but it was rather the grand defiance of the indian warrior at the stake whose proud soul can hold in hand his quivering body  there were two quite distinct veins of poetry in henley each the very extreme from the other the one was heroic gigantic running to large sweeping images and thundering words such are the song of the sword and much more that he has written like the wild singing of some northern scald the other and to my mind both the more characteristic and the finer side of his work is delicate precise finely etched with extraordinarily vivid little pictures drawn in carefully phrased and balanced english such are the hospital verses while the london voluntaries stand midway between the two styles what you have not read the hospital verses then get the book of verses and read them without delay you will surely find something there which for good or ill is unique you can nameor at least i can namenothing to compare it with goldsmith and crabbe have written of indoor themes but their monotonous if majestic metre wearies the modern reader but this is so varied so flexible so dramatic it stands by itself confound the weekly journals and all the other lightning conductors which caused such a man to pass away and to leave a total output of about five booklets behind him  however all this is an absolute digression for the books had no business in this shelf at all this corner is meant for chronicles of various sorts here are three in a line which carry you over a splendid stretch of french which usually means european history each as luck would have it beginning just about the time when the other leaves off the first is froissart the second de monstrelet and the third de comines when you have read the three you have the best contemporary account first hand of considerably more than a centurya fair slice out of the total written record of the human race  froissart is always splendid if you desire to avoid the mediaeval french which only a specialist can read with pleasure you can get lord berners almost equally mediaeval but very charming english or you can turn to a modern translation such as this one of johnes a single page of lord berners is delightful but it is a strain i think to read bulky volumes in an archaic style personally i prefer the modern and even with that you have shown some patience before you have reached the end of that big second tome  i wonder whether at the time the old hainault canon had any idea of what he was doingwhether it ever flashed across his mind that the day might come when his book would be the one great authority not only about the times in which he lived but about the whole institution of chivalry i fear that it is far more likely that his whole object was to gain some mundane advantage from the various barons and knights whose names and deeds be recounts he has left it on record for example that when he visited the court of england he took with him a handsomelybound copy of his work and doubtless if one could follow the good canon one would find his journeys littered with similar copies which were probably expensive gifts to the recipient for what return would a knightly soul make for a book which enshrined his own valour  but without looking too curiously into his motives it must be admitted that the work could not have been done more thoroughly there is something of herodotus in the canons cheery chatty garrulous takeitorleaveit manner but he has the advantage of the old greek in accuracy considering that he belonged to the same age which gravely accepted the travellers tales of sir john maundeville it is i think remarkable how careful and accurate the chronicler is take for example his description of scotland and the scotch some would give the credit to jeanlebel but that is another matter scotch descriptions are a subject over which a fourteenthcentury hainaulter might fairly be allowed a little scope for his imagination yet we can see that the account must on the whole have been very correct the galloway nags the girdlecakes the bagpipesevery little detail rings true jeanlebel was actually present in a border campaign and from him froissart got his material but he has never attempted to embroider it and its accuracy where we can to some extent test it must predispose us to accept his accounts where they are beyond our confirmation  but the most interesting portion of old froissarts work is that which deals with the knights and the knighterrants of his time their deeds their habits their methods of talking it is true that he lived himself just a little after the true heyday of chivalry but he was quite early enough to have met many of the men who had been looked upon as the flower of knighthood of the time his book was read too and commented on by these very men as many of them as could read and so we may take it that it was no fancy portrait but a correct picture of these soldiers which is to be found in it the accounts are always consistent if you collate the remarks and speeches of the knights as i have had occasion to do you will find a remarkable uniformity running through them we may believe then that this really does represent the kind of men who fought at crecy and at poictiers in the age when both the french and the scottish kings were prisoners in london and england reached a pitch of military glory which has perhaps never been equalled in her history  in one respect these knights differ from anything which we have had presented to us in our historical romances to turn to the supreme romancer you will find that scotts mediaeval knights were usually muscular athletes in the prime of life boisguilbert frontdeboeuf richard ivanhoe count robertthey all were such but occasionally the most famous of froissarts knights were old crippled and blinded chandos the best lance of his day must have been over seventy when he lost his life through being charged upon the side on which he had already lost an eye he was well on to that age when he rode out from the english army and slew the spanish champion big marten ferrara upon the morning of navaretta youth and strength were very useful no doubt especially where heavy armour had to be carried but once on the horses back the gallant steed supplied the muscles in an english huntingfield many a doddering old man when he is once firmly seated in his familiar saddle can give points to the youngsters at the game so it was among the knights and those who had outlived all else could still carry to the wars their wiliness their experience with arms and above all their cool and undaunted courage  beneath his varnish of chivalry it cannot be gainsayed that the knight was often a bloody and ferocious barbarian there was little quarter in his wars save when a ransom might be claimed but with all his savagery he was a lighthearted creature like a formidable boy playing a dreadful game he was true also to his own curious code and so far as his own class went his feelings were genial and sympathetic even in warfare there was no personal feeling or bitterness as there might be now in a war between frenchmen and germans on the contrary the opponents were very softspoken and polite to each other is there any small vow of which i may relieve you would you desire to attempt some small deed of arms upon me and in the midst of a fight they would stop for a breather and converse amicably the while with many compliments upon each others prowess when seaton the scotsman had exchanged as many blows as he wished with a company of french knights he said thank you gentlemen thank you and galloped away an english knight made a vow for his own advancement and the exaltation of his lady that he would ride into the hostile city of paris and touch with his lance the inner barrier the whole story is most characteristic of the times as he galloped up the french knights around the barrier seeing that he was under vow made no attack upon him and called out to him that he had carried himself well as he returned however there stood an unmannerly butcher with a poleaxe upon the sidewalk who struck him as he passed and killed him here ends the chronicler but i have not the least doubt that the butcher had a very evil time at the hands of the french knights who would not stand by and see one of their own order even if he were an enemy meet so plebeian an end  de comines as a chronicler is less quaint and more conventional than froissart but the writer of romance can dig plenty of stones out of that quarry for the use of his own little building of course quentin durward has come bodily out of the pages of de comines the whole history of louis xi and his relations with charles the bold the strange life at plessisletours the plebeian courtiers the barber and the hangman the astrologers the alternations of savage cruelty and of slavish superstitionit is all set forth here one would imagine that such a monarch was unique that such a mixture of strange qualities and monstrous crimes could never be matched and yet like causes will always produce like results read walewskis life of ivan the terrible and you will find that more than a century later russia produced a monarch even more diabolical but working exactly on the same lines as louis even down to small details the same cruelty the same superstition the same astrologers the same lowborn associates the same residence outside the influence of the great citiesa parallel could hardly be more complete if you have not supped too full of horrors when you have finished ivan then pass on to the same authors account of peter the great what a land what a succession of monarchs blood and snow and iron both ivan and peter killed their own sons and there is a hideous mockery of religion running through it all which gives it a grotesque horror of its own we have had our henry the eighth but our very worst would have been a wise and benevolent rule in russia  talking of romance and of chivalry that tattered book down yonder has as much between its disreputable covers as most that i know it is washington irvings conquest of granada i do not know where he got his material for this bookfrom spanish chronicles i presumebut the wars between the moors and the christian knights must have been among the most chivalrous of exploits i could not name a book which gets the beauty and the glamour of it better than this one the lanceheads gleaming in the dark defiles the red bale fires glowing on the crags the stern devotion of the mailclad christians the debonnaire and courtly courage of the dashing moslem had washington irving written nothing else that book alone should have forced the door of every library i love all his books for no man wrote fresher english with a purer style but of them all it is still the conquest of granada to which i turn most often  to hark back for a moment to history as seen in romances here are two exotics side by side which have a flavour that is new they are a brace of foreign novelists each of whom so far as i know has only two books this greenandgold volume contains both the works of the pomeranian meinhold in an excellent translation by lady wilde the first is sidonia the sorceress the second the amber witch i dont know where one may turn for a stranger view of the middle ages the quaint details of simple life with sudden intervals of grotesque savagery the most weird and barbarous things are made human and comprehensible there is one incident which haunts one after one has read it where the executioner chaffers with the villagers as to what price they will give him for putting some young witch to the torture running them up from a barrel of apples to a barrel and a half on the grounds that he is now old and rheumatic and that the stooping and straining is bad for his back it should be done on a sloping hill he explains so that the dear little children may see it easily both sidonia and the amber witch give such a picture of old germany as i have never seen elsewhere  but meinhold belongs to a bygone generation this other author in whom i find a new note and one of great power is merejkowski who is if i mistake not young and with his career still before him the forerunner and the death of the gods are the only two books of his which i have been able to obtain but the pictures of renaissance italy in the one and of declining rome in the other are in my opinion among the masterpieces of fiction i confess that as i read them i was pleased to find how open my mind was to new impressions for one of the greatest mental dangers which comes upon a man as he grows older is that he should become so attached to old favourites that he has no room for the newcomer and persuades himself that the days of great things are at an end because his own poor brain is getting ossified you have but to open any critical paper to see how common is the disease but a knowledge of literary history assures us that it has always been the same and that if the young writer is discouraged by adverse comparisons it has been the common lot from the beginning he has but one resource which is to pay no heed to criticism but to try to satisfy his own highest standard and leave the rest to time and the public here is a little bit of doggerel pinned as you see beside my bookcase which may in a ruffled hour bring peace and guidance to some younger brother     critics kindnever mind     critics flatterno matter     critics blameall the same     critics cursenone the worse     do your best  the rest    xi   i have been talking in the past tense of heroes and of knighterrants but surely their day is not yet passed when the earth has all been explored when the last savage has been tamed when the final cannon has been scrapped and the world has settled down into unbroken virtue and unutterable dulness men will cast their thoughts back to our age and will idealize our romance andour courage even as we do that of our distant forbears it is wonderful what these people did with their rude implements and their limited appliances that is what they will say when they read of our explorations our voyages and our wars  now take that first book on my travel shelf it is knights cruise of the falcon nature was guilty of the pun which put this soul into a body so named read this simple record and tell me if there is anything in hakluyt more wonderful two landsmensolicitors if i remember rightgo down to southampton quay they pick up a longshore youth and they embark in a tiny boat in which they put to sea where do they turn up at buenos ayres thence they penetrate to paraquay return to the west indies sell their little boat there and so home what could the elizabethan mariners have done more there are no spanish galleons now to vary the monotony of such a voyage but had there been i am very certain our adventurers would have had their share of the doubloons but surely it was the nobler when done out of the pure lust of adventure and in answer to the call of the sea with no golden bait to draw them on the old spirit still lives disguise it as you will with top hats frock coats and all prosaic settings perhaps even they also will seem romantic when centuries have blurred them  another book which shows the romance and the heroism which still linger upon earth is that large copy of the voyage of the discovery in the antarctic by captain scott written in plain sailor fashion with no attempt at overstatement or colour it none the less or perhaps all the more leaves a deep impression upon the mind as one reads it and reflects on what one reads one seems to get a clear view of just those qualities which make the best kind of briton every nation produces brave men every nation has men of energy but there is a certain type which mixes its bravery and its energy with a gentle modesty and a boyish goodhumour and it is just this type which is the highest here the whole expedition seem to have been imbued with the spirit of their commander no flinching no grumbling every discomfort taken as a jest no thought of self each working only for the success of the enterprise when you have read of such privations so endured and so chronicled it makes one ashamed to show emotion over the small annoyances of daily life read of scotts blinded scurvystruck party staggering on to their goal and then complain if you can of the heat of a northern sun or the dust of a country road  that is one of the weaknesses of modern life we complain too much we are not ashamed of complaining time was when it was otherwisewhen it was thought effeminate to complain the gentleman should always be the stoic with his soul too great to be affected by the small troubles of life you look cold sir said an english sympathizer to a french emigre the fallen noble drew himself up in his threadbare coat sir said he a gentleman is never cold ones consideration for others as well as ones own selfrespect should check the grumble this selfsuppression and also the concealment of pain are two of the old noblesse oblige characteristics which are now little more than a tradition public opinion should be firmer on the matter the man who must hop because his shin is hacked or wring his hand because his knuckles are bruised should be made to feel that he is an object not of pity but of contempt  the tradition of arctic exploration is a noble one among americans as well as ourselves the next book is a case in point it is greelys arctic service and it is a worthy shelfcompanion to scotts account of the voyage of the discovery there are incidents in this book which one can never forget the episode of those twentyodd men lying upon that horrible bluff and dying one a day from cold and hunger and scurvy is one which dwarfs all our puny tragedies of romance and the gallant starving leader giving lectures on abstract science in an attempt to take the thoughts of the dying men away from their sufferingswhat a picture it is bad to suffer from cold and bad to suffer from hunger and bad to live in the dark but that men could do all these things for six months on end and that some should live to tell the tale is indeed a marvel what a world of feeling lies in the exclamation of the poor dying lieutenant well this is wretched he groaned as he turned his face to the wall  the angloceltic race has always run to individualism and yet there is none which is capable of conceiving and carrying out a finer ideal of discipline there is nothing in roman or grecian annals not even the lavabaked sentry at pompeii which gives a more sternly fine objectlesson in duty than the young recruits of the british army who went down in their ranks on the birkenhead and this expedition of greelys gave rise to another example which seems to me hardly less remarkable you may remember if you have read the book that even when there were only about eight unfortunates still left hardly able to move for weakness and hunger the seven took the odd man out upon the ice and shot him dead for breach of discipline the whole grim proceeding was carried out with as much method and signing of papers as if they were all within sight of the capitol at washington his offence had consisted so far as i can remember of stealing and eating the thong which bound two portions of the sledge together something about as appetizing as a bootlace it is only fair to the commander to say however that it was one of a series of petty thefts and that the thong of a sledge might mean life or death to the whole party  personally i must confess that anything bearing upon the arctic seas is always of the deepest interest to me he who has once been within the borders of that mysterious region which can be both the most lovely and the most repellent upon earth must always retain something of its glamour standing on the confines of known geography i have shot the southward flying ducks and have taken from their gizzards pebbles which they have swallowed in some land whose shores no human foot has trod the memory of that inexpressible air of the great icegirt lakes of deep blue water of the cloudless sky shading away into a light green and then into a cold yellow at the horizon of the noisy companionable birds of the huge greasybacked water animals of the sluglike seals startlingly black against the dazzling whiteness of the iceall of it will come back to a man in his dreams and will seem little more than some fantastic dream itself go removed is it from the main stream of his life and then to play a fish a hundred tons in weight and worth two thousand poundsbut what in the world has all this to do with my bookcase  yet it has its place in my main line of thought for it leads me straight to the very next upon the shelf bullens cruise of the cachelot a book which is full of the glamour and the mystery of the sea marred only by the brutality of those who go down to it in ships this is the spermwhale fishing an opensea affair and very different from that greenland ice groping in which i served a sevenmonths apprenticeship both i fear are things of the pastcertainly the northern fishing is so for why should men risk their lives to get oil when one has but to sink a pipe in the ground it is the more fortunate then that it should have been handled by one of the most virile writers who has described a sailors life bullens english at its best rises to a great height if i wished to show how high i would take that next book down sea idylls  how is this for example if you have an ear for the music of prose it is a simple paragraph out of the magnificent description of a long calm in the tropics    a change unusual as unwholesome came over the bright blue   of the sea no longer did it reflect as in a limpid mirror   the splendour of the sun the sweet silvery glow of the   moon or the coruscating clusters of countless stars like   the ashengrey hue that bedims the countenance of the dying   a filmy greasy skin appeared to overspread the recent   loveliness of the ocean surface the sea was sick stagnant   and foul from its turbid waters arose a miasmatic vapour   like a breath of decay which clung clammily to the palate   and dulled all the senses drawn by some strange force   from the unfathomable depths below eerie shapes sought the   surface blinking glassily at the unfamiliar glare they had   exchanged for their native gloomuncouth creatures bedight   with tasselled fringes like weedgrowths waving around them   fathomlong medusae with coloured spots like eyes clustering   all over their transparent substance wriggling wormlike   forms of such elusive matter that the smallest exposure to   the sun melted them and they were not lower down vast pale   shadows creep sluggishly along happily undistinguishable   as yet but adding a halffamiliar flavour to the strange   faint smell that hung about us  take the whole of that essay which describes a calm in the tropics or take the other one sunrise as seen from the crowsnest and you must admit that there have been few finer pieces of descriptive english in our time if i had to choose a sea library of only a dozen volumes i should certainly give bullen two places the others well it is so much a matter of individual taste tom cringles log should have one for certain i hope boys respond now as they once did to the sharks and the pirates the planters and all the rollicking high spirits of that splendid book then there is danas two years before the mast i should find room also for stevensons wrecker and ebb tide clark russell deserves a whole shelf for himself but anyhow you could not miss out the wreck of the grosvenor marryat of course must be represented and i should pick midshipman easy and peter simple as his samples then throw in one of melvilles otaheite booksnow far too completely forgottentypee or omoo and as a quite modern flavour kiplings captains courageous and jack londons sea wolf with conrads nigger of the narcissus then you will have enough to turn your study into a cabin and bring the wash and surge to your cars if written words can do it oh how one longs for it sometimes when life grows too artificial and the old viking blood begins to stir surely it must linger in all of us for no man who dwells in an island but had an ancestor in longship or in coracle still more must the salt drop tingle in the blood of an american when you reflect that in all that broad continent there is not one whose forefather did not cross 3000 miles of ocean and yet there are in the central states millions and millions of their descendants who have never seen the sea  i have said that omoo and typee the books in which the sailor melville describes his life among the otaheitans have sunk too rapidly into obscurity what a charming and interesting task there is for some critic of catholic tastes and sympathetic judgment to undertake rescue work among the lost books which would repay salvage a small volume setting forth their names and their claims to attention would be interesting in itself and more interesting in the material to which it would serve as an introduction i am sure there are many good books possibly there are some great ones which have been swept away for a time in the rush what chance for example has any book by an unknown author which is published at a moment of great national excitement when some public crisis arrests the popular mind hundreds have been stillborn in this fashion and are there none which should have lived among them now there is a book a modern one and written by a youth under thirty it is snaiths broke of covenden and it scarce attained a second edition i do not say that it is a classici should not like to be positive that it is notbut i am perfectly sure that the man who wrote it has the possibility of a classic within him here is another noveleight days by forrest you cant buy it you are lucky even if you can find it in a library yet nothing ever written will bring the indian mutiny home to you as this book will do heres another which i will warrant you never heard of it is powells animal episodes no it is not a collection of dogandcat anecdotes but it is a series of very singularly told stories which deal with the animal side of the human and which you will feel have an entirely new flavour if you have a discriminating palate the book came out ten years ago and is utterly unknown if i can point to three in one small shelf how many lost lights must be flitting in the outer darkness  let me hark back for a moment to the subject with which i began the romance of travel and the frequent heroism of modern life i have two books of scientific exploration here which exhibit both these qualities as strongly as any i know i could not choose two better books to put into a young mans hands if you wished to train him first in a gentle and noble firmness of mind and secondly in a great love for and interest in all that pertains to nature the one is darwins journal of the voyage of the beagle any discerning eye must have detected long before the origin of species appeared simply on the strength of this book of travel that a brain of the first order united with many rare qualities of character had arisen never was there a more comprehensive mind nothing was too small and nothing too great for its alert observation one page is occupied in the analysis of some peculiarity in the web of a minute spider while the next deals with the evidence for the subsidence of a continent and the extinction of a myriad animals and his sweep of knowledge was so greatbotany geology zoology each lending its corroborative aid to the other how a youth of darwins agehe was only twentythree when in the year 1831 he started round the world on the surveying ship beaglecould have acquired such a mass of information fills one with the same wonder and is perhaps of the same nature as the boy musician who exhibits by instinct the touch of the master another quality which one would be less disposed to look for in the savant is a fine contempt for danger which is veiled in such modesty that one reads between the lines in order to detect it when he was in the argentina the country outside the settlements was covered with roving bands of horse indians who gave no quarter to any whites yet darwin rode the four hundred miles between bahia and buenos ayres when even the hardy gauchos refused to accompany him personal danger and a hideous death were small things to him compared to a new beetle or an undescribed fly  the second book to which i alluded is wallaces malay archipelago there is a strange similarity in the minds of the two men the same courage both moral and physical the same gentle persistence the same catholic knowledge and wide sweep of mind the same passion for the observation of nature wallace by a flash of intuition understood and described in a letter to darwin the cause of the origin of species at the very time when the latter was publishing a book founded upon twenty years labour to prove the same thesis what must have been his feelings when he read that letter and yet he had nothing to fear for his book found no more enthusiastic admirer than the man who had in a sense anticipated it here also one sees that science has its heroes no less than religion one of wallaces missions in papua was to examine the nature and species of the birdsofparadise but in the course of the years of his wanderings through those islands he made a complete investigation of the whole fauna a footnote somewhere explains that the papuans who lived in the birdofparadise country were confirmed cannibals fancy living for years with or near such neighbours let a young fellow read these two books and he cannot fail to have both his mind and his spirit strengthened by the reading    xii   here we are at the final seance for the last time my patient comrade i ask you to make yourself comfortable upon the old green settee to look up at the oaken shelves and to bear with me as best you may while i preach about their contents the last time and yet as i look along the lines of the volumes i have not mentioned one out of ten of those to which i owe a debt of gratitude nor one in a hundred of the thoughts which course through my brain as i look at them as well perhaps for the man who has said all that he has to say has invariably said too much  let me be didactic for a moment i assume this solemnoh call it not pedanticattitude because my eye catches the small but select corner which constitutes my library of science i wanted to say that if i were advising a young man who was beginning life i should counsel him to devote one evening a week to scientific reading had he the perseverance to adhere to his resolution and if he began it at twenty he would certainly find himself with an unusually wellfurnished mind at thirty which would stand him in right good stead in whatever line of life he might walk when i advise him to read science i do not mean that he should choke himself with the dust of the pedants and lose himself in the subdivisions of the lepidoptera or the classifications of the dicotyledonous plants these dreary details are the prickly bushes in that enchanted garden and you are foolish indeed if you begin your walks by butting your head into one keep very clear of them until you have explored the open beds and wandered down every easy path for this reason avoid the textbooks which repel and cultivate that popular science which attracts you cannot hope to be a specialist upon all these varied subjects better far to have a broad idea of general results and to understand their relations to each other a very little reading will give a man such a knowledge of geology for example as will make every quarry and railway cutting an object of interest a very little zoology will enable you to satisfy your curiosity as to what is the proper name and style of this buffermine moth which at the present instant is buzzing round the lamp a very little botany will enable you to recognize every flower you are likely to meet in your walks abroad and to give you a tiny thrill of interest when you chance upon one which is beyond your ken a very little archaeology will tell you all about yonder british tumulus or help you to fill in the outline of the broken roman camp upon the downs a very little astronomy will cause you to look more intently at the heavens to pick out your brothers the planets who move in your own circles from the stranger stars and to appreciate the order beauty and majesty of that material universe which is most surely the outward sign of the spiritual force behind it how a man of science can be a materialist is as amazing to me as how a sectarian can limit the possibilities of the creator show me a picture without an artist show me a bust without a sculptor show me music without a musician and then you may begin to talk to me of a universe without a universemaker call him by what name you will  here is flammarions latmospherea very gorgeous though weatherstained copy in faded scarlet and gold the book has a small history and i value it a young frenchman dying of fever on the west coast of africa gave it to me as a professional fee the sight of it takes me back to a little ships bunk and a sallow face with large sad eyes looking out at me poor boy i fear that he never saw his beloved marseilles again  talking of popular science i know no better books for exciting a mans first interest and giving a broad general view of the subject than these of samuel laing who would have imagined that the wise savant and gentle dreamer of these volumes was also the energetic secretary of a railway company many men of the highest scientific eminence have begun in prosaic lines of life herbert spencer was a railway engineer wallace was a land surveyor but that a man with so pronounced a scientific brain as laing should continue all his life to devote his time to dull routine work remaining in harness until extreme old age with his soul still open to every fresh idea and his brain acquiring new concretions of knowledge is indeed a remarkable fact read those books and you will be a fuller man  it is an excellent device to talk about what you have recently read rather hard upon your audience you may say but without wishing to be personal i dare bet it is more interesting than your usual small talk it must of course be done with some tact and discretion it is the mention of laings works which awoke the train of thought which led to these remarks i had met some one at a table dhote or elsewhere who made some remark about the prehistoric remains in the valley of the somme i knew all about those and showed him that i did i then threw out some allusion to the rock temples of yucatan which he instantly picked up and enlarged upon he spoke of ancient peruvian civilization and i kept well abreast of him i cited the titicaca image and he knew all about that he spoke of quaternary man and i was with him all the time each was more and more amazed at the fulness and the accuracy of the information of the other until like a flash the explanation crossed my mind you are reading samuel laings human origins i cried so he was and so by a coincidence was i we were pouring water over each other but it was all newdrawn from the spring  there is a big twovolumed book at the end of my science shelf which would even now have its right to be called scientific disputed by some of the pedants it is myers human personality my own opinion for what it is worth is that it will be recognized a century hence as a great root book one from which a whole new branch of science will have sprung where between four covers will you find greater evidence of patience of industry of thought of discrimination of that sweep of mind which can gather up a thousand separate facts and bind them all in the meshes of a single consistent system darwin has not been a more ardent collector in zoology than myers in the dim regions of psychic research and his whole hypothesis so new that a new nomenclature and terminology had to be invented to express it telepathy the subliminal and the rest of it will always be a monument of acute reasoning expressed in fine prose and founded upon ascertained fact  the mere suspicion of scientific thought or scientific methods has a great charm in any branch of literature however far it may be removed from actual research poes tales for example owe much to this effect though in his case it was a pure illusion jules verne also produces a charmingly credible effect for the most incredible things by an adept use of a considerable amount of real knowledge of nature but most gracefully of all does it shine in the lighter form of essay where playful thoughts draw their analogies and illustrations from actual fact each showing up the other and the combination presenting a peculiar piquancy to the reader  where could i get better illustration of what i mean than in those three little volumes which make up wendell holmes immortal series the autocrat the poet and the professor at the breakfast table here the subtle dainty delicate thought is continually reinforced by the allusion or the analogy which shows the wide accurate knowledge behind it what work it is how wise how witty how largehearted and tolerant could one choose ones philosopher in the elysian fields as once in athens i would surely join the smiling group who listened to the human kindly words of the sage of boston i suppose it is just that continual leaven of science especially of medical science which has from my early student days given those books so strong an attraction for me never have i so known and loved a man whom i had never seen it was one of the ambitions of my lifetime to look upon his face but by the irony of fate i arrived in his native city just in time to lay a wreath upon his newlyturned grave read his books again and see if you are not especially struck by the uptodateness of them like tennysons in memoriam it seems to me to be work which sprang into full flower fifty years before its time one can hardly open a page haphazard without lighting upon some passage which illustrates the breadth of view the felicity of phrase and the singular power of playful but most suggestive analogy here for example is a paragraphno better than a dozen otherswhich combines all the rare qualities    insanity is often the logic of an accurate mind overtasked   good mental machinery ought to break its own wheels and   levers if anything is thrust upon them suddenly which tends   to stop them or reverse their motion a weak mind does not   accumulate force enough to hurt itself stupidity often saves   a man from going mad we frequently see persons in insane   hospitals sent there in consequence of what are called   religious mental disturbances i confess that i think better   of them than of many who hold the same notions and keep   their wits and enjoy life very well outside of the asylums   any decent person ought to go mad if he really holds such   and such opinions anything that is brutal cruel   heathenish that makes life hopeless for the most of mankind   and perhaps for entire racesanything that assumes the   necessity for the extermination of instincts which were   given to be regulatedno matter by what name you call   itno matter whether a fakir or a monk or a deacon   believes itif received ought to produce insanity in   every wellregulated mind  theres a fine bit of breezy polemics for the dreary fiftiesa fine bit of moral courage too for the university professor who ventured to say it  i put him above lamb as an essayist because there is a flavour of actual knowledge and of practical acquaintance with the problems and affairs of life which is lacking in the elfin londoner i do not say that the latter is not the rarer quality there are my essays of elia and they are wellthumbed as you see so it is not because i love lamb less that i love this other more both are exquisite but wendell holmes is for ever touching some note which awakens an answering vibration within my own mind  the essay must always be a somewhat repellent form of literature unless it be handled with the lightest and deftest touch it is too reminiscent of the school themes of our boyhoodto put a heading and then to show what you can get under it even stevenson for whom i have the most profound admiration finds it difficult to carry the reader through a series of such papers adorned with his original thought and quaint turn of phrase yet his men and books and virginibus puerisque are high examples of what may be done in spite of the inherent unavoidable difficulty of the task  but his style ah if stevenson had only realized how beautiful and nervous was his own natural godgiven style he would never have been at pains to acquire another it is sad to read the muchlauded anecdote of his imitating this author and that picking up and dropping in search of the best the best is always the most natural when stevenson becomes a conscious stylist applauded by so many critics he seems to me like a man who having most natural curls will still conceal them under a wig the moment he is precious he loses his grip but when he will abide by his own sterling lowland saxon with the direct word and the short cutting sentence i know not where in recent years we may find his mate in this strong plain setting the occasional happy word shines like a cut jewel a really good stylist is like beau brummells description of a welldressed manso dressed that no one would ever observe him the moment you begin to remark a mans style the odds are that there is something the matter with it it is a clouding of the crystala diversion of the readers mind from the matter to the manner from the authors subject to the author himself  no i have not the edinburgh edition if you think of a presentationbut i should be the last to suggest it perhaps on the whole i would prefer to have him in scattered books rather than in a complete set the half is more than the whole of most authors and not the least of him i am sure that his friends who reverenced his memory had good warrant and express instructions to publish this complete editionvery possibly it was arranged before his lamented end yet speaking generally i would say that an author was best served by being very carefully pruned before being exposed to the winds of time let every weak twig every immature shoot be shorn away and nothing but strong sturdy wellseasoned branches left so shall the whole tree stand strong for years to come how false an impression of the true stevenson would our critical grandchild acquire if he chanced to pick down any one of half a dozen of these volumes as we watched his hand stray down the rank how we would pray that it might alight upon the ones we love on the new arabian nights the ebbtide the wrecker kidnapped or treasure island these can surely never lose their charm  what noble books of their class are those last kidnapped and treasure island both as you see shining forth upon my lower shelf treasure island is the better story while i could imagine that kidnapped might have the more permanent value as being an excellent and graphic sketch of the state of the highlands after the last jacobite insurrection each contains one novel and admirable character alan breck in the one and long john in the other surely john silver with his face the size of a ham and his little gleaming eyes like crumbs of glass in the centre of it is the king of all seafaring desperadoes observe how the strong effect is produced in his case seldom by direct assertion on the part of the storyteller but usually by comparison innuendo or indirect reference the objectionable billy bones is haunted by the dread of a seafaring man with one leg captain flint we are told was a brave man he was afraid of none not he only silversilver was that genteel or again where john himself says there was some that was feared of pew and some that was feared of flint but flint his own self was feared of me feared he was and proud they was the roughest crew afloat was flints the devil himself would have been feared to go to sea with them well now i will tell you im not a boasting man and you seen yourself how easy i keep company but when i was quartermaster lambs wasnt the word for flints old buccaneers so by a touch here and a hint there there grows upon us the individuality of the smoothtongued ruthless masterful onelegged devil he is to us not a creation of fiction but an organic living reality with whom we have come in contact such is the effect of the fine suggestive strokes with which he is drawn and the buccaneers themselves how simple and yet how effective are the little touches which indicate their ways of thinking and of acting i want to go in that cabin i do i want their pickles and wine and that now if you had sailed along o bill you wouldnt have stood there to be spoke twicenot you that was never bills way not the way of sich as sailed with him scotts buccaneers in the pirate are admirable but they lack something human which we find here it will be long before john silver loses his place in sea fiction and you may lay to that  stevenson was deeply influenced by meredith and even in these books the influence of the master is apparent there is the apt use of an occasional archaic or unusual word the short strong descriptions the striking metaphors the somewhat staccato fashion of speech yet in spite of this flavour they have quite individuality enough to constitute a school of their own their faults or rather perhaps their limitations lie never in the execution but entirely in the original conception they picture only one side of life and that a strange and exceptional one there is no female interest we feel that it is an apotheosis of the boystorythe penny number of our youth in excelsis but it is all so good so fresh so picturesque that however limited its scope it still retains a definite and wellassured place in literature there is no reason why treasure island should not be to the rising generation of the twentyfirst century what robinson crusoe has been to that of the nineteenth the balance of probability is all in that direction  the modern masculine novel dealing almost exclusively with the rougher more stirring side of life with the objective rather than the subjective marks the reaction against the abuse of love in fiction this one phase of life in its orthodox aspect and ending in the conventional marriage has been so hackneyed and worn to a shadow that it is not to be wondered at that there is a tendency sometimes to swing to the other extreme and to give it less than its fair share in the affairs of men in british fiction nine books out of ten have held up love and marriage as the beall and endall of life yet we know in actual practice that this may not be so in the career of the average man his marriage is an incident and a momentous incident but it is only one of several he is swayed by many strong emotionshis business his ambitions his friendships his struggles with the recurrent dangers and difficulties which tax a mans wisdom and his courage love will often play a subordinate part in his life how many go through the world without ever loving at all it jars upon us then to have it continually held up as the predominating allimportant fact in life and there is a not unnatural tendency among a certain school of which stevenson is certainly the leader to avoid altogether a source of interest which has been so misused and overdone if all lovemaking were like that between richard feverel and lucy desborough then indeed we could not have too much of it but to be made attractive once more the passion must be handled by some great master who has courage to break down conventionalities and to go straight to actual life for his inspiration  the use of novel and piquant forms of speech is one of the most obvious of stevensons devices no man handles his adjectives with greater judgment and nicer discrimination there is hardly a page of his work where we do not come across words and expressions which strike us with a pleasant sense of novelty and yet express the meaning with admirable conciseness his eyes came coasting round to me it is dangerous to begin quoting as the examples are interminable and each suggests another now and then he misses his mark but it is very seldom as an example an eyeshot does not commend itself as a substitute for a glance and to teehee for to giggle grates somewhat upon the ear though the authority of chaucer might be cited for the expressions  next in order is his extraordinary faculty for the use of pithy similes which arrest the attention and stimulate the imagination his voice sounded hoarse and awkward like a rusty lock i saw her sway like something stricken by the wind his laugh rang false like a cracked bell his voice shook like a taut rope my mind flying like a weavers shuttle his blows resounded on the grave as thick as sobs the private guilty considerations i would continually observe to peep forth in the mans talk like rabbits from a hill nothing could be more effective than these direct and homely comparisons  after all however the main characteristic of stevenson is his curious instinct for saying in the briefest space just those few words which stamp the impression upon the readers mind he will make you see a thing more clearly than you would probably have done had your eyes actually rested upon it here are a few of these wordpictures taken haphazard from among hundreds of equal merit    not far off macconochie was standing with his tongue out of   his mouth and his hand upon his chin like a dull fellow   thinking hard    stewart ran after us for more than a mile and i could not   help laughing as i looked back at last and saw him on a hill   holding his hand to his side and nearly burst with running    ballantrae turned to me with a face all wrinkled up and his   teeth all showing in his mouth he said no word but his   whole appearance was a kind of dreadful question    look at him if you doubt look at him grinning and gulping   a detected thief    he looked me all over with a warlike eye and i could see the   challenge on his lips  what could be more vivid than the effect produced by such sentences as these  there is much more that might be said as to stevensons peculiar and original methods in fiction as a minor point it might be remarked that he is the inventor of what may be called the mutilated villain it is true that mr wilkie collins has described one gentleman who had not only been deprived of all his limbs but was further afflicted by the insupportable name of miserrimus dexter stevenson however has used the effect so often and with such telling results that he may be said to have made it his own to say nothing of hyde who was the very impersonation of deformity there is the horrid blind pew black dog with two fingers missing long john with his one leg and the sinister catechist who is blind but shoots by ear and smites about him with his staff in the black arrow too there is another dreadful creature who comes tapping along with a stick often as he has used the device he handles it so artistically that it never fails to produce its effect  is stevenson a classic well it is a large word that you mean by a classic a piece of work which passes into the permanent literature of the country as a rule you only know your classics when they are in their graves who guessed it of poe and who of borrow the roman catholics only canonize their saints a century after their death so with our classics the choice lies with our grandchildren but i can hardly think that healthy boys will ever let stevensons books of adventure die nor do i think that such a short tale as the pavilion on the links nor so magnificent a parable as dr jekyll and mr hyde will ever cease to be esteemed how well i remember the eagerness the delight with which i read those early tales in cornhill away back in the late seventies and early eighties they were unsigned after the old unfair fashion but no man with any sense of prose could fail to know that they were all by the same author only years afterwards did i learn who that author was  i have stevensons collected poems over yonder in the small cabinet would that he had given us more most of them are the merest playful sallies of a freakish mind but one should indeed be a classic for it is in my judgment by all odds the best narrative ballad of the last centurythat is if i am right in supposing that the ancient mariner appeared at the very end of the eighteenth i would put coleridges tour de force of grim fancy first but i know none other to compare in glamour and phrase and easy power with ticonderoga then there is his immortal epitaph the two pieces alone give him a niche of his own in our poetical literature just as his character gives him a niche of his own in our affections no i never met him but among my most prized possessions are several letters which i received from samoa from that distant tower he kept a surprisingly close watch upon what was doing among the bookmen and it was his hand which was among the first held out to the striver for he had quick appreciation and keen sympathies which met another mans work halfway and wove into it a beauty from his own mind  and now my very patient friend the time has come for us to part and i hope my little sermons have not bored you overmuch if i have put you on the track of anything which you did not know before then verify it and pass it on if i have not there is no harm done save that my breath and your time have been wasted there may be a score of mistakes in what i have saidis it not the privilege of the conversationalist to misquote my judgments may differ very far from yours and my likings may be your abhorrence but the mere thinking and talking of books is in itself good be the upshot what it may for the time the magic door is still shut you are still in the land of faerie but alas though you shut that door you cannot seal it still come the ring of bell the call of telephone the summons back to the sordid world of work and men and daily strife well thats the real life after allthis only the imitation and yet now that the portal is wide open and we stride out together do we not face our fate with a braver heart for all the rest and quiet and comradeship that we found behind the magic door
