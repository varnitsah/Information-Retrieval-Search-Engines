87333355	little blue book no 1099 edited by e haldemanjulius   a cynic looks at life  ambrose bierce   haldemanjulius company girard kansas  copyright 1912 by the neale publishing company  reprinted by special arrangement with albert and charles boni new york  printed in the united states of america   a cynic looks at life     civilization   i  the question does civilization civilize is a fine example of petitio principii and decides itself in the affirmative for civilization must needs do that from the doing of which it has its name but it is not necessary to suppose that he who propounds is either unconscious of his lapse in logic or desirous of digging a pitfall for the feet of those who discuss i take it he simply wishes to put the matter in an impressive way and relies upon a certain degree of intelligence in the interpretation  concerning uncivilized peoples we know but little except what we are told by travelerswho speaking generally can know very little but the fact of uncivilization as shown in externals and irrelevances and are moreover greatly given to lying from the savages we hear very little judging them in all things by our own standards in default of a knowledge of theirs we necessarily condemn disparage and belittle one thing that civilization certainly has not done is to make us intelligent enough to understand that the contrary of a virtue is not necessarily a vice because as a rule we have but one wife and several mistresses each it is not certain that polygamy is everywherenor for that matter anywhereeither wrong or inexpedient because the brutality of the civilized slave owners and dealers created a conquering sentiment against slavery it is not intelligent to assume that slavery is a maleficent thing amongst oriental peoples for example where the slave is not oppressed some of these same orientals whom we are pleased to term halfcivilized have no regard for truth takest thou me for a christian dog said one of them that i should be the slave of my word so far as i can perceive the christian dog is no more the slave of his word than the true believer and i think the savageallowing for the fact that his inveracity has dominion over fewer thingsas great a liar as either of them for my part i do not know what in all circumstances is right or wrong but i know that if right it is at least stupid to judge an uncivilized people by the standards of morality and intelligence set up by civilized ones life in civilized countries is so complex that men there have more ways to be good than savages have and more to be bad more to be happy and more to be miserable and in each way to be good or bad their generally superior knowledgetheir knowledge of more thingsenables them to commit greater excesses than the savage can the civilized philanthropist wreaks upon his fellows a ranker philanthropy the civilized rascal a sturdier rascality andsplendid triumph of enlightenmentthe two characters are in civilization frequently combined in one person  i know of no savage custom or habit of thought which has not its mate in civilized countries for every mischievous or absurd practice of the natural man i can name you one of ours that is essentially the same and nearly every custom of our barbarian ancestors in historic times persists in some form today we make ourselves look formidable in battlefor that matter we fight our women paint their faces we feel it obligatory to dress more or less alike inventing the most ingenious reasons for doing so and actually despising and persecuting those who do not care to conform almost within the memory of living persons bearded men were stoned in the streets and a clergyman in new york who wore his beard as christ wore his was put into jail and variously persecuted till he died  civilization does not i think make the race any better it makes men know more and if knowledge makes them happy it is useful and desirable the one purpose of every sane human being is to be happy no one can have any other motive than that there is no such thing as unselfishness we perform the most generous and selfsacrificing acts because we should be unhappy if we did not we move on lines of least reluctance whatever tends to increase the beggarly sum of human happiness is worth having nothing else has any value  the cant of civilization fatigues civilization is a fine and beautiful structure it is as picturesque as a gothic cathedral but it is built upon the bones and cemented with the blood of those whose part in all its pomp is that and nothing more it cannot be reared in the ungenerous tropics for there the people will not contribute their blood and bones the proposition that the average american workingman or european peasant is better off than the south sea islander lolling under a palm and drunk with overeating will not bear a moments examination it is we scholars and gentlemen that are better off  it is admitted that the south sea islander in a state of nature is overmuch addicted to the practice of eating human flesh but concerning that i submit first that he likes it second that those who supply it are mostly dead it is upon his enemies that he feeds and these he would kill anyhow as we do ours in civilized enlightened and christian countries where cannibalism has not yet established itself wars are as frequent and destructive as among the maneaters the untitled savage knows at least why he goes killing whereas our private soldier is commonly in black ignorance of the apparent cause of quarrelof the actual cause always their shares in the fruits of victory are about equal for the chief takes all the dead the general all the glory   ii  transplanted institutions grow slowly civilization can not be put into a ship and carried across an ocean the history of this country is a sequence of illustrations of these truths it was settled by civilized men and women from civilized countries yet after two and a half centuries with unbroken communication with the mother systems it is still imperfectly civilized in learning and letters in art and the science of government america is but a faint and stammering echo of europe  for nearly all that is good in our american civilization we are indebted to the old world the errors and mischiefs are of our own creation we have originated little because there is little to originate but we have unconsciously reproduced many of the discredited systems of former ages and other countriesreceiving them at second hand but making them ours by the sheer strength and immobility of the national belief in their novelty novelty why it is not possible to make an experiment in government in art in literature in sociology or in morals that has not been made over and over and over again  the glories of england are our glories she can achieve nothing that our fathers did not help to make possible to her the learning the power the refinement of a great nation are not the growth of a century but of many centuries each generation builds upon the work of the preceding for untold ages our ancestors wrought to rear that reverend pile the civilization of england and shall we now try to belittle the mighty structure because other though kindred hands are laying the top courses while we have elected to found a new tower in another land the american eulogist of civilization who is not proud of his heritage in englands glory is unworthy to enjoy his lesser heritage in the lesser glory of his own country  the english are undoubtedly our intellectual superiors and as the virtues are solely the product of intelligence and cultivationa rogue being only a dunce considered from another point of viewthey are our moral superiors likewise why should they not be theirs is a land not of ugly schoolhouses grudgingly erected containing schools supported by such niggardly tax levies as a sparse and hardhanded population will consent to pay but of ancient institutions splendidly endowed by the state and by centuries of private benefaction as a means of dispensing formulated ignorance our boasted public school system is not without merit it spreads out education sufficiently thin to give everyone enough to make him a more competent fool than he would have been without it but to compare it with that which is not the creature of legislation acting with malice aforethought but the unnoted outgrowth of ages is to be ridiculous it is like comparing the laidout town of a western prairie its rightangled streets prim cottages and wooden abc shops with the grand old town of oxford topped with the clustered domes and towers of its twentyodd great colleges the very names of many of whose founders have perished from human record as have the chronicles of the times in which they lived  it is not only that we have had to subdue the wilderness our educational conditions are adverse otherwise our political system is unfavorable our fortunes accumulated in one generation are dispersed in the next if it takes three generations to make a gentleman one will not make a thinker instruction is acquired but capacity for instruction is transmitted the brain that is to contain a trained intellect is not the result of a haphazard marriage between a clown and a wench nor does it get its tractable tissues from a hardheaded farmer and a softheaded milliner if you confess the importance of race and pedigree in a horse and a dog how dare you deny it in a man  i do not hold that the political and social system that creates an aristocracy of leisure is the best possible kind of human organization i perceive its disadvantages clearly enough but i do hold that a system under which most important public trusts political and professional civil and military ecclesiastical and secular are held by educated menthat is men of trained faculties and disciplined judgmentis not an altogether faulty system  it is a universal human weakness to disparage the knowledge that we do not ourselves possess but it is only my own beloved country that can justly boast herself the last refuge and asylum of the impotents and incapables who deny the advantage of all knowledge whatsoever it was an american senator who declared that he had devoted a couple of weeks to the study of finance and found the accepted authorities all wrong it was another american senator who confronted with certain hostile facts in the history of another country proposed to brush away all facts and argue the question on consideration of plain common sense  republican institutions have this disadvantage by incessant changes in the personnel of governmentto say nothing of the manner of men that ignorant constituencies elect and all constituencies are ignorantwe attain to no fixed principles and standards there is no such thing here as a science of politics because it is not to any ones interest to make politics the study of his life nothing is settled no truth finds general acceptance what we do one year we undo the next and do over again the year following our energy is wasted in and our prosperity suffers from experiments endlessly repeated  every patriot believes his country better than any other country now they cannot all be the best indeed only one can be the best and it follows that the patriots of all the others have suffered themselves to be misled by a mere sentiment into blind unreason in its active manifestationit is fond of killingpatriotism would be well if it were simply defensive but it is also aggressive and the same feeling that prompts us to strike for our altars and our fires impels us over the border to quench the fires and overturn the altars of our neighbors it is all very pretty and spirited what the poets tell us about thermopylæ but there was as much patriotism at one end of that pass as there was at the other  patriotism deliberately and with folly aforethought subordinates the interests of a whole to the interests of a part worse still the fraction so favored is determined by an accident of birth or residence the western hoodlum who cuts the tail from a chinamans nowl and would cut the nowl from the body if he dared is simply a patriot with a logical mind having the courage of his opinions patriotism is fierce as a fever pitiless as the grave and blind as a stone   iii  there are two ways of clarifying liquidsebullition and precipitation one forces the impurities to the surface as scum the other sends them to the bottom as dregs the former is the more offensive and that seems to be our way but neither is useful if the impurities are merely separated but not removed we are told with tiresome iteration that our social and political systems are clarifying but when is the skimmer to appear if the purpose of free institutions is good government where is the good governmentwhen may it be expected to beginhow is it to come about systems of government have no sanctity they are practical means to a simple endthe public welfare worthy of no respect if they fail of its accomplishment the tree is known by its fruit ours is bearing crabapples if the body politic is constitutionally diseased as i verily believe if the disorder inheres in the system there is no remedy the fever must burn itself out and then nature will do the rest one does not prescribe what time alone can administer we have put our criminals and dunces into power do we suppose they will efface themselves will they restore to us the power of governing them they must have their way and go their length the natural and immemorial sequence is tyranny insurrection combat in combat everything that wears a sword has a chanceeven the right history does not forbid us to hope but it forbids us to rely upon numbers they will be against us if history teaches anything worth learning it teaches that the majority of mankind is neither good nor wise when government is founded upon the public conscience and the public intelligence the stability of states is a dream  in that moment of time that is covered by historical records we have abundant evidence that each generation has believed itself wiser and better than any of its predecessors that each people has believed itself to have the secret of national perpetuity in support of this universal delusion there is nothing to be said the desolate places of the earth cry out against it vestiges of obliterated civilizations cover the earth no savage but has camped upon the sites of proud and populous cities no desert but has heard the statesmans boast of national stability our nation our laws our historyall shall go down to everlasting oblivion with the others and by the same road but i submit that we are traveling it with needless haste  it can be sparedthis jonahs gourd civilization of ours we have hardly the rudiments of a true one compared with the splendors of which we catch dim glimpses in the fading past ours are as an illumination of tallow candles we know no more than the ancients we only know other things but nothing in which is an assurance of perpetuity and little that is truly wisdom our vaunted elixir vitae is the art of printing what good will that do when posterity struck by the inevitable intellectual blight shall have ceased to read what is printed our libraries will become its stables our books its fuel  ours is a civilization that might be heard from afar in space as a scolding and a riot a civilization in which the race has so differentiated as to have no longer a community of interest and feeling which shows as a ripe result of the principles underlying it a reasonless and rascally feud between rich and poor in which one is offered a choice if one have the means to take it between american plutocracy and european militocracy with an imminent chance of renouncing either for a stultocratic republic with a headsman in the presidential chair and every laundress in exile  i have not a solution to the labor problem i have only a story many and many years ago lived a man who was so good and wise that none in all the world was so good and wise as he he was one of those few whose goodness and wisdom are such that after some time has passed their foolish fellowmen begin to think them gods and treasure their words as divine law and by millions they are worshiped through centuries of time amongst the utterances of this man was one commandnot a new nor perfect onewhich has seemed to his adorers so preeminently wise that they have given it a name by which it is known over half the world one of the sovereign virtues of this famous law is its simplicity which is such that all hearing must understand and obedience is so easy that any nation refusing is unfit to exist except in the turbulence and adversity that will surely come to it when a people would avert want and strife or having them would restore plenty and peace this noble commandment offers the only meansall other plans for safety or relief are as vain as dreams as empty as the crooning of hags and behold here is it all things whatsoever ye would that men should do to you do ye even so to them  what you unappeasable rich coining the sweat and blood of your workmen into drachmas understanding the law of supply and demand as mandatory and justifying your cruel greed by the senseless dictum that business is business you lazy workmen railing at the capitalist by whose desertion when you have frightened away his capital you starverioting and shedding blood and torturing and poisoning by way of answer to exaction and by way of exaction you foul anarchists applauding with untidy palms when one of your coward kind hurls a bomb amongst powerless and helpless women and children you imbecile politicians with a plague of remedial legislation for the irremediable you writers and thinkers unread in history with as many solutions to the labor problem as there are among you those who can not coherently define itdo you really think yourselves wiser than jesus of nazareth do you seriously suppose yourselves competent to amend his plan for dealing with evils besetting nations and souls have you the effrontery to believe that those who spurn his golden rule you can bind to obedience of an act entitled an act to amend an act bah you fatigue the spirit go get ye to your scoundrel lockouts your villain strikes your blacklisting your boycotting your speeching marching and maundering but if ye do not to others as ye would that they do to you it shall occur and that right soon that ye be drowned in your own blood and your pickpocket civilization quenched as a star that falls into the sea     the gift o gab   a book entitled forensic eloquence by mr john goss appears to have for purpose to teach the young idea how to spout and that purpose i dare say it will accomplish if something is not done to prevent i know nothing of the matter myself a strong distaste for forensic eloquence or eloquence of any kind implying a man mounted on his legs and doing all the talking having averted me from its study the training of the youth of this country to utterance of themselves after that fashion i should regard as a disaster of magnitude so far as i know it forensic eloquence is the art of saying things in such a way as to make them pass for more than they are worth employed in matters of importance and for other employment it were hardly worth acquiring it is mischievous because dishonest and misleading in the public service truth toils best when not clad in clothofgold and bedaubed with fine lace if eloquence does not beget action it is valueless but action which results from the passions sentiments and emotions is less likely to be wise than that which comes of a persuaded judgment for that reason i cannot help thinking that the influence of bismarck in german politics was more wholesome than is that of mr john temple graves  for eloquence per seconsidered merely as an art of pleasingi entertain something of the respect evoked by success for it always pleases at least the speaker it is to speech what an ornate style is to writinggood and pleasant enough in its time and place and like piecrust and the evening girl destitute of any basis in common sense forensic eloquence on the contrary has an all too sufficient foundation in reason and the order of things it promotes the ambition of tricksters and advances the fortunes of rogues for i take it that the ciceros the mirabeaus the burkes the oconnells the patrick henrys and the rest of thempets of the textbookers and scourges of youthbelong in either the one category or the other or in both anyhow i find it impossible to think of them as highminded men and rightforth statesmenwith their actors tricks their devices of the countenance inventions of gesture and other cunning expedients having nothing to do with the matter in hand extinction of the orator i hold to be the most beneficent possibility of evolution if mr goss has done anything to retard that blessed time when the bourke cockrans shall cease from troubling and the weary be at rest he is an enemy of his race  what exclaims the thoughtless readeri have but oneare not the great forensic speeches by the worlds famous orators good reading considering them merely as literature do you not derive a high and refining pleasure from them i do not i find them turgid and tumid no end they are bad reading though they may have been good hearing in order to enjoy them one must have in memory what indeed one is seldom permitted to forget that they were addressed to the ear and in imagination one must hold some shadowy simulacrum of the orator himself uttering his work these conditions being fulfilled there remains for application to the matter of the discourse too little attention to get much good of it and the total effect is confusion literature by which the reader is compelled to bear in mind the producer and the circumstances under which it was produced can be spared     natura benigna   it is not always on remote islands peopled with pagans that great disasters occur as memory witnesseth nor are the forces of nature inadequate to production of a fiercer throe than any that we have known the situation is this we are tied by the feet to a fragile shell imperfectly confining a force powerful enough under favoring conditions to burst it asunder and set the fragments wallowing and grinding together in liquid flame in the blind fury of a readjustment nay it needs no such stupendous cataclysm to depeople this uneasy orb let but a square mile be blown out of the bottom of the sea or a great rift open there is it to be supposed that we would be unaffected in the altered conditions generated by a contest between the ocean and the earths molten core these fatalities are not only possible but in the highest degree probable it is probable indeed that they have occurred over and over again effacing all the more highly organized forms of life and compelling the slow march of evolution to begin anew slow on the stage of eternity the passing of racesthe entrances and exits of lifeare incidents in a brisk and lively drama following one another with confusing rapidity  mankind has not found it practicable to abandon and avoid those places where the forces of nature have been most malign the track of the western tornado is speedily repeopled san francisco is still populous despite its earthquake galveston despite its storm and even the courts of lisbon are not kept by the lion and the lizard in the peruvian village straight downward into whose streets the crew of a united states warship once looked from the crest of a wave that stranded her a half mile inland are heard the tinkle of the guitar and the voices of children at play there are people living at herculaneum and pompeii on the slopes about catania the goatherd endures with what courage he may the trembling of the ground beneath his feet as old enceladus again turns over on his other side as the hoangho goes back inside its banks after fertilizing its contiguity with hydrate of chinaman the living agriculturist follows the receding wave sets up his habitation beneath the broken embankment and again the valley of the gone away blossoms as the rose its people diving with death  this matter can not be amended the race exposes itself to peril because it can do no otherwise in all the world there is no city of refugeno temple in which to take sanctuary clinging to the horns of the altarno place apart where like hunted deer we can hope to elude the baying pack of natures malevolences the deadline is drawn at the gate of life man crosses it at birth his advent is a challenge to the entire packearthquake storm fire flood drought heat cold wild beasts venomous reptiles noxious insects bacilli spectacular plague and velvetfooted household diseaseall are fierce and tireless in pursuit dodge turn and double how he can theres no eluding them soon or late some of them have him by the throat and his spirit returns to the god who gave itand gave them  we are told that this earth was made for our inhabiting our dearly beloved brethren in the faith our spiritual guides philosophers and friends of the pulpit never tire of pointing out the goodness of god in giving us so excellent a place to live in and commending the admirable adaptation of all things to our needs  what a fine world it is to be surea darling little world so suited to the needs of man a globe of liquid fire straining within a shell relatively no thicker than that of an egga shell constantly cracking and in momentary danger of going all to pieces threefourths of this delectable field of human activity are covered with an element in which we can not breathe and which swallows us by myriads    with moldering bones the deep is white   from the frozen zones to the tropic bright  of the other onefourth more than onehalf is uninhabitable by reason of climate on the remaining oneeighth we pass a comfortless and precarious existence in disputed occupancy with countless ministers of death and painpass it in fighting for it tooth and nail a hopeless battle in which we are foredoomed to defeat everywhere death terror lamentation and the laughter that is more terrible than tearsthe fury and despair of a race hanging on to life by the tips of its fingers and the prize for which we strive to have and to holdwhat is it a thing that is neither enjoyed while had or missed when lost so worthless it is so unsatisfying so inadequate to purpose so false to hope and at its best so brief that for consolation and compensation we set up fantastic faiths of an aftertime in a better world from which no confirming whisper has ever reached us across the void heaven is a prophecy uttered by the lips of despair but hell is an inference from analogy     the death penalty   i  down with the gallows is a cry not unfamiliar in america there is always a movement afoot to make odious the just principle of a life for a lifeto represent it as a relic of barbarism a usurpation of the divine authority and the rest of it the law making murder punishable by death is as purely a measure of selfdefense as is the display of a pistol to one diligently endeavoring to kill without provocation it is in precisely the same sense an admonition a warning to abstain from crime society says by that law if you kill one of us you die just as by display of the pistol the individual whose life is attacked says desist or be shot to be effective the warning in either case must be more than an idle threat even the most unearthly reasoner among the antihanging unfortunates would hardly expect to frighten away an assassin who knew the pistol to be unloaded of course these queer illogicians can not be made to understand that their position commits them to absolute nonresistance to any kind of aggression and that is fortunate for the rest of us for if as christians they frankly and consistently took that ground we should be under the miserable necessity of respecting them  we have good reason to hold that the horrible prevalence of murder in this country is due to the fact that we do not execute our lawsthat the death penalty is threatened but not inflictedthat the pistol is not loaded in civilized countries where there is enough respect for the laws to administer them there is enough to obey them while man still has as much of the ancestral brute as his skin can hold without cracking we shall have thieves and demagogues and anarchists and assassins and persons with a private system of lexicography who define murder as disease and hanging as murder but in all this welter of crime and stupidity are areas where human life is comparatively secure against the human hand it is at least a significant coincidence that in these the death penalty for murder is fairly well enforced by judges who do not derive any part of their authority from those for whose restraint and punishment they hold it against the life of one guiltless person the lives of ten thousand murderers count for nothing their hanging is a public good without reference to the crimes that disclose their deserts if we could discover them by other signs than their bloody deeds they should be hanged anyhow unfortunately we must have a death as evidence the scientist who will tell us how to recognize the potential assassin and persuade us to kill him will be the greatest benefactor of his century  what would these enemies of the gibbet havethese lineal descendants of the drunken mobs that hooted the hangman at tyburn tree this progeny of criminals which has so defiled with the mud of its animosity the noble office of public executioner that even in this enlightened age he shirks his high duty entrusting it to a hidden or unnamed subordinate if murder is unjust of what importance is it whether its punishment by death be just or notnobody needs to incur it men are not drafted for the death penalty they volunteer then it is not deterrent mutters the gentleman whose rude forefather hooted the hangman well as to that the law which is to accomplish more than a part of its purpose must be awaited with great patience every murder proves that hanging is not altogether deterrent every hanging that it is somewhat deterrentit deters the person hanged a mans first murder is his crime his second is ours  the socialists it seems believe with alphonse karr in the expediency of abolishing the death penalty but apparently they do not hold with him that the assassins should begin they want the state to begin believing that the magnanimous example will effect a change of heart in those about to murder this i take it is the meaning of their assertion that death penalties have not the deterring influence that imprisonment for life carries in this they obviously err death deters at least the person who suffers ithe commits no more murder whereas the assassin who is imprisoned for life and immune from further punishment may with impunity kill his keeper or whomsoever he may be able to get at even as matters now are incessant vigilance is required to prevent convicts in prison from murdering their attendants and one another how would it be if the lifetermer were assured against any additional inconvenience for braining a guard occasionally or strangling a chaplain now and then a penitentiary may be described as a place of punishment and reward and under the system proposed the difference in desirableness between a sentence and an appointment would be virtually effaced to overcome this objection a life sentence would have to mean solitary confinement and that means insanity is that what these gentlemen propose to substitute for death  the death penalty say these amiables and futilitarians creates bloodthirstiness in the unthinking masses and defeats its own endsis itself a cause of murder not a check these gentlemen are themselves of the unthinking massesthey do not know how to think let them try to trace and lucidly expound the chain of motives lying between the knowledge that a murderer has been hanged and the wish to commit a murder how precisely does the one beget the other by what unearthly process of reasoning does a man turning away from the gallows persuade himself that it is expedient to incur the danger of hanging let us have pointed out to us the several steps in that remarkable mental progress obviously the thing is absurd one might as reasonably say that contemplation of a pitted face will make a man wish to go and catch smallpox or the spectacle of an amputated limb on the scrapheap of a hospital tempt him to cut off his arm or renounce his leg  an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth say the opponents of the death penalty is not justice it is revenge and unworthy of a christian civilization it is exact justice nobody can think of anything more accurately just than such punishments would be whatever the motive in awarding them unfortunately such a system is not practicable but he who denies its justice must deny also the justice of a bushel of corn for a bushel of corn a dollar for a dollar service for service we can not undertake by such clumsy means as laws and courts to do to the criminal exactly what he has done to his victim but to demand a life for a life is simple practicable expedient and therefore right  taking the life of a murderer does not restore the life he took therefore it is a most illogical punishment two wrongs do not make a right  heres richness hanging an assassin is illogical because it does not restore the life of his victim incarceration is logical therefore incarceration doesquod erat demonstrandum  two wrongs certainly do not make a right but the veritable thing in dispute is whether taking the life of a lifetaker is a wrong so naked and unashamed an example of petitio principii would disgrace a debater in a pinafore and these wondermongers have the effrontery to babble of logic why if one of them were to meet a syllogism in a lonely road he would run away in a hundred and fifty directions as hard as ever he could hoof it one is almost ashamed to dispute with such intellectual cloutlings  whatever an individual may rightly do to protect himself society may rightly do to protect him for he is a part of itself if he may rightly take life in defending himself society may rightly take life in defending him if society may rightly take life in defending him it may rightly threaten to take it having rightly and mercifully threatened to take it it not only rightly may take it but expediently must   ii  the law of a life for a life does not altogether prevent murder no law can altogether prevent any form of crime nor is it desirable that it should doubtless god could so have created us that our sense of right and justice could have existed without contemplation of injustice and wrong as doubtless he could so have created us that we could have felt compassion without a knowledge of suffering but he did not constituted as we are we can know good only by contrast with evil our sense of sin is what our virtues feed upon in the thin air of universal morality the altarfires of honor and the beacons of conscience could not be kept alight a community without crime would be a community without warm and elevated sentimentswithout the sense of justice without generosity without courage without mercy without magnanimitya community of small smug souls uninteresting to god and uncoveted by the devil we can have and do have too much crime no doubt what the wholesome proportion is none can tell just now we are running a good deal to murder but he who can gravely attribute that phenomenon or any part of it to infliction of the death penalty instead of to virtual immunity from any penalty at all is justly entitled to the innocent satisfaction that comes of being a simpleton   iii  the new woman is against the death penalty naturally for she is hot and hardy in the conviction that whatever is is wrong she has visited this world in order to straighten things about a bit and is in distress lest the number of things be insufficient to her need the matter is important variously not least so in its relation to the new heaven and the new earth that are to be the outcome of woman suffrage there can be no doubt that the vast majority of women have sentimental objections to the death penalty that quite outweigh such practical considerations in its favor as they can be persuaded to comprehend aided by the minority of men afflicted by the same mental malady they will indubitably effect its abolition in the first lustrum of their political equality the new woman will scarcely feel the seat of power warm beneath her before giving to the assassins unhand me villain the authority of law so we shall make again the old experiment discredited by a thousand failures of preventing crime by tenderness to caught criminals and the criminal uncaught will treat us to a quantity and quality of crime notably augmented by the christian spirit of the new régime   iv  as to painless execution the simple and practical way to make them both just and expedient is the adoption by murderers of a system of painless assassinations until this is done there seems to be no call to renounce the wholesome discomfort of the style of executions endeared to us by memories and associations of the tenderest character there is i fancy a shaping notion in the observant mind that the penologists and their allies have gone about as far as they can safely be permitted to go in the direction of a softer suasion of the criminal nature toward good behavior the modern prison has become a rather more comfortable habitation than the dangerous classes are accustomed to at home modern prison life has in their eyes something of the charm and glamor of an ideal existence like that in the happy valley from which rasselas had the folly to escape whatever advantages to the public may be secured by abating the rigors of imprisonment and inconveniences incident to execution there is this objection it makes them less deterrent let the penologers and philanthropers have their way and even hanging might be made so pleasant and withal so interesting a social distinction that it would deter nobody but the person hanged adopt the euthanasian method of electricity asphyxia by smothering in roseleaves or slow poisoning with rich food and the death penalty may come to be regarded as the object of a noble ambition to the bon vivant and the rising young suicide may go and kill somebody else instead of himself in order to receive from the public executioner a happier dispatch than his own prentice hand can assure him  but the advocates of agreeable pains and penalties tell us that in the darker ages when cruel and degrading punishment was the rule and was freely inflicted for every light infraction of the law crime was more common than it is now and in this they appear to be right but one and all they overlook a fact equally obvious and vastly significant that the intellectual moral and social condition of the masses was very low crime was more common because ignorance was more common poverty was more common sins of authority and therefore hatred of authority were more common the world of even a century ago was a different world from the world of today and a vastly more uncomfortable one the popular adage to the contrary notwithstanding human nature was not by a long cut the same then that it is now in the very ancient time of that early english king george iii when women were burned at the stake in public for various offenses and men were hanged for coining and children for theft and in the still remoter period circa 1530 when prisoners were boiled in several waters divers sorts of criminals were disemboweled and some are thought to have undergone the peine forte et dure of coldpressing an infliction which the pen of hugo has since made popularin literaturein these wicked old days crime flourished not because of the laws severity but in spite of it it is possible that our lawmaking ancestors understood the situation as it then was a trifle better than we can understand it on the hither side of this gulf of years and that they were not the reasonless barbarians that we think them to have been and if they were what must have been the unreason and barbarity of the criminal element with which they had to deal  i am far from thinking that severity of punishment can have the same restraining effect as probability of some punishment being inflicted but if mildness of penalty is to be superadded to difficulty of conviction and both are to be mounted upon laxity in detection the pile will be complete indeed there is a peculiar fitness perhaps in the fact that all these pleas for comfortable punishment should be urged at a time when there appears to be a general disposition to inflict no punishment at all there are however still a few oldfashioned persons who hold it obvious that one who is ambitious to break the laws of his country will not with so light a heart and so airy an indifference incur the peril of a harsh penalty as he will the chance of one more nearly resembling that which he would himself select   v  after lying for more than a century dead i was revived dowered with a new body and restored to society the first thing of interest that i observed was an enormous building covering a square mile of ground it was surrounded on all sides by a high strong wall of hewn stone upon which armed sentinels paced to and fro in one face of the wall was a single gate of massive iron strongly guarded while admiring the cyclopean architecture of the reverend pile i was accosted by a man in uniform evidently the warden with a cheerful salutation  colonel i said pray tell me what is this building  this said he is the new state penitentiary it is one of twelve all alike  you surprise me i replied surely the criminal element must have increased enormously  yes indeed he assented under the reform régime which began in your day crime became so powerful bold and fierce that arrests were no longer possible and the prisons then in existence were soon overcrowded the state was compelled to erect others of greater capacity  but colonel i protested if the criminals were too bold and powerful to be taken into custody of what use are the prisons and how are they crowded  he fixed upon me a look that i could not fail to interpret as expressing a doubt of my sanity what he said is it possible that the modern penology is unknown to you do you suppose we practice the antiquated and ineffective method of shutting up the rascals sir the growth of the criminal element has as i said compelled the erection of more and larger prisons we have enough to hold comfortably all the honest men and women of the state within these protecting walls they carry on all the necessary vocations of life excepting commerce that is necessarily in the hands of the rogues as before  venerated representative of reform i exclaimed wringing his hand with effusion you are knowledge you are history you are the higher education we must talk further come let us enter this benign edifice you shall show me your dominion and instruct me in the rules you shall propose me as an inmate  i walked rapidly to the gate when challenged by the sentinel i turned to summon my instructor he was nowhere visible i turned again to look at the prison nothing was there desolate and forbidding as about the broken statue of ozymandias  the lone and level sands stretched far away     immortality   the desire for life everlasting has commonly been affirmed to be universalat least that is the view taken by those unacquainted with oriental faiths and with oriental character those of us whose knowledge is a trifle wider are not prepared to say that the desire is universal nor even general  if the devout buddhist for example wishes to live always he has not succeeded in very clearly formulating the desire the sort of thing that he is pleased to hope for is not what we should call life and not what many of us would care for  when a man says that everybody has a horror of annihilation we may be very sure that he has not many opportunities for observation or that he has not availed himself of all that he has most persons go to sleep rather gladly yet sleep is virtual annihilation while it lasts and if it should last forever the sleeper would be no worse off after a million years of it than after an hour of it there are minds sufficiently logical to think of it that way and to them annihilation is not a disagreeable thing to contemplate and expect  in this matter of immortality peoples beliefs appear to go along with their wishes the man who is content with annihilation thinks he will get it those that want immortality are pretty sure they are immortal and that is a very comfortable allotment of faiths the few of us that are left unprovided for are those who do not bother themselves much about the matter one way or another  the question of human immortality is the most momentous that the mind is capable of conceiving if it is a fact that the dead live all other facts are in comparison trivial and without interest the prospect of obtaining certain knowledge with regard to this stupendous matter is not encouraging in all countries but those in barbarism the powers of the profoundest and most penetrating intelligences have been ceaselessly addressed to the task of glimpsing a life beyond this life yet today no one can truly say that he knows it is as much a matter of faith as ever it was  our modern christian nations profess a passionate hope and belief in another world yet the most popular writer and speaker of his time the man whose lectures drew the largest audiences the work of whose pen brought him the highest rewards was he who most strenuously strove to destroy the ground of that hope and unsettle the foundations of that belief  the famous and popular frenchman professor of spectacular astronomy camille flammarion affirms immortality because he has talked with departed souls who said that it was true yes monsieur but surely you know the rule about hearsay evidence we anglosaxons are very particular about that  m flammarion says  i dont repudiate the presumptive arguments of schoolmen i merely supplement them with something positive for instance if you assumed the existence of god this argument of the scholastics is a good one god has implanted in all men the desire of perfect happiness this desire cannot be satisfied in our lives here if there were not another life wherein to satisfy it then god would be a deceiver voila tout  there is more the desire of perfect happiness does not imply immortality even if there is a god for  1 god may not have implanted it but merely suffers it to exist as he suffers sin to exist the desire of wealth the desire to live longer than we do in this world it is not held that god implanted all the desires of the human heart then why hold that he implanted that of perfect happiness  2 even if he dideven if a divinely implanted desire entail its own gratificationeven if it cannot be gratified in this lifethat does not imply immortality it implies only another life long enough for its gratification just once an eternity of gratification is not a logical inference from it  3 perhaps god is a deceiver who knows that he is not assumption of the existence of a god is one thing assumption of the existence of a god who is honorable and candid according to our conception of honor and candor is another  4 there may be an honorable and candid god he may have implanted in us the desire of perfect happiness it may beit isimpossible to gratify that desire in this life still another life is not implied for god may not have intended us to draw the inference that he is going to gratify it if omniscient and omnipotent god must be held to have intended whatever occurs but no such god is assumed in m flammarions illustration and it may be that gods knowledge and power are limited or that one of them is limited  m flammarion is a learned if somewhat theatrical astronomer he has a tremendous imagination which naturally is more at home in the marvelous and catastrophic than in the orderly regions of familiar phenomena to him the heavens are an immense pyrotechnicon and he is the master of the show and sets off the fireworks but he knows nothing of logic which is the science of straight thinking and his views of things have therefore no value they are nebulous  nothing is clearer than that our preexistence is a dream having absolutely no basis in anything that we know or can hope to know of afterexistence there is said to be evidence or rather testimony in assurances of those who are in present enjoyment of itif it is enjoyable whether this testimony has actually been givenand it is the only testimony worth a moments considerationis a disputed point many persons living this life profess to have received it but nobody professes or ever has professed to have received a communication of any kind from one in actual experience of the forelife the souls as yet ungarmented if such there are are dumb to question the land beyond the grave has been if not observed yet often and variously described if not explored and surveyed yet carefully charted from among so many accounts of it that we have he must be fastidious indeed who cannot be suited but of the fatherland that spreads before the cradlethe great heretofore wherein we all dwelt if we are to dwell in the hereafter we have no account nobody professes knowledge of that no testimony reaches our ears of flesh concerning its topographical or other features no one has been so enterprising as to wrest from its actual inhabitants any particulars of their character and appearance and among educated experts and professional proponents of worlds to be there is a general denial of its existence  i am of their way of thinking about that the fact that we have no recollection of a former life is entirely conclusive of the matter to have lived an unrecollected life is impossible and unthinkable for there would be nothing to connect the new life with the oldno thread of continuitynothing that persisted from the one life to the other the later birth would be that of another person an altogether different being unrelated to the firsta new john smith succeeding to the late tom jones  let us not be misled here by a false analogy today i may get a thwack o the mazzard which will give me an intervening season of unconsciousness between yesterday and tomorrow thereafter i may live to a green old age with no recollection of anything that i knew or did or was before the accident yet i shall be the same person for between the old life and the new there will be a nexus a thread of continuity something spanning the gulf from the one state to the other and the same in bothnamely my body with its habits capacities and powers that is i that identifies me to others as my former selfauthenticates and credentials me as the person that incurred the cranial mischance dislodging memory  but when death occurs all is dislodged if memory is for between two merely mental or spiritual existences memory is the only nexus conceivable consciousness of identity is the only identity to live again without memory of having lived before is to live another reexistence without recollection is absurd there is nothing to reexist     emancipated woman   what i should like to know is how the enlargement of womans sphere by her entrance into various activities of commercial professional and industrial life benefits the sex it may please helen gougar and satisfy her sense of logical accuracy to say as she does we women must work in order to fill the places left vacant by liquordrinking men but who filled these places before did they remain vacant or were there then disappointed applicants as now if my memory serves there has been no time in the period that it covers when the supply of workersabstemious male workerswas not in excess of the demand that it has always been so is sufficiently attested by the universally inadequate wage rate  employers seldom fail and never for long to get all the workmen they need the field into which women have put their sickles was already overcrowded with reapers whatever employment women have obtained has been got by displacing menwho would otherwise be supporting women where is the general advantage we may shout high tariff combination of capital demonetization of silver and what not but if searching for the cause of augmented poverty and crime industrial discontent and the tramp evil instead of dogmatically expounding it we should take some account of this enormous sudden addition to the number of workers seeking work if any one thinks that within the brief period of a generation the visible supply of labor can be enormously augmented without profoundly affecting the stability of things and disastrously touching the interests of wageworkers let no rude voice dispel his dream of such maleficent agencies as his slumbrous understanding may joy to affirm and let our widows of ashur unlung themselves in advocacy of quack remedies for evils of which themselves are cause it remains true that when the contention of two lions for one bone is exacerbated by the accession of a lioness the squabble is not composable by stirring up some bears in the cage adjacent  indubitably a woman is under no obligation to sacrifice herself to the good of her sex by foregoing needed employment in the hope that it may fall to a man gifted with dependent women nevertheless our congratulations are more intelligent when bestowed upon her individual head than when sifted into the hair of all eves daughters this is a world of complexities in which the lines of interest are so intertangled as frequently to transgress that of sex and one ambitious to help but half the race may profitably know that every effort to that end provokes a counterbalancing mischief the enlargement of womans opportunities has benefited individual women it has not benefited the sex as a whole and has distinctly damaged the race the mind that can not discern a score of great and irreparable general evils distinctly traceable to emancipation of woman is as impregnable to the light as a toad in a rock  a marked demerit of the new order of thingsthe régime of female commercial serviceis that its main advantage accrues not to the race not to the sex not to the class not to the individual woman but to the person of least need and worththe male employer female employers in any considerable number there will not be but those that we have could give the male ones profitable instruction in grinding the faces of their employees this constant increase of the army of laboralways and everywhere too large for the work in sightby accession of a new contingent of natural oppressibles makes the very teeth of old munniglut thrill with a poignant delight it brings in that situation known as two laborers seeking one joband one of them a person whose bones he can easily grind to make his bread and munniglut is a miller of skill and experience dusted all over with the evidence of his useful craft when heaven has assisted the daughters of hope to open to women a new avenue of opportunities the first to enter and walk therein like god in the garden of eden is the good mr munniglut contentedly smoothing the folds out of the superior slope of his paunch exuding the peculiar aroma of his oleaginous personality and larding the new roadway with the overflow of a righteousness stimulated to action by relish of his own identity and ever thereafter the subtle suggestion of a fat philistinism lingers along that path of progress like an assertion of a possessory right  it is gods own crystal truth that in dealing with women unfortunate enough to be compelled to earn their own living and fortunate enough to have wrested from fate an opportunity to do so men of business and affairs treat them with about the same delicate consideration that they show to dogs and horses of the inferior breeds it does not commonly occur to the wealthy professional man or prominent merchant to be ashamed to add to his yearly thousands a part of the salary justly due to his female bookkeeper or typewriter who sits before him all day with an empty belly in order to have an habilimented back he has a vague hazy notion that the law of supply and demand is mandatory and that in submitting himself to it by paying her a half of what he would have to pay a man of inferior efficiency he is supplying the world with a noble example of obedience i must take the liberty to remind him that the law of supply and demand is not imperative it is not a statute but a phenomenon he may reply it is imperative the penalty for disobedience is failure if i pay more in salaries and wages than i need to my competitor will not and with that advantage he will drive me from the field if his margin of profit is so small that he must eke it out by coining the sweat of his workwomen into nickels ive nothing to say to him let him adopt in peace the motto i cheat to eat i do not know why he should eat but nature who has provided sustenance for the worming sparrow the sparrowing owl and the owling eagle approves the needy man of prey and makes a place for him at table  human nature is pretty well balanced for every lacking virtue there is a rough substitute that will serve at a pinchas cunning is the wisdom of the unwise and ferocity the courage of the coward nobody is altogether bad the scoundrel who has grown rich by underpaying workmen in his factory will sometimes endow an asylum for indigent seamen to oppress ones own workmen and provide for the workmen of a neighborto skin those in charge of ones own interests while cottoning and oiling the residuary product of anothers skinnerythat is not very good benevolence nor very good sense but it serves in place of both the man who eats pâté de fois gras in the sweat of his girl cashiers face or wears purple and fine linen in order that his typewriter may have an eocene gown and a pliocene hat seems a tolerably satisfactory specimen of the genus thief but let us not forget that in his own homea fairly good onehe may enjoy and merit that highest and most honorable title on the scroll of womans favor a good provider one having a claim to that glittering distinction should enjoy immunity from the coarse and troublesome question from whose backs and bellies do you provide  so much for the material results to the sex what are the moral results one does not like to speak of them particularly to those who do not and can not knowto good women in whose innocent minds female immorality is inseparable from flashy gowning and the painted face to foolish booktaught men who honestly believe in some protective sanctity that hedges womanhood if men of the world with years enough to have lived out of the old régime into the new would testify in this matter there would ensue a great rattling of dry bones in bodices of reformladies nay if the young man about town knowing nothing of how things were in the dark backward and absym of time but something of the moral distance between even so freerunning a creature as the society girl and the average working girl of the factory the shop and the office would speak out under assurance of immunity from prosecution his testimony would be a surprise to the cartilaginous virgins blowsy matrons acrid relicts and hairy males of emancipation it would pain too some very worthy but unobservant persons not in sympathy with the cause  certain significant facts are within the purview of all but the very young and the comfortably blind to the woman of today the man of today is imperfectly polite in place of reverence he gives her deference to the language of compliment has succeeded the language of raillery men have almost forgotten how to bow doubtless the advanced female prefers the new manner as may some of her less forward sisters thinking it more sincere it is not our giddy grandfather talked highflown nonsense because his heart had tangled his tongue he treated his woman more civilly than we ours because he loved her better he never had seen her on the rostrum and in the lobby never had heard her in advocacy of herself never had read her confessions of his sins never had felt the stress of her competition nor himself assisted by daily personal contact in rubbing the bloom off her he did not know that her virtues were due to her secluded life but thought dear old boy that they were a gift of god     a mad world   let us suppose that in tracing its cycloidal curves through the unthinkable reaches of space traversed by the solar system our planet should pass through a belt of attenuated matter having the property of dementing us it is a conception easily enough entertained that space is full of malign conditions incontinuously distributed that we are at one time traversing a zone comparatively innocuous and at another spinning through a region of infection that away behind us in the wake of our swirling flight are fields of plague and pain still agitated by our passage through themall this is as good as known it is almost as certain as it is that in our little annual circle round the sun are points at which we are stoned and brickbatted like a pig in a potatopatchpelted with little nodules of meteoric metal flung like gravel and bombarded with gigantic masses hurled by god knows what what strange adventures await us in those yet untraveled regions toward which we speedinto what malign conditions may we not at any time plungeto the strength and stress of what frightful environment may we not at last succumb the subject lends itself readily enough to a jest but i am not jesting it is really altogether probable that our solar system racing through space with inconceivable velocity will one day enter a region charged with something deleterious to the human brain minding us all madwise  by the way dear reader did you ever happen to consider the possibility that you are a lunatic and perhaps confined in an asylum it seems to you that you are notthat you go with freedom where you will and use a sweet reasonableness in all your works and ways but to many a lunatic it seems that

achievement and i am proud of it but the mental feat in which i take most satisfaction and which i doubt not is most diverting to my keepers is that of creating mr wr hearst pointing his eyes toward the white house and endowing him with a perilous jacksonian ambition to defile it the hearst is distinctly a treasure  on the whole i have done i think tolerably well and when i contemplate the
