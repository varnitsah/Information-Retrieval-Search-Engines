saguenay boat which had been advertised to leave quebec at seven oclock on tuesday morning miss kitty ellison sat tranquilly expectant of the joys which its departure should bring and tolerantly patient of its delay for if all the saguenay had not been in promise she would have thought it the greatest happiness just to have that prospect of the st lawrence and quebec the sun shone with a warm yellow light on the upper town with its girdle of gray wall and on the red flag that drowsed above the citadel and was a friendly lustre on the tinned roofs of the lower town while away off to the south and east and west wandered the purple hills and the farmlit plains in such dewy shadow and effulgence as would have been enough to make the heaviest heart glad near at hand the river was busy with every kind of craft and in the distance was mysterious with silvery vapors little breaths of haze like an ethereal colorless flame exhaled from its surface and it all glowed with a lovely inner radiance in the middle distance a black ship was heaving anchor and setting sail and the voice of the seamen came soft and sad and yet wildly hopeful to the dreamy ear of the young girl whose soul at once went round the world before the ship and then made haste back again to the promenade of the saguenay boat she sat leaning forward a little with her hands fallen into her lap letting her unmastered thoughts play as they would in memories and hopes around the consciousness that she was the happiest girl in the world and blest beyond desire or desert to have left home as she had done equipped for a single day at niagara and then to have come adventurously on by grace of her cousins wardrobe as it were to montreal and quebec to be now going up the saguenay and finally to be destined to return home by way of boston and new yorkthis was more than any one human being had a right to and as she had written home to the girls she felt that her privileges ought to be divided up among all the people of eriecreek she was very grateful to colonel ellison and fanny for affording her these advantages but they being now out of sight in pursuit of staterooms she was not thinking of them in relation to her pleasure in the morning scene but was rather regretting the absence of a lady with whom they had travelled from niagara and to whom she imagined she would that moment like to say something in praise of the prospect this lady was a mrs basil march of boston and though it was her wedding journey and her husbands presence ought to have absorbed her she and miss kitty had sworn a sisterhood and were pledged to see each other before long at mrs marchs home in boston in her absence now kitty thought what a very charming person she was and wondered if all boston people were really like her so easy and friendly and hearty in her letter she had told the girls to tell her uncle jack that he had not rated boston people a bit too high if she were to judge from mr and mrs march and that she was sure they would help her as far as they could to carry out his instructions when she got to boston  these instructions were such as might seem preposterous if no more particular statement in regard to her uncle jack were made but will be imaginable enough i hope when he is a little described the ellisons were a west virginia family who had wandered up into a corner of northwestern new york because dr ellison unceremoniously known to kitty as uncle jack was too much an abolitionist to live in a slaveholding state with safety to himself or comfort to his neighbors here his family of three boys and two girls had grown up and hither in time had come kitty the only child of his youngest brother who had gone first to illinois and thence from the pretty constant adversity of a country editor to kansas where he joined the free state party and fell in one of the border feuds her mother had died soon after find dr ellisons heart bowed itself tenderly over the orphan she was something not only dear but sacred to him as the child of a martyr to the highest cause on earth and the love of the whole family encompassed her one of the boys had brought her from kansas when she was yet very little and she had grown up among them as their youngest sister but the doctor from a tender scruple against seeming to usurp the place of his brother in her childish thought would not let her call him father and in obedience to the rule which she soon began to give their love they all turned and called him uncle jack with her yet the ellisons though they loved their little cousin did not spoil herneither the doctor nor his great grownup sons whom she knew as the boys nor his daughters whom she called the girls though they were wellnigh women when she came to them she was her uncles pet and most intimate friend riding with him on his professional visits till she became as familiar a feature of his equipage as the doctors horse itself and he educated her in those extreme ideas tempered by humor which formed the character of himself and his family they loved kitty and played with her and laughed at her when she needed ridiculing they made a jest of their father on the one subject on which he never jested and even the antislavery cause had its droll points turned to the light they had seen danger and trouble enough at different times in its service but no enemy ever got more amusement out of it their house was a principal entrep√¥t of the underground railroad and they were always helping anxious travellers over the line but the boys seldom came back from an excursion to canada without adventures to keep the family laughing for a week and they made it a serious business to study the comic points of their beneficiaries who severally lived in the family records by some grotesque mental or physical trait they had an irreverent name among themselves for each of the humorless abolition lecturers who unfailingly abode with them on their rounds and these brethren and sisters as they called them paid with whatever was laughable in them for the substantial favors they received  miss kitty having the same natural bent began even as a child to share in these harmless reprisals and to look at life with the same wholesomely fantastic vision but she remembered one abolition visitor of whom none of them made fun but treated with a serious distinction and regardan old man with a high narrow forehead and thereon a thick upright growth of gray hair who looked at her from under bushy brows with eyes as of blue flame and took her on his knee one night and sang to her blow ye the trumpet blow he and her uncle had been talking of some indefinite faroff place that they called boston in terms that commended it to her childish apprehension as very little less holy than jerusalem and as the home of all the good and great people outside of palestine  in fact boston had always been dr ellisons foible in the beginning of the great antislavery agitation he had exchanged letters corresponded he used to say with john quincy adams on the subject of lovejoys murder and he had met several boston men at the free soil convention in buffalo in 1848 a little formal perhaps a little reserved he would say but excellent men polished and certainly of sterling principle which would make his boys and girls laugh as they grew older and sometimes provoke them to highly colored dramatizations of the formality of these bostonians in meeting their father the years passed and the boys went west and when the war came they took service in iowa and wisconsin regiments by and by the presidents proclamation of freedom to the slaves reached eriecreek while dick and bob happened both to be home on leave after they had allowed their sire his rapture well this is a great blow for father said bob what are you going to do now father fugitive slavery and all its charms blotted out forever at one fell swoop pretty rough on you isnt it no more men and brothers no more soulless oligarchy dull lookout father  o no insinuated one of the girls theres boston  why yes cried dick to be sure there is the president hasnt abolished boston live for boston  and the doctor did live for an ideal boston thereafter so far at least as concerned a neverrelinquished neverfulfilled purpose of some day making a journey to boston but in the mean time there were other things and at present since the proclamation had given him a country worth living in he was ready to honor her by studying her antiquities in his youth before his mind had been turned so strenuously to the consideration of slavery he had a pretty taste for the mystery of the mound builders and each of his boys now returned to camp with instructions to note any phenomena that would throw light upon this interesting subject they would have abundant leisure for research since the proclamation dr ellison insisted practically ended the war  the mound builders were only a startingpoint for the doctor he advanced from them to historical times in due course and it happened that when colonel ellison and his wife stopped off at eriecreek on their way east in 1870 they found him deep in the history of the old french war as yet the colonel had not intended to take the canadian route eastward and he escaped without the charges which he must otherwise have received to look up the points of interest at montreal and quebec connected with that ancient struggle he and his wife carried kitty with them to see niagara which she had never seen because it was so near but no sooner had dr ellison got the despatch announcing that they would take kitty on with them down the st lawrence to quebec and bring her home by way of boston than he sat down and wrote her a letter of the most comprehensive character as far as concerned canada his mind was purely historical but when it came to boston it was strangely reabolitionized and amidst an ardor for the antiquities of the place his old love for its humanitarian preeminence blazed up he would have her visit faneuil hall because of its revolutionary memories but not less because wendell phillips had there made his first antislavery speech she was to see the collections of the massachusetts historical society and if possible certain points of ancient colonial interest which he named but at any rate she was somehow to catch sight of the author of the biglow papers of senator sumner of mr whittier of dr howe of colonel higginson and of mr garrison these people were all bostonians to the idealizing remoteness of dr ellison and he could not well conceive of them asunder he perhaps imagined that kitty was more likely to see them together than separately and perhaps indeed they were less actual persons to his admiration than so many figures of a grand historical composition finally i want you to remember my dear child he wrote that in boston you are not only in the birthplace of american liberty but the yet holier scene of its resurrection there everything that is noble and grand and liberal and enlightened in the national life has originated and i cannot doubt that you will find the character of its people marked by every attribute of a magnanimous democracy if i could envy you anything my dear girl i should envy you this privilege of seeing a city where man is valued simply and solely for what he is in himself and where color wealth family occupation and other vulgar and meretricious distinctions are wholly lost sight of in the consideration of individual excellence  kitty got her uncles letter the night before starting up the saguenay and quite too late for compliance with his directions concerning quebec but she resolved that as to boston his wishes should be fulfilled to the utmost limit of possibility she knew that nice mr march must be acquainted with some of those very people kitty had her uncles letter in her pocket and she was just going to take it out and read it again when something else attracted her notice  the boat had been advertised to leave at seven oclock and it was now half past a party of english people were pacing somewhat impatiently up and down before kitty for it had been made known among the passengers by that subtle process through which matters of public interest transpire in such places that breakfast would not be served till the boat started and these english people had the appetites which go before the admirable digestions of their nation but they had also the good temper which does not so certainly accompany the insular good appetite the man in his dashing glengarry cap and his somewhat shabby gray suit took on one arm the plain jolly woman who seemed to be his wife and on the other the amiable handsome young girl who looked enough like him to be his sister and strode rapidly back and forth saying that they must get up an appetite for breakfast this made the women laugh and so he said it again which made them laugh so much that the elder lost her balance and in regaining it twisted off her high shoeheel which she briskly tossed into the river but she sat down after that and the three were presently intent upon the liverpool steamer which was just arrived and was now gliding up to her dock with her population of passengers thronging her quarterdeck  shes from england said the husband expressively  only fancy answered the wife give me the glass jenny then after a long survey of the steamer she added fancy her being from england they all looked and said nothing for two or three minutes when the wifes mind turned to the delay of their own boat and of breakfast this thing she said with that air of uttering a novelty which the english cast about their commonplacesthis this thing doesnt start at seven you know  no replied the younger woman she waits for the montreal boat  fancy her being from england said the other whose eyes and thoughts had both wandered back to the liverpool steamer  theres the montreal boat now comin round the point cried the husband dont you see the steam he pointed with his glass and then studied the white cloud in the distance no by jove its a sawmill on the shore  o harry sighed both the women reproachfully  why deuce take it you know he retorted i didnt turn it into a sawmill its been a sawmill all along i fancy  half an hour later when the montreal boat came in sight the women would have her a sawmill till she stood in full view in midchannel their own vessel paddled out into the stream as she drew near and the two bumped and rubbed together till a gangway plank could he passed from one to the other a very well dressed young man stood ready to get upon the saguenay boat with a porter beside him bearing his substantial valise no one else apparently was coming aboard  the english people looked upon him for an instant with wrathful eyes as they hung over the rail of the promenade upon my word said the elder of the women have we been waitin all this time for one man  hush edith answered the younger its an englishman and they all three mutely recognized the right of the englishman to stop not only the boat but the whole solar system if his ticket entitled him to a passage on any particular planet while mr miles arbuton of boston massachusetts passed at his ease from one vessel to the other he had often been mistaken for an englishman and the error of those spectators if he had known it would not have surprised him perhaps it might have softened his judgment of them as he sat facing them at breakfast but he did not know it and he thought them three very common english people with something professional as of public singing or acting about them the young girl wore instead of a travellingsuit a vivid light blue dress and over her skyblue eyes and fresh cheeks a glory of corncolored hair lay in great braids and masses it was magnificent but it wanted distance so near it was almost harsh mr arbutons eyes fell from the face to the vivid blue dress which was not quite fresh and not quite new and a glimmer of cold dismissal came into them as he gave himself entirely to the slender merits of the steamboat breakfast  he was himself meantime an object of interest to a young lady who sat next to the english party and who glanced at him from time to time out of tender gray eyes with a furtive play of feeling upon a sensitive face to her he was that divine possibility which every young man is to every young maiden and besides he was invested with a halo of romance as the gentleman with the blond mustache whom she had seen at niagara the week before on the goat island bridge to the pretty matron at her side he was exceedingly handsome as a young man may frankly be to a young matron but not otherwise comparable to her husband the fullpersoned goodhumored looking gentleman who had just added sausage to the ham and eggs on his plate he was handsome too but his full beard was reddish whereas mr arbutons mustache was flaxen and his dress was not worn with that scrupulosity with which the bostonian bore his clothes there was a touch of slovenliness in him that scarcely consorted with the alert exmilitary air of some of his movements goodlooking young john bull he thought concerning mr arbuton and then thought no more about him being no more selfjudged before the supposed englishman than he would have been before so much frenchman or spaniard mr arbuton on the other hand if he had met an englishman so well dressed as himself must at once have arraigned himself and had himself tacitly tried for his personal and national difference he looked in his turn at these people and thought he should have nothing to do with them in spite of the longlashed gray eyes  it was not that they had made the faintest advance towards acquaintance or that the choice of knowing them or not was with mr arbuton but he had the habit of thus protecting himself from the chances of life and a conscience against encouraging people whom he might have to drop for reasons of society this was sometimes a sacrifice for he was not past the age when people take a lively interest in most other human beings when breakfast was over and he had made the tour of the boat and seen all his fellowpassengers he perceived that he could have little in common with any of them and that probably the journey would require the full exercise of that tolerant spirit in which he had undertaken a branch of summer travel in his native land  the rush of air against the steamer was very raw and chill and the forward promenade was left almost entirely to the english professional people who walked rapidly up and down with jokes and laughter of their kind while the wind blew the girls hair in loose gold about her fresh face and twisted her blue drapery tight about her comely shape when they got out of breath they sat down beside a large american lady with a great deal of gold filling in her front teeth and presently rose again and ran races to and from the bow mr arbuton turned away in displeasure at the stern he found a much larger company most of whom had furnished themselves with novels and magazines from the stock on board and were drowsing over them one gentleman was reading aloud to three ladies the newspaper account of a dreadful shipwreck other ladies and gentlemen were coming and going forever from their staterooms as the wont of some is others yet sat with closed eyes as if having come to see the saguenay they were resolved to see nothing of the st lawrence on the way thither but would keep their vision sacred to the wonders of the former river  yet the st lawrence was worthy to be seen as even mr arbuton owned whose way was to slight american scenery in distinction from his countrymen who boast it the finest in the world as you leave quebec with its muralcrowned and castled rock and drop down the stately river presently the snowy fall of montmorenci far back in its purple hollow leaps perpetual avalanche into the abyss and then you are abreast of the beautiful isle of orleans whose low shores with their expanses of farmland and their groves of pine and oak are still as lovely as when the wild grape festooned the primitive forests and won from the easy rapture of old cartier the name of isle of bacchus for two hours farther down the river either shore is bright and populous with the continuous villages of the habitans each clustering about its slimspired church in its shallow vale by the waters edge or lifted in more eminent picturesqueness upon some gentle height the banks nowhere lofty or abrupt are such as in a southern land some majestic river might flow between wide slumbrous open to all the heaven and the long day till the very set of sun but no starry palm glasses its crest in the clear cold green from these low brinks the pale birch slender and delicately fair mirrors here the wintry whiteness of its boughs and this is the sad great river of the awful north  gradually as the day wore on the hills which had shrunk almost out of sight on one hand and on the other were dark purple in the distance drew near the shore and at one point on the northern side rose almost from the waters edge the river expanded into a lake before them and in their lap some cottages and halfway up the hillside among the stunted pines a muchgalleried hotel proclaimed a resort of fashion in the heart of what seemed otherwise a wilderness indian huts sheathed in birchbark nestled at the foot of the rocks which were rich in orange and scarlet stains out of the tops of the huts curled the blue smoke and at the door of one stood a squaw in a flamered petticoat others in bright shawls squatted about on the rocks each with a circle of dogs and papooses but all this warmth of color only served like a winter sunset to heighten the chilly and desolate sentiment of the scene the light dresses of the ladies on the veranda struck cold upon the eye in the faces of the sojourners who lounged idly to the steamers landingplace the passenger could fancy a sad resolution to repress their tears when the boat should go away and leave them she put off two or three old peasantwomen who were greeted by other such on the pier as if returned from a long journey and then the crew discharged the vessel of a prodigious freight of onions which formed the sole luggage these old women had brought from quebec bale after bale of the pungent bulbs were borne ashore in the careful arms of the deckhands and counted by the owners at last order was given to draw in the plank when a passionate cry burst from one of the old women who extended both hands with an imploring gesture towards the boat a bale of onions had been left aboard a deckhand seized it and ran quickly ashore with it and then back again followed by the benedictions of the tranquillized and comforted beldam the gay sojourners at murray bay controlled their grief and as mr arbuton turned from them the boat pushing out left them to their fashionable desolation she struck across to the southern shore to land passengers for cacouna a wateringplace greater than murray bay the tide which rises fifteen feet at quebec is the impulse not the savor of the sea but at cacouna the water is salt and the seabathing lacks nothing but the surf and hither resort in great numbers the canadians who fly their cities during the fierce brief fever of the northern summer the wateringplace village and hotel is not in sight from the landing but as at murray bay the sojourners thronged the pier as if the arrival of the steamboat were the great event of their day that afternoon they were in unusual force having come on foot and by omnibus and calash and presently there passed down through their ranks a strange procession with a band of music leading the way to the steamer  its an indian wedding mr arbuton heard one of the boats officers saying to the gentleman with the exmilitary air who stood next him beside the rail and now the band having drawn aside he saw the bride and groomthe latter a common stolidfaced savage and the former pretty and almost white with a certain modesty and sweetness of mien before them went a young american with a jaunty scotch cap and a visage of supernatural gravity as the master of ceremonies which he had probably planned arm in arm with him walked a portly chieftain in black broadcloth preposterously adorned on the breast with broad flat disks of silver in two rows behind the bridal couple came the whole village in pairs men and women and children of all ages even to brown babies in arms gay in dress and indescribably serious in demeanor they were mated in some sort according to years and size and the last couple were young fellows paired in an equal tipsiness these reeled and wavered along the pier and when the other wedding guests crowned the days festivity by going aboard the steamer they followed dizzily down the gangway midway they lurched heavily the spectators gave a cry but they had happily lurched in opposite directions their grip upon each others arms held and a forward stagger launched them victoriously aboard in a heap they had scarcely disappeared from sight when having as it were instantly satisfied their curiosity concerning the boat the other guests began to go ashore in due order mr arbuton waited in a slight anxiety to see whether the tipsy couple could repeat their maneuver successfully on an upward incline and they had just appeared on the gangway when he felt a hand passed carelessly and as if unconsciously through his arm and at the same moment a voice said those are a pair of disappointed lovers i suppose  he looked round and perceived the young lady of the party he had made up his mind to have nothing to do with resting one hand on the rail and sustaining herself with the other passed through his arm while she was altogether intent upon the scene below the exmilitary gentleman the head of the party and apparently her kinsman had stepped aside without her knowing and she had unwittingly taken mr arbutons arm so much was clear to him but what he was to do was not so plain it did not seem quite his place to tell her of her mistake and yet it seemed a piece of unfairness not to do so to leave the matter alone however was the simplest safest and pleasantest for the pressure of the pretty figure lightly thrown upon his arm had something agreeably confiding and appealing in it so he waited till the young lady turning to him for some response discovered her error and disengaged herself with a face of mingled horror and amusement even then he had no inspiration to speak of the mistake in tones of compliment would have been grossly out of place an explanation was needless and to her murmured excuses he could only bow silently she flitted into the cabin and he walked away leaving the indians to stagger ashore as they might his arm seemed still to sustain that elastic weight and a voice haunted his ear with the words a pair of disappointed lovers i suppose and still more awkward and stupid he felt his own part in the affair to be though at the same time he was not without some obscure resentment of the young girls mistake as an intrusion upon him  it was late twilight when the boat reached tadoussac and ran into a sheltered cove under the shadow of uplands on which a quaint village perched and dispersed itself on a country road in summer cottages above these in turn rose loftier heights of barren sand or rock with here and there a rank of sickly pines dying along their sterility it had been harsh and cold all day when the boat moved for it was running full in the face of the northeast the river had widened almost to a sea growing more and more desolate with a few lonely islands breaking its expanse and the shores sinking lower and lower till near tadoussac they rose a little in flattopped bluffs thickly overgrown with stunted evergreens here into the vast lowwalled breadth of the st lawrence a dark stream narrowly bordered by rounded heights of rock steals down from the north out of regions of gloomy and everduring solitude this is the saguenay and in the cold evening light under which the traveller approaches its mouth no landscape could look more forlorn than that of tadoussac where early in the sixteenth century the french traders fixed their first post and where still the oldest church north of florida is standing  the steamer lies here five hours and supper was no sooner over than the passengers went ashore in the gathering dusk mr arbuton guarding his distance as usual went too with a feeling of surprise at his own concession to the popular impulse he was not without a desire to see the old church wondering in a halfcompassionate way what such a bit of american antiquity would look like and he had perceived since the little embarrassment at cacouna that he was a discomfort to the young lady involved by it he had caught no glimpse of her till supper and then she had briefly supped with an air of such studied unconsciousness of his presence that it was plain she was thinking of her mistake every moment well ill leave her the freedom of the boat while we stay thought mr arbuton as he went ashore he had not the least notion whither the road led but like the rest he followed it up through the village and on among the cottages which seemed for the most part empty and so down a gloomy ravine in the bottom of which far beneath the tremulous rustic bridge he heard the mysterious crash and fall of an unseen torrent before him towered the shadowy hills up into the starless night he thrilled with a sense of the loneliness and remoteness and he had a formless wish that some one qualified by the proper associations and traditions were there to share the satisfaction he felt in the whole effect at the same instant he was once more aware of that delicate pressure that weight so lightly sweetly borne upon his arm it startled him and again he followed the road which with a sudden turn brought him in sight of a hotel and in sound of a bowlingalley and therein young ladies cackle and laughter and he wondered a little scornfully who could be spending the summer there a bay of the river loftily shut in by rugged hills lay before him and on the shore just above hightide stood what a wandering shadow told him was the ancient church of tadoussac the windows were faintly tinged with red as from a single taper burning within and but that the elements were a little too bare and simple for one so used to the rich effects of the old world mr arbuton might have been touched by the vigil which this poor chapel was still keeping after three hundred years in the heart of that gloomy place while he stood at least tolerating its appeal he heard voices of people talking in the obscurity near the church door which they seemed to have been vainly trying for entrance  pity we cant see the inside isnt it  yes but i am so glad to see any of it just think of its having been built in the seventeenth century  uncle jack would enjoy it wouldnt he  o yes poor uncle jack i feel somehow as if i were cheating him out of it he ought to be here in my place but i do like it and dick i dont know what i can ever say or do to you and fanny for bringing me  well kitty postpone the subject till you can think of the right thing were in no hurry  mr arbuton heard a shaking of the door as of a final attempt upon it before retreat and then the voices faded into inarticulate sounds in the darkness they were the voices he easily recognized of the young lady who had taken his arm and of that kinsman of hers as she seemed to be he blamed himself for having not only overheard them but for desiring to hear more of their talk and he resolved to follow them back to the boat at a discreet distance but they loitered so at every point or he unwittingly made such haste that he had overtaken them as they entered the lane between the outlying cottages and he could not help being privy to their talk again  well it may be old kitty but i dont think its lively  it isnt exactly a whirl of excitement i must confess  its the deadliest place i ever saw is that a swing in front of that cottage no its a gibbet why theyve all got em i suppose theyre for the summer tenants at the close of the season what a rush there would be for them if the boat should happen to go off and leave her passengers  mr arbuton thought this rather a coarse kind of drolling and strengthened himself anew in his resolution to avoid those people  they now came in sight of the steamer where in the cove she lay illumined with all her lamps and through every window and door and crevice was bursting with the ruddy light her brilliancy contrasted vividly with the obscurity and loneliness of the shore where a few lights glimmered in the village houses and under the porch of the village store some desolate idlershabitans and halfbreedshad clubbed their miserable leisure beyond the steamer yawned the wide vacancy of the greater river and out of this gloomed the course of the saguenay  o i hate to go on board said the young lady do you think hes got back yet its perfect misery to meet him  never mind kitty he probably thinks you didnt mean anything by it i dont believe you would have taken his arm if you hadnt supposed it was mine any way  she made no answer to this as if too much overcome by the true state of the case to be troubled by its perversion mr arbuton following them on board felt himself in the unpleasant character of persecutor some one to be shunned and escaped by every maneuver possible to selfrespect he was to be the means it appeared of spoiling the enjoyment of the voyage for one who he inferred had not often the opportunity of such enjoyment he had a willingness that she should think well and not ill of him and then at the bottom of all was a sentiment of superiority which if he had given it shape would have been noblesse oblige some action was due to himself as a gentleman  the young lady went to seek the matron of the party and left her companion at the door of the saloon wistfully fingering a cigar in one hand and feeling for a match with the other presently he gave himself a clap on the waistcoat which he had found empty and was turning away when mr arbuton said offering his own lighted cigar may i be of use to you  the other took it with a hearty o yes thank you and with many inarticulate murmurs of satisfaction lighted his cigar and returned mr arbutons with a brisk halfmilitary bow  mr arbuton looked at him narrowly a moment im afraid he said abruptly that ive most unluckily been the cause of annoyance to one of the ladies of your party it isnt a thing to apologize for and i hardly know how to say that i hope if shes not already forgotten the matter shell do so saying this mr arbuton by an impulse which he would have been at a loss to explain offered his card  his action had the effect of frankness and the other took it for cordiality he drew near a lamp and looked at the name and street address on the card and then said ah of boston my name is ellison im of milwaukee wisconsin and he laughed a free trustful laugh of good companionship why yes my cousins been tormenting herself about her mistake the whole afternoon but of course its all right you know bless my heart it was the most natural thing in the world have you been ashore theres a good deal of repose about tadoussac now but it must be a lively place in winter such a cheerful lookout from these cottages or that hotel over yonder we went over to see if we could get into the little old church the purser told me there are some lead tablets there left by jacques cartiers men you know and dug up in the neighborhood i dont think its likely and im bearing up very well under the disappointment of not getting in ive done my duty by the antiquities of the place and now i dont care how soon we are off  colonel ellison was talking in the kindness of his heart to change the subject which the younger gentleman had introduced in the belief which would scarcely have pleased the other that he was much embarrassed his goodnature went still further and when his cousin returned presently with mrs ellison he presented mr arbuton to the ladies and then thoughtfully made mrs ellison walk up and down the deck with him for the exercise she would not take ashore that the others might be left to deal with their vexation alone  i am very sorry miss ellison said mr arbuton to have been the means of a mistake to you today  and i was dreadfully ashamed to make you the victim of my blunder answered miss ellison penitently and a little silence ensued then as if she had suddenly been able to alienate the case and see it apart from herself in its unmanageable absurdity she broke into a confiding laugh very like her cousins and said why its one of the most hopeless things i ever heard of i dont see what in the world can be done about it  it is rather a difficult matter and im not prepared to say myself before i make up my mind i should like it to happen again  mr arbuton had no sooner made this speech which he thought neat than he was vexed with himself for having made it since nothing was further from his purpose than a flirtation but the dark vicinity the young girls prettiness the apparent freshness and reliance on his sympathy from which her frankness came were too much he tried to congeal again and ended in some feebleness about the scenery which was indeed very lonely and wild after the boat started up the saguenay leaving the few lights of tadoussac to blink and fail behind her he had an absurd sense of being alone in the world there with the young lady and he suffered himself to enjoy the situation which was as perfectly safe as anything could be he and miss ellison had both come on from niagara it seemed and they talked of that place she consciously withholding the fact that she had noticed mr arbuton there they had both come down the rapids of the st lawrence and they had both stopped a day in montreal these common experiences gave them a surprising interest for each other which was enhanced by the discovery that their experiences differed thereafter and that whereas she had passed three days at quebec he as we know had come on directly from montreal  did you enjoy quebec very much miss ellison  o yes indeed its a beautiful old town with everything in it that i had always read about and never expected to see you know its a walled city  yes but i confess i had forgotten it till this morning did you find it all that you expected a walled city to be  more if possible there were some boston people with us there and they said it was exactly like europe they fairly sighed over it and it seemed to remind them of pretty nearly everything they had seen abroad they were just married  did that make quebec look like europe  no but i suppose it made them willing to see it in the pleasantest light mrs marchthat was their namewouldnt allow me to say that i enjoyed quebec because if i hadnt seen europe i couldnt properly enjoy it you may think you enjoy it she was always saying but thats merely fancy still i cling to my delusion but i dont know whether i cared more for quebec or the beautiful little villages in the country all about it the whole landscape looks just like a dream of evangeline  indeed i must certainly stop at quebec i should like to see an american landscape that put one in mind of anything what can your imagination do for the present scenery  i dont think it needs any help from me replied the young girl as if the tone of her companion had patronized and piqued her she turned as she spoke and looked up the sad lonely river the moon was making its veiled face seen through the gray heaven and touching the black stream with hints of melancholy light on either hand the uninhabitable shore rose in desolate grandeur friendless heights of rock with a thin covering of pines seen in dim outline along their tops and deepening into the solid dark of hollows and ravines upon their sides the cry of some wild bird struck through the silence of which the noise of the steamer had grown to be a part and echoed away to nothing then from the saloon there came on a sudden the notes of a song and miss ellison led the way within where most of the other passengers were grouped about the piano the english girl with the corncolored hair sat in ravishing picture at the instrument and the commonish man and his very plain wife were singing with heavenly sweetness together  isnt it beautiful said miss ellison how nice it must be to be able to do such things  yes do you think so its rather public answered her companion  when the english people had ended a grave elderly canadian gentleman sat down to give what he believed a comic song and sent everybody disconsolate to bed  well kitty cried mrs ellison shutting herself inside the young ladys stateroom a moment  well fanny  isnt he handsome  he is indeed  is he nice  i dont know  sweet  icecream said kitty and placidly let herself be kissed an enthusiastic goodnight before mrs ellison slept she wished to ask her husband one question  what is it  should you want kitty to marry a bostonian they say bostonians are so cold  what bostonian has been asking kitty to marry him  o how spiteful you are i didnt say any had but if there should  then itll be time to think about it youve married kitty right and left to everybody whos looked at her since we left niagara and ive worried myself to death investigating the character of her husbands now im not going to do it any longertill she has an offer  very well you can depreciate your own cousin if you like but i know what i shall do i shall let her wear all my best things how fortunate it is richard that were exactly of a size o i am so glad we brought kitty along if she should marry and settle down in bostonno i hope she could get her husband to live in new york  go on go on my dear cried colonel ellison with a groan of despair kitty has talked twentyfive minutes with this young man about the hotels and steamboats and of course hell be round tomorrow morning asking my consent to marry her as soon as we can get to a justice of the peace my hair is gradually turning gray and i shall be bald before my time but i dont mind that if you find any pleasure in these little hallucinations of yours go on     ii  mrs ellisons little maneuvre   the next morning our tourists found themselves at rest in haha bay at the head of navigation for the larger steamers the long line of sullen hills had fallen away and the morning sun shone warm on what in a friendlier climate would have been a very lovely landscape the bay was an irregular oval with shores that rose in bold but not lofty heights on one side while on the other lay a narrow plain with two villages clinging about the road that followed the crescent beach and lifting each the slender tinclad spire of its church to sparkle in the sun  at the head of the bay was a mountainous top and along its waters were masses of rocks gayly painted with lichens and stained with metallic tints of orange and scarlet the unchanging growth of stunted pines was the only forest in sight though haha bay is a famous lumbering port and some schooners now lay there receiving cargoes of odorous pine plank the steamboatwharf was all astir with the liveliest toil and leisure the boat was taking on wood which was brought in wheelbarrows to the top of the steep smooth gangwayplanking where the habitant in charge planted his broad feet for the downward slide and was hurled aboard more or less en masse by the fierce velocity of his heavyladen wheelbarrow amidst the confusion and hazard of this feat a procession of other habitans marched aboard each one bearing under his arm a coffinshaped wooden box the rising fear of colonel ellison that these boxes represented the loss of the whole infant population of haha bay was checked by the reflection that the region could not have produced so many children and calmed altogether by the purser who said that they were full of huckleberries and that colonel ellison could have as many as he liked for fifteen cents a bushel this gave him a keen sense of the poverty of the land and he bought of the boys who came aboard such abundance of wild red raspberries in all manner of birchbark canoes and goblets and cornucopias that he was obliged to make presents of them to the very dealers whose stock he had exhausted and he was in treaty with the local halfwitvery fine with a hunchback and a massive wen on one side of his headto take charity in the wild fruits of his native province when the crowd about him was gently opened by a person who advanced with a flourishing bow and a sprightly good morning good morning sir how do you do asked colonel ellison but the other intent on business answered i am the only person at haha bay who speaks english and i have come to ask if you would not like to make a promenade in my horse and buggy upon the mountain before breakfast you shall be gone as long as you will for one shilling and sixpence i will show you all that there is to be seen about the place and the beautiful view of the bay from the top of the mountain but it is elegant you know i can assure you  the speaker was so fluent of his english he had such an audacious widebranching mustache such a twinkle in his left eyewhich wore its lid in a careless slouching fashionthat the heart of man naturally clove to him and colonel ellison agreed on the spot to make the proposed promenade for himself and both his ladies of whom he went joyfully in search he found them at the stern of the boat admiring the wild scenery and looking      fresh as the morn and as the season fair  he was not a close observer and of his wifes wardrobe he had the ignorance of a good husband who as soon as the pang of paying for her dresses is past forgets whatever she has but he could not help seeing that some gayeties of costume which he had dimly associated with his wife now enhanced the charms of his cousins nice little face and figure a scarf of lively hue carelessly tied about the throat to keep off the morning chill a prettier ribbon a more stylish jacket than miss ellison ownedwhat do i knowan air of preparation for battle caught the colonels eye and a conscious red stole responsive into kittys cheek  kitty said he dont you let yourself be made a goose of  i hope she wontby you retorted his wife and ill thank you colonel ellison not to be a betty whatever you are i dont think its manly to be always noticing ladies clothes  who said anything about clothes demanded the colonel taking his stand upon the letter  well dont you at any rate yes id like to ride of all things and weve time enough for breakfast isnt ready till half past eight wheres the carriage  the only english scholar at haha bay had taken the light wraps of the ladies and was moving off with them this way this way he said waving his hand towards a larger number of vehicles on the shore than could have been reasonably attributed to haha bay i hope you wont object to having another passenger with you theres plenty of room for all he seems a very nice gentlemanly person said he with a queer patronizing graciousness which he had no doubt caught from his english patrons  the more the merrier answered colonel ellison and not in the least said his wife not meaning the proverb her eye had swept the whole array of vehicles and had found them all empty save one in which she detected the blamelessly coated back of mr arbuton but i ought perhaps to explain mrs ellisons motives better than they can be made to appear in her conduct she cared nothing for mr arbuton and she had no logical wish to see kitty in love with him but here were two young people thrown somewhat romantically together mrs ellison was a born matchmaker and to have refrained from promoting their better acquaintance in the interest of abstract matrimony was what never could have entered into her thought or desire her whole being closed for the time about this purpose her heart always warm towards kittywhom she admired with a sort of generous frenzyexpanded with all kinds of lovely designs in a word every dress she had she would instantly have bestowed upon that worshipful creature who was capable of adding another marriage to the world i hope the reader finds nothing vulgar or unbecoming in this for i do not it was an enthusiasm pure and simple a beautiful and unselfish abandon and i am sure men ought to be sorry that they are not worthier to be favored by it ladies have often to lament in the midst of their finesse that really no man is deserving the fate they devote themselves to prepare for him or in other words that women cannot marry women  i am not going to be so rash as try to depict mrs ellisons arts for then indeed i should make her appear the clumsy conspirator she was not and should merely convict myself of ignorance of such matters whether mr arbuton was ever aware of them i am not sure as a man he was of course obtuse and blind but then on the other hand he had seen far more of the world than mrs ellison and she may have been clear as day to him probably though he did not detect any design he could not have conceived of such a thing in a person with whom he had been so irregularly made acquainted and to whom he felt himself so hopelessly superior a film of ice such as in autumn you find casing the still pools early in the frosty mornings had gathered upon his manner over night but it thawed under the greetings of the others and he jumped actively out of the vehicle to offer the ladies their choice of seats when all was arranged he found himself at mrs ellisons side for kitty had somewhat eagerly climbed to the front seat with the colonel in these circumstances it was pure zeal that sustained mrs ellison in the flattering constancy with which she babbled on to mr arbuton and refrained from openly resenting kittys contumacy  as the wagon began to ascend the hill the road was so rough that the springs smote together with pitiless jolts and the ladies uttered some irrepressible moans never mind my dear said the colonel turning about to his wife weve got all the english there is at haha bay any way whereupon the driver gave him a wink of sudden liking and goodfellowship at the same time his tongue was loosed and he began to talk of himself you see my dog how he leaps at the horses nose he is a moosedog and keeps himself in practice of catching the moose by the nose you ought to come in the hunting season i could furnish you with indians and everything you need to hunt with i am a dealer in wild beasts you know and i must keep prepared to take them  wild beasts  yes for barnum and the other showmen i deal in deer wolf bear beaver moose cariboo wildcat link  what  linklink you say deer for deers and link for lynx dont you  certainly answered the unblushing colonel are there many link about here  not many and they are a very expensive animal i have been shamefully treated in a link that i have sold to a boston showman it was a difficult beast to take bit my indian awfully and mr doolittle would not give the price he promised  what an outrage  yes but it was not so bad as it might have been he wanted the money back afterwards the link died in about two weeks said the dealer in wild animals with a smile that curled his mustache into his ears and a glance at colonel ellison he may have been bruised i suppose he may have been homesick perhaps he was never a very strong link the link is a curious animal miss he said to kitty in conclusion  they had been slowly climbing the mountain road from which on either hand the pasturelands fell away in long irregular knolls and hollows the tops were quite barren but in the little vales despite the stones a short grass grew very thick and tenderly green and groups of kine tinkled their soft bells in a sweet desultory assonance as they cropped the herbage below the bay filled the oval of the hills with its sunny expanse and the white steamer where she lay beside the busy wharf and the black lumberships gave their variety to the pretty scene which was completed by the picturesque villages on the shore it was a very simple sight but somehow very touching as if the soft spectacle were but a respite from desolation and solitude as indeed it was  mr arbuton must have been talking of travel elsewhere for now he said to mrs ellison this looks like a bit of norway the bay yonder might very well be a fjord of the northern sea  mrs ellison murmured her sense of obligation to the bay the fjord and mr arbuton for their complaisance and kitty remembered that he had somewhat snubbed her the night before for attributing any suggestive grace to the native scenery then youve really found something in an american landscape i suppose we ought to congratulate it she said in smiling enjoyment of her triumph  the colonel looked at her with eyes of humorous question mrs ellison looked blank and mr arbuton having quite forgotten what he had said to provoke this comment now looked puzzled and answered nothing for he had this trait also in common with the sort of englishman for whom he was taken that he never helped out your conversational venture but if he failed to respond inwardly left you with your unaccepted remark upon your hands as it were in his silence kitty fell a prey to very evil thoughts of him for it made her harmless sally look like a blundering attack upon him but just then the driver came to her rescue he said gentlemen and ladies this is the end of the mountain promenade and turning his horses head drove rapidly back to the village  at the foot of the hill they came again to the church and his passengers wanted to get out and look into it o certainly said he it isnt finished yet but you can say as many prayers as you like in it  the church was decent and clean like most canadian churches and at this early hour there was a good number of the villagers at their devotions the lithographic pictures of the stations to calvary were of course on its walls and there was the ordinary tawdriness of paint and carving about the high altar  i dont like to see these things said mrs ellison it really seems to savor of idolatry dont you think so mr arbuton  well i dont know i doubt if theyre the sort of people to be hurt by it  they need a good stout faith in cold climates i can tell you said the colonel it helps to keep them warm the broad church would be too full of draughts up here they want something snug and tight just imagine one of these poor devils listening to a liberal sermon about birds and fruits and flowers and beautiful sentiments and then driving home over the hills with the mercury thirty degrees below zero he couldnt stand it  yes yes certainly said mr arbuton and looked about him with an eye of cold uncompassionate inspection as if he were trying it by a standard of taste and on the whole finding the poor little church vulgar  when they mounted to their places again the talk fell entirely to the colonel who as his wont was got what information he could out of the driver it appeared in spite of his theory that they were not all good catholics at haha bay this chap for example said the frenchman touching himself on the breast and using the slang he must have picked up from american travellers is no catholicnot much he has made too many studies to care for religion theres a large french party sir in canada thats opposed to the priests and in favor of annexation  he satisfied the colonels utmost curiosity discoursing as he drove by the logbuilt cottages which were now and then sheathed in birchbark upon the local affairs and the character and history of such of his fellowvillagers as they met he knew the pretty girls upon the street and saluted them by name interrupting himself with these courtesies in the lecture he was giving the colonel on life at haha bay there was only one brick house which he had built himself but had been obliged to sell in a season unfavorable for wild beasts and the other edifices dropped through the social scale to some picturesque barns thatched with straw these he excused to his americans but added that the ungainly thatch was sometimes useful in saving the lives of the cattle toward the end of an unusually long hard winter  and the people asked the colonel what do they do in the winter to pass the time  draw the wood smoke the pipe court the ladiesbut wouldnt you like to see the inside of one of our poor cottages i shall be very proud to have you look at mine and to have you drink a glass of milk from my cows i am sorry that i cannot offer you brandy but theres none to be bought in the place  dont speak of it for an eyeopener there is nothing like a glass of milk gayly answered the colonel  they entered the best room of the housewide lowceiled dimly lit by two small windows and fortified against the winter by a huge canada stove of castiron it was rude but neat and had an air of decent comfort through the window appeared a very little vegetable garden with a border of the hardiest flowers the large beans there explained the host are for soup and coffee my corn he said pointing out some rows of dwarfish maize has escaped the early august frosts and so i expect to have some roastingears yet this summer  well it isnt exactly what youd call an inviting climate is it asked the colonel  the canadian seemed a hard little man but he answered now with a kind of pathos its cruel i came here when it was all bush twenty years i have lived here and it has not been worth while if it was to do over again i should rather not live anywhere i was born in quebec he said as if to explain that he was used to mild climates and began to tell of some events of his life at haha bay i wish you were going to stay here awhile with me you wouldnt find it so bad in the summertime i can assure you there are bears in the bush sir he said to the colonel and you might easily kill one  but then i should be helping to spoil your trade in wild beasts replied the colonel laughing  mr arbuton looked like one who might be very tired of this he made no sign of interest either in the early glooms and privations or the summer bears of haha bay he sat in the quaint parlor with his hat on his knee in the decorous and patient attitude of a gentleman making a call  he had no feeling kitty said to herself but that is a matter about which we can easily be wrong it was rather to be said of mr arbuton that he had always shrunk from knowledge of things outside of a very narrow world and that he had not a ready imagination moreover he had a personal dislike as i may call it of poverty and he did not enjoy this poverty as she did because it was strange and suggestive though doubtless he would have done as much to relieve distress  rather too much of his autobiography he said to kitty as he waited outside the door with her while the canadian quieted his dog which was again keeping himself in practice of catching the moose by making vicious leaps at the horses nose the egotism of that kind of people is always so aggressive but i suppose hes in the habit of throwing himself upon the sympathy of summer visitors in this way you cant offer a man so little as shilling and sixpence whos taken you into his confidence did you find enough that was novel in his place to justify him in bringing us here miss ellison he asked with an air he had of taking you of course to be of his mind and which equally offended you whether you were so or not  every face that they had seen in their drive had told its pathetic story to kitty every cottage that they passed she had entered in thought and dreamed out its humble drama what their host had said gave breath and color to her fancies of the struggle of life there and she was startled and shocked when this cold doubt was cast upon the sympathetic tints of her picture she did not know what to say at first she looked at mr arbuton with a sudden glance of embarrassment and trouble then she answered i was very much interested i dont agree with you i believe which when she heard it seemed a resentful little speech and made her willing for some occasion to soften its effect but nothing occurred to her during the brief drive back to the boat save the fact that the morning air was delicious  yes but rather cool said mr arbuton whose feelings apparently had not needed any balm and the talk fell again to the others  on the pier he helped her down from the wagon for the colonel was intent on something the driver was saying and then offered his hand to mrs ellison  she sprang from her place but stumbled slightly and when she touched the ground i believe i turned my foot a little she said with a laugh its nothing of course and fainted in his arms  kitty gave a cry of alarm and the next instant the colonel had relieved mr arbuton it was a scene and nothing could have annoyed him more than this tumult which poor mrs ellisons misfortune occasioned among the bystanding habitans and deckhands and the passengers eagerly craning forward over the bulwarks and running ashore to see what the matter was few men know just how to offer those little offices of helpfulness which such emergencies demand and mr arbuton could do nothing after he was rid of his burden he hovered anxiously and uselessly about while mrs ellison was carried to an airy position on the bow of the boat where in a few minutes he had the great satisfaction of seeing her open her eyes it was not the moment for him to speak and he walked somewhat guiltily away with the dispersing crowd  mrs ellison addressed her first words to pale kitty at her side you can have all my things now she said as if it were a clause in her will and perhaps it had been her last thought before unconsciousness  why fanny cried kitty with an hysterical laugh youre not going to die a sprained ankle isnt fatal  no but ive heard that a person with a sprained ankle cant put their foot to the ground for weeks and i shall only want a dressinggown you know to lie on the sofa in with that mrs ellison placed her hand tenderly on kittys head like a mother wondering what will become of a helpless child during her disability in fact she was mentally weighing the advantages of her wardrobe which kitty would now fully enjoy against the loss of the friendly strategy which she would now lack helpless to decide the matter she heaved a sigh  but fanny you wont expect to travel in a dressinggown  indeed i wish i knew whether i could travel in anything or not but the next twentyfour hours will show if it swells up i shall have to rest awhile at quebec and if it doesnt there may be something internal ive read of accidents when the person thought they were perfectly well and comfortable and the first thing they knew they were in a very dangerous state thats the worst of these internal injuries you never can tell not that i think theres anything of that kind the matter with me but a few days rest wont do any harm whatever happens the stores in quebec are quite as good and a little cheaper than in montreal and i could go about in a carriage you know and put in the time as well in one place as the other im sure we could get on very pleasantly there and the colonel neednt be home for a month yet i suppose that i could hobble into the stores on a crutch  whilst mrs ellisons monologue ran on with scarcely a break from kitty her husband was gone to fetch her a cup of tea and such other light refreshment as a lady may take after a swoon when he returned she bethought herself of mr arbuton who having once come back to see if all was going well had vanished again  why our friend boston is bearing up under his share of the mornings work like a heroor a lady with a sprained ankle said the colonel as he arranged the provision to see the havoc hes making in the ham and eggs and chiccory is to be convinced that there is no appetizer like regret for the sufferings of others  why and heres poor kitty not had a bite yet cried mrs ellison kitty go off at once and get your breakfast put on my  o dont fanny or i cant go and im really very hungry  well i wont then said mrs ellison seeing the rainy cloud in kittys eyes go just as you are and dont mind me and so kitty went gathering courage at every pace and sitting down opposite mr arbuton with a vivid color to be sure but otherwise lionbold he had been upbraiding the stars that had thrust him further and further at every step into the intimacy of these people as he called them to himself it was just twentyfour hours he reflected since he had met them and resolved to have nothing to do with them and in that time the young lady had brought him under the necessity of apologizing for a blunder of her own he had played the eavesdropper to her talk he had sentimentalized the midnight hour with her they had all taken a morning ride together and he had ended by having mrs ellison sprain her ankle and faint in his arms it was outrageous and what made it worse was that decency obliged him to take henceforth a regretful deprecatory attitude towards mrs ellison whom he liked least among these people so he sat vindictively eating an enormous breakfast in a sort of angry abstraction from which kittys coming roused him to say that he hoped mrs ellison was better  o very much its just a sprain  a sprain may be a very annoying thing said mr arbuton dismally miss ellison he cried ive been nothing but an affliction to your party since i came on board this boat  do you think evil genius of our party would be too harsh a term suggested kitty  not in the least it would be a mere euphemismbase flattery in fact call me something worse  i cant think of anything i must leave you to your own conscience it was a pity to end our ride in that way it would have been such a pleasant ride and kitty took heart from his apparent mood to speak of some facts of the morning that had moved her fancy what a strange little nest it is up here among these halfthawed hills and imagine the winter the fifteen or twenty months of it they must have every year i could almost have shed tears over that patch of corn that had escaped the early august frosts i suppose this is a sort of indian summer that we are enjoying now and that the cold weather will set in after a week or two my cousin and i thought that tadoussac was somewhat retired and composed last night but im sure that i shall see it in its true light as a metropolis going back im afraid that the turmoil and bustle of eriecreek when i get home  eriecreekwhen you got homei thought you lived at milwaukee  o no its my cousins who live at milwaukee i live at eriecreek new york state  oh mr arbuton looked blank and not altogether pleased milwaukee was bad enough though he understood that it was largely peopled from new england and had a great german element which might account for the fact that these people were not quite barbaric but this eriecreek new york state i dont think ive heard of it he said  its a small place observed kitty and i believe it isnt noted for anything in particular its not even on any railroad its in the northwest part of the state  isnt it in the oilregions groped mr arbuton  why the oilregions are rather migratory you know it used to be in the oilregions but the oil was pumped out and then the oilregions gracefully withdrew and left the cheeseregions and graperegions to come back and take possession of the old derricks and the rusty boilers you might suppose from the appearance of the meadows that all the boilers that ever blew up had come down in the neighborhood of eriecreek and every field has its derrick standing just as the last dollar or the last drop of oil left it  mr arbuton brought his fancy to bear upon eriecreek and wholly failed to conceive of it he did not like the notion of its being thrust within the range of his knowledge and he resented its being the home of miss ellison whom he was beginning to accept as a not quite comprehensible yet certainly agreeable fact though he still had a disposition to cast her off as something incredible he asked no further about eriecreek and presently she rose and went to join her relatives and he went to smoke his cigar and to ponder upon the problem presented to him in this young girl from whose locality and conjecturable experiences he was at loss how to infer her as he found her here  she had a certain selfreliance mingling with an innocent trust of others which mrs isabel march had described to her husband as a charm potent to make everybody sympathetic and goodnatured but which it would not be easy to account for to mr arbuton in part it was a natural gift and partly it came from mere ignorance of the world it was the unsnubbed fearlessness of a heart which did not suspect a sense of social difference in others or imagine itself misprized for anything but a fault for such a false conception of her relations to polite society kittys uncle jack was chiefly to blame in the fierce democracy of his revolt from his virginian traditions he had taught his family that a belief in any save intellectual and moral distinctions was a mean and cruel superstition he had contrived to fix this idea so deeply in the education of his children that it gave a coloring to their lives and kitty when her turn came had the effect of it in the character of those about her in fact she accepted his extreme theories of equality to a degree that delighted her uncle who having held them many years was growing perhaps a little languid in their tenure and was glad to have his grasp strengthened by her faith socially as well as politically eriecreek was almost a perfect democracy and there was little in kittys circumstances to contradict the doctors teachings the brief visits which she had made to buffalo and erie and since the colonels marriage to milwaukee had not sufficed to undeceive her she had never suffered slight save from the ignorant and uncouth she innocently expected that in people of culture she should always find community of feeling and ideas and she had met mr arbuton all the more trustfully because as a bostonian he must be cultivated  in the secluded life which she led perforce at eriecreek there was an abundance of leisure which she bestowed upon books at an age when most girls are sent to school the doctor had a good taste of an oldfashioned kind in literature and he had a library pretty well stocked with the elderly english authors poets and essayists and novelists and here and there an historian and these kitty read childlike liking them at the time in a certain way and storing up in her mind things that she did not understand for the present but whose beauty and value dawned upon her from time to time as she grew older but of far more use and pleasure to her than these now somewhat mouldy classics were the more modern books of her cousin charlesthat pride and hope of his fathers heart who had died the year before she came to eriecreek he was named after her own father and it was as if her uncle jack found both his son and his brother in her again when her taste for reading began to show itself in force the old man one day unlocked a certain bookcase in a little upper room and gave her the key saying with a broken pride and that queer virginian pomp which still clung to him this was my sons who would one day have been a great writer now it is yours after that the doctor would pick up the books out of this collection which kitty was reading and had left lying about the rooms and look into them a little way sometimes he fell asleep over them sometimes when he opened on a page pencilled with marginal notes he would put the volume gently down and go very quickly out of the room  kitty i reckon youd better not leave poor charleys books around where uncle jack can get at them one of the girls virginia or rachel would say i dont believe he cares much for those writers and the sight of the books just tries him so kitty kept the books and herself for the most part with them in the upper chamber which had been charles ellisons room and where amongst the witnesses of the dead boys ambitious dreams she grew dreamer herself and seemed to inherit with his earthly place his own fine and gentle spirit  the doctor as his daughter suggested did not care much for the modern authors in whom his son had delighted like many another simple and purehearted man he thought that since pope there had been no great poet but byron and he could make nothing out of tennyson and browning or the other contemporary english poets amongst the americans he had a great respect for whittier but he preferred lowell to the rest because he had written the biglow papers and he never would allow that the last series was half so good as the first these and the other principal poets of our nation and language kitty inherited from her cousin as well as a full stock of the contemporary novelists and romancers whom she liked better than the poets on the whole she had also the advantage of the magazines and reviews which used to come to him and the house overflowed with newspapers of every kind from the eriecreek courier to the new york tribune what with the coming and going of the eccentric visitors and this continual reading and her rides about the country with her uncle jack kittys education such as it was went on very actively and with the effect at least to give her a great liveliness of mind and several decided opinions where it might have warped her out of natural simplicity and made her conceited the keen and wholesome airs which breathed continually in the ellison household came in to restore her there was such kindness in this discipline that she never could remember when it wounded her it was part of the gayety of those times when she would sit down with the girls and they took up some work together and rattled on in a free wild racy talk with an edge of satire for whoever came near a fantastic excess in its drollery and just a touch of native melancholy tingeing it the last queer guest some neighborhood gossip some youthful folly or pretentiousness of kittys some trait of their own some absurdity of the boys if they happened to be at home and came lounging in were the themes out of which they contrived such jollity as never was save when in uncle jacks presence they fell upon some characteristic action or theory of his and turned it into endless ridicule  but of such people of such life mr arbuton could have made nothing if he had known them in many things he was an excellent person and greatly to be respected for certain qualities he was very sincere his mind had a singular purity and rectitude he was a scrupulously just person so far as he knew he had traits that would have fitted him very well for the career he had once contemplated and he had even made some preliminary studies for the ministry but the very generosity of his creed perplexed him his mislikers said contending that he could never have got on with the mob of the redeemed arbuton said a fat young fellow the supposed wit of the class thinks there are persons of low extraction in heaven but he doesnt like the idea and mr arbuton did not like the speaker very well either nor any of his poorer fellowstudents whose gloveless and unfashionable poverty and meagre board and lodgings and general hungry dependence upon pious bequests and neighborhood kindnesses offended his instincts so hes given it up has he moralized the same wit upon his retirement if arbuton could have been a divinely commissioned apostle to the best society and been obliged to save none but wellconnected oldestablished and cultivated souls he might have gone into the ministry this was a coarse construction of the truth but it was not altogether a perversion it was long ago that he had abandoned the thought of the ministry and he had since travelled and read law and become a man of society and of clubs but he still kept the traits that had seemed to make his vocation clear on the other hand he kept the prejudices that were imagined to have disqualified him he was an exclusive by training and by instinct he gave ordinary humanity credit for a certain measure of sensibility and it is possible that if he had known more kinds of men he would have recognized merits and excellences which did not now exist for him but i do not think he would have liked them his doubt of these western people was the most natural if not the most justifiable thing in the world and for kitty if he could have known all about her i do not see how he could have believed in her at all as it was he went in search of her party when he had smoked his cigar and found them on the forward promenade she had left him in quite a lenient mood although as she perceived with amusement he had done nothing to merit it except give her cousin a sprained ankle at the moment of his reappearance mrs ellison had been telling kitty that she thought it was beginning to swell a little and so it could not be anything internal and kitty had understood that she meant her ankle as well as if she had said so and had sorrowed and rejoiced over her and the colonel had been inculpated for the whole affair this made mr arbutons excuses rather needless though they were most graciously received     iii  on the way back to quebec   by this time the boat was moving down the river and every one was alive to the scenery the procession of the pineclad rounded heights on either shore began shortly after haha bay had disappeared behind a curve and it hardly ceased save at one point before the boat reentered the st lawrence the shores of the stream are almost uninhabited the hills rise from the waters edge and if ever a narrow vale divides them it is but to open drearier solitudes to the eye in such a valley would stand a sawmill and huddled about it a few poor huts while a friendless road scarce discernible from the boat wound up from the river through the valley and led to wildernesses all the forlorner for the devastation of their forests now and then an island rugged as the shores broke the long reaches of the grim river with its massive rock and dark evergreen and seemed in the distance to forbid escape from those dreary waters over which no bird flew and in which it was incredible any fish swam  mrs ellison with her foot comfortably and not ungracefully supported on a stool was in so little pain as to be looking from time to time at one of the guidebooks which the colonel had lavished upon his party and which she was disposed to hold to very strict account for any excesses of description  it says here that the water of the saguenay is as black as ink do you think it is richard  it looks so  well but if you took some up in your hand  perhaps it wouldnt be as black as the best maynard and noyes but it would be black enough for all practical purposes  maybe suggested kitty the guidebook means the kind that is light blue at first but becomes a deep black on exposure to the air as the label says  what do you think mr arbuton asked mrs ellison with unabated anxiety  well really i dont know said mr arbuton who thought it a very trivial kind of talk i cant say indeed i havent taken any of it up in my hand  thats true said mrs ellison gravely with an accent of reproval for the others who had not thought of so simple a solution of the problem very true  the colonel looked into her face with an air of wellfeigned alarm you dont think the sprain has gone to your head fanny he asked and walked away leaving mr arbuton to the ladies mrs ellison did not care for this or any other gibe if she but served her own purposes and now having made everybody laugh and given the conversation a lively turn she was as perfectly content as if she had not been herself an offering to the cause of cheerfulness she was indeed equal to any sacrifice in the enterprise she had undertaken and would not only have given kitty all her worldly goods but would have quite effaced herself to further her own designs upon mr arbuton she turned again to her guidebook and left the young people to continue the talk in unbroken gayety they at once became serious as most people do after a hearty laugh which if you think seems always to have something strange and sad in it but besides kitty was oppressed by the coldness that seemed perpetually to hover in mr arbutons atmosphere while she was interested by his fastidious good looks and his blameless manners and his air of a world different from any she had hitherto known he was one of those men whose perfection makes you feel guilty of misdemeanor whenever they meet you and whose greeting turns your honest goodday coarse and common even kittys fearless ignorance and more than western disregard of dignities were not proof against him she had found it easy to talk with mrs march as she did with her cousin at home she liked to be frank and gay in her parley to jest and to laugh and to make harmless fun and to sentimentalize in a halfearnest way she liked to be with mr arbuton but now she did not see how she could take her natural tone with him she wondered at her daring lightness at the breakfasttable she waited for him to say something and he said with a glance at the gray heaven that always overhangs the saguenay that it was beginning to rain and unfurled the slender silk umbrella which harmonized so perfectly with the london effect of his dress and held it over her mrs ellison sat within the shelter of the projecting roof and diligently perused her book with her eyes and listened to their talk  the great drawback to this sort of thing in america continued mr arbuton is that there is no human interest about the scenery fine as it is  why i dont know said kitty there was that little settlement round the sawmill cant you imagine any human interest in the lives of the people there it seems to me that one might make almost anything out of them suppose for example that the owner of that mill was a disappointed man who had come here to bury the wreck of his life insawdust  o yes that sort of thing certainly but i didnt mean that i meant something historical there is no past no atmosphere no traditions you know  o but the saguenay has a tradition said kitty you know that a party of the first explorers left their comrades at tadoussac and came up the saguenay three hundred years ago and never were seen or heard of again i think its so in keeping with the looks of the river the saguenay would never tell a secret  um uttered mr arbuton as if he were not quite sure that it was the saguenays place to have a legend of this sort and disposed to snub the legend because the saguenay had it after a little silence he began to speak of famous rivers abroad  i suppose kitty said the rhine has traditions enough hasnt it  yes he answered but i think the rhine rather overdoes it you cant help feeling you know that its somewhat melodramatic andcommon have you ever seen the rhine  o no this is almost the first ive seen of anything perhaps she added demurely yet with a tremor at finding herself about to make light of mr arbuton if i had had too much of tradition on the rhine i should want more of it on the saguenay  why you must allow theres a golden mean in everything miss ellison said her companion with a lenient laugh not feeling it disagreeable to be made light of by her  yes and im afraid were going to find cape trinity and cape eternity altogether too big when we come to them dont you think eighteen hundred feet excessively high for a feature of river scenery  mr arbuton really did have an objection to the exaggerations of nature on this continent and secretly thought them in bad taste but he had never formulated his feeling he was not sure but it was ridiculous now that it was suggested and yet the possibility was too novel to be entertained without suspicion  however when after a while the rumor of their approach to the great objects of the saguenay journey had spread among the passengers and they began to assemble at points favorable for the enjoyment of the spectacle he was glad to have secured the place he held with miss ellison and a sympathetic thrill of excitement passed through his loath superiority the rain ceased as they drew nearer and the gray clouds that had hung so low upon the hills sullenly lifted from them and let their growing height he seen the captain bade his sightseers look at the vast roman profile that showed itself upon the rock and then he pointed out the wonderful gothic arch the reputed doorway of an unexplored cavern under which an upright shaft of stone had stood for ages statuelike till not many winters ago the frost heaved it from its base and it plunged headlong down through the ice into the unfathomed depths below the unvarying gloom of the pines was lit now by the pensive glimmer of birchtrees and this gray tone gave an indescribable sentiment of pathos and of age to the scenery suddenly the boat rounded the corner of the three steps each five hundred feet high in which cape eternity climbs from the river and crept in under the naked side of the awful cliff it is sheer rock springing from the black water and stretching upward with a weary effortlike aspect in long impulses of stone marked by deep seams from space to space till fifteen hundred feet in air its vast brow beetles forward and frowns with a scattering fringe of pines there are stains of weather and of oozing springs upon the front of the cliff but it is height alone that seems to seize the eye and one remembers afterwards these details which are indeed so few as not properly to enter into the effect the rock fully justifies its attributive height to the eye which follows the upward rush of the mighty acclivity steep after steep till it wins the cloudcapt summit when the measureless mass seems to swing and sway overhead and the nerves tremble with the same terror that besets him who looks downward from the verge of a lofty precipice it is wholly grim and stern no touch of beauty relieves the austere majesty of that presence at the foot of cape eternity the water is of unknown depth and it spreads a black expanse in the rounding hollow of shores of unimaginable wildness and desolation and issues again in its rivers course around the base of cape trinity this is yet loftier than the sister cliff but it slopes gently backward from the stream and from foot to crest it is heavily clothed with a forest of pines the woods that hitherto have shagged the hills with a stunted and meagre growth showing long stretches scarred by fire now assume a stately size and assemble themselves compactly upon the side of the mountain setting their serried stems one rank above another till the summit is crowned with the mass of their dark green plumes dense and soft and beautiful so that the spirit perturbed by the spectacle of the other cliff is calmed and assuaged by the serene grandeur of this  there have been to be sure some human agencies at work even under the shadow of cape eternity to restore the spirit to selfpossession and perhaps none turns from it wholly dismayed kitty at any rate took heart from some works of art which the cliff wall displayed near the waters edge one of these was a lively fresco portrait of lieutenantgeneral sherman with the insignia of his rank and the other was an even more striking effigy of general oneil of the armies of the irish republic wearing a threatening aspect and designed in a bold conceit of his presence there as conqueror of canada in the year 1875 mr arbuton was inclined to resent these intrusions upon the sublimity of nature and he could not conceive without disadvantage to them how miss ellison and the colonel should accept them so cheerfully as part of the pleasure of the whole as he listened blankly to their exchange of jests he found himself awfully beset by a temptation which one of the boats crew placed before the passengers this was a bucket full of pebbles of inviting size and the man said now see which can hit the cliff its farther than any of you can throw though it looks so near  the passengers cast themselves upon the store of missiles colonel ellison most actively among them none struck the cliff and suddenly mr arbuton felt a blind stupid irresistible longing to try his chance the spirit of his college days of his boating and ballplaying youth came upon him he picked up a pebble while kitty opened her eyes in a stare of dumb surprise then he wheeled and threw it and as it struck against the cliff with a shock that seemed to have broken all the windows on the back bay he exulted in a sense of freedom the havoc caused him it was as if for an instant he had rent away the ties of custom thrown off the bonds of social allegiance broken down and trampled upon the conventions which his whole life long he had held so dear and respectable in that moment of frenzy he feared himself capable of shaking hands with the shabby englishman in the glengarry cap or of asking the whole admiring company of passengers down to the bar a cry of applause had broken from them at his achievement and he had for the first time tasted the sweets of popular favor of course a revulsion must come and it must be of a corresponding violence and the next moment mr arbuton hated them all and most of all colonel ellison who had been loudest in his praise him he thought for that moment everything that was aggressively and intrusively vulgar but he could not utter these friendly impressions nor is it so easy to withdraw from any concession and he found it impossible to repair his broken defences destiny had been against him from the beginning and now why should he not strike hands with it for the brief halfday that he was to continue in these peoples society in the morning he would part from them forever and in the mean time why should he not try to please and be pleased there might to be sure have been many reasons why he should not do this but however the balance stood he now yielded himself passively to his fate he was polite to mrs ellison he was attentive to kitty and as far as he could he entered into the fantastic spirit of her talk with the colonel he was not a dull man he had quite an apt wit of his own and a neat way of saying things but humor always seemed to him something not perfectly well bred of course he helped to praise it in some oldestablished dinerout or some woman of good fashion whose mots it was customary to repeat and he even tolerated it in books but he was at a loss with these people who looked at life in so bizarre a temper yet without airiness or pretension nay with a whimsical readiness to acknowledge kindred in every droll or laughable thing  the boat stopped at tadoussac on her return and among the spectators who came down to the landing was a certain very pretty consciouslooking silly bridalfaced young womanimaginably the belle of the season at that forlorn wateringplacewho before coming on board stood awhile attended by a following of those elderly imperial and colonial british who heavily flutter round the fair at such resorts she had an air of utterly satisfied vanity in which there was no harm in the world and when she saw that she had fixed the eyes of the shorewardgazing passengers it appeared as if she fell into a happy trepidation too blissful to be passively borne she moistened her pretty red lips with her tongue she twitched her mantle she settled the bow at her lovely throat she bridled and tossed her graceful head  what should you do next kitty asked the colonel who had been sympathetically intent upon all this  o i think i should pat my foot answered kitty and in fact the charming simpleton on shore having perfected her attitude was tapping the ground nervously with the toe of her adorable slipper  after the boat started a canadian lady of ripe age yet of a vivacity not to be reconciled with the notion of the married state capered briskly about among her somewhat stolid and indifferent friends saying theyre going to fire it as soon as we round the point and presently a dull boom as of a small piece of ordnance discharged in the neighborhood of the hotel struck through the gathering fog and this elderly sylph clapped her hands and exulted theyve fired it theyve fired it and now the captain will blow the whistle in answer but the captain did nothing of the kind and the lady after some more girlish effervescence upbraided him for an old owl and an old muff and so sank into such a flat and spiritless calm that she was sorrowful to see  too bad mr arbuton isnt it said the colonel and mr arbuton listened in vague doubt while kitty built up with her cousin a touching romance for the poor lady supposed to have spent the one brilliant and successful summer of her life at tadoussac where her admirers had agreed to bemoan her loss in this explosion of gunpowder they asked him if he did not wish the captain had whistled and oh shuddered kitty doesnt it all make you feel just as if you had been doing it yourselfa question which he hardly knew how to answer never having to his knowledge done a ridiculous thing in his life much less been guilty of such behavior as that of the disappointed lady  at cacouna where the boat stopped to take on the horses and carriages of some homereturning sojourners the pier was a labyrinth of equipages of many sorts and sizes and a herd of brighthooded gayly blanketed horses gave variety to the human crowd that soaked and steamed in the fine slowly falling rain a draughthorse was every three minutes driven into their midst with tedious iteration as he slowly drew baskets of coal up from the sloop unloading at the wharf and each time they closed solidly upon his retreat as if they never expected to see that horse again while the world stood they were idle ladies and gentlemen under umbrellas indians and habitans taking the rain stolidly erect or with shrugged shoulders and two or three clergymen of the curate type who might have stepped as they were out of any dull english novel these were talking in low voices and putting their hands to their ears to catch the replies of the ladypassengers who hung upon the rail and twaddled back as dryly as if there was no moisture in life all the while the safetyvalves hissed with the escaping steam and the boats crew silently toiled with the grooms of the different horses to get the equipages on board with the carriages it was an affair of mere muscle but the horses required to be managed with brain no sooner had one of them placed his fore feet on the gangway plank than he protested by backing up over a mass of patient canadians carrying with him half a dozen grooms and deckhands then his hood was drawn over his eyes and he was blindly walked up and down the pier and back to the gangway which he knew as soon as he touched it he pulled he pranced he shied he did all that a bad and stubborn horse can do till at last a groom mounted his back a clump of deckhands tugged at his bridle and other grooms tenderly embracing him at different points pushed and he was thus conveyed on board with mingled affection and ignominy none of the canadians seemed amused by this they regarded it with serious composure as a fitting decorum and mr arbuton had no comment to make upon it but at the first embrace bestowed upon the horse by the grooms the colonel said absently ah longlost brother and kitty laughed and as the scruples of each brute were successively overcome she helped to give some grotesque interpretation to the various scenes of the melodrama while mr arbuton stood beside her and sheltered her with his umbrella and a spice of malice in her heart told her that he viewed this drolling and especially her part in it with grave misgiving that gave the zest of transgression to her excess mixed with dismay for the tricksy spirit in her was not a domineering spirit but was easily abashed by the moods of others she ought not to have laughed at dicks speeches she soon told herself much less helped him on she dreadfully feared that she had done something indecorous and she was pensive and silent over it as she moved listlessly about after supper and she sat at last thinking in a dreary sort of perplexity on what had passed during the day which seemed a long one  the shabby englishman with his wife and sister were walking up and down the cabin by and by they stopped and sat down at the table facing kitty the elder woman with a civil freedom addressed her some commonplace and the four were presently in lively talk for kitty had beamed upon the woman in return having already longed to know something of them the world was so fresh to her that she could find delight in those poor singing or acting folk though she had soon to own to herself that their talk was not very witty nor very wise and that the best thing about them was their goodnature the colonel sat at the end of the table with a newspaper mrs ellison had gone to bed and kitty was beginning to tire of her new acquaintance and to wonder how she could get away from them when she saw rescue in the eye of mr arbuton as he came down to the cabin she knew he was looking for her she saw him check himself with a start of recognition then he walked rapidly by the group without glancing at them  brrrr said the blond girl drawing her blue knit shawl about her shoulders isnt it cold and she and her friends laughed  o dear thought kitty i didnt suppose they were so rude im afraid i must say good night she added aloud after a little and stole away the most consciencestricken creature on that boat she heard those people laugh again after she left them     iv  mr arbutons inspiration   the next morning when mr arbuton awoke he found a clear light upon the world that he had left wrapped in fog at midnight a heavy gale was blowing and the wide river was running in seas that made the boat stagger in her course and now and then struck her bows with a force that sent the spray from their seething tops into the faces of the people on the promenade the sun out of rifts of the breaking clouds launched broad splendors across the villages and farms of the level landscape and the crests and hollows of the waves and a certain joy of the air penetrated to the guarded consciousness of mr arbuton involuntarily he looked about for the people he meant to have nothing more to do with that he might appeal to the sympathies of one of them at least in his sense of such an admirable morning but a great many passengers had come on board during the night at murray bay where the brief season was ending and their number hid the ellisons from him when he went to breakfast he found some one had taken his seat near them and they did not notice him as he passed by in search of another chair kitty and the colonel were at table alone and they both wore preoccupied faces after breakfast he sought them out and asked for mrs ellison who had shared in most of the excitements of the day before helping herself about with a pretty limp and who certainly had not as her husband phrased it kept any of the meals waiting  why said the colonel im afraid her ankles worse this morning and that well have to lie by at quebec for a few days at any rate  mr arbuton heard this sad news with a cheerful aspect unaccountable in one who was concerned at mrs ellisons misfortune he smiled when he ought to have looked pensive and he laughed at the colonels joke when the latter added of course this is a great hardship for my cousin who hates quebec and wants to get home to eriecreek as soon as possible  kitty promised to bear her trials with firmness and mr arbuton said not very consequently as she thought i had been planning to spend a few days in quebec myself and i shall have the opportunity of inquiring about mrs ellisons convalescence in fact he added turning to the colonel i hope youll let me be of service to you in getting to a hotel  and when the boat landed mr arbuton actually busied himself in finding a carriage and putting the various ellison wraps and bags into it then he helped to support mrs ellison ashore and to lift her to the best place he raised his hat and had goodmorning on his tongue when the astonished colonel called out why the deuce youre going to ride up with us  mr arbuton thought he had better get another carriage he should incommode mrs ellison but mrs ellison protested that he would not at all and to cut the matter short he mounted to the colonels side it was another stroke of fate  at the hotel they found a line of people reaching halfway down the outer steps from the inside of the office  hallo whats this asked the colonel of the last man in the queue  o its a little procession to the hotel register weve been three quarters of an hour in passing a given point said the man who was plainly a fellowcitizen  and havent got by yet said the colonel taking to the speaker then the house is full  well no they havent begun to throw them out of the window  his humor is degenerating dick said kitty and hadnt you better go inside and inquire asked mrs ellison it was part of the ellison travelling joke for her thus to prompt the colonel in his duty  im glad you mentioned it fanny i was just going to drive off in despair the colonel vanished within doors and after long delay came out flushed but not with triumph on the express condition that i have ladies with me one an invalid i am promised a room on the fifth floor some time during the day they tell me the other hotel is crammed and its no use to go there  mrs ellison was ready to weep and for the first time since her accident she harbored some bitterness against mr arbuton they all sat silent and the colonel on the sidewalk silently wiped his brow  mr arbuton in the poverty of his invention wondered if there was not some lodginghouse where they could find shelter  of course there is cried mrs ellison beaming upon her hero and calling kittys attention to his ingenuity by a pressure with her well foot richard we must look up a boardinghouse  do you know of any good boardinghouses asked the colonel of the driver mechanically  plenty answered the man  well drive us to twenty or thirty firstclass ones commanded the colonel and the search began  the colonel first asked prices and looked at rooms and if he pronounced any apartment unsuitable kitty was despatched by mrs ellison to view it and refute him as often as she confirmed him mrs ellison was sure that they were both too fastidious and they never turned away from a door but they closed the gates of paradise upon that afflicted lady she began to believe that they should find no place whatever when at last they stopped before a portal so unboardinghouselike in all outward signs that she maintained it was of no use to ring and imparted so much of her distrust to the colonel that after ringing he prefaced his demand for rooms with an apology for supposing that there were rooms to let there then after looking at them he returned to the carriage and reported that the whole affair was perfect and that he should look no farther mrs ellison replied that she never could trust his judgment he was so careless kitty inspected the premises and came back in a transport that alarmed the worst fears of mrs ellison she was sure that they had better look farther she knew there were plenty of nicer places even if the rooms were nice and the situation pleasant she was certain that there must be some drawbacks which they did not know of yet whereupon her husband lifted her from the carriage and bore her without reply or comment of any kind into the house  throughout the search mr arbuton had been making up his mind that he would part with his friends as soon as they found lodgings give the day to quebec and take the evening train for gorham thus escaping the annoyances of a crowded hotel and ending at once an acquaintance which he ought never to have let go so far as long as the ellisons were without shelter he felt that it was due to himself not to abandon them but even now that they were happily housed had he done all that nobility obliged he stood irresolute beside the carriage  wont you come up and see where we live asked kitty hospitably  i shall be very glad said mr arbuton  my dear fellow said the colonel in the parlor i didnt engage a room for you i supposed youd rather take your chances at the hotel  o im going away tonight  why thats a pity  yes ive no fancy for a cotbed in the hotel parlor but i dont quite like to leave you here after bringing this calamity upon you  o dont mention that i was the only one to blame we shall get on splendidly here  mr arbuton suffered a vague disappointment at the bottom of his heart was a formless hope that he might in some way be necessary to the ellisons in their adversity or if not that then that something might entangle him further and compel his stay but they seemed quite equal in themselves to the situation they were in far more comfortable quarters than they could have hoped for and plainly should want for nothing fortune put on a smiling face and bade him go free of them he fancied it a mocking smile though as he stood an instant silently weighing one thing against another the colonel was patiently waiting his motion mrs ellison sat watching him from the sofa kitty moved about the room with averted facea pretty domestic presence a household priestess ordering the temporary penates mr arbuton opened his lips to say farewell but a god spoke through theminconsequently as the gods for the most part do saying besides i suppose youve got all the rooms here  o as to that i dont know answered the colonel not recognizing the language of inspiration lets ask kitty knocked a photographbook off the table and mrs ellison said why kitty but nothing more was spoken till the landlady came she had another room but doubted if it would answer it was in the attic and was a back room though it had a pleasant outlook mr arbuton had no doubt that it would do very well for the day or two he was going to stay and took it hastily without going to look at it he had his valise carried up at once and then he went to the postoffice to see if he had any letters offering to ask also for colonel ellison  kitty stole off to explore the chamber given her at the rear of the house that is to say she opened the window looking out on what their hostess told her was the garden of the ursuline convent and stood there in a mute transport a black cross rose in the midst and all about this wandered the paths and alleys of the garden through clumps of lilacbushes and among the spires of hollyhocks the grounds were enclosed by high walls in part and in part by the group of the convent edifices built of gray stone high gabled and topped by dormerwindowed steep roofs of tin which under the high morning sun lay an expanse of keenest splendor while many a grateful shadow dappled the fullfoliaged garden below two slim tall poplars stood against the gable of the chapel and shot their tops above its roof and under a porch near them two nuns sat motionless in the sun blackrobed with black veils falling over their shoulders and their white faces lost in the white linen that draped them from breast to crown their hands lay quiet in their laps and they seemed unconscious of the other nuns walking in the gardenpaths with little children their pupils and answering their laughter from time to time with voices as simple and innocent as their own kitty looked down upon them all with a swelling heart they were but figures in a beautiful picture of something old and poetical but she loved them and pitied them and was most happy in them the same as if they had been real it could not be that they and she were in the same world she must be dreaming over a book in charleys room at eriecreek she shaded her eyes for a better look when the noonday gun boomed from the citadel the bell upon the chapel jangled harshly and those strange maskers those quaint black birds with white breasts and faces flocked indoors at the same time a small dog under her window howled dolorously at the jangling of the bell and kitty with an impartial joy turned from the pensive romance of the convent garden to the mild comedy of the scene to which his woeful note attracted her when he had uttered his anguish he relapsed into the quietest small french dog that ever was and lay down near a large tranquil cat whom neither the bell nor he had been able to stir from her slumbers in the sun a peasantlike old man kept on sawing wood and a little child stood still amidst the larkspurs and marigolds of a tiny garden while over the flowerpots on the low windowsill of the neighboring house to which it belonged a young motherly face gazed peacefully out the great extent of the convent grounds had left this poor garden scarce breathingspace for its humble blooms with the low paling fence that separated it from the adjoining houseyards it looked like a toygarden or the background of a puppetshow and in its way it was as quaintly unreal to the young girl as the nunnery itself  when she saw it first the citys walls and other warlike ostentations had taken her imagination with the historic grandeur of quebec but the fascination deepened now that she was admitted as it were to the religious heart and the domestic privacy of the famous old town she was romantic as most good young girls are and she had the same pleasure in the strangeness of the things about her as she would have felt in the keeping of a charming story to fannys well kitty i suppose all this just suits you when she had returned to the little parlor where the sufferer lay she answered with a sigh of irrepressible content o yes could anything be more beautiful and her enraptured eye dwelt upon the low ceilings the deep wide chimneys eloquent of the mighty fires with which they must roar in winter the french windows with their curious and clumsy fastenings and every little detail that made the place alien and precious  fanny broke into a laugh at the visionary absence in her face  do you think the place is good enough for your hero and heroine asked she slyly for kitty had one of those family reputes so hard to survive for childish attempts of her own in the world of fiction where so great part of her life had been passed and mrs ellison who was as unliterary a soul as ever breathed admired her with the heartiness which unimaginative people often feel for their idealizing friends and believed that she was always deep in the mysteries of some plot  o i dont know kitty answered with a little color about heroes and heroines but id like to live here myself yes she continued rather to herself than to her listener i do believe this is what i was made for ive always wanted to live amongst old things in a stone house with dormerwindows why there isnt a single dormerwindow in eriecreek nor even a brick house let alone a stone one o yes indeed i was meant for an old country  well then kitty i dont see what youre to do but to marry east and live east or else find a rich husband and get him to take you to europe to live  yes or get him to come and live in quebec thats all id ask and he neednt be a very rich man for that  why you poor child what sort of husband could you get to settle down in this dead old place  o i suppose some kind of artist or literary man  this was not mrs ellisons notion of the kind of husband who was to realize for kitty her fancy for life in an old country but she was content to let the matter rest for the present and in a serene thankfulness to the power that had brought two marriageable young creatures together beneath the same roof and under her own observance she composed herself among the sofacushions from which she meant to conduct the campaign against mr arbuton with relentless vigor  well she said it wont be fair if you are not happy in this world kitty you ask so little of it while kitty turned to the window overlooking the street and lost herself in the drama of the passing figures below they were new and yet oddly familiar for she had long known them in the realm of romance the peasantwomen who went by in hats of felt or straw some on foot with baskets and some in their light marketcarts were all in their wrinkled and crooked age or their freshfaced stronglimbed youth her friends since childhood in many a tale of france or germany and the blackrobed priests who mixed with the passers on the narrow wooden sidewalk and now and then courteously gave way or lifted their widerimmed hats in a grave smiling salutation were more recent acquaintances but not less intimate they were out of old romances about italy and spain in which she was very learned and this butchers boy tilting along through the crowd with a halfstaggering run was from any one of dickenss stories and she divined that the fourarmed wooden trough on his shoulder was the butchers tray which figures in every novelists description of a london streetcrowd there were many other types as french mothers of families with marketbaskets on their arms very pretty french schoolgirls with books under their arms wildlooking country boys with red raspberries in birchbark measures and quiet gliding nuns with white hoods and downcast faces each of whom she unerringly relegated to an appropriate corner of her world of unreality a young mildfaced spectacled anglican curate she did not give a moments pause but rushed him instantly through the whole series of anthony trollopes novels which dull books i am sorry to say she had read and liked every one and then she began to find various people astray out of thackeray the trig corporal with the little visorless cap worn so jauntily the light stick carried in one hand and the broadsealed official document in the other had also in his breastpocket one of those brief infrequent missives which lieutenant osborne used to send to poor amelia a tall awkward officer did duty for major dobbin and when a very pretty lady driving a pony carriage with a footman in livery on the little perch behind her drew rein beside the pavement and a handsome young captain in a splendid uniform saluted her and began talking with her in a languid affected way it was osborne recreant to the thought of his betrothed one of whose tender letters he kept twirling in his fingers while he talked  most of the people whom she saw passing had letters or papers and in fact they were coming from the postoffice where the noonday mails had just been opened so she went on turning substance into shadowunless indeed flesh and blood is the illusionand as i am bound to own catching at very slight pretexts in many cases for the exercise of her sorcery when her eye fell upon a gentleman at a little distance at the same moment he raised his eyes from a letter at which he had been glancing and ran them along the row of houses opposite till they rested on the window at which she stood then he smiled and lifted his hat and with a start she recognized mr arbuton while a certain chill struck to her heart through the tumult she felt there till he saw her there had been such a cold reserve and hauteur in his bearing that the trepidation which she had felt about him at times the day before and which had worn quite away under the events of the morning was renewed again and the aspect in which he had been so strange that she did not know him seemed the only one that he had ever worn this effect lasted till mr arbuton could find his way to her and place in her eager hand a letter from the girls and dr ellison she forgot it then and vanished till she read her letter     v  mr arbuton makes himself agreeable   the first care of colonel ellison had been to call a doctor and to know the worst about the sprained ankle upon which his plans had fallen lame and the worst was that it was not a bad sprain but mrs ellison having been careless of it the day before had aggravated the hurt and she must now have that perfect rest which physicians prescribe so recklessly of other interests and duties for a week at least and possibly two or three  the colonel was still too much a soldier to be impatient at the doctors order but he was of far too active a temper to be quiet under it he therefore proposed to himself nothing less than the capture of quebec in an historical sense and even before dinner he began to prepare for the campaign he sallied forth and descended upon the bookstores wherever he found them lurking in whatsoever recess of the upper or lower town and returned home laden with guidebooks to quebec and monographs upon episodes of local history such as are produced in great quantity by the semiclerical literary taste of outoftheway catholic capitals the colonel who had gone actively into business after leaving the army at the close of the war had always a newspaper somewhere about him but he was not a reader of many books of the volumes in the doctors library he had never in former days willingly opened any but the plays of shakespeare and don quixote long passages of which he knew by heart he had sometimes attempted other books but for the most of kittys favorite authors he professed as frank a contempt as for the moundbuilders themselves he had read one book of travel namely the innocents abroad which he held to be so good a book that he need never read anything else about the countries of which it treated when he brought in this extraordinary collection of pamphlets both kitty and fanny knew what to expect for the colonel was as ready to receive literature at secondhand as to avoid its original sources he had in this way picked up a great deal of useful knowledge and he was famous for clipping from newspapers scraps of instructive fact all of which he relentlessly remembered he had already a fair outline of the local history in his mind and this had been deepened and freshened by dr ellisons recent talk of his historical studies moreover he had secured in the course of the present journey from his wifes and cousins reading of divers guidebooks a new store of names and dates which he desired to attach to the proper localities with their help  light reading for leisure hours fanny said kitty looking askance at the colonels literature as she sat down near her cousin after dinner  yes and you start fair ladies start with jacques cartier ancient mariner of dieppe in the year 1535 no favoritism in this investigation no bringing forward of champlain or montcalm prematurely no running off on subsequent conquests or other sideissues stick to the discovery and the names of jacques cartier and donnacona come do something for an honest living  who was donnacona demanded mrs ellison with indifference  that is just what these fascinating little volumes will tell us kitty read something to your suffering cousins about donnaconahe sounds uncommonly like an irishman answered the colonel establishing himself in an easychair and kitty picked up a small sketch of the history of quebec and opening it fell into the trance which came upon her at the touch of a book and read on for some pages to herself  well upon my word said the colonel i might as well be reading about donnacona myself for any comfort i get  o dick i forgot i was just looking now im really going to commence  no not yet cried mrs ellison rising on her elbow where is mr arbuton  what has he to do with donnacona my dear  everything you know hes stayed on our account and i never heard of anything so impolite so inhospitable as offering to read without him go and call him richard do  o no pleaded kitty he wont care about it dont call him dick  why kitty im surprised at you when you read so beautifully yon neednt be ashamed im sure  im not ashamed but at the same time i dont want to read to him  well call him any way colonel hes in his room  if you do said kitty with superfluous dignity i must go away  very well kitty just as you please only i want richard to witness that im not to blame if mr arbuton thinks us unfeeling or neglectful  o if he doesnt say what he thinks itll make no difference  it seems to me that this is a good deal of fuss to make about one human being a mere passing man and brother of a day isnt it said the colonel go on with donnacona do  there came a knock at the door kitty leaped nervously to her feet and fled out of the room but it was only the little french servingmaid upon some errand which she quickly despatched  well now what do you think asked mrs ellison  why i think youve a surprising knowledge of french for one who studied it at school do you suppose she understood you  o nonsense you know i mean kitty and her very queer behavior richard if you moon at me in that stupid way she continued i shall certainly end in an insane asylum cant you see whats under your very nose  yes i can fanny answered the colonel if anythings there but i give you my word i dont know any more than millions yet unborn what youre driving at the colonel took up the book which kitty had thrown down and went to his room to try to read up donnacona for himself while his wife penitently turned to a pamphlet in french which he had bought with the others after all she thought men will be men and seemed not to find the fact wholly wanting in consolation  a few minutes after there was a murmur of voices in the entry without at a window looking upon the convent garden where it happened to mr arbuton descending from his attic chamber to find kitty standing a pretty shape against the reflected light of the convent roofs and amidst a little greenery of houseplants tall geraniums an overarching ivy some delicate roses she had paused there on her way from fannys to her own room and was looking into the garden where a pair of silent nuns were pacing up and down the paths turning now their backs with the heavy sable coiffure sweeping their black robes and now their still masklike faces set in that stiff framework of white linen sometimes they came so near that she could distinguish their features and imagine an expression that she should know if she saw them again and while she stood selfforgetfully feigning a character for each of them mr arbuton spoke to her and took his place at her side  were remarkably favored in having this bit of opera under our windows miss ellison he said and smiled as kitty answered o is it really like an opera i never saw one but i could imagine it must be beautiful and they both looked on in silence a moment while the nuns moved shadowlike out of the garden and left it empty  then mr arbuton said something to which kitty answered simply ill see if my cousin doesnt want me and presently stood beside mrs ellisons sofa a little conscious in color fanny mr arbuton has asked me to go and see the cathedral with him do you think it would be right  mrs ellisons triumphant heart rose to her lips why you dear particular innocent little goose she cried flinging her arms about kitty and kissing her till the young girl blushed again of course it would go you mustnt stay mewed up in here i shant be able to go about with you and if i can judge by the colonels breathing as he calls it from the room in there he wont at present but the idea of your having a question of propriety and indeed it was the first time kitty had ever had such a thing and the remembrance of it put a kind of constraint upon her as she strolled demurely beside mr arbuton towards the cathedral  you must be guide said he for this is my first day in quebec you know and you are an old inhabitant in comparison  ill show the way she answered if youll interpret the sights i think i must be stranger to them than you in spite of my long residence sometimes im afraid that i do only fancy i enjoy these things as mrs march said for ive no european experiences to contrast them with i know that it seems very delightful though and quite like what i should expect in europe  youd expect very little of europe then in most things though theres no disputing that its a very pretty illusion of the old world  a few steps had brought them into the marketsquare in front of the cathedral where a little belated traffic still lingered in the few old peasantwomen hovering over baskets of such fruits and vegetables as had long been out of season in the states and the housekeepers and servingmaids cheapening these wares a sentry moved mechanically up and down before the high portal of the jesuit barracks over the arch of which were still the letters i h s carved long ago upon the keystone and the ancient edifice itself with its yellow stucco front and its grated windows had every right to be a monastery turned barracks in france or italy a row of quaint stone housesinns and shopsformed the upper side of the square while the modern buildings of the rue fabrique on the lower side might serve very well for that show of improvement which deepens the sentiment of the neighboring antiquity and decay in latin towns as for the cathedral which faced the convent from across the square it was as cold and torpid a bit of renaissance as could be found in rome itself a redcoated soldier or two passed through the square three or four neat little french policemen lounged about in blue uniforms and flaring havelocks some walnutfaced blueeyed old citizens and peasants sat upon the thresholds of the row of old houses and gazed dreamily through the smoke of their pipes at the slight stir and glitter of shopping about the fine stores of the rue fabrique an air of serene disoccupation pervaded the place with which the occasional riot of the drivers of the long row of calashes and carriages in front of the cathedral did not discord whenever a stray american wandered into the square there was a wild flight of these drivers towards him and his person was lost to sight amidst their pantomime they did not try to underbid each other and they were perfectly goodhumored as soon as he had made his choice the rejected multitude returned to their places on the curbstone pursuing the successful aspirant with inscrutable jokes as he drove off while the horses went on munching the contents of their leathern headbags and tossing them into the air to shake down the lurking grains of corn  it is like europe your friends were right said mr arbuton as they escaped into the cathedral from one of these friendly onsets its quite the atmosphere of foreign travel and you ought to be able to realize the feelings of a tourist  a priest was saying mass at one of the sidealtars assisted by acolytes in their everyday clothes and outside of the railing a marketwoman with a basket of chokecherries knelt among a few other poor people presently a young english couple came in he with a dashing india scarf about his hat and she very stylishly dressed who also made their genuflections with the rest and then sat down and dropped their heads in prayer  this is like enough europe too murmured mr arbuton its very good north italy or south for the matter of that  o is it answered kitty joyously i thought it must be and she added in that trustful way of hers its all very familiar but then it seems to me on this journey that ive seen a great many things that i know ive only read of before and so followed mr arbuton in his tour of the pictures  she was as ignorant of art as any roman or florentine girl whose life has been passed in the midst of it and she believed these mighty fine pictures and was puzzled by mr arbutons behavior towards them who was too little imaginative or too conscientious to make merit for them out of the things they suggested he treated the poor altarpieces of the quebec cathedral with the same harsh indifference he would have shown to the secondrate paintings of a european gallery doubted the vandyck and cared nothing for the conception in the style of le brun over the highaltar though it had the historical interest of having survived that bombardment of 1759 which destroyed the church  kitty innocently singled out the worst picture in the place as her favorite and then was piqued and presently frightened at his cold reluctance about it he made her feel that it was very bad and that she shared its inferiority though he said nothing to that effect she learned the shame of not being a connoisseur in a connoisseurs company and she perceived more painfully than ever before that a bostonian who had been much in europe might be very uncomfortable to the simple unravelled american yet she reminded herself the marches had been in europe and they were bostonians also and they did not go about putting everything under foot they seemed to care for everything they saw and to have a friendly jest if not praises for it she liked that she would have been well enough pleased to have mr arbuton laugh outright at her picture and she could have joined him in it but the look however flattered into an air of polite question at last which he had bent upon her seemed to outlaw her and condemn her taste in everything as they passed out of the cathedral she would rather have gone home than continued the walk as he begged her if she were not tired to do but this would have been flight and she was not a coward so they sauntered down the rue fabrique and turned into palace street as they went by the door of h√¥tel musty her pleasant friends came again into her mind and she said this is where we stayed last week with mr and mrs march  those boston people  yes  do you know where they live in boston  why we have their address but i cant think of it i believe somewhere in the southern part of the city  the south end  o yes thats it have you ever heard of them  no  i thought perhaps you might have known mr march hes in the insurance business  o no no i dont know him said mr arbuton eagerly kitty wondered if there could be anything wrong with the business repute of mr march but dismissed the thought as unworthy and having perceived that her friends were snubbed she said bravely that they were the most delightful people she had ever seen and she was sorry that they were not still in quebec he shared her regret tacitly if at all and they walked in silence to the gate whence they strolled down the winding street outside the wall into the lower town but it was not a pleasant ramble for kitty she was in a dim dread of hitherto unseen and unimagined trespasses against good taste not only in pictures and people but in all life which from having been a very smiling prospect when she set out with mr arbuton had suddenly become a narrow pathway in which one must pick ones way with more regard to each step than any general end all this was as obscure and uncertain as the intimations which had produced it and which in words had really amounted to nothing but she felt more and more that in her companion there was something wholly alien to the influences which had shaped her and though she could not know how much she was sure of enough to make her dreary in his presence  they wandered through the quaintness and noiseless bustle of the lower town thoroughfares and came by and by to that old church the oldest in quebec which was built near two hundred years ago in fulfilment of a vow made at the repulse of sir william phippss attack upon the city and further famed for the prophecy of a nun that this church should be ruined by the fire in which a successful attempt of the english was yet to involve the lower town a painting which represented the vision of the nun perished in the conflagration which verified it in 1759 but the walls of the ancient structure remain to witness this singular piece of history which kitty now glanced at furtively in one of the colonels guidebooks since her illfortune with the picture in the cathedral she had not openly cared for anything  at one side of the church there was a booth for the sale of crockery and tin ware and there was an everyday cheerfulness of small business in the shops and tented stands about the square on which the church faced and through which there was continual passing of heavy burdens from the port swift calashes and slow countrypaced marketcarts  mr arbuton made no motion to enter the church and kitty would not hint the curiosity she felt to see the interior and while they lingered a moment the door opened and a peasant came out with a little coffin in his arms his eyes were dim and his face wet with weeping and he bore the little coffin tenderly as if his caress might reach the dead child within behind him she came who must be the mother her face deeply hidden in her veil beside the pavement waited a shabby calash with a driver half asleep on his perch and the man still clasping his precious burden clambered into the vehicle and laid it upon his knees while the woman groped through her tears and veil for the step kitty and her companion had moved reverently aside but now mr arbuton came forward and helped the woman to her place she gave him a hoarse sad merci and spread a fold of her shawl fondly over the end of the little coffin the drowsy driver whipped up his beast and the calash jolted away  kitty cast a grateful glance upon mr arbuton as they now entered the church by a common impulse on their way towards the highaltar they passed the rude black bier with the tallow candles yet smoking in their black wooden candlesticks a few worshippers were dropped here and there in the vacant seats and at a principal sidealtar knelt a poor woman praying before a wooden effigy of the dead christ that lay in a glass case under the altar the image was of lifesize and was painted to represent life or rather death with false hair and beard and with the muslin drapery managed to expose the stigmata it was stretched upon a bed strewn with artificial flowers and it was dreadful but the poor soul at her devotions there prayed to it in an ecstasy of supplication flinging her arms asunder with imploring gesture clasping her hands and bowing her head upon them while her person swayed from side to side in the abandon of her prayer who could she be and what was her mighty need of blessing or forgiveness as her wont was kitty threw her own soul into the imagined case of the suppliant the tragedy of her desire or sorrow yet like all who suffer sympathetically she was not without consolations unknown to the principal and the waning afternoon as it lit up the conventional ugliness of the old church and the paraphernalia of its worship relieved her emotional selfabandon with a remote sense of content so that it may have been a jealousy for the integrity of her own revery as well as a feeling for the poor woman that made her tremble lest mr arbuton should in some way disparage the spectacle i suppose that her interest in it was more an aesthetic than a spiritual one it embodied to her sight many a scene of penitence that had played before her fancy and i do not know but she would have been willing to have the suppliant guilty of some dreadful misdeed rather than eating meat last friday which was probably her sin however it was the ancient crone before that ghastly idol was precious to her and it seemed too great a favor when at last the suppliant wiped her eyes rose trembling from her knees and approaching kitty stretched towards her a shaking palm for charity  it was a touch that transfigured all and gave even mr arbutons neutrality a light of ideal character he bestowed the alms craved of him in turn he did not repulse the beldames blessing and kitty who was already moved by his kindness to that poor mourner at the door forgot that the earlier part of their walk had been so miserable and climbed back to the upper town through the prescott gate in greater gayety than she had yet known that day in his company i think he had not done much to make her cheerful but it is one of the advantages of a temperament like his that very little is expected of it and that it can more easily than any other make the human heart glad at the least softening in it the soul frolics with a craven lightsomeness for this reason kitty was able to enjoy with novel satisfaction the picturesqueness of mountain street and they both admired the huge shoulder of rock near the gate with its poplars atop and the battery at the brink with the muzzles of the guns thrust forward against the sky she could not move him to her pleasure in the grotesqueness of the circusbills plastered halfway up the rock but he tolerated the levity with which she commented on them and her light sallies upon passing things and he said nothing to prevent her reaching home in serene satisfaction  well kitty said the tenant of the sofa as kitty and the colonel drew up to the table on which the tea was laid at the sofaside youve had a nice walk havent you  o yes very nice that is the first part of it wasnt very nice but after a while we reached an old church in the lower townwhich was very interestingand then we appeared to cheer up and take a new start  well asked the colonel what did you find so interesting at that old church  why there was a babys funeral and an old woman perfectly crushed by some trouble or other praying before an altar and  it seems to take very little to cheer you up said the colonel all you ask of your fellowbeings is a heartbreaking bereavement and a religious agony and you are lively at once some people might require human sacrifices but you dont  kitty looked at her cousin a moment with vague amaze the grossness of the absurdity flashed upon her and she felt as if another touch must bring the tears she said nothing but mrs ellison who saw only that she was cut off from her hearts desire of gossip came to the rescue  dont answer a word kitty not a single word i never heard anything more insulting from one cousin to another and i should say it if i was brought into a court of justice  a sudden burst of laughter from kitty who hid her conscious face in her hands interrupted mrs ellisons defence  well said mrs ellison piqued at her desertion i hope you understand yourselves i dont this was mrs ellisons attitude towards her husbands whole family who on their part never had been able to account for the colonels choice except as a joke and sometimes questioned if he had not perhaps carried the joke too far though they loved her too for a kind of passionate generosity and sublime inconsequent unselfishness about her  what i want to know now said the colonel as soon as kitty would let him and ill try to put it as politely as i can is simply this what made the first part of your walk so disagreeable you didnt see a weddingparty or a child rescued from a horrible death or a man saved from drowning or anything of that kind did you  but the colonel would have done better not to say anything his wife was made peevish by his persistence and the loss of the harmless pleasure upon which she had counted in the history of kittys walk with mr arbuton kitty herself would not laugh again in fact she grew serious and thoughtful and presently took up a book and after that went to her own room where she stood awhile at her window and looked out on the garden of the ursulines the moon hung full orb in the stainless heaven and deepened the mystery of the paths and trees and lit the silvery roofs and chimneys of the convent with tender effulgence a wandering odor of leaf and flower stole up from the garden but she perceived the sweetness like the splendor with veiled senses she was turning over in her thought the incidents of her walk and trying to make out if anything had really happened first to provoke her against mr arbuton and then to reconcile her to him had he said or done anything about her favorite painting which she hated now or the marches to offend her or if it had been his tone and manner was his afterconduct at the old church sufficient penance what was it he had done that common humanity did not require was he so very superior to common humanity that she should meekly rejoice at his kindness to the afflicted mother why need she have cared for his forbearance toward the rapt devotee she became aware that she was ridiculous dick was right she confessed and i will not let myself be made a goose of and when the bugle at the citadel called the soldiers to rest and the harsh chapelbell bade the nuns go dream of heaven she also fell asleep a smile on her lips and a light heart in her breast     vi  a letter of kittys       quebec august  1870      dear girls since the letter i wrote you a day or two after we got     here we have been going on very much as you might have expected a     whole week has passed but we still bear our enforced leisure with     fortitude and though boston and new york are both fading into the     improbable as far as we are concerned quebec continues     inexhaustible and i dont begrudge a moment of the time we are     giving it      fanny still keeps her sofa the first enthusiasm of her affliction     has worn away and she has nothing to sustain her now but planning     our expeditions about the city she has got the map and the history     of quebec by heart and she holds us to the literal fulfilment of her     instructions on this account she often has to send dick and me out     together when she would like to keep him with her for she wont     trust either of us alone and when we come back she examines us     separately to see whether we have skipped anything this makes us     faithful in the smallest things she says she is determined that     uncle jack shall have a full and circumstantial report from me of all     that he wants to know about the celebrated places here and i really     think he will if i go on or am goaded on in this way its pure     devotion to the cause in fanny for you know she doesnt care for     such things herself and has no pleasure in it but carrying a point     her chief consolation under her trial of keeping still is to see how     i look in her different dresses she sighs over me as i appear in a     new garment and says o if she only had the dressing of me then     she gets up and limps and hops across the room to where i stand     before the glass and puts a pin here and a ribbon there and gives     my hair which she has dressed herself a little dab to make it lie     differently and then scrambles back to her sofa and knocks her lame     ankle against something and lies there groaning and enjoying herself     like a martyr on days when she thinks she is never going to get     well she says she doesnt know why she doesnt give me her things at     once and be done with it and on days when she thinks she is going to     get well right away she says she will have me one made something     like whatever dress i have got on as soon as shes home then up     shell jump again for the exact measure and tell me the history of     every stitch and how shell have it altered just the least grain     and differently trimmed to suit my complexion better and ends by     having promised to get me something not in the least like it you     have some idea already of what fanny is and all you have got to do     is to multiply it by about fifty thousand her sprained ankle simply     intensifies her whole character      besides helping to compose fannys expeditionary corps and really     exerting himself in the cause of uncle jack as he calls it dick is     behaving beautifully every morning after breakfast he goes over to     the hotel and looks at the arrivals and reads the newspapers and     though we never get anything out of him afterwards we somehow feel     informed of all that is going on he has taken to smoking a clay pipe     in honor of the canadian fashion and he wears a gay barbaric scarf     of indian muslin wound round his hat and flying out behind because     the quebeckers protect themselves in that way against sunstroke when     the thermometer gets up among the sixties he has also bought a pair     of snowshoes to be prepared for the other extreme of weather in     case anything else should happen to fanny and detain us into the     winter when he has rested from his walk to the hotel we usually go     out together and explore as we do also in the afternoon and in the     evening we walk on durham terracea promenade overlooking the     river where the whole cramped and crooked city goes for exercise     its a formal parade in the evening but one morning i went there     before breakfast for a change and found it the resort of careless     ease two or three idle boys were sunning themselves on the carriages     of the big guns that stand on the terrace a little dog was barking     at the chimneys of the lower town and an old gentleman was walking     up and down in his dressinggown and slippers just as if it were     his own front porch he looked something like uncle jack and i     wished it had been heto see the smoke curling softly up from the     lower town the bustle about the marketplace and the shipping in     the river and the haze hanging over the water a little way off and     the near hills all silver and the distant ones blue      but if we are coming to the grand and the beautiful why there is no     direction in which you can look about quebec without seeing it and     it is always mixed up with something so familiar and homelike that     my heart warms to it the jesuit barracks are just across the street     from us in the foreground of the most magnificent landscape the     building isthink you eriecreekers of an hourtwo hundred years     old and it looks five hundred the english took it away from the     jesuits in 1760 and have used it as barracks ever since but it     isnt in the least changed so that a jesuit missionary who visited     it the other day said that it was as if his brother priests had been     driven out of it the week before well you might think so old and so     historical a place would be putting on airs but it takes as kindly     to domestic life as a new framehouse and i am never tired of     looking over into the yard at the frowsy soldiers wives hanging     out clothes and the unkempt children playing among the burdocks and     chickens and cats and the soldiers themselves carrying about the     officers boots or sawing wood and picking up chips to boil the     teakettle they are off dignity as well as off duty then but when     they are on both and in full dress they make our volunteers as i     remember them seem very shabby and slovenly      over the belfry of the barracks our windows command a view of half     quebec with its roofs and spires dropping down the slope to the     lower town where the masts of the ships in the river come tapering     up among them and then of the plain stretching from the river in the     valley to a range of mountains against the horizon with faroff     white villages glimmering out of their purple folds the whole plain     is bright with houses and harvestfields and the distinctly divided     farmsthe owners cut them up every generation and give each son a     strip of the entire lengthrun back on either hand from the     straight roads bordered by poplars while the highways near the city     pass between lovely villas      but this landscape and the jesuit barracks with all their merits     are nothing to the ursuline convent just under our back windows     which i told you something about in my other letter we have been     reading up its history since and we know about madame de la peltrie     the noble norman lady who founded it in 1640 she was very rich and     very beautiful and a saint from the beginning so that when her     husband died and her poor old father wanted her to marry again and     not go into a nunnery she didnt mind cheating him by a sham     marriage with a devout gentleman and she came to canada as soon as     her father was dead with another saint marie de lincarnation and     founded this convent the first building is standing yet as strong     as ever though everything but the stone walls was burnt two     centuries ago only a few years since an old ashtree under which     the ursulines first taught the indian children blew down and now a     large black cross marks its place the modern nuns are in the garden     nearly the whole morning long and by night the ghosts of the former     nuns haunt it and in very bright moonlight i myself do a bit of     madame de la peltrie there and teach little indian boys who dwindle     like those in the song as the moon goes down it is an enchanted     place and i wish we had it in the back yard at eriecreek though i     dont think the neighbors would approve of the architecture i have     adopted two nuns for my own one is tall and slender and pallid and     you can see at a glance that she broke the heart of a mortal lover     and knew it when she became the bride of heaven and the other is     short and plain and plump and looks as comfortable and commonplace     as lifeafterdinner when the world is bright i revel in the     statuelike sadness of the beautiful nun who never laughs or plays     with the little girl pupils but when the world is darkas the best     of worlds will be at times for a minute or twoi take to the fat     nun and go in for a clumsy romp with the children and then i fancy     that i am wiser if not better than the fair slim ursuline but     whichever i am for the time being i am vexed with the other yet     they always are together as if they were counterparts i think a     nice story might be written about them      in wolfes siege of quebec this ursuline garden of ours was     everywhere torn up by the falling bombs and the sisters were driven     out into the world they had forsaken forever as fanny has been     reading in a little french account of the events written at the     time by a nun of the general hospital it was there the ursulines     took what refuge there was going from their cloistered schoolrooms     and their innocent little ones to the wards of the hospital filled     with the wounded and dying of either side and echoing with their     dreadful groans what a sad evil bewildering world they had a     glimpse of in the garden here our poor montcalmi belong to the     french side please in quebecwas buried in a grave dug for him by     a bursting shell they have his skull now in the chaplains room of     the convent where we saw it the other day they have made it     comfortable in a glass box neatly bound with black and covered with     a white lace drapery just as if it were a saints it was broken a     little in taking it out of the grave and a few years ago some     english officers borrowed it to look at and were horrible enough to     pull out some of the teeth tell uncle jack the head is very broad     above the ears but the forehead is small      the chaplain also showed us a copy of an old painting of the first     convent indian lodges madame de la peltries house and madame     herself very splendidly dressed with an indian chief before her     and some french cavaliers riding down an avenue towards her then he     showed us some of the nuns work in albums painted and lettered in a     way to give me an idea of old missals by and by he went into the     chapel with us and it gave such a queer notion of his indoors life     to have him put on an overcoat and indiarubbers to go a few rods     through the open air to the chapel door he had not been very well     he said when he got in he took off his hat and put on an octagonal     priests cap and showed us everything in the kindest wayand his     manners were exquisite there were beautiful paintings sent out from     france at the time of the revolution and woodcarvings round the     highaltar done by quebec artists in the beginning of the last     century for he said they had a school of arts then at st annes     twenty miles below the city then there was an ivory crucifix so     lifelike that you could scarcely bear to look at it but what i most     cared for was the tiny twinkle of a votive lamp which he pointed out     to us in one corner of the nuns chapel it was lit a hundred and     fifty years ago by two of our french officers when their sister took     the veil and has never been extinguished since except during the     siege of 1759 of course i think a story might be written about     this and the truth is the possibilities of fiction in quebec are     overpowering i go about in a perfect haze of romances and meet     people at every turn who have nothing to do but invite the passing     novelist into their houses and have their likenesses done at once     for heroes and heroines they neednt change a thing about them but     sit just as they are and if this is in the present only think how     the whole past of quebec must be crying out to be put into historical     romances      i wish you could see the houses and how substantial they are i     can only think of eriecreek as an assemblage of huts and barklodges     in contrast our boardinghouse is comparatively slight and has     stone walls only a foot and a half thick but the average is two     feet and two and a half and the other day dick went through the     laval universityhe goes everywhere and gets acquainted with     everybodyand saw the foundation walls of the first building which     have stood all the sieges and conflagrations since the seventeenth     century and no wonder for they are six feet thick and form a     series of lowvaulted corridors as heavy he says as the casemates     of a fortress there is a beautiful old carved staircase there of     the same date and he liked the president a priest ever so much     and we like the looks of all the priests we see they are so handsome     and polite and they all speak english with some funny little     defect the other day we asked such a nice young priest about the     way to hare point where it is said the recollet friars had their     first mission on the marshy meadows he didnt know of this bit of     history and we showed him our book ah you see the book say     probably the site if it had said certainly i should have     known but probably probably you see however he showed     us the way and down we went through the lower town and out past the     general hospital to this pointe aux li√®vres which is famous also     because somewhere near it on the st charles jacques cartier     wintered in 1536 and kidnapped the indian king donnacona whom he     carried to france and it was here montcalms forces tried to rally     after their defeat by wolfe please read this several times to uncle     jack so that he can have it impressed upon him how faithful i am in     my historical researches      it makes me dreadfully angry and sad to think the french should have     been robbed of quebec after what they did to build it but it is     still quite a french city in everything even to sympathy with france     in this prussian war which you would hardly think they would care     about our landlady says the very boys in the street know about the     battles and explain every time the french are beaten how they were     outnumbered and betrayedsomething the way we used to do in the     first of our war      i suppose you will think i am crazy but i do wish uncle jack would     wind up his practice at eriecreek and sell the house and come to     live at quebec i have been asking prices of things and i find that     everything is very cheap even according to the eriecreek standard     we could get a beautiful house on the st louis road for two hundred     a year beef is ten or twelve cents a pound and everything else in     proportion then besides that the washing is sent out into the     country to be done by the peasantwomen and there isnt a crumb of     bread baked in the house but it all comes from the bakers and only     think girls what a relief that would be do get uncle jack to     consider it seriously      since i began this letter the afternoon has worn awaythe light from     the sunset on the mountains would glorify our suppertable without     extra charge if we lived hereand the twilight has passed and the     moon has come up over the gables and dormerwindows of the convent     and looks into the garden so invitingly that i cant help joining     her so i will put my writing by till tomorrow the goingtobed     bell has rung and the red lights have vanished one by one from the     windows and the nuns are asleep and another set of ghosts is     playing in the garden with the coppercolored phantoms of the indian     children of long ago what not madame de la peltrie oh how do they     like those little fibs of yours up in heaven      sunday afternoonas we were at the french cathedral last sunday     we went to the english today and i could easily have imagined     myself in some church of old england hearing the royal family prayed     for and listening to the pretty poor sermon delivered with such an     english brogue the people too had such englishy faces and such     queer little eccentricities of dress the young lady that sang     contralto in the choir wore a scarf like a mans on her hat the     cathedral isnt much architecturally i suppose but it affected me     very solemnly and i couldnt help feeling that it was as much a part     of british power and grandeur as the citadel itself over the     bishops seat drooped the flag of a crimean regiment tattered by     time and battles which was hung up here with great ceremonies in     1860 when the prince of wales presented them with new colors and up     in the gallery was a kind of glorified pew for royal highnesses and     governorgenerals and so forth to sit in when they are here there     are tablets and monumental busts about the walls and one to the     memory of the duke of lenox the governorgeneral who died in the     middle of the last century from the bite of a fox which seemed an     odd fate for a duke and somehow made me very sorry for him      fanny of course couldnt go to church with me and dick got out of     it by lingering too late over the newspapers at the hotel and so i     trudged off with our bostonian who is still with us here i didnt     dwell much upon him in my last letter and i dont believe now i can     make him quite clear to you he has been a good deal abroad and he     is europeanized enough not to think much of america though i cant     find that he quite approves of europe and his experience seems not     to have left him any particular country in either hemisphere      he isnt the bostonian of uncle jacks imagination and i suspect he     wouldnt like to be he is rather too young still to have much of     an antislavery record and even if he had lived soon enough i think     that he would not have been a john brown man i am afraid that he     believes in vulgar and meretricious distinctions of all sorts and     that he hasnt an atom of magnanimous democracy in him in fact i     find to my great astonishment that some ideas which i thought were     held only in england and which i had never seriously thought of     seem actually a part of mr arbutons nature or education he talks     about the lower classes and tradesmen and the best people and good     families as i supposed nobody in this country ever didin     earnest to be sure i have always been reading of characters who had     such opinions but i thought they were just put into novels to eke     out somebodys unhappinessto keep the highborn daughter from     marrying beneath her for love and so on or else to be made fun of     in the person of some silly old woman or some odious snob and i     could hardly believe at first that our bostonian was serious in     talking in that way such things sound so differently in real life     and i laughed at them till i found that he didnt know what to make     of my laughing and then i took leave to differ with him in some of     his notions but he never disputes anything i say and so makes it     seem rude to differ with him i always feel though he begins it     as if i had thrust my opinions upon him but in spite of his     weaknesses and disagreeabilities there is something really high     about him he is so scrupulously true so exactly just that uncle     jack himself couldnt be more so though you can see that he respects     his virtues as the peculiar result of some extraordinary system here     at quebec though he goes round patronizing the landscape and the     antiquities and coldly smiling at my little enthusiasms there is     really a great deal that ought to be at least improving in him i get     to paying him the same respect that he pays himself and imbues his     very clothes with till everything he has on appears to look like him     and respect itself accordingly i have often wondered what his hat     his honored hat for instance would do if i should throw it out of     the front window it would make an earthquake i believe      he is politely curious about us and from time to time in a     shrinking disgusted way he asks some leading question about     eriecreek which he doesnt seem able to form any idea of as much     as i explain it he clings to his original notion that it is in the     heart of the oil regions of which he has seen pictures in the     illustrated papers and when i assert myself against his opinions he     treats me very gingerly as if i were an explosive sprite or an     inflammable naiad from a torpedoed well and it wouldnt be quite     safe to oppose me or i would disappear with a flash and a bang      when dick isnt able to go with me on fannys account mr arbuton     takes his place in the expeditionary corps and we have visited a     good many points of interest together and now and then he talks very     entertainingly about his travels but i dont think they have made     him very cosmopolitan it seems as if he went about with a little     imaginary standard and was chiefly interested in things to see     whether they fitted it or not trifling matters annoy him and when     he finds sublimity mixed up with absurdity it almost makes him     angry one of the oddest and oldestlooking buildings in quebec is a     little onestory house on st louis street to which poor general     montgomery was taken after he was shot and it is a pastrycooks     now and the tarts and cakes in the window vexed mr arbuton so     muchnot that he seemed to care for montgomerythat i didnt dare     to laugh      i live very little in the nineteenth century at present and do not     care much for people who do still i have a few grains of affection     left for uncle jack which i want you to give him      i suppose it will take about six stamps to pay this letter i forgot     to say that dick goes to be barbered every day at the montcalm     shaving and shampooing saloon so called because they say montcalm     held his last council of war there it is a queer little steeproofed     house with a flowering bean up the front and a bit of garden full     of snapdragons before it      we shall be here a week or so yet at any rate and then i think we     shall go straight home dick has lost so much time already      with a great deal of love      your kitty     vii  loves young dream   with the two young people whose days now lapsed away together it could not be said that monday varied much from tuesday or ten oclock from half past three they were not always certain what day of the week it was and sometimes they fancied that a thing which happened in the morning had taken place yesterday afternoon  but whatever it was and however uncertain in time and character their slight adventure was to themselves mrs ellison secured all possible knowledge of it from kitty since it was her misfortune that promoted it she considered herself a martyr to kittys acquaintance with mr arbuton and believed that she had the best claim to any gossip that could come of it she lounged upon her sofa and listened with a patience superior to the maiden caprice with which her inquisition was sometimes met for if that delayed her satisfaction it also employed her arts and the final triumph of getting everything out of kitty afforded her a delicate selfflattery but commonly the young girl was ready enough to speak for she was glad to have the light of a worldlier mind and a greater experience than her own on mr arbutons character if mrs ellison was not the wisest head still talking him over was at least a relief from thinking him over and then at the end of the ends when were ever two women averse to talk of a man  she commonly sought fannys sofa when she returned from her rambles through the city and gave a sufficiently strict account of what had happened this was done lightheartedly and with touches of burlesque and extravagance at first but the reports grew presently to have a more serious tone and latterly kitty had been so absent at times that she would fall into a puzzled silence in the midst of her narration or else she would meet a long procession of skilfully marshalled questions with a flippancy that no one but a martyr could have suffered but mrs ellison bore all and would have borne much more in that cause battled at one point she turned to another and the sum of her researches was often a clearer perception of kittys state of mind than the young girl herself possessed for her indeed the whole affair was full of mystery and misgiving  our acquaintance has the charm of novelty every time we meet she said once when pressed hard by mrs ellison we are growing better strangers mr arbuton and i by and by some morning we shall not know each other by sight i can barely recognize him now though i thought i knew him pretty well once i want you to understand that i speak as an unbiassed spectator fanny  o kitty how can you accuse me of trying to pry into your affairs cries injured mrs ellison and settles herself in a more comfortable posture for listening  i dont accuse you of anything im sure youve a right to know everything about me only i want you really to know  yes dear says the matron with hypocritical meekness  well resumes kitty there are things that puzzle me more and more about himthings that used to amuse me at first because i didnt actually believe that they could be and that i felt like defying afterwards but now i cant bear up against them they frighten me and seem to deny me the right to be what i believe i am  i dont understand you kitty  why youve seen how it is with us at home and how uncle jack has brought us up we never had a rule for anything except to do what was right and to be careful of the rights of others  well  well mr arbuton seems to have lived in a world where everything is regulated by some rigid law that it would be death to break then you know at home we are always talking about people and discussing them but we always talk of each person for what he is in himself and i always thought a person could refine himself if he tried and was sincere and not conceited but he seems to judge people according to their origin and locality and calling and to believe that all refinement must come from just such training and circumstances as his own without exactly saying so he puts everything else quite out of the question he doesnt appear to dream that there can be any different opinion he tramples upon all that i have been taught to believe and though i cling the closer to my idols i cant help now and then trying myself by his criterions and then i find myself wanting in every civilized trait and my whole life coarse and poor and all my associations hopelessly degraded i think his ideas are hard and narrow and i believe that even my little experience would prove them false but then they are his and i cant reconcile them with what i see is good in him  kitty spoke with halfaverted face where she sat beside one of the front windows looking absently out on the distant line of violet hills beyond charlesbourg and now and then lifting her glove from her lap and letting it drop again  kitty said mrs ellison in reply to her difficulties you oughtnt to sit against a light like that it makes your profile quite black to any one back in the room  o well fanny im not black in reality  yes but a young lady ought always to think how she is looking suppose some one was to come in  dicks the only one likely to come in just now and he wouldnt mind it but if you like it better ill come and sit by you said kitty and took her place beside the sofa  her hat was in her hand her sack on her arm the fatigue of a recent walk gave her a soft pallor and languor of face and attitude mrs ellison admired her pretty looks with a generous regret that they should be wasted on herself and then asked where were you this afternoon  o we went to the h√¥tel dieu for one thing and afterwards we looked into the courtyard of the convent and there another of his pleasant little traits came outa way he has of always putting you in the wrong even when its a matter of no consequence any way and there neednt be any right or wrong about it i remembered the place because mrs march you know showed us a rose that one of the nuns in the hospital gave her and i tried to tell mr arbuton about it and he graciously took it as if poor mrs march had made an advance towards his acquaintance i do wish you could see what a lovely place that courtyard is fanny its so strange that such a thing should be right there in the heart of this crowded city but there it was with its peasant cottage on one side and its long low barns on the other and those widehorned canadian cows munching at the racks of hay outside and pigeons and chickens all about among their feet  yes yes never mind all that kitty you know i hate nature go on about mr arbuton said mrs ellison who did not mean a sarcasm  it looked like a farmyard in a picture far out in the country somewhere resumed kitty and mr arbuton did it the honor to say it was just like normandy  kitty  he did indeed fanny and the cows didnt go down on their knees out of gratitude either well off on the right were the hospital buildings climbing up you know with their stone walls and steep roofs and windows dropped about over them like our convent here and there was an artist there sketching it all he had such a brown pleasant face with a little black mustache and imperial and such gay black eyes that nobody could help falling in love with him and he was talking in such a freeandeasy way with the lazy workmen and women overlooking him he jotted down a little image of the virgin in a niche on the wall and one of the people called outmr arbuton was translatinglook there with one touch hes made our blessed lady o says the painter thats nothing with three touches i can make the entire holy family and they all laughed and that little joke you know won my hearti dont hear many jokes from mr arbutonand so i said what a blessed life a painters must be for it would give you a right to be a vagrant and you could wander through the world seeing everything that was lovely and funny and nobody could blame you and i wondered everybody who had the chance didnt learn to sketch mr arbuton took it seriously and said people had to have something more than the chance to learn before they could sketch and that most of them were an affliction with their sketchbooks and he had seen too much of the sad effects of drawing from casts and he put me in the wrong as he always does dont you see i didnt want to learn drawing i wanted to be a painter and go about sketching beautiful old convents and sit on campstools on pleasant afternoons and joke with people of course he couldnt understand that but i know the artist could o fanny if it had only been the painter whose arm i took that first day on the boat instead of mr arbuton but the worst of it is he is making a hypocrite of me and a cowardly unnatural girl i wanted to go nearer and look at the painters sketch but i was ashamed to say id never seen a real artists sketch before and im getting to be ashamed or to seem ashamed of a great many innocent things he has a way of not seeming to think it possible that any one he associates with can differ from him and i do differ from him i differ from him as much as my whole past life differs from his i know im just the kind of production that he disapproves of and that im altogether irregular and unauthorized and unjustifiable and though its funny to have him talking to me as if i must have the sympathy of a rich girl with his ideas its provoking too and its very bad for me up to the present moment fanny if you want to know thats the principal effect of mr arbuton on me im being gradually snubbed and scared into treasons stratagems and spoils  mrs ellison did not find all this so very grievous for she was one of those women who like a snub from the superior sex if it does not involve a slight to their beauty or their power of pleasing but she thought it best not to enter into the question and merely said but surely kitty there are a great many things in mr arbuton that you must respect  respect o yes indeed but respect isnt just the thing for one who seems to consider himself sacred say revere fanny say revere  kitty had risen from her chair but mrs ellison waved her again to her seat with an imploring gesture dont go kitty im not half done with you yet you must tell me something more youve stirred me up so now i know you dont always have such disagreeable times youve often come home quite happy what do you generally find to talk about do tell me some particulars for once  why little topics come up you know but sometimes we dont talk at all because i dont like to say what i think or feel for fear i should be thinking or feeling something vulgar mr arbuton is rather a blight upon conversation in that way he makes you doubtful whether there isnt something a little common in breathing and the circulation of the blood and whether it wouldnt be true refinement to stop them  stuff kitty hes very cultivated isnt he dont you talk about books hes read everything i suppose  o yes hes read enough  what do you mean  nothing only sometimes it seems to me as if he hadnt read because he loved it but because he thought it due to himself but maybe im mistaken i could imagine a delicate poem shutting up half its sweetness from his cold cold scrutinyif you will excuse the floweriness of the idea  why kitty dont you think hes refined im sure i think hes a very refined person  hes a very elaborated person but i dont think it would make much difference to him what our opinion of him was his own good opinion would be quite enough  is heis healways agreeable  i thought we were discussing his mind fanny i dont know that i feel like enlarging upon his manners said kitty slyly  but surely kitty said the matron with an air of argument theres some connection between his mind and his manners  yes i suppose so i dont think theres much between his heart and his manners they seem to have been put on him instead of having come out of him hes very well trained and nine times out of ten hes so exquisitely polite that its wonderful but the tenth time he may say something so rude that you cant believe it  then you like him nine times out of ten  i didnt say that but for the tenth time its certain his training doesnt hold out and he seems to have nothing natural to fall back upon but you can believe that if he knew hed been disagreeable hed be sorry for it  why then kitty how can you say that theres no connection between his heart and manners this very thing proves that they come from his heart dont be illogical kitty said mrs ellison and her nerves added sotto voce if you are so abominably provoking  o responded the young girl with the kind of laugh that meant it was after all not such a laughing matter i didnt say hed be sorry for you perhaps he would but hed be certain to be sorry for himself its with his politeness as it is with his reading he seems to consider it something thats due to himself as a gentleman to treat people well and it isnt in the least as if he cared for them he wouldnt like to fail in such a point  but kitty isnt that to his credit  maybe i dont say if i knew more about the world perhaps i should admire it but now you seeand here kittys laugh grew more natural and she gave a subtle caricature of mr arbutons air and tone as she spokei cant help feeling that its a littlevulgar  mrs ellison could not quite make out how much kitty really meant of what she had said she gasped once or twice for argument then she sat up and beat the sofapillows vengefully in composing herself anew and finally well kitty im sure i dont know what to make of it all she said with a sigh  why were not obliged to make anything of it fanny theres that comfort replied kitty and then there was a silence while she brooded over the whole affair of her acquaintance with mr arbuton which this talk had failed to set in a more pleasant or hopeful light it had begun like a romance she had pleased her fancy if not her heart with the poetry of it but at last she felt exiled and strange in his presence she had no right to a different result even through any deep feeling in the matter but while she owned with her halfsad halfcomical consciousness that she had been tacitly claiming and expecting too much she softly pitied herself with a kind of impersonal compassion as if it wore some other girl whose pretty dream had been broken its ruin involved the loss of another ideal for she was aware that there had been gradually rising in her mind an image of boston different alike from the holy place of her childhood the sacred city of the antislavery heroes and martyrs and from the jesting easy sympathetic boston of mr and mrs march this new boston with which mr arbuton inspired her was a boston of mysterious prejudices and lofty reservations a boston of high and difficult tastes that found its social ideal in the old world and that shrank from contact with the reality of this a boston as alien as europe to her simple experiences and that seemed to be proud only of the things that were unlike other american things a boston that would rather perish by fire and sword than be suspected of vulgarity a critical fastidious and reluctant boston dissatisfied with the rest of the hemisphere and gelidly selfsatisfied in so far as it was not in the least the boston of her fond preconceptions it was doubtless no more the real boston we know and love than either of the others and it perplexed her more than it need even if it had not been mere phantasm it made her suspicious of mr arbutons behavior towards her and observant of little things that might very well have otherwise escaped her the bantering humor the lighthearted trust and selfreliance with which she had once met him deserted her and only returned fitfully when some accident called her out of herself and made her forget the differences that she now too plainly saw in their ways of thinking and feeling it was a greater and greater effort to place herself in sympathy with him she relaxed into a languid selfcontempt as if she had been playing a part when she succeeded sometimes fanny she said now after a long pause speaking in behalf of that other girl she had been thinking of it seems to me as if mr arbuton were all gloves and slim umbrellathe mere husk of well dressed culture and good manners his looks do promise everything but o dear me i should be sorry for any one that was in love with him just imagine some girl meeting with such a man and taking a fancy to him i suppose she never would quite believe but that he must somehow be what she first thought him and she would go down to her grave believing that she had failed to understand him what a curious story it would make  then why dont you write it kitty asked mrs ellison no one could do it better  kitty flushed quickly then she smiled o i dont think i could do it at all it wouldnt be a very easy story to work out perhaps he might never do anything positively disagreeable enough to make anybody condemn him the only way you could show his character would be to have her do and say hateful things to him when she couldnt help it and then repent of it while he was impassively perfect through everything and perhaps after all he might be regarded by some stupid people as the injured one well mr arbuton has been very polite to us im sure fanny she said after another pause as she rose from her chair and maybe im unjust to him i beg his pardon of you and i wish she added with a dull disappointment quite her own and a pang of surprise at words that seemed to utter themselves that he would go away  why kitty im shocked said mrs ellison rising from her cushions  yes so am i fanny  are you really tired of him then  kitty did not answer but turned away her face a little where she stood beside the chair in which she had been sitting  mrs ellison put out her hand towards her kitty come here she said with imperious tenderness  no i wont fanny answered the young girl in a trembling voice she raised the glove that she had been nervously swinging back and forth and bit hard upon the button of it i dont know whether im tired of himthough he isnt a person to rest one a great dealbut im tired of it im perplexed and troubled the whole time and i dont see any end to it yes i wish he would go away yes he is tiresome what is he staying here for if he thinks himself so much better than all of us i wonder he troubles himself with our company its quite time for him to go no fanny no cried kitty with a little broken laugh still rejecting the outstretched hand ill be flat in private if you please and dashing her hand across her eyes she flitted out of the room at the door she turned and said  you neednt think its what you think it is fanny  no indeed dear youre just overwrought  for i really wish hed go  but it was on this very day that mr arbuton found it harder than ever to renew his resolution of quitting quebec and cutting short at once his acquaintance with these people he had been pledging himself to this in some form every day and every morrow had melted his resolution away whatever was his opinion of colonel and mrs ellison it is certain that if he considered kitty merely in relation to the present he could not have said how by being different she could have been better than she was he perceived a charm that would be recognized anywhere in her manner though it was not of his world her fresh pleasure in all she saw though he did not know how to respond to it was very winning he respected what he thought the good sense running through her transports he wondered at the culture she had somewhere somehow got and he was so good as to find that her literary enthusiasms had nothing offensive but were as pretty and naive as a girls love of flowers moreover he approved of some personal attributes of hers a low gentle voice tender longlashed eyes a trick of drooping shoulders and of idle hands fallen into the lap one in the others palm a serene repose of face a light and eager laugh there was nothing so novel in those traits and in different combination he had seen them a thousand times yet in her they strangely wrought upon his fancy she had that soft kittenish way with her which invites a caressing patronage but as he learned she had also the kittenish equipment for resenting overcondescension and she never took him half so much as when she showed the high spirit that was in her and defied him most  for here and now it was all well enough but he had a future to which he owed much and a conscience that would not leave him at rest the fascination of meeting her so familiarly under the same roof the sorcery of the constant sight of her were becoming too much it would not do on any account for his own sake he must put an end to it but from hour to hour he lingered upon his unenforced resolve the passing days that brought him doubts in which he shuddered at the great difference between himself and her and her people brought him also moments of blissful forgetfulness in which his misgivings were lost in the sweetness of her looks or the young grace of her motions passing the days rebuked his delay in vain a week and two weeks slipped from under his feet and still he had waited for fate to part him and his folly but now at last he would go and in the evening after his cigar on durham terrace he knocked at mrs ellisons door to say that on the day after tomorrow he should push on to the white mountains  he found the ellisons talking over an expedition for the next morning in which he was also to take part mrs ellison had already borne her full share in the preparation for being always at hand there in her room and having nothing to do she had been almost a willing victim to the colonels passion for information at secondhand and had probably come to know more than any other american woman of arnolds expedition against quebec in 1775 she know why the attack was planned and with what prodigious hazard and heroical toil and endurance it was carried out how the dauntless little army of riflemen cut their way through the untrodden forests of maine and canada and beleaguered the gray old fortress on her rock till the red autumn faded into winter and on the last bitter night of the year flung themselves against her defences and fell back leaving half their number captive montgomery dead and arnold wounded but haplessly destined to survive  yes said the colonel considering the age in which they lived and their total lack of modern improvements mental moral and physical we must acknowledge that they did pretty well it wasnt on a very large scale but i dont see how they could have been braver if every man had been multiplied by ten thousand in fact as its going to be all the same thing a hundred years from now i dont know but id as soon be one of the men that tried to take quebec as one of the men that did take atlanta of course for the present and on account of my afflicted family mr arbuton im willing to be what and where i am but just see what those fellows did and the colonel drew from his glowing memory of mrs ellisons facts a brave historical picture of arnolds expedition and now were going tomorrow morning to look up the scene of the attack on the 31st of december kitty sing something  at another time kitty might have hesitated but that evening she was so at rest about mr arbuton so sure she cared nothing for his liking or disliking anything she did that she sat down at the piano and sang a number of songs which i suppose were as unworthy the cultivated ear as any he had heard but though they were given with an untrained voice and a touch as little skilled as might be they pleased or else the singer pleased the simplehearted courage of the performance would alone have made it charming and mr arbuton had no reason to ask himself how he should like it in boston if he were married and should hear it from his wife there yet when a young man looks at a young girl or listens to her a thousand vagaries possess his mindformless imaginations lawless fancies the question that presented itself remotely like pain in a dream dissolved in the ripple of the singers voice and left his revery the more luxuriously untroubled for having been  he remembered after saying goodnight that he had forgotten something it was to tell them he was going away     viii  next morning   quebec lay shining in the tender oblique light of the northern sun when they passed next morning through the upper town marketplace and took their way towards hope gate where they were to be met by the colonel a little later it is easy for the alert tourist to lose his course in quebec and they who were neither hurried nor heedful went easily astray but the street into which they had wandered if it did not lead straight to hope gate had many merits and was very characteristic of the city most of the houses on either hand were low structures of one story built heavily of stone or stuccoed brick with two dormerwindows full of houseplants in each roof the doors were each painted of a livelier color than the rest of the house and each glistened with a polished brass knob a large brass knocker or an intricate bellpull of the same resplendent metal and a plate bearing the owners name and his professional title which if not avocat was sure to be notaire so well is quebec supplied with those ministers of the law at the side of each house was a portecoch√®re and in this a smaller door the thresholds and doorsteps were covered with the neatest and brightest oilcloth the wooden sidewalk was very clean like the steep roughly paved street itself and at the foot of the hill down which it sloped was a breadth of the city wall pierced for musketry and past the corner of one of the houses the halflength of cannon showing it had the charm of those ancient streets dear to oldworld travel in which the past and the present decay and repair peace and war have made friends in an effect that not only wins the eye but however illogically touches the heart and over the top of the wall it had a stretch of such landscape as i know not what oldworld street can command the st lawrence blue and wide a bit of the white village of beauport on its bank then a vast breadth of palegreen upwardsloping meadows then the purple heights and the hazy heaven over them halfway down this happy street sat the artist whom they had seen before in the court of the h√¥tel dieu he was sketching something and evoking the curious life of the neighborhood two schoolboys in the uniform of the seminary paused to look at him as they loitered down the pavement a group of children encircled him a little girl with her hair in blue ribbons talked at a window about him to some one within a young lady opened her casement and gazed furtively at him a door was set quietly ajar and an old grandam peeped out shading her eyes with her hand a woman in deep mourning gave his sketch a glance as she passed a calash with a fat quebecker in it ran into a cart driven by a broadhatted peasantwoman so eager were both to know what he was drawing a man lingered even at the head of the street as if it were any use to stop there  as kitty and mr arbuton passed him the artist glanced at her with the smile of a man who believes he knows how the case stands and she followed his eye in its withdrawal towards the bit he was sketching an old roof and on top of this a balcony shut in with green blinds yet higher a weatherworn woodcolored gallery pentroofed and balustered with a geranium showing through the balusters a dormerwindow with hook and tackle beside an orientalshaped pavilion with a shining tin domea picturesque confusion of forms which had been apparently added from time to time without design and yet were full of harmony the unreasonable succession of roofs had lifted the top far above the level of the surrounding houses into the heart of the morning light and some white doves circled about the pavilion or nestled cooing upon the windowsill where a young girl sat and sewed  why its hilda in her tower said kitty of course and this is just the kind of street for such a girl to look down into it doesnt seem like a street in real life does it the people all look as if they had stepped out of stories and might step back any moment and these queer little houses theyre the very places for things to happen in  mr arbuton smiled forbearingly as she thought at this burst but she did not care and she turned at the bottom of the street and lingered a few moments for another look at the whole charming picture and then he praised it and said that the artist was making a very good sketch i wonder quebec isnt infested by artists the whole summer long he added they go about hungrily picking up bits of the picturesque along our shores and country roads when they might exchange their famine for a feast by coming here  i suppose theres a pleasure in finding out the small graces and beauties of the povertystricken subjects that they wouldnt have in better ones isnt there asked kitty at any rate if i were to write a story i should want to take the slightest sort of plot and lay the scene in the dullest kind of place and then bring out all their possibilities ill tell you a book after my own heart detailsjust the history of a week in the life of some young people who happen together in an old new england countryhouse nothing extraordinary little everyday things told so exquisitely and all fading naturally away without any particular result only the full meaning of everything brought out  and dont you think its rather a sad ending for all to fade away without any particular result asked the young man stricken he hardly knew how or where besides i always thought that the author of that book found too much meaning in everything he did for men im sure but i believe women are different and see much more than we do in a little space      why has not man a microscopic eye      for this plain reason man is not a fly  nor a woman mocked kitty have you read his other books  yes  arent they delightful  theyre very well and i always wondered he could write them he doesnt look it  o have you ever seen him  he lives in boston you know  yes yes but kitty could not go on and say that she had not supposed authors consorted with creatures of common clay and mr arbuton who was the constant guest of people who would have thought most authors sufficiently honored in being received among them to meet such men as he was very far from guessing what was in her mind  he waited a moment for her and then said hes a very ordinary sort of mannot what one would exactly call a gentleman you know in his belongingsand yet his books have nothing of the shop nothing professionally literary about them it seems as if almost any of us might have written them  kitty glanced quickly at him to see if he were jesting but mr arbuton was not easily given to irony and he was now very much in earnest about drawing on his light overcoat which he had hitherto carried on his arm with that scrupulous consideration for it which was not dandyism but part of his selfrespect apparently as an overcoat ho cared nothing for it as the overcoat of a man of his condition he cared everything and now though the sun was so bright on the open spaces in these narrow streets the garment was comfortable  at another time kitty would have enjoyed the care with which he smoothed it about his person but this profanation of her dearest ideals made the moment serious her pulse quickened and she said im afraid i cant enter into your feelings i wasnt taught to respect the idea of a gentleman very much ive often heard my uncle say that at the best it was a poor excuse for not being just honest and just brave and just kind and a false pretence of being something more i believe if i were a man i shouldnt want to be a gentleman at any rate id rather be the author of those books which any gentleman might have written than all the gentlemen who didnt put together  in the career of her indignation she had unconsciously hurried her companion forward so swiftly that they had reached hope gate as she spoke and interrupted the revery in which colonel ellison loafing up against the masonry was contemplating the sentry in his box  youd better not overheat yourself so early in the day kitty said her cousin serenely with a glance at her flushed face this expedition is not going to be any joke  now that prescott gate by which so many thousands of americans have entered quebec since arnolds excursionists failed to do so is demolished there is nothing left so picturesque and characteristic as hope gate and i doubt if anywhere in europe there is a more medi√¶vallooking bit of military architecture the heavy stone gateway is black with age and the gate which has probably never been closed in our century is of massive frame set thick with mighty bolts and spikes the wall here sweeps along the brow of the crag on which the city is built and a steep street drops down by stoneparapeted curves and angles from the upper to the lower town where in 1775 nothing but a narrow lane bordered the st lawrence a considerable breadth of land has since been won from the river and several streets and many piers now stretch between this alley and the water but the old sault au matelot still crouches and creeps along under the shelter of the city wall and the overhanging rock which is thickly bearded with weeds and grass and trickles with abundant moisture it must be an icepit in winter and i should think it the last spot on the continent for the summer to find but when the summer has at last found it the old sault au matelot puts on a vagabond air of southern leisure and abandon not to be matched anywhere out of italy looking from that jutting rock near hope gate behind which the defeated americans took refuge from the fire of their enemies the vista is almost unique for a certain scenic squalor and gypsy luxury of color sagroofed barns and stables and weakbacked sunkenchested workshops of every sort lounge along in tumbledown succession and lean up against the cliff in every imaginable posture of worthlessness and decrepitude light wooden galleries cross to them from the second stories of the houses which back upon the alley and over these galleries flutters from a labyrinth of clotheslines a variety of brightcolored garments of all ages sexes and conditions while the footway underneath abounds in gossiping women smoking men idle poultry cats children and large indolent newfoundland dogs  it was through this lane that arnolds party advanced almost to the foot of mountain street where they were to be joined by montgomerys force in an attempt to surprise prescott gate said the colonel with his unerring secondhand history      you that will follow me to this attempt  wait till you see the whites of their eyes and then fire low and so forth by the way do you suppose anybody did that at bunker hill mr arbuton come youre a boston man my experience is that recruits chivalrously fire into the air without waiting to see the enemy at all let alone the whites of their eyes why arent you coming he asked seeing no movement to follow in kitty or mr arbuton  it doesnt look very pleasant under foot dick suggested kitty  well upon my word is this your uncles niece i shall never dare to report this panic at eriecreek  i can see the whole length of the alley and theres nothing in it but chickens and domestic animals  very well as fanny says when uncle jackhes your uncleasks you about every inch of the ground that arnolds men were demoralized over i hope youll know what to say  kitty laughed and said she should try a little invention if her uncle jack came down to inches  all right kitty you can go along st paul street there and mr arbuton and i will explore the sault au matelot and come out upon you covered with glory at the other end  i hope itll be glory said kitty with a glance at the lane but i think its more likely to be feathers and chopped strawgood by mr arbuton  not in the least answered the young man im going with you  the colonel feigned indignant surprise and marched briskly down the sault au matelot alone while the others took their way through st paul street in the same direction amidst the bustle and business of the port past the banks and great commercial houses with the encounter of throngs of seafaring faces of many nations and at the corner of st peter street a glimpse of the national flag thrown out from the american consulate which intensified for untravelled kitty her sense of remoteness from her native land at length they turned into the street now called sault au matelot into which opens the lane once bearing that name and strolled idly along in the cool shadow silence and solitude of the street she was strangely released from the constraint which mr arbuton usually put upon her a certain defiant ease filled her heart she felt and thought whatever she liked for the first time in many days while he went puzzling himself with the problem of a young lady who despised gentlemen and yet remained charming to him  a mighty marine smell of oakum and saltfish was in the air and o sighed kitty doesnt it make you long for distant seas shouldnt you like to be shipwrecked for half a day or so mr arbuton  yes yes certainly he replied absently and wondered what she laughed at the silence of the place was broken only by the noise of coopering which seemed to be going on in every other house the solitude relieved only by the newfoundland dogs that stretched themselves upon the thresholds of the coopershops the monotony of these shops and dogs took kittys humor and as they went slowly by she made a jest of them as she used to do with things she saw  but heres a door without a dog she said presently this cant be a genuine coopershop of course without a dog o that accounts for it perhaps she added pausing before the threshold and glancing up at a signacad√©mie commerciale et litt√©raireset under an upper window what a curious place for a seat of learning what do you suppose is the connection between coopershops and an academical education mr arbuton  she stood looking up at the sign that moved her mirth and swinging her shut parasol idly to and fro while a light of laughter played over her face  suddenly a shadow seemed to dart betwixt her and the open doorway mr arbuton was hurled violently against her and as she struggled to keep her footing under the shock she saw him bent over a furious dog that hung from the breast of his overcoat while he clutched its throat with both his hands  he met the terror of her face with a quick glance i beg your pardon dont call out please he said but from within the shop came loud cries and maledictions o nom de dieu cest le bouledogue du capitaine anglais with appalling screams for help and a wild uncouth little figure of a man bareheaded horroreyed came flying out of the open door he wore a coopers apron and he bore in one hand a redhot iron which with continuous clamor he dashed against the muzzle of the hideous brute without a sound the dog loosed his grip and dropping to the ground fled into the obscurity of the shop as silently as he had launched himself out of it while kitty yet stood spellbound and before the crowd that the appeal of mr arbutons rescuer had summoned could see what had happened  mr arbuton lifted himself and looked angrily round upon the gaping spectators who began one by one to take in their heads from their windows and to slink back to their thresholds as if they had been guilty of something much worse than a desire to succor a human being in peril  good heavens said mr arbuton what an abominable scene his face was deadly pale as he turned from these insolent intruders to his deliverer whom he saluted with a merci bien spoken in a cold steady voice then he drew off his overcoat which had been torn by the dogs teeth and irreparably dishonored in the encounter he looked at it shuddering with a countenance of intense disgust and made a motion as if to hurl it into the street but his eye again fell upon the coopers squalid little figure as he stood twisting his hands into his apron and with voluble eagerness protesting that it was not his dog but that of the english shipcaptain who had left it with him and whom he had many a time besought to have the beast killed mr arbuton who seemed not to hear what he was saying or to be so absorbed in something else as not to consider whether he was to blame or not broke in upon him in french youve done me the greatest service i cannot repay you but you must take this he said as he thrust a banknote into the little mans grimy hand  o but it is too much but it is like a monsieur so brave so  hush it was nothing interrupted mr arbuton again then he threw his overcoat upon the mans shoulder if you will do me the pleasure to receive this also perhaps you can make use of it  monsieur heaps me with benefitsmonsieur began the bewildered cooper but mr arbuton turned abruptly away from him toward kitty who trembled at having shared the guilt of the other spectators and seizing her hand he placed it on his arm where he held it close as he strode away leaving his deliverer planted in the middle of the sidewalk and staring after him she scarcely dared ask him if he were hurt as she found herself doing now with a faltering voice  no i believe not he said with a glance at the frockcoat which was buttoned across his chest and was quite intact and still he strode on with a quick glance at every threshold which did not openly declare a newfoundland dog  it had all happened so suddenly and in so brief a time that she might well have failed to understand it even if she had seen it all it was barely intelligible to mr arbuton himself who as kitty had loitered mocking and laughing before the door of the shop chanced to see the dog crouched within and had only time to leap forward and receive the cruel brute on his breast as it flung itself at her  he had not thought of the danger to himself in what he had done he knew that he was unhurt but he did not care for that he cared only that she was safe and as he pressed her hand tight against his heart there passed through it a thrill of inexpressible tenderness a quick passionate sense of possession a rapture as of having won her and made her his own forever by saving her from that horrible risk the maze in which he had but now dwelt concerning her seemed an obsolete frivolity of an alien past all the cold doubts and hindering scruples which he had felt from the first were gone gone all his care for his world his world in that supreme moment there was no world but in the tender eyes at which he looked down with a glance which she knew not how to interpret  she thought that his pride was deeply wounded at the ignominy of his adventurefor she was sure he would care more for that than for the dangerand that if she spoke of it she might add to the angry pain he felt as they hurried along she waited for him to speak but he did not though always as he looked down at her with that strange look he seemed about to speak  presently she stopped and withdrawing her hand from his arm she cried why weve forgotten my cousin  oyes said mr arbuton with a vacant smile  looking back they saw the colonel standing on the pavement near the end of the old sault au matelot with his hands in his pockets and steadfastly staring at them he did not relax the severity of his gaze when they returned to join him and appeared to find little consolation in kittys o dick i forgot all about you given with a sudden inexplicable laugh interrupted and renewed as some ludicrous image seemed to come and go in her mind  well this may be very flattering kitty but it isnt altogether comprehensible said he with a keen glance at both their faces i dont know what youll say to uncle jack its not forgetting me alone its forgetting the whole american expedition against quebec  the colonel waited for some reply but kitty dared not attempt an explanation and mr arbuton was not the man to seem to boast of his share of the adventure by telling what had happened even if he had cared at that moment to do so her very ignorance of what he had dared for her only confirmed his new sense of possession and if he could he would not have marred the pleasure he felt by making her grateful yet sweet as that might be in its time now he liked to keep his knowledge to have had her unwitting compassion to hear her pour out her unwitting relief in this laugh while he superiorly permitted it  i dont understand this thing said the colonel through whose dense masculine intelligence some suspicions of lovemaking were beginning to pierce but he dismissed them as absurd and added however im willing to forgive and youve done the forgetting and all that i ask now is the pleasure of your company on the spot where montgomery fell fannyll never believe ive found it unless you go with me he appealed finally  o well go by all means said mr arbuton unconsciously speaking as by authority for both  they came into busier streets of the port again and then passed through the square of the lower town market with the markethouse in the midst the shops and warehouses on either side the long row of tented booths with every kind of peasantwares to sell and the wide stairway dropping to the river which brought the abundance of the neighboring country to the mart the whole place was alive with countryfolk in carts and citizens on foot at one point a gayly painted wagon was drawn up in the midst of a group of people to whom a quackishfaced yankee was hawking in his own personal french an american patentmedicine and making his audience giggle because kitty was amused at this mr arbuton found it the drollest thing imaginable but saw something yet droller when she made the colonel look at a peasant standing in one corner beside a basket of fowls which a woman coming up to buy examined as if the provision were some natural curiosity while a crowd at once gathered round  it requires a considerable population to make a bargain up here remarked the colonel i suppose they turn out the garrison when they sell a beef for both buyer and seller seemed to take advice of the bystanders who discussed and inspected the different fowls as if nothing so novel as poultry had yet fallen in their way  at last the peasant himself took up the fowls and carefully scrutinized them  those chickens it seems never happened to catch his eye before interpreted kitty and mr arbuton who was usually very restive during such banter smiled as if it were the most admirable fooling or the most precious wisdom in the world he made them wait to see the bargain out and could apparently have lingered there forever  but the colonel had a conscience about montgomery and he hurried them away on past the queens wharf and down the cove road to that point where the scarped and rugged breast of the cliff bears the sign here fell montgomery though he really fell not halfway up the height but at the foot of it where stood the battery that forbade his juncture with arnold at prescott gate  a certain wildness yet possesses the spot the front of the crag topped by the high citadelwall is so grim and the few tough evergreens that cling to its clefts are torn and twisted by the winter blasts and the houses are decrepit with age showing here and there the scars of the frequent fires that sweep the lower town  it was quite useless neither the memories of the place nor their setting were sufficient to engage the wayward thoughts of these curiously assorted pilgrims and the colonel after some attempts to bring the matter home to himself and the others was obliged to abandon mr arbuton to his tender reveries of kitty and kitty to her puzzling over the change in mr arbuton his complaisance made her uncomfortable and shy of him it was so strange it gave her a little shiver as if he were behaving undignifiedly  well kitty said the colonel i reckon uncle jack would have made more out of this than weve done hed have had their geology out of these rocks any way     ix  mr arbutons infatuation   kitty went as usual to mrs ellisons room after her walk but she lapsed into a deep abstraction as she sat down beside the sofa  what are you smiling at asked mrs ellison after briefly supporting her abstraction  was i smiling asked kitty beginning to laugh i didnt know it  what has happened so very funny  why i dont know whether its so very funny or not i believe it isnt funny at all  then what makes you laugh  i dont know was i  now dont ask me if you were laughing kitty its a little too much you can talk or not as you choose but i dont like to be turned into ridicule  o fanny how can you i was thinking about something very different but i dont see how i can tell you without putting mr arbuton in a ludicrous light and it isnt quite fair  youre very careful of him all at once said mrs ellison you didnt seem disposed to spare him yesterday so much i dont understand this sudden conversion  kitty responded with a fit of outrageous laughter now i see i must tell you she said and rapidly recounted mr arbutons adventure  why i never knew anything so cool and brave fanny and i admired him more than ever i did but then i couldnt help seeing the other side of it you know  what other side i dont know  well youd have had to laugh yourself if youd seen the lordly way he dismissed the poor people who had come running out of their houses to help him and his stateliness in rewarding that little cooper and his heroic parting from his cherished overcoatwhich of course he cant replace in quebecand his absentminded politeness in taking my hand under his arm and marching off with me so magnificently but the worst thing fannyand she bowed herself under a tempest of longpent mirththe worst thing was that the iron you know was the coopers brandingiron and i had a vision of the dog carrying about on his nose as long as he lived the monogram that marks the coopers casks as holding a certain number of gallons  kitty dont besacrilegious cried mrs ellison  no im not she retorted gasping and panting i never respected mr arbuton so much and you say yourself i havent shown myself so careful of him before but i never was so glad to see dick in my life and to have some excuse for laughing i didnt dare to speak to mr arbuton about it for he couldnt if he had tried have let me laugh it out and be done with it i trudged demurely along by his side and neither of us mentioned the matter to dick she concluded breathlessly then i dont know why i should tell you now it seems wicked and cruel she said penitently almost pensively  mrs ellison had not been amused she said well kitty in some girls i should say it was quite heartless to do as youve done  its heartless in me fanny and you neednt say such a thing im sure i didnt utter a syllable to wound him and just before that hed been very disagreeable and i forgave him because i thought he was mortified and you neednt say that ive no feeling and thereupon she rose and putting her hands into her cousins fanny she cried vehemently i have been heartless im afraid i havent shown any sympathy or consideration im afraid i must have seemed dreadfully callous and hard i oughtnt to have thought of anything but the danger to him and it seems to me now i scarcely thought of that at all o how rude it was of me to see anything funny in it what can i do  dont go crazy at any rate kitty he doesnt know that youve been laughing about him you neednt do anything  o yes i need he doesnt know that ive been laughing about him to you but dont you see i laughed when we met dick and what can he think of that  he just thinks you were nervous i suppose  o do you suppose he does fanny o i wish i could believe that o im so horribly ashamed of myself and here yesterday i was criticising him for being unfeeling and now ive been a thousand times worse than he has ever been or ever could be o dear dear dear  kitty hush exclaimed mrs ellison you run on like a wild thing and youre driving me distracted by not being like yourself  o its very well for you to be so calm but if you didnt know what to do you wouldnt  yes i would i dont and i am  but what shall i do and kitty plucked away the hands which fanny had been holding and wrung them ill tell you what i can do she suddenly added while a gleam of relief dawned upon her face i can bear all his disagreeable ways after this as long as he stays and not say anything back yes ill put up with everything ill be as meek he may patronize me and snub me and put me in the wrong as much as he pleases and then he wont be approaching my behavior o fanny  upon this mrs ellison said that she was going to give her a good scolding for her nonsense and pulled her down and kissed her and said that she had not done anything and was nevertheless consoled at her resolve to expiate her offence by respecting thenceforward mr arbutons foibles and prejudices  it is not certain how far kitty would have succeeded in her good purposes these things so easily conceived are not of such facile execution she passed a sleepless night of good resolutions and schemes of reparation but fortunately for her mr arbutons foibles and prejudices seemed to have fallen into a strange abeyance the change that had come upon him that day remained he was still mr arbuton but with a difference he could not undo his whole inherited and educated being and perhaps no chance could deeply affect it without destroying the man he continued hopelessly superior to colonel and mrs ellison but it is not easy to love a woman and not seek at least before marriage to please those dear to her mr arbuton had contested his passion at every advance he had firmly set his face against the fancy that at the beginning invested this girl with a charm he had only done the things afterwards that mere civilization required he had suffered torments of doubt concerning her fitness for himself and his place in society he was not sure yet that her unknown relations were not horribly vulgar people even yet he was almost wholly ignorant of the circumstances and conditions of her life but how he saw her only in the enrapturing light of his daring for her sake of a selfdevotion that had seemed to make her his own and he behaved toward her with a lovers selfforgetfulnessor something like it say a perfect tolerance a tender patience in which it would have been hard to detect the lurking shadow of condescension  he was fairly domesticated with the family mrs ellisons hurt in spite of her many imprudences was decidedly better and sometimes she made a ceremony of being helped down from her room to dinner but she always had tea beside her sofa and he with the others drank it there few hours of the day passed in which they did not meet in that easy relation which establishes itself among people sojourning in summer idleness under the same roof in the morning he saw the young girl fresh and glad as any flower of the garden beneath her window while the sweet abstraction of her maiden dreams yet hovered in her eyes at night he sat with her beside the lamp whose light illuming a little world within shut out the great world outside and seemed to be the soft effulgence of her presence as she sewed or knit or reada heavenly spirit of home sometimes he heard her talking with her cousin or lightly laughing after he had said good night once when he woke she seemed to be looking out of her window across the moonlight in the ursulines garden while she sang a fragment of song to meet her on the stairs or in the narrow entries or to encounter her at the doors and make way for her to pass with a jest and blush and flutter to sit down at table with her three times a daywas a potent witchery there was a rapture in her shawl flung over the back of a chair her gloves lying light as fallen leaves on the table and keeping the shape of her hands were full of winning character and all the more unaccountably they touched his heart because they had a certain careless sweet shabbiness about the fingertips  he found himself hanging upon her desultory talk with fanny about the set of things and the agreement of colors there was always more or less of this talk going on whatever the main topic was for continual question arose in the minds of one or other lady concerning those adaptations of mrs ellisons finery to the exigencies of kittys daily life they pleased their innocent hearts with the secrecy of the affair which in the concealments it required the sudden difficulties it presented and the guiltless equivocations it inspired had the excitement of intrigue nothing could have been more to the mind of mrs ellison than to deck kitty for this perpetual masquerade and since the things were very pretty and kitty was a girl in every motion of her being i do not see how anything could have delighted her more than to wear them their talk effervesced with the delicious consciousness that he could not dream of what was going on and babbled over with mysterious jests and laughter which sometimes he feared to be at his expense and so joined in and made them laugh the more at his misconception he went and came among them at will he had but to tap at mrs ellisons door and some voice of unaffected cordiality welcomed him in he had but to ask and kitty was frankly ready for any of those strolls about quebec in which most of their waking hours were dreamed away  the gray lady of the north cast her spell about themthe freshness of her mornings the still heat of her middays the slant pensive radiance of her afternoons and the pale splendor of her auroral nights never was city so faithfully explored never did city so abound in objects of interest for kittys love of the place was boundless and his love for her was inevitable friendship with this adoptive patriotism  i didnt suppose you western people cared for these things he once said i thought your minds were set on things new and square  but how could you think so replied kitty tolerantly its because we have so many new and square things that we like the old crooked ones i do believe i should enjoy europe even better than you theres a forsaken farmhouse near eriecreek dropping to pieces amongst its wildgrown sweetbriers and quincebushes that i used to think a wonder of antiquity because it was built in 1815 cant you imagine how i must feel in a city like this that was founded nearly three centuries ago and has suffered so many sieges and captures and looks like pictures of those beautiful old towns i can never see  o perhaps you will see them some day he said touched by her fervor  i dont ask it at present quebecs enough im in love with the place i wish i never had to leave it there isnt a crook or a turn or a tinroof or a dormerwindow or a gray stone in it that isnt precious  mr arbuton laughed well you shall be sovereign lady of quebec for me shall we have the english garrison turned out  no not unless you can bring back montcalms men to take their places  this might be as they sauntered out of one of the city gates and strayed through the lower town till they should chance upon some poor bareinteriored church with a few humble worshippers adoring their saint with his lamps alight before his picture or as they passed some high conventwall and caught the strange metallic clang of the nuns voices singing their hymns within sometimes they whiled away the hours on the esplanade breathing its pensive sentiment of neglect and incipient decay and pacing up and down over the turf athwart the slim shadows of the poplars or with comfortable indifference to the local observances sat in talk on the carriage of one of the burly uncaredfor guns while the spider wove his web across the mortars mouth and the grass nodded above the tumbled pyramids of shot and the children raced up and down and the nurserymaids were wooed of the dapper sergeants and the redcoated sentry loitered lazily to and fro before his box on the days of the music they listened to the band in the governors garden and watched the fine world of the old capital in flirtation with the blondwhiskered officers and on pleasant nights they mingled with the citizen throng that filled the durham terrace while the river shaped itself in the lights of its shipping and the lower town with its lamps lay like a nether firmament two hundred feet below them and point levis glittered and sparkled on the thither shore and in the northern sky the aurora throbbed in swift pulsations of violet and crimson they liked to climb the breakneck steps at prescott gate dropping from the upper to the lower town which reminded mr arbuton of naples and trieste and took kitty with the unassociated picturesqueness of their odd shops and taverns and their lofty windows green with houseplants they would stop and look up at the geraniums and fuchsias and fall a thinking of far different things and the friendly unbusy people would come to their doors and look up with them they recognized the handsome blond young man and the pretty grayeyed girl for people in quebec have time to note strangers who linger there and kitty and mr arbuton had come to be wellknown figures different from the fleeting tourists on their rounds and indeed as sojourners they themselves perceived their poetic distinction from mere birds of passage  indoors they resorted much to the little entrywindow looking out on the ursulines garden two chairs stood confronted there and it was hard for either of the young people to pass them without sinking a moment into one of them and this appeared always to charm another presence into the opposite chair there they often lingered in the soft forenoons talking in desultory phrase of things far and near or watching in long silences the nuns pacing up and down in the garden below and waiting for the pensive slender nun and the stout jolly nun whom kitty had adopted and whom she had gayly interpreted to him as an allegory of life in their quaint inseparableness and they played that the influence of one or other nun was in the ascendant according as their own talk was gay or sad in their relation people are not so different from children they like the same thing over and over again they like it the better the less it is in itself  at times kitty would come with a book in her hand one finger shut in to keep the placesome latest novel or a pirated edition of longfellow recreantly purchased at a quebec bookstore and then mr arbuton must ask to see it and he read romance or poetry to her by the hour he showed to as much advantage as most men do in the serious follies of wooing and an influence which he could not defy or would not shaped him to all the sweet absurd demands of the affair from time to time recollecting himself and trying to look consequences in the face he gently turned the talk upon eriecreek and endeavored to possess himself of some intelligible image of the place and of kittys home and friends even then the present was so fair and full of content that his thoughts when they reverted to the future no longer met the obstacles that had made him recoil from it before whatever her past had been he could find some way to weaken the ties that bound her to it a year or two of europe would leave no trace of eriecreek without effort of his her life would adapt itself to his own and cease to be a part of the lives of those people there again and again his amiable imaginationsthey were scarcely intentsaccomplished themselves in many a swift fugitive revery while the days went by and the shadow of the ivy in the window at which they sat fell in moonlight and sunlight upon kittys cheeks and the fuchsia kissed her hair with its purple and crimson blossom     x  mr arbuton speaks   mrs ellison was almost well she had already been shopping twice in the rue fabrique and her recovery was now chiefly retarded by the dressmakers delays in making up a silk too precious to be risked in the piece with the customs officers at the frontier moreover although the colonel was beginning to chafe she was not loath to linger yet a few days for the sake of an affair to which her suffering had been a willing sacrifice in return for her indefatigable selfdevotion kitty had lately done very little she ungratefully shrunk more and more from those confidences to which her cousins speeches covertly invited she openly resisted open attempts upon her knowledge of facts if she was not prepared to confess everything to fanny it was perhaps because it was all so very little or because a young girl has not or ought not to have a mind in certain matters or else knows it not till it is asked her by the one first authorized to learn it the dream in which she lived was flattering and fair and it wholly contented her imagination while it lulled her consciousness it moved from phase to phase without the harshness of reality and was apparently allied neither to the future nor to the past she herself seemed to have no more fixity or responsibility in it than the heroine of a romance  as their last week in quebec drew to its close only two or three things remained for them to do as tourists and chief among the few unvisited shrines of sentiment was the site of the old jesuit mission at sillery  it wont do not to see that kitty said mrs ellison who as usual had arranged the details of the excursion and now announced them its one of the principal things here and your uncle jack would never be satisfied if you missed it in fact its a shame to have left it so long i cant go with you for im saving up my strength for our picnic at ch√¢teaubigot tomorrow and i want you kitty to see that the colonel sees everything ive had trouble enough goodness knows getting the facts together for him this was as kitty and mr arbuton sat waiting in mrs ellisons parlor for the delinquent colonel who had just stepped round to the h√¥tel st louis and was to be back presently but the moment of his return passed a quarterhour of grace a halfhour of grim magnanimityand still no colonel mrs ellison began by saying that it was perfectly abominable and left herself in a greater extremity with nothing more forcible to add than that it was too provoking its getting so late now she said at last that its no use waiting any longer if you mean to go at all today and todays the only day you can go there youd better drive on without him i cant bear to have you miss it and thus adjured the younger people rose and went  when the highborn no√´l brulart de sillery knight of malta and courtier of marie de medicis turned from the vanities of this world and became a priest canada was the fashionable mission of the day and the noble neophyte signalized his selfrenunciation by giving of his great wealth for the conversion of the indian heathen he supplied the jesuits with money to maintain a religious establishment near quebec and the settlement of red christians took his musical name which the region still keeps it became famous at once as the first residence of the jesuits and the nuns of the h√¥tel dieu who wrought and suffered for religion there amidst the terrors of pestilence iroquois and winter it was the scene of miracles and martyrdoms and marvels of many kinds and the centre of the missionary efforts among the indians indeed few events of the picturesque early history of quebec left it untouched and it is worthy to be seen no less for the wild beauty of the spot than for its heroical memories about a league from the city where the irregular wall of rock on which quebec is built recedes from the river and a grassy space stretches between the tide and the foot of the woody steep the old mission and the indian village once stood and to this day there yet stands the stalwart frame of the first jesuit residence modernized of course and turned to secular uses but firm as of old and good for a century to come all round is a world of lumber and rafts of vast extent cover the face of the waters in the ample coveone of many that indent the shore of the st lawrence a careless village straggles along the roadside and the rivers margin huge lumberships are loading for europe in the stream a town shines out of the woods on the opposite shore nothing but a friendly climate is needed to make this one of the most charming scenes the heart could imagine  kitty and mr arbuton drove out towards sillery by the st louis road and already the jealous foliage that hides the pretty villas and stately places of that aristocratic suburb was tinged in here and there a bough with autumnal crimson or yellow in the meadows here and there a vine ran red along the grass the loath chokecherries were ripening in the fence corners the air was full of the pensive jargoning of the crickets and grasshoppers and all the subtle sentiment of the fading summer their hearts were open to every dreamy influence of the time their driver understood hardly any english and their talk might safely be made up of those harmless egotisms which young people exchangethose strains of psychological autobiography which mark advancing intimacy and in which they appear to each other the most uncommon persons that ever lived and their experiences and emotions and ideas are the more surprisingly unique because exactly alike  it seemed a very short league to sillery when they left the st louis road and the driver turned his horses heads towards the river down the winding sylvan way that descended to the shore and they had not so much desire after all to explore the site of the old mission nevertheless they got out and visited the little space once occupied by the jesuit chapel where its foundations may yet be traced in the grass and they read the inscription on the monument lately raised by the parish to the memory of the first jesuit missionary to canada who died at sillery then there seemed nothing more to do but admire the mighty rafts and piles of lumber but their show of interest in the local celebrity had stirred the pride of sillery and a little french boy entered the chapelyard and gave kitty a pamphlet history of the place for which he would not suffer himself to be paid and a sweetfaced young englishwoman came out of the house across the way and hesitatingly asked if they would not like to see the jesuit residence she led them indoors and showed them how the ancient edifice had been encased by the modern house and bade them note from the deep shelving windowseats that the stone walls were three feet thick the rooms were lowceiled and quaintly shaped but they borrowed a certain grandeur from this massiveness and it was easy to figure the priests in black and the nuns in gray in those dim chambers which now a life so different inhabited behind the house was a plot of grass and thence the wooded hill rose steep  but come up stairs said the ardent little hostess to kitty when her husband came in and had civilly welcomed the strangers and ill show you my own room thats as old as any  they left the two men below and mounted to a large room carpeted and furnished in modern taste we had to take down the old staircase she continued to get our bedstead upa magnificent structure which she plainly thought well worth the sacrifice and then she pointed out divers remnants of the ancient building its a queer place to live in but were only here for the summer and she went on to explain with a pretty na√Øvet√© how her husbands business brought him to sillery from quebec in that season they were descending the stairs kitty foremost as she added this is my first housekeeping you know and of course it would be strange anywhere but you cant think how funny it is here i suppose she said shyly but as if her confidences merited some return while kitty stepped from the stairway face to face with mr arbuton who was about to follow them with the ladys husbandi suppose this is your weddingjourney  a quick alarm flamed through the young girl and burned out of her glowing cheeks this pleasant masquerade of hers must look to others like the most intentional lovemaking between her and mr arbutonno dreams either of them nor figures in a play nor characters in a romance nay on one spectator at least it had shed the soft lustre of a honeymoon how could it be otherwise here on this fatal line of weddingtravelso common that she remembered mrs march half apologized for making it her first tour after marriagehow could it happen but that two young people together as they were should be taken for bride and bridegroom moreover and worst of all he must have heard that fatal speech  he was pale if she was flushed and looked grave as she fancied but he passed on up the stairs and she sat down to wait for his return  i used to notice so many couples from the states when we lived in the city continued the hospitable mistress of the house but i dont think they often came out to sillery in fact youre the only pair thats come this summer and so when you seemed interested about the mission i thought you wouldnt mind if i spoke to you and asked you in to see the house most of the americans stay long enough to visit the citadel and the plains of abraham and the falls at montmorenci and then they go away i should think theyd be tired always doing the same things to be sure theyre always different people  it was unfair to let her entertainer go on talking for quantity in this way and kitty said how glad she was to see the old residence and that she should always be grateful to her for asking them in she did not disabuse her of her error it cost less to leave it alone and when mr arbuton reappeared she took leave of those kind people with a sort of remote enjoyment of the wifes mistakenness concerning herself yet as the young matron and her husband stood beside the carriage repeating their adieux she would fain have prolonged the parting forever so much she dreaded to be left alone with mr arbuton but left alone with him her spirits violently rose and as they drove along under the shadow of the cliff she descanted in her liveliest strain upon the various interests of the way she dwelt on the beauty of the wide still river with the ships at anchor in it she praised the lovely sunsetlight on the other shore she commented lightly on the village through which they passed with the open doors and the suppers frying on the great stoves set into the partitionwalls of each cleanly home she made him look at the two great stairways that climb the cliff from the lumberyards to the plains of abraham and the army of laborers each with his empty dinnerpail in hand scaling the once difficult heights on their way home to the suburb of st roch she did whatever she could to keep the talk to herself and yet away from herself part of the way the village was french and neat and pleasant then it grovelled with irish people and ceased to be a tolerable theme for discourse and so at last the silence against which she had battled fell upon them and deepened like a spell that she could not break  it would have been better for mr arbutons success just then if he had not broken it but failure was not within his reckoning for he had so long regarded this young girl de haut en bas to say it brutally that he could not imagine she should feel any doubt in accepting him moreover a magnanimous sense of obligation mingled with his confident love for she must have known that he had overheard that speech at the residence perhaps he let this feeling color his manner however faintly he lacked the last fine instinct he could not forbear and he spoke while all her nerves and fluttering pulses cried him mercy     xi  kitty answers   it was dimmest twilight when kitty entered mrs ellisons room and sank down on the first chair in silence  the colonel met a friend at the st louis and forgot about the expedition kitty said fanny and he only came in half an hour ago but its just as well i know youve had a splendid time wheres mr arbuton  kitty burst into tears  why has anything happened to him cried mrs ellison springing towards her  to him no what should happen to him kitty demanded with an indignant accent  well then has anything happened to you  i dont know if you can call it happening but i suppose youll be satisfied now fanny hes offered himself to me kitty uttered the last words with a sort of violence as if since the fact must be stated she wished it to appear in the sharpest relief  o dear said mrs ellison not so well satisfied as the successful matchmaker ought to be so long as it was a marriage in the abstract she had never ceased to desire it but as the actual union of kitty and this mr arbuton of whom really they knew so little and of whom if she searched her heart she had as little liking as knowledge it was another affair mrs ellison trembled at her triumph and began to think that failure would have been easier to bear were they in the least suited to each other would she like to see poor kitty chained for life to that impassive egotist whose very merits were repellent and whose modesty even seemed to convict and snub you mrs ellison was not able to put the matter to herself with moderation either way doubtless she did mr arbuton injustice now did you accept him she whispered feebly  accept him repeated kitty no  o dear again sighed mrs ellison feeling that this was scarcely better and not daring to ask further  im dreadfully perplexed fanny said kitty after waiting for the questions which did not come and i wish youd help me think  i will darling but i dont know that ill be of much use i begin to think im not very good at thinking  kitty who longed chiefly to get the situation more distinctly before herself gave no heed to this confession but went on to rehearse the whole affair the twilight lent her its veil and in the kindly obscurity she gathered courage to face all the facts and even to find what was droll in them  it was very solemn of course and i was frightened but i tried to keep my wits about me and not to say yes simply because that was the easiest thing i told him that i didnt knowand i dont and that i must have time to thinkand i must he was very ungenerous and said he had hoped i had already had time to think and he couldnt seem to understand or else i couldnt very well explain how it had been with me all along  he might certainly say you had encouraged him mrs ellison remarked thoughtfully  encouraged him fanny how can you accuse me of such indelicacy  encouraging isnt indelicacy the gentlemen have to be encouraged or of course theyd never have any courage theyre so timid naturally  i dont think mr arbuton is very timid he seemed to think that he had only to ask as a matter of form and i had no business to say anything what has he ever done for me and hasnt he often been intensely disagreeable he oughtnt to have spoken just after overhearing what he did it was horrid to do so he was very obtuse too not to see that girls cant always be so certain of themselves as men or if they are dont know they are as soon as theyre asked  yes interrupted mrs ellison thats the way with girls i do believe that most of themwhen theyre young like you kittynever think of marriage as the end of their flirtations theyd just like the attentions and the romance to go on forever and never turn into anything more serious and theyre not to blame for that though they do get blamed for it  certainly assented kitty eagerly thats it thats just what i was saying thats the very reason why girls must have time to make up their minds you had i suppose  yes two minutes poor dick was going back to his regiment and stood with his watch in his hand i said no and called after him to correct myself but kitty if the romance had happened to stop without his saying anything you wouldnt have liked that either would you  no faltered kitty i suppose not  well then dont you see thats a great point in his favor how much time did you want or did he give you  i said i should answer before we left quebec answered kitty with a heavy sigh  dont you know what to say now  i cant tell thats what i want you to help me think out  mrs ellison was silent for a moment before she said well then i suppose we shall have to go back to the very beginning  yes assented kitty faintly  you did have a sort of fancy for him the first time you saw him didnt you asked mrs ellison coaxingly while forcing herself to be systematic and coherent by a mental strain of which no idea can be given  yes said kitty yet more faintly adding but i cant tell just what sort of a fancy it was i suppose i admired him for being handsome and stylish and for having such exquisite manners  go on said mrs ellison and after you got acquainted with him  why you know weve talked that over once already fanny  yes but we oughtnt to skip anything now replied mrs ellison in a tone of judicial accuracy which made kitty smile  but she quickly became serious again and said afterwards i couldnt tell whether to like him or not or whether he wanted me to i think he acted very strangely for a person inlove i used to feel so troubled and oppressed when i was with him he seemed always to be making himself agreeable under protest  perhaps that was just your imagination kitty  perhaps it was but it troubled me just the same  well and then  well and then after that day of the montgomery expedition he seemed to change altogether and to try always to be pleasant and to do everything he could to make me like him i dont know how to account for it ever since then hes been extremely careful of me and behavedof course without knowing itas if i belonged to him already or maybe ive imagined that too its very hard to tell what has really happened the last two weeks  kitty was silent and mrs ellison did not speak at once presently she asked was his acting as if you belonged to him disagreeable  i cant tell i think it was rather presuming i dont know why he did it  do you respect him demanded mrs ellison  why fanny ive always told you that i did respect some things in him  mrs ellison had the facts before her and it rested upon her to sum them up and do something with them she rose to a sitting posture and confronted her task  well kitty ill tell you i dont really know what to think but i can say this if you liked him at first and then didnt like him and afterwards he made himself more agreeable and you didnt mind his behaving as if you belonged to him and you respected him but after all didnt think him fascinating  he is fascinatingin a kind of way he was from the beginning in a story his cold snubbing puttingdown ways would have been perfectly fascinating  then why didnt you take him  because answered kitty between laughing and crying it isnt a story and i dont know whether i like him  but do you think you might get to like him  i dont know his asking brings back all the doubts i ever had of him and that ive been forgetting the past two weeks i cant tell whether i like him or not if i did shouldnt i trust him more  well whether you are in love or not ill tell you what you are kitty cried mrs ellison provoked with her indecision and yet relieved that the worst whatever it was was postponed thereby for a day or two  what  youre  but at this important juncture the colonel came lounging in and kitty glided out of the room  richard said mrs ellison seriously and in a tone implying that it was the colonels fault as usual you know what has happened i suppose  no my dear i dont but no matter i will presently i dare say  o i wish for once you wouldnt be so flippant mr arbuton has offered himself to kitty  colonel ellison gave a quick sharp whistle of amazement but trusted himself to nothing more articulate  yes said his wife responding to the whistle and it makes me perfectly wretched  why i thought you liked him  i didnt like him but i thought it would be an excellent thing for kitty  and wont it  she doesnt know  doesnt know  no  the colonel was silent while mrs ellison stated the case in full and its pending uncertainty then he exclaimed vehemently as if his amazement had been growing upon him this is the most astonishing thing in the world who would ever have dreamt of that young iceberg being in love  havent i told you all along he was  o yes certainly but that might be taken either way you know you would discover the tender passion in the eye of a potato  colonel ellison said fanny with sternness why do you suppose hes been hanging about us for the last four weeks why should he have stayed in quebec do you think he pitied me or found you so very agreeable  well i thought he found us just tolerable and was interested in the place  mrs ellison made no direct reply to this pitiable speech but looked a scorn which happily for the colonel the darkness hid presently she said that bats did not express the blindness of men for any bat could have seen what was going on  why remarked the colonel i did have a momentary suspicion that day of the montgomery business they both looked very confused when i saw them at the end of that street and neither of them had anything to say but that was accounted for by what you told me afterwards about his adventure at the time i didnt pay much attention to the matter the idea of his being in love seemed too ridiculous  was it ridiculous for you to be in love with me  no and yet i cant praise my condition for its wisdom fanny  yes thats like men as soon as one of them is safely married he thinks all the lovemaking in the world has been done forever and he cant conceive of two young people taking a fancy to each other  thats something so fanny but grantingfor the sake of argument merelythat boston has been asking kitty to marry him and she doesnt know whether she wants him what are we to do about it i dont like him well enough to plead his cause do you when does kitty think shell be able to make up her mind  shes to let him know before we leave  the colonel laughed and so hes to hang about here on uncertainties for two whole days that is rather rough on him fanny what made you so eager for this business  eager i wasnt eager  well thenreluctantly acquiescent  why shes so literary and that  and what  how insultingintellectual and so on and i thought she would be just fit to live in a place where everybody is literary and intellectual that is i thought that if i thought anything  well said the colonel you may have been right on the whole but i dont think kitty is showing any particular force of mind just now that would fit her to live in boston my opinion is that its ridiculous for her to keep him in suspense she might as well answer him first as last shes putting herself under a kind of obligation by her delay ill talk to her  if you do youll kill her you dont know how shes wrought up about it  o well ill be careful of her sensibilities its my duty to speak with her im here in the place of a parent besides dont i know kitty ive almost brought her up  maybe youre right youre all so queer that perhaps youre right only do be careful richard you must approach the matter very delicatelyindirectly you know girls are different remember from young men and you mustnt be blunt do maneuver a little for once in your life  all right fanny you neednt be afraid of my doing anything awkward or sudden ill go to her room pretty soon after she is quieted down and have a good calm old fatherly conversation with her  the colonel was spared this errand for kitty had left some of her things on fannys table and now came back for them with a lamp in her hand her averted face showed the marks of weeping the corners of her firmset lips were downward bent as if some resolution which she had taken were very painful this the anxious fanny saw and she made a gesture to the colonel which any woman would have understood to enjoin silence or at least the utmost caution and tenderness of speech the colonel summoned his finesse and said cheerily well kitty whats boston been saying to you  mrs ellison fell back upon her sofa as if shot and placed her hand over her face  kitty seemed not to hear her cousin having gathered up her things she bent an unmoved face and an unseeing gaze full upon him and glided from the room without a word  well upon my soul cried the colonel this is a pleasant nightmarish sleepwalking ladymacbethish little transaction confound it fanny this comes of your wanting me to maneuver if youd let me come straight at the subjectlike a man  please richard dont say anything more now pleaded mrs ellison in a broken voice you cant help it i know and i must do the best i can under the circumstances do go away for a little while darling o dear  as for kitty when she had got out of the room in that phantasmal fashion she dimly recalled through the mists of her own trouble the colonels dismay at her so glooming upon him and began to think that she had used poor dick more tragically than she need and so began to laugh softly to herself but while she stood there at the entry window a moment laughing in the moonlight that made her lampflame thin and painted her face with its pale lustre mr arbuton came down the attic stairway he was not a man of quick fancies but to one of even slower imagination and of calmer mood she might very well have seemed unreal the creature of a dream fantastic intangible insensible arch not wholly without some touch of the malign in his heart he groaned over her beauty as if she were lost to him forever in this elfish transfiguration  miss ellison he scarcely more than whispered  you ought not to speak to me now she answered gravely  i know it but i could not help it for heavens sake do not let it tell against me i wished to ask if i should not see you tomorrow to beg that all might go on as had been planned and as if nothing had been said today  itll be very strange said kitty my cousins know everything now how can we meet before them  im not going away without an answer and we cant remain here without meeting it will be less strange if we let everything take its course  well  thanks  he looked strangely humbled but even more bewildered than humbled  she listened while he descended the steps unbolted the street door and closed it behind him then she passed out of the moonlight into her own room whose closecurtained space the lamp filled with its ruddy glow and revealed her again no malicious sprite but a very puzzled conscientious anxious young girl  of one thing at least she was clear it had all come about through misunderstanding through his taking her to be something that she was not for she was certain that mr arbuton was of too worldly a spirit to choose if he had known a girl of such origin and lot as she was only too proud to own the deception must have begun with dress and she determined that her first stroke for truth and sincerity should be most sublimely made in the return of fannys things and a rigid fidelity to her own dresses besides she could not help reflecting my travellingsuit will be just the thing for a picnic and here if the cynical reader of another sex is disposed to sneer at the method of her selfdevotion i am sure that women at least will allow it was most natural and highly proper that in this great moment she should first think of dress upon which so great consequences hang in matters of the heart whoto be honest for once o vain and conceited mencan deny that the cut the color the texture the stylish set of dresses has not had everything to do with the rapture of loves young dream are not certain bits of lace and knots of ribbon as much a part of it as any smile or sidelong glance of them all and hath not the long experience of the fair taught them that artful dress is half the virtue of their spells full well they know it and when kitty resolved to profit no longer by fannys wardrobe she had won the hardest part of the battle in behalf of perfect truth towards mr arbuton she did not indeed stop with this but lay awake devising schemes by which she should disabuse him of his errors about her and persuade him that she was no wife for him     xii  the picnic at chateaubigot   well said mrs ellison who had slipped into kittys room in the morning to do her back hair with some advantages of light which her own chamber lacked itll be no crazier than the rest of the performance and if you and he can stand it im sure that weve no reason to complain  why i dont see how its to be helped fanny hes asked it and im rather glad he has for i should have hated to have the conventional headache that keeps young ladies from being seen and at any rate i dont understand how the day could be passed more sensibly than just as we originally planned to spend it i can make up my mind a great deal better with him than away from him but i think there never was a more ridiculous situation now that the high tragedy has faded out of it and the serious part is coming it makes me laugh poor mr arbuton will feel all day that he is under my mercilessly critical eye and that he mustnt do this and he mustnt say that for fear of me and he cant run away for hes promised to wait patiently for my decision its a most inglorious position for him but i dont think of anything to do about it i could say no at once but hed rather not  what have you got that dress on for asked mrs ellison abruptly  because im not going to wear your things any more fanny its a case of conscience i feel like a guilty creature being courted in anothers clothes and i dont know but its for a kind of punishment of my deceit that i cant realize this affair as i ought or my part in it i keep feeling the whole time as if it were somebody else and i have an absurd kind of other persons interest in it  mrs ellison essayed some reply but was met by kittys steadfast resolution and in the end did not prevail in so much as a ribbon for her hair  it was not till well into the forenoon that the preparations for the picnic were complete and the four set off together in one carriage in the strong need that was on each of them to make the best of the affair the colonels unconsciousness might have been a little overdone but mrs ellisons demeanor was sublimely successful the situation gave full play to her peculiar genius and you could not have said that any act of hers failed to contribute to the perfection of her design that any tone or speech was too highly colored mr arbuton of whom she took possession and who knew that she knew all felt that he had never done justice to her and seconded her efforts with something like cordial admiration while kitty with certain grateful looks and aversions of the face paid an ardent homage to her strokes of tact and after a few miserable moments in which her nightlong trouble gnawed at her heart began in spite of herself to enjoy the humor of the situation  it is a lovely road out to ch√¢teaubigot first you drive through the ancient suburbs of the lower town and then you mount the smooth hard highway between pretty countryhouses toward the village of charlesbourg while quebec shows to your casual backwardglance like a wondrous painted scene with the spires and lofty roofs of the upper town and the long irregular wall wandering on the verge of the cliff then the thronging gables and chimneys of st roch and again many spires and convent walls lastly the shipping in the st charles which in one direction runs a narrowing gleam up into its valley and in the other widens into the broad light of the st lawrence quiet elmy spaces of meadow land stretch between the suburban mansions and the village of charlesbourg where the driver reassured himself as to his route from the group of idlers on the platform before the church then he struck off on a country road and presently turned from this again into a lane that grew rougher and rougher till at last it lapsed to a mere carttrack among the woods where the rich strong odors of the pine and of the wild herbs bruised under the wheels filled the air a peasant and his blackeyed openmouthed boy were cutting withes to bind hay at the side of the track and the latter consented to show the strangers to the ch√¢teau from a point beyond which they could not go with the carriage there the small habitant and the driver took up the picnicbaskets and led the way through pathless growths of underbrush to a stream so swift that it is said never to freeze so deeply sprung that the summer never drinks it dry a screen of watergrowths bordered it and when this was passed a wide open space revealed itself with the ruin of the ch√¢teau in the midst  the pathos of long neglect lay upon the scene for here were evidences of gardens and bowery aisles in other times and now for many a year desolation and the slow return of the wilderness the mountain rising behind the ch√¢teau grounds showed the dying flush of the deciduous leaves among the dark green of the pines that clothed it to the crest a cry of innumerable crickets filled the ear of the dreaming noon  the ruin itself is not of impressive size and it is a ch√¢teau by grace of the popular fancy rather than through any right of its own for it was in truth never more than the huntinglodge of the kings intendant bigot a man whose sins claim for him a lordly consideration in the history of quebec he was the last intendant before the british conquest and in that time of general distress he grew rich by oppression of the citizens and by peculation from the soldiers he built this pleasurehouse here in the woods and hither he rode out from quebec to enjoy himself in the chase and the carouses that succeed the chase here too it is said dwelt in secret the huron girl who loved him and who survives in the memory of the peasants as the murdered sauragesse and indeed there is as much proof that she was murdered as that she ever lived when the wicked bigot was arrested and sent to france where he was tried with great result of documentary record his ch√¢teau fell into other hands at last a party of arnolds men wintered there in 1775 and it is to our own countrymen that we owe the conflagration and the ruin of ch√¢teaubigot it stands as i said in the middle of that open place with the two gable walls and the stone partitionwall still almost entire and that day showing very effectively against the tender northern sky on the most weatherward gable the iron in the stone had shed a dark red stain under the lash of many winter storms and some tough lichens had incrusted patches of the surface but for the rest the walls rose in the univied nakedness of all ruins in our climate which has no clinging evergreens wherewith to pity and soften the forlornness of decay out of the rubbish at the foot of the walls there sprang a wilding growth of syringas and lilacs and the interior was choked with flourishing weeds and with the briers of the raspberry on which a few berries hung the heavy beams left where they fell a hundred years ago proclaimed the honest solidity with which the ch√¢teau had been built and there was proof in the cut stone of the hearths and chimneyplaces that it had once had at least the ambition of luxury  while its visitors stood amidst the ruin a harmless gardensnake slipped out of one crevice into another from her nest in some hidden corner overhead a silent bird flew away for the momentso slight is the capacity of any mood so deeply is the heart responsive to a little impulsethe palace of the c√¶sars could not have imparted a keener sense of loss and desolation they eagerly sought such particulars of the ruin as agreed with the descriptions they had read of it and were as well contented with a bit of cellarway outside as if they had really found the secret passage to the subterranean chamber of the ch√¢teau or the hoard of silver which the little habitant said was buried under it then they dispersed about the grounds to trace out the borders of the garden and mr arbuton won the common praise by discovering the foundations of the stable of the ch√¢teau  then there was no more to do but to prepare for the picnic they chose a grassy plot in the shadow of a halfdismantled barklodgea relic of the indians who resort to the place every summer in the ashes of that sylvan hearth they kindled their fire mr arbuton gathering the sticks and the colonel showing a peculiar genius in adapting the savage flames to the limitations of the civilized coffeepot borrowed of mrs gray mrs ellison laid the cloth much meditating the arrangement of the viands and reversing again and again the relative positions of the sliced tongue and the sardines that flanked the cold roast chicken and doubting dreadfully whether to put down the cake and the canned peaches at once or reserve them for a second course the stuffed olives drove her to despair being in a bottle and refusing to be balanced by anything less monumental in shape some wild asters and red leaves and green and yellowing sprays of fern which kitty arranged in a tumbler were hailed with rapture but presently flung far away with fierce disdain because they had ants on them kitty witnessed this outburst with her usual complacency and then went on making the coffee with such blissful pain as none but lovers know mr arbuton saw her break the egg upon the edge of the coffeepot and let it drop therein and then with a charming frenzy stir it round and round it was a picture of domestic suggestion a subtle insinuation of home the unconscious appeal of inherent housewifery to inherent husbandhood at the crash of the eggshell he trembled the swift agitation of the coffee and the egg within the pot made him dizzy  shant i stir that for you miss ellison he said awkwardly  o dear no she answered in surprise at a mans presuming to stir coffee but you may go get me some water at the creek if you please  she gave him a pitcher and he went off to the brook which was but a minutes distance away this minute however left her alone for the first time that day with both dick and fanny and a silence fell upon all three at once they could not help looking at one another and then the colonel to show that he was not thinking of anything began to whistle and mrs ellison rebuked him for whistling  why not he asked it isnt a funeral is it  of course it isnt said mrs ellison and kitty who had been blushing to the verge of tears laughed instead and then was consumed with vexation when mr arbuton came up feeling that he must suspect himself the motive of her illtimed mirth the champagne ought to be cooled i suppose observed mrs ellison when the coffee had been finally stirred and set to boil on the coals  im best acquainted with the brook said mr arbuton and i know just the eddy in it where the champagne will cool soonest  then you shall take it there answered the governess of the feast and mr arbuton duteously set off with the bottle in his hand  the pitcher of water which he had already brought stood in the grass by a sudden movement of the skirt kitty knocked it over the colonel made a start forward mrs ellison arrested him with a touch while she bent a look of ineffable admiration upon kitty  now ill teach myself said kitty that i cant be so clumsy with impunity ill go and fill that pitcher again myself she hurried after mr arbuton they scarcely spoke going or coming but the constraint that kitty felt was nothing to that she had dreaded in seeking to escape from the tacit raillery of the colonel and the championship of fanny yet she trembled to realize that already her life had become so far entangled with this strangers that she found refuge with him from her own kindred they could do nothing to help her in this the trouble was solely hers and his and they two must get out of it one way or other themselves the case scarcely admitted even of sympathy and if it had not been hers it would have been one to amuse her rather than appeal to her compassion even as it was she sometimes caught herself smiling at the predicament of a young girl who had passed a month in every appearance of lovemaking and who being asked her heart was holding her lover in suspense whilst she searched it and meantime was picnicking with him upon the terms of casual flirtation of all the heroines in her books she knew none in such a strait as this  but her perplexities did not impair the appetite which she brought to the sylvan feast in her whole simple life she had never tasted champagne before and she said innocently as she put the frisking fluid from her lips after the first taste why i thought you had to learn to like champagne  no remarked the colonel its like reading and writing it comes by nature i suppose that even one of the lower animals would like champagne the refined instinct of young ladies makes them recognize its merits instantly some of the confederate cellars added the colonel thoughtfully had very good champagne in them green seal was the favorite of our erring brethren it wasnt one of their errors i prefer it myself to our own native cider whether made of apples or grapes yes its better even than the water from the old chainpump in the back yard at eriecreek though it hasnt so fine a flavor of lubricating oil in it  the faint chill that touched mr arbuton at the mention of eriecreek and its petrolic associations was transient he was very light of heart since the advance that kitty seemed to have made him and in his temporary abandon he talked well and promoted the pleasure of the time without critical reserves when the colonel with the reluctance of our soldiers to speak of their warlike experiences before civilians had suffered himself to tell a story that his wife begged of him about his last battle mr arbuton listened with a deference that flattered poor mrs ellison and made her marvel at kittys doubt concerning him and then he spoke entertainingly of some travel experiences of his own which he politely excused as quite unworthy to come after the colonels story he excused them a little too much and just gave the modest soldier a faint uneasy fear of having boasted but no one else felt this result of his delicacy and the feast was merry enough when it was ended mrs ellison being still a little infirm of foot remained in the shadow of the barklodge and the colonel lit his cigar and loyally stretched himself upon the grass before her  there was nothing else for kitty and mr arbuton but to stroll off together and she preferred to do this  they sauntered up to the ch√¢teau in silence and peered somewhat languidly about the ruin on a bit of smooth surface in a sheltered place many names of former visitors were written and mr arbuton said he supposed they might as well add those of their own party  o yes answered kitty with a halfsigh seating herself upon a fallen stone and letting her hands fall into each other in her lap as her wont was you write them a curious pensiveness passed from one to the other and possessed them both  mr arbuton began to write suddenly miss ellison said he with a smile ive blundered in your name i neglected to put the miss before it and now there isnt room on the plastering  o never mind replied kitty i dare say it wont be missed  mr arbuton neither perceived nor heeded the pun he was looking in a sort of rapture at the name which his own hand had written now for the first time and he felt an indecorous desire to kiss it  if i could speak it as ive written it  i dont see what harm there would be in that said the owner of the name or what object she added more discreetly  i should feel that i had made a great gain  i never told you answered kitty evasively how much i admire your first name mr arbuton  how did you know it  it was on the card you gave my cousin said kitty frankly but thinking he now must know she had been keeping his card  its an old family namea sort of heirloom from the first of us who came to the country and in every generation since some arbuton has had to wear it  its superb cried kitty miles miles standish the puritan captain miles standish the captain of plymouth i should be very proud of such a name  you have only to take it he said gravely  o i didnt mean that she said with a blush and then added yours is a very old family then isnt it  yes its pretty well answered mr arbuton but its not such a rare thing in the east you know  i suppose not the ellisons are not an old family if we went back of my uncle we should only come to backwoodsmen and indian fighters perhaps thats the reason we dont care much for old families you think a great deal of them in boston dont you  we do and we dont its a long story and im afraid i couldnt make you understand unless you had seen something of boston society  mr arbuton said kitty abruptly plunging to the bottom of the subject on which they had been hovering im dreadfully afraid that what you said to mewhat you asked of me yesterdaywas all through a misunderstanding im afraid that youve somehow mistaken me and my circumstances and that somehow ive innocently helped on your mistake  there is no mistake he answered eagerly about my loving you  kitty did not look up nor answer this outburst which flattered while it pained her she said ive been so much mistaken myself and ive been so long finding it out that i should feel anxious to have you know just what kind of girl youd asked to be your wife before i  what  nothing but i should want you to know that in many things my life has been very very different from yours the first thing i can rememberyoull think im more autobiographical than our driver at haha bay even but i must tell you all thisis about kansas where we had moved from illinois and of our having hardly enough to eat or wear and of my mother grieving over our privations at last when my father was killed she said dropping her voice in front of our own door  mr arbuton gave a start killed  yes didnt you know or no how could you he was shot by the missourians  whether it was not hopelessly out of taste to have a fatherinlaw who had been shot by the missourians whether he could persuade kitty to suppress that part of her history that she looked very pretty sitting there with her earnest eyes lifted toward his these things flashed wilfully through mr arbutons mind  my father was a freestate man continued kitty in a tone of pride he wasnt when he first went to kansas she added simply while mr arbuton groped among his recollections of that forgotten struggle for some association with these names keenly feeling the squalor of it all and thinking still how very pretty she was he went out there to publish a proslavery paper but when he found out what the border ruffians really were he turned against them he used to be very bitter about my uncles having become an abolitionist they had had a quarrel about it but father wrote to him from kansas and they made it up and before father died he was able to tell mother that we were to go to uncles but mother was sick then and she only lived a month after father and when my cousin came out to get us just before she died there was scarcely a crust of cornbread in our cabin it seemed like heaven to get to eriecreek but even at eriecreek we live in a way that i am afraid you wouldnt respect my uncle has just enough and we are very plain people indeed i suppose continued the young girl meekly that i havent had at all what youd call an education uncle told me what to read at first and after that i helped myself it seemed to come naturally but dont you see that it wasnt an education  i beg pardon said mr arbuton with a blush for he had just then lost the sense of what she said in the music of her voice as it hesitated over these particulars of her history  i mean explained kitty that im afraid i must be very onesided im dreadfully ignorant of a great many things i havent any accomplishments only the little bit of singing and playing that youve heard i couldnt tell a good picture from a bad one ive never been to the opera i dont know anything about society now just imagine cried kitty with sublime impartiality such a girl as that in boston  even mr arbuton could not help smiling at this comic earnestness while she resumed at home my cousins and i do all kinds of things that the ladies whom you know have done for them we do our own work for one thing she continued with a sudden treacherous misgiving that what she was saying might be silly and not heroic but bravely stifling her doubt my cousin virginia is housekeeper and rachel does the sewing and im a kind of maidofallwork  mr arbuton listened respectfully vainly striving for some likeness of miss ellison in the figure of the different secondgirls who during life had taken his card or shown him into drawingrooms or waited on him at table failing in this he tried her in the character of daughter of that kind of farmhouse where they take summer boarders and do their own work but evidently the ellisons were not of that sort either and he gave it up and was silent not knowing what to say while kitty a little piqued by his silence went on were not ashamed you understand of our ways theres such a thing as being proud of not being proud and thats what we are or what i am for the rest are not mean enough ever to think about it and once i wasnt either but thats the kind of life im used to and though ive read of other kinds of life a great deal ive not been brought up to anything different dont you understand and maybei dont knowi mightnt like or respect your kind of people any more than they did me my uncle taught us ideas that are quite different from yours and what if i shouldnt be able to give them up  there is only one thing i know or see i love you he said passionately and drew nearer by a step but she put out her hand and repelled him with a gesture  sometimes you might be ashamed of me before those you knew to be my inferiorsreally common and coarseminded people but regularly educated and used to money and fashion i should cower before them and i never could forgive you  ive one answer to all this i love you  kitty flushed in generous admiration of his magnanimity and said with more of tenderness than she had yet felt towards him im sorry that i cant answer you now as you wish mr arbuton  but you will tomorrow  she shook her head i dont know o i dont know ive been thinking of something that mrs march asked me to visit her in boston but we had given up doing so because of the long delay here if i asked my cousins theyd still go home that way its too bad to put you off again but you must see me in boston if only for a day or two and after youve got back into your old associations there before i answer you im in great trouble you must wait or i must say no  ill wait said mr arbuton  o thank you sighed kitty grateful for this patience and not for the chance of still winning him you are very forbearing im sure  she again put forth her hand but not now to repel him he clasped it and kept it in his then impulsively pressed it against his lips  colonel and mrs ellison had been watching the whole pantomime forgotten  well said the colonel i suppose thats the end of the play isnt it i dont like it fanny i dont like it  hush whispered mrs ellison  they were both puzzled when kitty and mr arbuton came towards them with anxious faces kitty was painfully revolving in her mind what she had just said and thinking she had said not so much as she meant and yet so much more and tormenting herself with the fear that she had been at once too bold and too meek in her demand for longer delay did it not give him further claim upon her must it not have seemed a very audacious thing what right had she to make it and how could she now finally say no then the matter of her explanation to him was it in the least what she meant to say must it not give him an idea of intellectual and spiritual poverty in her life which she knew had not been in it would he not believe in spite of her boasts that she was humiliated before him by a feeling of essential inferiority o had she boasted what she meant to do was just to make him understand clearly what she was but had she could he be made to understand this with what seemed his narrow conception of things outside of his own experience was it worth while to try did she care enough for him to make the effort desirable had she made it for his sake or in the interest of truth merely or in selfdefence  these and a thousand other like questions beset her the whole way home to quebec amid the frequent pauses of the talk and underneath whatever she was saying half the time she answered yes or no to them and not to what dick or fanny or mr arbuton had asked her she was distraught with their recurrence as they teased about her like angry bees and one now and then settled and stung and stung through the whole night too they pursued her in dreams with pitiless iteration and fantastic change and at dawn she was awakened by voices calling up to her from the ursulines gardenthe slim pale nun crying out in a lamentable accent that all men were false and there was no shelter save the convent or the grave and the comfortable sister bemoaning herself that on meagre days madame de la peltrie ate nothing but chokecherries from ch√¢teaubigot  kitty rose and dressed herself and sat at the window and watched the morning come into the garden below first a tremulous flush of the heavens then a rosy light on the silvery roofs and gables then little golden aisles among the lilacs and hollyhocks the tiny flowerbeds just under her window were left with their snapdragons and larkspurs in dew and shadow the small dog stood on the threshold and barked uneasily when the bell rang in the ursulines chapel where the nuns were at matins  it was sunday and a soft tranquillity blest the cool air in which the young girl bathed her troubled spirit a faint anticipative homesickness mingled now with her nightlong anxietya pity for herself that on the morrow she must leave those pretty sights which had become so dear to her that she could not but feel herself native among them she must go back to eriecreek which was not a walled city and had not a stone building much less a cathedral or convent within its borders and though she dearly loved those under her uncles roof there yet she had to own that beyond that shelter there was little in eriecreek to touch the heart or take the fancy that the village was ugly and the village people mortally dull narrow and uncongenial why was not her lot cast somewhere else why should she not see more of the world that she had found so fair and which all her aspirations had fitted her to enjoy quebec had been to her a rapture of beautiful antiquity but europe but london venice rome those infinitely older and more storied cities of which she had lately talked so much with mr arbutonwhy should she not see them  here for the guilty space of a heatlightning flash kitty wickedly entertained the thought of marrying mr arbuton for the sake of a bridal trip to europe and bade love and the fitness of things and the incompatibility of boston and eriecreek traditions take care of themselves but then she blushed for her meanness and tried to atone for it as she could by meditating the praise of mr arbuton she felt remorse for having as he had proved yesterday undervalued and misunderstood him and she was willing now to think him even more magnanimous than his generous words and conduct showed him it would be a base return for his patience to accept him from a worldly ambition a man of his noble spirit merited the best that love could give but she respected him at last she respected him fully and entirely and she could tell him that at any rate  the words in which he had yesterday protested his love for her repeated themselves constantly in her revery if he should speak them again after he had seen her in boston in the light by which she was anxious to be testedshe did not know what she should say     xiii  ordeal   they had not planned to go anywhere that day but after church they found themselves with the loveliest afternoon of their stay at quebec to be passed somehow and it was a pity to pass it indoors the colonel said at their early dinner they canvassed the attractions of the different drives out of town and they decided upon that to lorette the ellisons had already been there but mr arbuton had not and it was from a dim motive of politeness towards him that mrs ellison chose the excursion though this did not prevent her from wondering aloud afterward from time to time why she had chosen it he was restless and absent and answered at random when points of the debate were referred to him but he eagerly assented to the conclusion and was in haste to set out  the road to lorette is through st johns gate down into the outlying meadows and ryefields where crossing and recrossing the swift st charles it finally rises at lorette above the level of the citadel it is a lonelier road than that to montmorenci and the scattering cottages upon it have not the welltodo prettiness the operatic repair of stonebuilt beauport but they are charming nevertheless and the people seem to be remoter from modern influences peasantgirls in purple gowns and broad straw hats and not the fashions of the year before last now and then appeared to our acquaintance near one ancient cottage an old man in the true habitants red woollen cap with a long fall leaned over the bars of his gate and smoked a short pipe  by and by they came to jeunelorette an almost ideally pretty hamlet bordering the road on either hand with galleried and balconied little houses from which the people bowed to them as they passed and piously enclosing in its midst the village church and churchyard they soon after reached lorette itself which they might easily have known for an indian town by its unkempt air and the irregular attitudes in which the shabby cabins lounged along the lanes that wandered through it even if the ellisons had not known it already or if they had not been welcomed by a pomp of indian boys and girls of all shades of darkness the girls had beadwrought moccasins and workbags to sell and the boys bore bows and arrows and burst into loud cries of shoot shoot grand shoot putuppennies shootthepennies grand shoot when they recognized the colonel as they did after the party had dismounted in front of the church they renewed these cries with greater vehemence  now richard implored his wife youre not going to let those little pests go through all that shooting performance again  i must it is expected of me whenever i come to lorette and i would never be the man to neglect an ancient observance of this kind the colonel stuck a copper into the hard sand as he spoke and a small storm of arrows hurtled around it presently it flew into the air and a fairfaced blueeyed boy picked it up he won most of the succeeding coins  theres an aborigine of pure blood remarked the colonel his ancestors came from normandy two hundred years ago thats the reason he uses the bow so much better than these coffeecolored impostors  they went into the chapel which stands on the site of the ancient church burnt not long ago it is small and it is bare and rude inside with only the commonest ornamentation about the altar on one side of which was the painted wooden statue of a nun on the other that of a priestslight enough commemoration of those who had suffered so much for the hopeless race that lingers and wastes at lorette in incurable squalor and wildness they are christians after their fashion this poor remnant of the mighty huron nation converted by the jesuits and crushed by the iroquois in the farwestern wilderness but whatever they are at heart they are still savage in countenance and these boys had faces of wolves and foxes they followed their visitors into the church where there was only an old woman praying to a picture beneath which hung a votive hand and foot and a few young huron suppliants with very sleek hair whose wandering devotions seemed directed now at the strangers and now at the wooden effigy of the house of st ann borne by two gilt angels above the highaltar there was no service and the visitors soon quitted the chapel amid the clamors of the boys outside some young girls in the dress of our period were promenading up and down the road with their arms about each other and their eyes alert for the effect upon spectators  from one of the village lanes came swaggering towards the visitors a figure of aggressive fashiona very buckish young fellow with a heavy black mustache and black eyes who wore a jaunty round hat blue checked trousers a white vest and a morningcoat of blue diagonals buttoned across his breast in his hand he swung a light cane  that is the son of the chief paul picot whispered the driver  excuse me said the colonel instantly and the young gentleman nodded can you tell me if we could see the chief today  o yes answered the notary in english my father is chief you can see him and passed on with a somewhat supercilious air  the colonel in his first hours at quebec had bought at a bazaar of indian wares the photograph of an indian warrior in a splendor of factitious savage panoply it was called the last of the hurons and the colonel now avenged himself for the curtness of m picot by styling him the next to the last of the hurons  well said fanny who had a wifes willingness to see her husband occasionally snubbed i dont know why you asked him im sure nobody wants to see that old chief and his wretched bead trumpery again  my dear answered the colonel wherever americans go they like to be presented at court mr arbuton here ive no doubt has been introduced to the crowned heads of the old world and longs to pay his respects to the sovereign of lorette besides i always call upon the reigning prince when i come to lorette the coldness of the heirapparent shall not repel me  the colonel led the way up the principal lane of the village some of the cabins were ineffectually whitewashed but none of them were so uncleanly within as the outside prophesied at the doors and windows sat women and young girls working moccasins here and there stood a wellfed mother of a family with an infant huron in her arms they all showed the traces of white blood as did the little ones who trooped after the strangers and demanded charity as clamorously as so many italians only a few faces were of a clear dark as if stained by walnutjuice and it was plain that the hurons were fading if not dying out they responded with a queer mixture of french liveliness and savage stolidity to the colonels jocose advances great lean dogs lounged about the thresholds they and the women and children were alone visible there were no men none of the houses were fenced save the chiefs this stood behind a neat grass plot across which at the moment our travellers came up two youngish women were trailing in long morninggowns and eyeglasses the chiefs house was a handsome cottage papered and carpeted with a huge stove in the parlor where also stood a table exposing the bead trumpery of mrs ellisons scorn a fullbodied elderly man with quick black eyes and a tranquil dark face stood near it he wore a halfmilitary coat with brass buttons and was the chief picot at sight of the colonel he smiled slightly and gave his hand in welcome then he sold such of his wares as the colonel wanted rather discouraging than inviting purchase he talked upon some urgency of his people who he said numbered three hundred and were a few of them farmers but were mostly hunters and in the service of the officers of the garrison spent the winter in the chase he spoke fair english but reluctantly and he seemed glad to have his guests go who were indeed willing enough to leave him  mr arbuton especially was willing for he had been longing to find himself alone with kitty of which he saw no hope while the idling about the village lasted  the colonel bought an insane watchpocket for une dolleur from a pretty little girl as they returned through the village but he forbade the boys any more archery at his expense with pas de grand shoot now mes enfansfriends he added to his own party we have the falls of lorette and the better part of the afternoon still before us how shall we employ them  mrs ellison and kitty did not know and mr arbuton did not know as they sauntered down past the chapel to the stone mill that feeds its industry from the beauty of the fall the cascade with two or three successive leaps above the road plunges headlong down a steep crescentshaped slope and hides its foamy whiteness in the darkfoliaged ravine below it is a wonder of graceful motion of iridescent lights and delicious shadows a shape of loveliness that seems instinct with a conscious life its beauty like that of all natural marvels on our continent is on a generous scale and now the spectators after viewing it from the mill passed for a different prospect of it to the other shore and there the colonel and fanny wandered a little farther down the glen leaving kitty with mr arbuton the affair between them was in such a puzzling phase that there was as much reason for as against this nobody could do anything not even openly recognize it besides it was somehow very interesting to kitty to be there alone with him and she thought that if all were well and he and she were really engaged the sense of recent betrothal could be nowhere else half so sweet as in that wild and lovely place she began to imagine a bliss so divine that it would have been strange if she had not begun to desire it and it was with a half reluctant halfacquiescent thrill that she suffered him to touch upon what was first in both their minds  i thought you had agreed not to talk of that again for the present she feebly protested  no i was not forbidden to tell you i loved you i only consented to wait for my answer but now i shall break my promise i cannot wait i think the conditions you make dishonor me said mr arbuton with an impetuosity that fascinated her  o how can you say such a thing as that she asked liking him for his resentment of conditions that he found humiliating while her heart leaped remorseful to her lips for having imposed them you know very well why i wanted to delay and you know thatthatifi had done anything to wound you i never could forgive myself  but you doubted me all the same he rejoined  did i i thought it was myself that i doubted she was stricken with sudden misgiving as to what had seemed so well her words tended rapidly she could not tell whither  but why do you doubt yourself  ii dont know  no he said bitterly for its really me that you doubt i cant understand what you have seen in me that makes you believe anything could change me towards you he added with a kind of humbleness that touched her i could have borne to think that i was not worthy of you  not worthy of me i never dreamed of such a thing  but to have you suspect me of such meanness  o mr arbuton  as you hinted yesterday is a disgrace that i ought not to bear i have thought of it all night and i must have my answer now whatever it is  she did not speak for every word that she had uttered had only served to close escape behind her she did not know what to do she looked up at him for help he said with an accent of meekness pathetic from him why must you still doubt me  i dont she scarcely more than breathed  then you are mine now without waiting and forever he cried and caught her to him in a swift embrace  she only said oh in a tone of gentle reproach yet clung to him a helpless moment as for rescue from himself she looked at him in blank pallor striving to realize the tender violence in which his pulses wildly exulted then a burning flush dyed her face and tears came into her eyes o i hope youll never be sorry she said and then do let us go for she had no distinct desire save for movement for escape from that place  her heart had been surprised she hardly knew how but at his kiss a novel tenderness had leaped to life in it she suffered him to put her hand upon his arm and then she began to feel a strange pride in his being tall and handsome and hers but she kept thinking as they walked i hope hell never he sorry and she said it again half in jest he pressed her hand against his heart and met her look with one of protest and reassurance that presently melted into something sweeter yet he said what beautiful eyes you have i noticed the long lashes when i saw you on the saguenay boat and i couldnt get away from them  o please dont speak of that dreadful time cried kitty  no why not  o because i think it was such a bold kind of accident my taking your arm by mistake and the whole next day has always been a perfect horror to me  he looked at her in questioning amaze  i think i was very pert with you all dayand i dont think im pert naturallytaking you up about the landscape and twitting you about the saguenay scenery and legends you know but i thought you were trying to put me downyou are rather downputting at timesand i admired you and i couldnt bear it  oh said mr arbuton he dimly recollected as if it had been in some former state of existence that there were things he had not approved in kitty that day but now he met her penitence with a smile and another pressure of the hand well then he said if you dont like to recall that time lets go back of it to the day i met you on goat island bridge at niagara  o did you see me there i thought you didnt but i saw you you had on a blue cravat she answered and he returned with as much the air of coherency as if really continuing the same train of thought you wont think it necessary to visit boston now i suppose and he smiled triumphantly upon her i fancy that i have now a better right to introduce you there than your south end friends  kitty smiled too im willing to wait but dont you think you ought to see eriecreek before you promise too solemnly i cant allow that theres anything serious till youve seen me at home  they had been going for no reason that they knew back to the country inn near which you purchase admittance to a certain view of the falls and now they sat down on the piazza somewhat apart from other people who were there as mr arbuton said o i shall visit eriecreek soon enough but i shall not come to put myself or you to the proof i dont ask to see you at home before claiming you forever  kitty murmured ah you are more generous than i was  i doubt it  o yes you are but i wonder if youll be able to find eriecreek  is it on the map  its on the county map and so is uncle jacks lot on it and a picture of his house for that matter theyll all be standing on the piazzasomething like this onewhen you come up youll know uncle jack by his big gray beard and his bushy eyebrows and his boots which he wont have blacked and his leghorn hat which we cant get him to change the girls will be there with himvirginia all red and heated with having got supper for you and rachel with the family mending in her handand theyll both come running down the walk to welcome you how will you like it  mr arbuton suspected the gross caricature of this picture and smiled securely at it i shall like it well enough he said if you run down with them where shall you be  i forgot i shall be up stairs in my room peeping through the windowblinds to see how you take it then i shall come down and receive you with dignity in the parlor but after supper youll have to excuse me while i help with the dishes uncle jack will talk to you hell talk to you about boston hes much fonder of boston than you are even and here kitty broke off with a laugh thinking what a very different boston her uncle jacks was from mr arbutons and maliciously diverted with what she conceived of their mutual bewilderment in trying to get some common standpoint he had risen from his chair and was now standing a few paces from her looking toward the fall as if by looking he might delay the coming of the colonel and fanny  she checked her merriment a moment to take note of two ladies who were coming up the path towards the porch where she was sitting mr arbuton did not see them the ladies mounted the steps and turned slowly and languidly to survey the company but at sight of mr arbuton one of them advanced directly toward him with exclamations of surprise and pleasure and he with a stupefied face and a mechanical movement turned to meet her  she was a lady of more than middle age dressed with certain personal audacities of color and shape rather than overdressed and she thrust forward in expression of her amazement a very small hand wonderfully well gloved her manner was full of the anxiety of a woman who had fought hard for a high place in society and yet suggested a latent hatred of people who in yielding to her had made success bitter and humiliating  her companion was a young and very handsome girl exquisitely dressed and just so far within the fashion as to show her already a mistress of style but it was not the vivid new york stylishness a peculiar restraint of line an effect of ladylike concession to the ruling mode a temperance of ornament marked the whole array and stamped it with the unmistakable character of boston her clear tints of lip and cheek and eye were incomparable her blond hair gave weight to the poise of her delicate head by its rich and decent masses she had a look of independent innocence an angelic expression of extremely nice young fellow blending with a subtle maidenly charm she indicated her surprise at seeing mr arbuton by pressing the point of her sunumbrella somewhat nervously upon the floor and blushing a very little then she gave him her hand with friendly frankness and smiled dazzlingly upon him while the elder hailed him with effusive assertion of familiar acquaintance heaping him with greetings and flatteries and cries of pleasure  o dear sighed kitty these are old friends of his and will i have to know them perhaps its best to begin at once though she thought  but he made no movement toward her where she sat the ladies began to walk up and down and he with them as they passed her he did not seem to see her  the ladies said they were waiting for their carriage which they had left at a certain point when they went to look at the fall and had ordered to take them up at the inn they talked about people and things that kitty had never heard of  have you seen the trailings since you left newport asked the elder woman  no said mr arbuton  perhaps youll be surprised thenor perhaps you wontto hear that we parted with them on the top of mount washington thursday and the mayflowers are at the glen house the mountains are horribly full but what are you to do now the continentshe spoke as if the english channel divided it from usis so common you cant run over there any more  whenever they walked towards kitty this woman whose quick eye had detected mr arbuton at her side as she came up to the inn bent upon the young girls face a stare of insolent curiosity yet with a front of such impassive coldness that to another she might not have seemed aware of her presence kitty shuddered at the thought of being made acquainted with her then she remembered why how stupid i am of course a gentleman cant introduce ladies and the only thing for him to do is to excuse himself to them as soon as he can without rudeness and come back to me but none the less she felt helpless and deserted though ordinarily so brave she was so beaten down by that look that for a glance of not unkindly interest that the young lady gave her she was abjectly grateful she admired her and fancied that she could easily be friends with such a girl as that if they met fairly she wondered that she should be there with that other not knowing that society cannot really make distinctions between fine and coarse and could not have given her a reason for their association  still the three walked up and down before kitty and still she made his peace with herself thinking he is embarrassed he cant come to me at once but he will of course  the elder of his companions talked on in her loud voice of this thing and that of her summer and of the people she had met and of their places and yachts and horses and all the splendors of their keepingtalk which kittys aching sense sometimes caught by fragments and sometimes in full the lady used a slang of deprecation and apology for having come to such a queer resort as quebec and raised her brows when mr arbuton reluctantly owned how long he had been there  ah ah she said briskly bringing the group to a standstill while she spoke one doesnt stay in a slow canadian city a whole month for love of the place come mr arbuton is she english or french  kittys heart beat thickly and she whispered to herself o nownow surely he must do something  or perhaps continued his tormentor shes some fair fellowwanderer in these canadian wildssome pretty companion of voyage  mr arbuton gave a kind of start at this like one thrilled for an instant with a sublime impulse he cast a quick stealthy look at kitty and then as suddenly withdrew his glance what had happened to her who was usually dressed so prettily alas true to her resolution kitty had again refused fannys dresses that morning and had faithfully put on her own travellingsuitthe suit which rachel had made her and which had seemed so very well at eriecreek that they had called uncle jack in to admire it when it was tried on now she knew that it looked countrified and its unstylishness struck in upon her and made her feel countrified in soul yes she owned as she met mr arbutons glance im nothing but an awkward milkmaid beside that young lady this was unjust to herself but truly it was never in her present figure that he had intended to show her to his world which he had been sincere enough in contemning for her sake while away from it confronted with good society in these ladies its delegates he doubtless felt as never before the vastness of his selfsacrifice the difficulty of his enterprise and it would not have been so strange if just then she should have appeared to him through the hard cold vision of the best people instead of that which love had illumined she saw whatever purpose toward herself was in his eyes flicker and die out as they fell from hers then she sat alone while they three walked up and down up and down and the skirts of the ladies brushed her garments in passing  o where can dick and fanny be she silently bemoaned herself and why dont they come and save me from these dreadful people  she sat in a stony quiet while they talked on she thought forever their voices sounded in her ears like voices heard in a dream their laughter had a nightmare cruelty yet she was resolved to be just to mr arbuton she was determined not meanly to condemn him she confessed to herself with a glimmer of her wonted humor that her dress must be an ordeal of peculiar anguish to him and she half blamed herself for her conscientiousness in wearing it if she had conceived of any such chance as this she would perhaps she thought have worn fannys grenadine  she glanced again at the group which was now receding from her ah the elder of the ladies said again halting the others midway of the piazzas length theres the carriage at last but what is that stupid animal stopping for o i suppose he didnt understand and expects to take us up at the bridge provoking but its no use we may as well go to him at once its plain he isnt coming to us mr arbuton will you see us on board  whoi yes certainly he answered absently and for the second time he cast a furtive look at kitty who had half started to her feet in expectation of his coming to her before he wenta look of appeal or deprecation or reassurance as she chose to interpret it but after all a look only  she sank back in blank rejection of his look and so remained motionless as he led the way from the porch with a quick and anxious step since those people came he had not openly recognized her presence and now he had left her without a word she could not believe what she could not but divine and she was powerless to stir as the three moved down the road towards the carriage then she felt the tears spring to her eyes she flung down her veil and swept on by a storm of grief and pride and pain she hurried ran towards the grounds about the falls she thrust aside the boy who took money at the gate i have no money she said fiercely im going to look for my friends theyre in here  but dick and fanny were not to be seen instead as she fluttered wildly about in search of them she beheld mr arbuton who had missed her on his return to the inn coming with a frightened face to look for her she had hoped somehow never to see him again in the world but since it was to be she stood still and waited his approach in a strange composure while he drew nearer thinking how yesterday he had silenced her prophetic doubt of him i have one answer to all this i love you her faltering words verified so fatally soon recalled themselves to him with intolerable accusation and what should he say now if possiblyif by some miracleshe might not have seen what he feared she must one glance that he dared give her taught him better and while she waited for him to speak he could not lure any of the phrases of which the air seemed full to serve him  i wonder you came back to me she said after an eternal moment  came back he echoed vacantly  you seemed to have forgotten my existence  of course the whole wrong if any wrong had been done to her was tacit and much might be said to prove that she felt needlessly aggrieved and that he could not have acted otherwise than as he did she herself had owned that it must be an embarrassing position to him  why what have i done he began what makes you think for heavens sake listen to me he cried and then while she turned a mute attentive face to him he stood silent as before like one who has lost his thought and strives to recall what he was going to say what sensewhat use he resumed at last as if continuing the course of some previous argument would there have been in making a display of our acquaintance before them i did not suppose at first that they saw us together but here he broke off and indeed his explanation had but a mean effect when put into words i did not expect them to stay i thought they would go away every moment and then at last it was too late to manage the affair without seeming to force it this was better and he paused again for some sign of acquiescence from kitty and caught her eye fixed on his face in what seemed contemptuous wonder his own eyes fell and ran uneasily over her dress before he lifted them and began once more as if freshly inspired i could have wished you to be known to my friends with every advantage on your side and this had such a magnanimous sound that he took courage and you ought to have had faith enough in me to believe that i never could have meant you a slight if you had known more of the worldif your social experience had been greater you would have seen oh he cried desperately is there nothing you have to say to me  no said kitty simply but with a languid quiet and shrinking from speech as from an added pang you have been telling me that you were ashamed of me in this dress before those people but i knew that already what do you want me to do  if you give me time i can make everything clear to you  but now you dont deny it  deny what i  but here the whole fabric of mr arbutons defence toppled to the ground he was a man of scrupulous truth not accustomed to deceive himself or others he had been ashamed of her he could not deny it not to keep the love that was now dearer to him than life he saw it with paralyzing clearness and as an inexorable fact that confounded quite as much as it dismayed him he perceived that throughout that ignoble scene she had been the gentle person and he the vulgar one how could it have happened with a man like him as he looked back upon it he seemed to have been only the helpless sport of a sinister chance  but now he must act it could not go so it was too horrible a thing to let stand confessed a hundred protests thronged to his lips but he refused utterance to them all as worse even than silence and so still meaning to speak he could not speak he could only stand and wait while it wrung his heart to see her trembling grieving lips  his own aspect was so lamentable that she half pitied him half respected him for his truths sake you were right i think it wont be necessary for me to go to boston she said with a dim smile good by its all been a dreadful dreadful mistake  it was like him even in that humiliation not to have thought of losing her not to have dreamed but that he could somehow repair his error and she would yet willingly be his o no no no he cried starting forward dont say that it cant be it mustnt be you are angry now but i know youll see it differently dont be so quick with me with yourself i will do anything say anything you like  the tears stood in her eyes but they were cruel drops you cant say anything that wouldnt make it worse you cant undo whats been done and thats only a little part of what couldnt be undone the best way is for us to part its the only way  no there are all the ways in the world besides waitthinki implore you not to be soprecipitate  the unfortunate word incensed her the more it intimated that she was ignorantly throwing too much away i am not rash now but i was very rash half an hour ago i shall not change my mind again o she cried giving way it isnt what youve done but what you are and what i am thats the great trouble i could easily forgive whats happenedif you asked it but i couldnt alter both our whole lives or make myself over again and you couldnt change yourself perhaps you would try and i know that i would but it would be a wretched failure and disappointment as long as we lived ive learnt a great deal since i first saw those people and in truth he felt as if the young girl whom he had been meaning to lift to a higher level than her own at his side had somehow suddenly grown beyond him and his heart sank its foolish to try to argue such a thing but its true and you must let me go  i cant let you go he said in such a way that she longed at least to part kindly with him  you can make it hard for me she answered but the end will be the same  i wont make it hard for you then he returned after a pause in which he grew paler and she stood with a wan face plucking the red leaves from a low bough that stretched itself towards her  he turned and walked away some steps then he came suddenly back i wish to express my regret he began formally and with his old air of doing what was required of him as a gentleman that i should have unintentionally done anything to wound  o better not speak of that interrupted kitty with bitterness its all over now and the final tinge of superiority in his manner made her give him a little stab of dismissal good by i see my cousins coming  she stood and watched him walk away the sunlight playing on his figure through the mantling leaves till he passed out of the grove  the cataract roared with a sevenfold tumult in her ears and danced before her eyes all things swam together as in her blurred sight her cousins came wavering towards her  where is mr arbuton asked mrs ellison  kitty threw her arms about the neck of that foolish woman whoso loving heart she could not doubt and clung sobbing to her gone she said and mrs ellison wise for once asked no more  she had the whole story that evening without asking and whilst she raged she approved of kitty and covered her with praises and condolences  why of course fanny i didnt care for knowing those people what should i want to know them for but what hurt me was that he should so postpone me to them and ignore me before them and leave me without a word then when i ought to have been everything in the world to him and first of all i believe things came to me while i sat there as they do to drowning people all at once and i saw the whole affair more distinctly than ever i did we were too far apart in what we had been and what we believed in and respected ever to grow really together and if he gave me the highest position in the world i should have only that he never could like the people who had been good to me and whom i loved so dearly and he only could like me as far as he could estrange me from them if he could coolly put me aside now how would it be afterwards with the rest and with me too thats what flashed through me and i dont believe that getting splendidly married is as good as being true to the love that came long before and honestly living your own life out without fear or trembling whatever it is so perhaps said kitty with a fresh burst of tears you neednt condole with me so much fanny perhaps if you had seen him you would have thought he was the one to be pitied i pitied him though he was so cruel when he first turned to meet them youd have thought he was a man sentenced to death or under some dreadful spell or other and while he was walking up and down listening to that horrible comical old womanthe young lady didnt talk muchand trying to make straight answers to her and to look as if i didnt exist it was the most ridiculous thing in the world  how queer you are kitty  yes but you neednt think i didnt feel it i seemed to be like two persons sitting there one in agony and one just coolly watching it but o she broke out again while fanny held her closer in her arms how could he have done it how could he have acted so towards me and just after i had begun to think him so generous and noble it seems too dreadful to be true and with this kitty kissed her cousin and they had a little cry together over the trust so done to death and kitty dried her eyes and bade fanny a brave goodnight and went off to weep again upon her pillow  but before that she called fanny to her door and with a smile breaking through the trouble of her face she asked how do you suppose he got back i never thought of it before  oh cried mrs ellison with profound disgust i hope he had to walk back but im afraid there were only too many chances for him to ride i dare say he could get a calash at the hotel there  kitty had not spoken a word of reproach to fanny for her part in promoting this hapless affair and when the latter returning to her own room found the colonel there she told him the story and then began to discern that she was not without credit for kittys fortunate escape as she called it  yes said the colonel under exactly similar circumstances shell know just what to expect another time if thats any comfort  its a great comfort retorted mrs ellison you cant find out what the world is too soon i can tell you and if i hadnt maneuvered a little to bring them together kitty might have gone off with some lingering fancy for him and think what a misfortune that would have been  horrible  and now shell not have a single regret for him  i should think not said the colonel and he spoke in a tone of such dejection that it went to his wifes heart more than any reproach of kittys could have done youre all right and nobody blames you fanny but if you think its well for such a girl as kitty to find out that a man who has had the best that the world can give and has really some fine qualities of his own can be such a poor devil after all then i dont she may be the wiser for it but you know she wont be the happier  o dont dick dont speak seriously its so dreadful from you if you feel so about it why dont you do something  o yes theres a fine opening we know because we know ever so much more how the case really is but the way it seems to stand is that kitty couldnt bear to have him show civility to his friends and ran away and then wouldnt give him a chance to explain besides what could i do under any circumstances  well dick of course youre right and i wish i could see things as clearly as you do but i really believe kittys glad to be out of it  what thundered the colonel  i think kittys secretly relieved to have it all over but you neednt stun me  you do the colonel paused as if to gain force enough for a reply but after waiting nothing whatever came to him and he wound up his watch  to be sure added mrs ellison thoughtfully after a pause shes giving up a great deal and shell probably never have such another chance as long as she lives  i hope she wont said the colonel  o you neednt pretend that a high position and the social advantages he could have given her are to be despised  no you heartless worldling and neither are peace of mind and selfrespect and whole feelings and your little joke  o youyou sickly sentimentalist  thats what they used to call us in the good old abolition days laughed the colonel and the two being quite alone they made their peace with a kiss and were as happy for the moment as if they had thereby assuaged kittys grief and mortification  besides fanny continued the colonel though im not much on religion i believe these things are ordered  dont be blasphemous colonel ellison cried his wife who represented the church if not religion in her family as if providence had anything to do with loveaffairs  well i wont but i will say that if kitty turned her back on mr arbuton and the social advantages he could offer her its a sign she wasnt fit for them and poor thing if she doesnt know how much shes lost why she has the less to grieve over if she thinks she couldnt be happy with a husband who would keep her snubbed and frightened after he lifted her from her lowly sphere and would tremble whenever she met any of his own sort of course it may be a sad mistake but it cant be helped she must go back to eriecreek and try to worry along without him perhaps shell work out her destiny some other way     xiv  afterwards   mrs ellison had kittys whole story and so has the reader but for a little thing that happened next day and which is perhaps scarcely worthy of being set down  mr arbutons valise was sent for at night from the h√¥tel st louis and they did not see him again when kitty woke next morning a fine cold rain was falling upon the drooping hollyhocks in the ursulines garden which seemed stricken through every leaf and flower with sudden autumn all the forenoon the gardenpaths remained empty but under the porch by the poplars sat the slender nun and the stout nun side by side and held each others hands they did not move they did not appear to speak  the fine cold rain was still falling as kitty and fanny drove down mountain street toward the railway station whither dick and the baggage had preceded them for they were going away from quebec midway their carriage was stopped by a mass of ascending vehicles and their driver drew rein till the press was over at the same time kitty saw advancing up the sidewalk a figure grotesquely resembling mr arbuton it was he but shorter and smaller and meaner then it was not he but only a light overcoat like his covering a very common little man about whom it hung looselya burlesque of mr arbutons selfrespectful overcoat or the garment itself in a state of miserable yet comical collapse  what is that ridiculous little wretch staring at you for kitty asked fanny  i dont know answered kitty absently  the man was now smiling and gesturing violently kitty remembered having seen him before and then recognized the cooper who had released mr arbuton from the dog in the sault au matelot and to whom he had given his lacerated overcoat  the little creature awkwardly unbuttoned the garment and took from the breastpocket a few letters which he handed to kitty talking eagerly in french all the time  what is he doing kitty  what is he saying fanny  something about a ferocious dog that was going to spring upon you and the young gentleman being brave as a lion and rushing forward and saving your life mrs ellison was not a woman to let her translation lack color even though the original wanted it  make him tell it again  when the man had done so yes sighed kitty it all happened that day of the montgomery expedition but i never knew before of what he had done for me fanny she cried with a great sob may be im the one who has been cruel but what happened yesterday makes his having saved my life seem such a very little matter  nothing at all answered fanny less than nothing but her heart failed her  the little cooper had bowed himself away and was climbing the hill mr arbutons coatskirts striking his heels as he walked  what letters are those asked fanny  o old letters to mr arbuton which he found in the pocket i suppose he thought i would give them to him  but how are you going to do it  i ought to send them to him answered kitty then after a silence that lasted till they reached the boat she handed the letters to fanny dick may send them she said   the end
