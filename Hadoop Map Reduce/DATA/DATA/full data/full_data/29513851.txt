afternoon in may an old sidewheeler was steaming south toward puget sound across the landlocked waters that lie between vancouver island and the state of washington a little astern on one hand mount baker lifted its heights of eternal snow on the other and a little ahead the olympians rose white and majestic and between vast dim forests rolled down to the ruffled blue water it seemed to frank whitney sitting on the steamers upper deck in the lee of her smokestack that it was a wild and wonderfully beautiful country he had reached at last for since leaving vancouver british columbia they had steamed past endless rocks and woods while island after island faded into the smoke trail down the seething wake and great white mountains opened out changed their shapes and closed in on one another as the steamer went by he had however not come there to admire the scenery and as he watched the wonderful panorama unroll itself he looked back upon the troubles that had befallen him since he set out from boston a little less than a year ago  when he left that city he was but sixteen and was as he had cause to realize during the following twelve months merely an average american boy with a certain amount of alertness selfreliance and common sense though he might perhaps have had more of these desirable qualities had he not been a trifle spoiled by his widowed mother before he went to gorton school he had quite apart from his lessons learned a few useful things there which probably he would never have learned at home but he had been suddenly recalled and his mother had informed him that it was now impossible for him to enter the profession for which he had been intended frank did not understand all the reasons for this but he knew that they were connected with the fall in value of some railroad stock and the failure of a manufacturing company in which his mother held shares she had as she pointed out his two younger sisters to provide for and he must earn his living at once  frank found this much harder than he had expected the subjects in which he excelled did not seem to be of the least use to business men and the fact that he could play several games moderately well did not seem to count at all there were people who were ready to give him a trial but they seemed singularly unwilling to pay him enough to live in a way that he considered fitting and this somewhat astonished as well as troubled him in the end a relative who said that a young man with any grit and snap had better chances in the west found him a position with a big milling company in minneapolis frank accepted the position but soon found it not much to his liking the people he met were not like his boston friends they were mostly germans and scandinavians and their ways were not those to which he had been accustomed what was worse they hustled him in the milling companys offices and instead of teaching him the business kept him busy licking stamps copying letters and answering telephones which did not seem to him a fitting occupation for an intellectual lad  he bore it nevertheless because he had to until one day there came a climax when a clerk who had bullied him all along assigned to him a particularly disagreeable task which was really outside his duties in return in a fit of very foolish anger frank screwed the clerks new hat down tight in a copyingpress and it happened that the secretary came upon the scene during the trouble that followed the secretary had an unpleasant temper and when he walked out of the general office frank sat down at his desk boiling with indignation and almost stupefied there was however not the least doubt that he was fired  he spent a very dismal evening afterward for one thing at least was clearhe could not go home to boston and become a burden on his mother but the flour trade was bad in minneapolis just then and business in st paul did not seem much better so eventually he found employment in the offices of a milling company in winnipeg he suffered from the extreme cold during the winter there the cold of massachusetts as he discovered is very different from the iron frost which shuts down on the canadian prairie and never slackens its grip for months together the clothing he had brought from boston was not warm enough and his small earnings would only provide him with shelter in the cheapest quarters still he held on until trade grew slack in the early spring and he was turned adrift again this time he felt that he had had enough of business he had heard and read of men who burrowed for treasure in the snowclad ranges broke wild horses and cleared the forests out in the farthest west there was a romance in that life surpassing anything that seemed likely to be got out of the addition of flour invoices or the licking of stamps and he wrote a letter to an old friend of his dead father who lived on a ranch near puget sound it was some time before he got an answer telling him rather tersely to come along  frank started the day after he received it and was now he supposed within a short distance of his journeys end he had never seen his fathers friend and knew nothing of what he would be required to do at the ranch though he fancied that all that was necessary could readily be learned by an intelligent lad in this however he was wrong  suddenly the steamers whistle hurled a great blast out across the waters and looking around frank saw not far ahead a long point strewn with rocks and streaked with wisps of pines there was however no sign of life on it and he turned to a deckhand who strode by  can that be banningtons he asked  yes the man informed him i guess thats just what it is  but theres nobody about objected frank  the deckhand grinned  did you expect it was like seattle or port townsend theres a store to the place and theyve got a postoffice back among the rocks we lay off and whistle and if theres no sign of a shore boat she goes on again  he went forward with a jump as a man came out of the pilot house with a pair of glasses in his hand  run up slow he ordered theres nothing coming yet  the big sidewheels beat more slowly and the whistle called again but there was still only the ruffled blue water with white flecks on it and the rapidly rising pines frank watched them anxiously for he had only about two dollars in his pocket and it seemed quite possible that he might be carried on to seattle in which case he had not the faintest notion as to how he was to get back it was quite certain that he could not pay any more steamboat fares  a minute or two later the man with the glasses raised his hand as a sail crept out around the point and the big wheels stopped the strip of canvas grew into a gaff mainsail and a jib the hull beneath it emerged at intervals from the little tumbling seas and it became apparent to frank for the first time that it was blowing rather hard the sail seemed to be dripping and he could see the spray flying about the shapeless figure at the helm then the steamboat officer motioned to him  are you getting off here he asked  frank answered rather dubiously that this was his intention  then youd better get down on to the wheelcase bracings with your grip i dont know how theyre going to take you off but i guess theyll shoot her up head to wind and youll have to jump  frank got out on the guardframing on the after side of the wheel and watched the boat drive by swung up on a little sea some distance away half of her hull seemed to be under water though the fore part of it was hove up streaming into the air she rolled wildly with her big mainsail squared right out and the jib which hung slack dripping water then she came round and headed for the steamer lying down all slanted to one side while the water sluiced along her lee deck and frank made out a boy crouching under the sail with a rope in his hand it seemed to him that the boat must inevitably ram the steamer and smash in her bows then a hail reached him  hello pilot house shove her astern soon as were clear of you  somebody shouted an answer and the steamer swung out lifting a row of wet plates out of the water and burying them again with a gurgling splash a glance around showed frank a deckhand standing behind him with a long spiked pole and a crowd of passengers leaning over the rails of the deck above how he was to get into the boat he did not know for the thing was beginning to look difficult then there was another shout from the figure at her helm  that you whitney  frank waved his hand in answer hastily grabbing up the small bag which contained his few possessions the wheelcasing sank again into a ridge of frothing brine which swirled about his feet and he felt that it would be a good deal wiser to climb back to the deck above and go on to seattle this however was out of the question even if there had not been so many passengers looking on and it was comforting to remember that he could swim a little the next moment the deckhand touched his arm  ill sling your grip aboard her as she shoots he said then jump and stick to anything you get your hands on  the boat was now only seven or eight yards away nearer the steamers stern but as frank gazed at her she suddenly swayed upright with a frantic thrashing of canvas and shot forward head to wind beneath the vessels side the next moment his bag went hurtling through the air and he heard the deckhand shout something in his ear then he set his lips and jumped  he struck something hard with his knees and was conscious of a sudden chill as the brine washed over one leg but he had his hands clenched tight on a strip of wet wood and somebody seized him by the shoulder making a determined effort he dragged himself up on the narrow side deck and fell in a heap into the bottom of the boat when he scrambled to his feet again the big sidewheel was splashing amidst a welter of churnedup foam as the steamer pushed away from them and in the boat the boy he had already noticed was tugging desperately at a rope  get hold and heave he cried  frank did as the boy directed then the helmsman waved his hand  not too flat belay at that get down here aft both of you  frank staggered aft a pace or two and sitting down breathless and dripping gazed about him the boat looked a good deal bigger than she had appeared from the steamer and as a matter of fact she was a halfdecked sloop of about twentyfour feet in length just then she was slanted well down on one side with the water foaming along her depressed deck and showers of spray beating into her over her weather bow while the jib above her bowsprit every now and then plunged into the short whitetopped seas there seemed to be some water inside her for it washed up above the floorings at every heave in a few moments frank had recovered his breath sufficiently to look around at his companions one was a boy of about his own age who smiled at him he had a bronzed skin and a kindly expression and looked lean and wiry  youre frank whitney asked the boy  frank acknowledged that this was his name and the other proceeded to introduce himself and his companion  im harry oliver and as youre going to stay with us weve got to hit it off together  then he turned and indicated the ruddyfaced redhaired man who held the helm  this is jake one of the smartest choppers and trailers on the pacific slope there arent many of the boys who could have picked you off that steamboat in a breeze of wind as he did  oh pshaw said the helmsman with a grin  neither of them had said anything striking in the way of welcome but frank felt quickly at ease with them as a rule the new acquaintances he had made in business farther east seemed to expect him to recognize their superiority or at least to understand that it was a privilege to be admitted into their society his present companions however somehow made it plain that as long as he was willing to be commonly civil there was no reason why they should not get on well together for which he was thankful though he felt that any attempt to put on airs with them would probably lead to trouble  how far is it to your fathers ranch he asked presently  twelve miles responded harry with a head wind like this one it means from eighteen to twentyfour miles sailing it depends for one thing on jakes steering  thirty sure broke in the helmsman if you had the tiller  hows that asked frank  know anything about sailing  frank confessed his ignorance and jake nodded to harry  show him he said he has got to learn and you can teach the fellow wholl allow he doesnt know anything the kind weve no use for is the one that knows too much  harry laid a wet finger on the hoveup weather deck  now he began a boat or a ship under sail can go straight to the place shes bound for as long as she has the wind anywhere from right behind her to a little forward on her side in fact as shell lie up within a few points of the wind theres only a small segment of the circle you cant sail her straight into  he traced a circle on the deck and then placed his finger over about a quarter of the circumference of it  she wont go there  but supposing you want to  then if the winds ahead you have to beat he drew two lines across the circle at right angles to each other and laid his finger at the end of one say were here at north and the cove were going to lies about south well you get your sheets in flatsame as we have them nowand you sail up this way at this angle to the wind he ran a slanting line across the circle until it touched the rim that brings you here then you come round and go off at the same angle on the opposite tack which brings you right up to the cove you can do it in two long tacks orand its the same thingin a lot of little ones each at the same angle to the wind but how many degrees there are in that angle and when you get there depends on how your sails are cut and how smart you are at steering her  frank understood the gist of it but there were one or two difficulties and he was not ashamed to ask a question  what makes her go slantways against the wind why doesnt it blow her back or sideways  it does jake broke in dryly if you dont sail her right or it blows hard enough  what makes a kite go up slantways against or on the wind which is the same thing in sailing continued harry because with the wind and the string both pulling her thats the line of least resistance he paused and added deprecatingly i was at school at tacoma and as id a notion i might take up surveying they pounded some facts into me that made this kind of thing easier to get hold of a boat goes ahead on the wind because considering the shape of her its the easiest way and this is what stops her going off sideways to lee he kicked a high narrow box which ran along the middle of the boat it holds the centerboarda big plate thats down deep in the water now before the wind could shove her off sidewaysand it does a littleit would have to press that flat plate sideways through the water  frank made a sign of comprehension  thats about the size of it said jake now i guess it would be more useful if you got some of the water out of her  harry who explained that there was something wrong with the pump pulled up one of the flooring boards and invited frank to dip a bucket into the cavity and hand it up to him when it was full frank endeavored to do so but found it difficult for the water which surged to and fro as the sloop plunged left the bottom of the hole almost dry one moment and the next came splashing back so rapidly that before he could get a fair scoop with the bucket it had generally gone again besides the motion every now and then flung him off his knees but he toiled on with his head down for nearly half an hour when a horrible nausea mastered him and he staggered to the foamswept lee coaming for the next ten minutes he felt desperately unhappy and when he turned around again there was a grin on the faces of his companions  shell do said harry you want to look to weather and get the wind on your face thats the best way to keep a hold on your dinner  frank suddenly remembered that he had had no dinner he had had only a dollar or two left in his possession and after considering the steamboat tariff he had decided to dispense with the meal in spite of this fact and the unpleasant sensations he felt he was conscious of a certain satisfaction with his new surroundings the seasickness would pass and grappling with the winds of heaven and the charging seas seemed a finer thing than adding up the price of flour or sticking stamps on letters here mans skill nerve and quickness were pitted against the variable elements and frank had a suspicionwhich as it happened was quite justifiedthat if jake made a blunder the next whitetopped comber would come foaming across the bows of the craft it was only his cool judgment and ready hand on the tiller that swung her safely over them  raising himself a little he glanced ahead the steamer and her smoke trail had vanished some time ago and the white olympians had faded too evening was drawing on the sky was now a dismal dingy gray and the leadenblue water was streaked with flecks and curls of foam it seemed to him that the sea was steadily getting higher and there was not the least doubt that the sloop was slanting more sharply and throwing the spray all over her  it looks bad up yonder doesnt it he queried in anxious tones  i allow we might have more wind by and by jake answered laconically seems to me she has about all the sail she can stand up to on her now  he had scarcely finished speaking when a comber curled over at its top rose up close ahead and the boat went into it to the mast part of it poured over the forward head ledge into the open well and the rest sluiced foaming down the slanted deck to lee through which she lurched clear with the water splashing and gurgling inside her  well heave another reef down right away said jake get forward harry and claw that headsail off her  the boy seized a wet sail that lay in the well and as he crawled forward with it the sloop rose almost upright with her mainsail banging and thrashing furiously when he loosed a rope the jib ran partly down its stay and then jammed filling out and emptying with sudden shocks that shook the stout spar beneath it and the reeling mast harry however crawled out on the bowsprit with his feet braced against a wirea lean dripping figure that dipped in the tumbling seasand frank seeing that he was struggling vainly with the sail scrambled forward to help him sick as he was water flowed about his knees on the plunging deck flying ropes whipped him and the spray was hurled into his face but he could think of no reason why the western boy should do more than he could he crouched down hauling savagely on a rope at which harry pointed and by and by the sail fell upon both of them they dragged it in made it fast and set a smaller one in place of it after which they floundered aft to where jake was struggling with the mainsail  he had hauled down what frank afterward learned was the leach of it and was now standing with his toes on the coaming and his chest upon the boom pulling down the hard drenched canvas and tying the little bits of rope that hung in a row from it around the boom  hustle he shouted get those reefpoints in  frank took his place with his companion and tried not to look at the frothing water close beneath him as he leaned out on the jerking boom for the most part the big spar lay fairly quiet but now and then the canvas above it shook itself with a bang it cost him a strenuous effort to drag each handful of it down in turn and he discovered afterward that he had broken two of his nails he lost his breath the perspiration started from every pore in his skin and he was sick and dizzy but he managed to hold on at last it was finished and soon afterward jake driving the sloop on her course again turned to harry  shell make nothing of it against this breeze he said well uphelm and look for shelter under tourmalin  harry bracing himself against the strain let a rope run through the clattering blocks the bow swung around and the motion became a little easier  well be snug beneath the pines in an hour said jake nodding reassuringly  frank found the time quite long enough he was wet and dizzy and the way the big frothing ridges came tumbling up out of the growing darkness was rather terrifying they heaved themselves up above the boat and every time that one foamed about her she slanted alarmingly over to leeward at last when it had grown quite dark a shadowy blur that grew into a wisp of tall pines rose up ahead and a minute or two later there was an almost bewildering change from the rolling and plunging as the sloop ran into smooth water her sails dropped the anchor chain rattled out and by and by they were all sitting in the little cabin which was scarcely three feet high and jake was cramming bark and kerosene rags into the stove  half an hour later frank forced himself to eat a little canned beef and drink some coffee and then harry told him he could lie down on what seemed to be a moderately dry sail he had scarcely done so when he fell asleep jake who had been watching him turned the lantern so that the light fell on his face  he was mighty sick he observed a kindly smile lighting up his rugged features but he stayed with it through the reefin your father should make something of him i guess hell do     chapter ii  the bush   frank awoke a little before daylight feeling considerably better the nausea and dizziness had gone and the sloop seemed to be lying almost still which was a relief to him then he noticed by the light of a lamp that his companions places were empty and presently he heard them talking in the well crawling out through the narrow doorway he stood up shivering in the coldness of the dawn  there were dim black trees and shadowy rocks close in front of him with a white wash about the latter for a smooth swell worked in around a point from open water he could hear the rumble of the surf upon the reefs and though he could scarcely feel a breath of wind upon his face the wailing of the black pines suggested that it was blowing still he could smell the clean resinous scent of them and it seemed to him that they were singing wild barbaric songs afterward when he knew them better he learned that the pines and their kin the cedars and balsams and redwoods are never silent altogether even when their fragrance steals out heavy and sweet as honey under the fierce sunshine of a windless day one can hear faint elfin whisperings high up among their somber spires then he saw that jake was standing on the side deck apparently gazing at the white surf about the end of the point  no he mused she wouldnt face it the breeze hasnt fallen any and the seall be steeper guess youd better leave me here and take the indian trail  harry agreed with this  well get off as soon as weve had breakfast and as i did the cooking yesterday its your turn this morning theres still a little fire in the stove  jake disappeared into the cabin and presently came out again and was filling his pipe when harry sprang up suddenly on the deck  hello he cried theres a schooner yonder  it was growing a little clearer and frank turning around saw a tall black spire of canvas cutting against the sky he made out a frothy whiteness beneath it where the swell broke on the vessels bows and the sight of her singularly stirred his imagination she had appeared so suddenly probably from behind the point and she looked ghostly in the uncertain light she ran in under her headsails and boomforesail with her mainmast bare rising higher and growing clearer all the while by and by there was a splash and a voice broke through the wailing of the trees  three fathom it said you can luff her in a little  harry seemed about to hail her but jake gripped his arm and they all stood silent while the schooner crept up abreast of them the little sloop lying with the shadowy land close behind her had evidently not been seen then the vessel commenced to fade again and in a few minutes she had vanished altogether  it looks as if there might have been some truth in old sandbergs tale harry remarked thoughtfully its kind of curious that halibut fisherman from banningtons said he saw her too  he said shed a white stripe round her sandberg allowed it was green objected jake  that wouldnt prove anything they could soon paint the stripe another color  what would they want to do it for  what does a schooner want running in here theres no freight to be picked up nearer than port townsend  that said jake dryly is just what i dont know whats more i dont want to she might have run in for bark for cooking or maybe for water  harry laughed if she has come down from seattle theyd get plenty cordwood or if they wanted it stove coal there and i guess a skipper wouldnt waste a fair wind like this one to save two or three dollars the things mighty curious that vessels been seen twice anyway and nobody seems to know where she comes from or where she goes  well jake observed stolidly she doesnt belong to you or me and if you want your breakfast it should be ready  they crawled into the cabin and when they had made a meal jake sculled the sloop in near enough to the steep beach for them to jump then he flung a small packet after them  its the most i can spare you as i maynt get a slant round the reefs until tomorrow he said anyway it will do you two meals and you ought to fetch the ranch by sundown you want to head right up the valley until you strike a big log that lies across the river when you get over cross the neck of the ridge where its lowest youll see the clearing from the top of it  harry said this was plain enough and moved away across the shingle frank following him cautiously when they reached the fringe of driftwood which divided beach from bush whitened logs and barked branches were scattered about in tangled confusion where the water had left them and it was with difficulty that the lads scrambled over the barrier then frank stopped breathless with one leg wet to the knee and a rent in his trousers  its pretty rough going if this is an average sample he panted  youll find it a good deal worse before we reach the ranch harry answered with a laugh  he strode forward and frank looked around with wonder when they plunged into the bush for he had never seen a wood of that kind except in pictures of the giant californian sequoia there are of course pines in the eastern states but they seemed pigmies by comparison with these tremendous conifers which were already tall and stately when columbus sailed from spain they ran up far above the boy in huge cylindrical columns before they flung out their first great branches which met and crossed like the ribs of highvaulted arches holding up a roof of dusky greenery beneath there was a dim shadow and a tangle of such luxuriant vegetation as is seen excepting in the tropics probably only upon the warm damp pacific slope  there was another difference which struck frank the eastern woods that he had seen were clear of wreckage for lumber and fuel are valuable there and the ax had kept them clean but this forest was strewn with huge logs and branches some of which evidently had fallen years ago thickets of all kinds had sprung up between and these were filled with tufts of unrolling fern which harry told him would grow six or eight feet high through the midst of it all there twisted a narrow path which frank remembered jake had mentioned as the indian trail  have you indians here he asked  oh yes said harry we have a few siwashes though there are more of them up in canada they seem fond of indians there  are they quiet  harry chuckled you dont want to get them mixed with the redskins of the plains though i suppose where theyre not wiped out theyre pretty quiet too these fellows are a different breed most of them are sailors and fishermen and they dress much the same as you and i do they come up these rivers now and then after the salmon and they made this trail you can tell that by the looks of it  how  it goes in and out and where theres an obstacle it winds around thats the difference between a white mans and an indians nature the siwash strikes a big fir log and he walks around it if he has to keep on doing it for months it doesnt seem to worry him that hes wasting a minute or two every time then the white man comes along and gets to work with his ax he goes right straight through its born in him  frank had made a sign of understanding he knew something of the history of the old great nations as well as that of his own country and he remembered another dominant race that ages ago blazed its trails from rome across all europe and far into asia it was characteristic of those men that turning aside for no obstacle they went straight and long after their power had perished their roads remained running as the crow flies through morasses and over mountains and rivers his own people had done much the same whittling west with the axes through the eastern woods and then pushing on with their wagons across the lonely plains until they drove the steel track through the snowclad rockies and over the sierras they died in shoals on the journey but it was the march of a nation and always more came on the lumberman after the trapper the trackgrader on the cowboys heels with ranches and farms and factories growing up along the line now they had reached the pacific and frank wondered vaguely whether that would be the limit or where they were going then it was however a question that seemed too big for him  this countrys rough on ones clothes he said ruefully looking down at a second tear in his trousers  harry laughed he was dressed in old duck overalls long boots and a battered gray hat  thats a fact what you want to wear is leather there were two sports from back east came out to hunt last fall and they had their things made of some patent cloth warranted to turn water and resist any thorns jake went along to cook for them he paused with a chuckle and added they were wearing their blankets because they hadnt any clothes left when he brought them back  they went on for an hour or so until they came out upon the bank of a frothing river which roared among the rocks in a shallow cañon there was no way of reaching the water had they desired it and as harry had predicted the trail they followed grew rapidly worse in places it wound perilously along narrow ledges beneath a dripping wall of rock in others it led over banks of stones which had slipped down from the heights above the boys made very slow progress until noon when they stopped for a meal from the package jake had thrown them while they ate it frank looked down again at his boots which were already badly ripped  they were new just before i left winnipeg he said in some ways the people in europe are ahead of us there are one or two countries where they make their shoes of wood  harry was too busy to make an answer and when he had finished eating he carefully tied up the packet which was now considerably smaller before he turned to his companion  wed better be hitting the trail he said unless we can make the ranch by sundown well get mighty little supper  they pushed on for a couple of hours still floundering and stumbling among the rocks harry stopped for a moment where the bush was thinner and pointed to a big gap in a ridge of hillside three or four miles away  thats the neck he said the log we cross the river on is somewhere abreast of it we surely cant have passed the thing  they went on a little farther but there was no sign of the log presently harry stopped again with an exclamation catching a glimpse of a great branchless fir which rose out of a welter of foam in the bottom of the cañon  there she is he exclaimed jammed in where we certainly cant get down to her it will be difficult to go straight this time but well have to try  frank drew a pace or two nearer the edge of the cañon and felt a creepy shiver run through him as he looked down the rock he stood upon arched out a little over the shadowy hollow through the bottom of which the wild waters seethed and clamored he supposed that he stood at least sixty feet above them the rock on the opposite side also projected so that the rift was wider at the bottom than at the top in one place however the crest of it had broken away and plunged into the gulf leaving a short slope down which stones and soil had slid its lower edge lay about twelve feet beneath him though the distance would have been rather less if it could have been measured horizontally  how are we to get across he asked hesitatingly  jump said harry curtly cant you do it  no frank answered with some reluctance  scared asked harry looking at him curiously  i am but its not that altogether  you didnt seem to want sand when you jumped into the boat  frank stood silent a moment or two with a flush on his face had he been forced to make the choice a year earlier he probably would have jumped and chanced it from shame of appearing afraid or of owning his inferiority to another but he had learned a little sense since then  it was different then he explained i was scaredbadly scaredbut i felt i could do the thing if i forced myself to it now im almost certain that i cant  yes owned harry thoughtfully thats quite right one hasnt much use for the fellow whose great idea is to keep himself from getting hurt but when a things too big for you its best to own it he dismissed the subject with a wave of his hand the question is how were going to get across and my notion is that wed better head right up into the bush the river will be getting smaller and it forks somewhere each branch will probably be only half the size and i guess the cañon cant go on very far  it occurred to frank that considering the nature of the country it would be singularly inconvenient if the cañon went on for another league or two particularly as they had only a handful of provisions left but he followed his companion and they stumbled and floundered forward all the afternoon there was now no trail to follow and where they were not forced to scramble over slippery rock fallen trees and thorny brakes barred their way still there was nothing to indicate that the cañon was dying out and where they could have reached the water it either foamed furiously between rocky ledges or spun round in horrible black eddies on the verge of a wild yeasty turmoil they looked at these spots and abandoned any thought of swimming  evening came at length and they sat down beneath a big cedar where the roar of the river rang about them in deep pulsations a chilly wind was wailing in the tops of the pines and trails of white mist commenced to drift in and out among their trunks which showed through it spectrally harry gazed about him with a rueful grin on his face  if id an ax one or two matches and a couple of blankets id make you quite snug then with a few groceries a kettle and a spider wed have all any one could reasonably want  you havent got them frank commented wouldnt it save time if you wished for a furnished house  id most as soon have an ax then i could make a shelter that would anyway keep us comfortable enough and when id cut you a good layer of spruce twigs you wouldnt want a better bed if id a rifle i might get a blue grouse for supper stilland he laughedas you say we havent got them and we couldnt do any cooking without matches curious isnt it what a lot of things you want and that in most cases you have to get another fellow to make them  frank agreed with this but he had never realized the truth of it as he did just then it was clear that the man who made all he wanted must live as the indians or grosser savages did and that it was only the division of employments that provided one with the comforts of civilization every man it seemed lived by the toil of another for while on the pacific slope they turned the forests into dressed lumber and raised fruit and wheat the clothes they wore and their saws and plows and axes came from the east one could clear a ranch on puget sound only because a host of other men puddled liquid iron or pounded whitehot steel in the forges of for instance pennsylvania frank would very much have liked to provide his companion with the fruit of somebody elses labor in the shape of a few matches which would have made a cheerful fire possible  in the meanwhile harry had opened the packet and divided its contents equally  theres not enough to keep any over he observed we have got to make the ranch tomorrow  they ate the little that was left them and then set to work to search for a young spruce from which they might obtain a few branches but they failed to find one small enough even to climb coming back they lay down among the cedar sprays which seemed rather wet and it was some time before frank could go to sleep he was still hungry and the roar of the river and the strangeness of his surroundings had a peculiar effect on him the mist which was getting thicker rested clammily on his face and crawled in denser wreaths among the black trunks which stood out here and there from the encircling gloom drops of moisture began to fall upon him from the branches and once or twice he cautiously moved an elbow until it touched his companion it was consoling to feel that he was not alone  at length however he fell asleep and awaking in the gray light of dawn staggered to his feet when harry called him feeling very miserable he was chilled to the bone his shoulders ached his knees ached and one hipjoint ached worse than all while his energy and courage seemed to have melted out of him as a matter of fact nobody unused to it feels very animated on getting up before sunrise from a bed on the damp ground  as we have to reach home tonight we may as well get a move on announced harry its about four oclock now and it wont be dark until after eight  the prospect of a sixteen hours march with nothing to eat all the while did not appeal to frank it was the first time in his life that he had felt downright hungry and this fast had made him the more sensitive to an unpleasant pain in his left side  if youre not sure about the way wouldnt it be better if we went back to jake he suggested it seems a pity we didnt think of it earlier  i did harry answered smilingly the trouble is that jake would clear out the minute the wind dropped a little or shifted enough to let him get round the head besides hed have mighty little to eat if he were still lying behind the point when we got there when your letter reached us wed hardly time to run down to banningtons to meet the steamer so i just grabbed what i could find and we sailed in a few minutes  frank said nothing further and they pushed on doggedly into the shadowy bush it was wrapped in a thick white mist and every brake they smashed through dripped with moisture except for the clamor of the river everything was wonderfully stillso still indeed that the heavy silence was beginning to pall upon frank who suddenly turned to his companion  isnt there anything alive besides ourselves in this bush he asked  that replied harry is more than i can tell you we have bears and a few timber wolves besides two kinds of deer and several kinds of grouse and some of them are quite often about but there are belts of bush where for some reason you cant find one  they went on again following up the river for an hour or two in the meanwhile the mist melted and frank could see the endless ranks of mighty trees stretch away before him until they merged into a blurred columnar mass at last the cañon which was growing shallower forked off into two branches and they followed one branch until a broken rocky slope led them down to the water it was a dull greenish color and foamed furiously past them among great stones there was no means of ascertaining how deep it was and the boys looked at each other dubiously for a moment or two then harry made a little gesture  we have to get across he said  frank without waiting for his resolution to fail him plunged in on the instant and a couple of steps took him well above his knees the water seemed icy cold as a matter of fact it was mostly melted snow and the drainage from the glaciers had given it the curious green color the gravel commenced to slide away beneath franks feet and by the time the foam was swirling round his waist he was gasping and struggling savagely there was a big eddying pool not far away and though he could swim a little he had no desire to be swept into it a moment or two later he was driven against a rock with a violence that shook all the breath out of him he clung to it desperately until harry came floundering by and held out his hand they made a yard or two together and then harry slipped suddenly jerking frank off his feet as he rolled over in the flood frank went down overhead and as he felt himself being swept along toward the eddy he exerted all his energy in a struggle to regain his footing he clutched at a rock but the swirling waters only carried him past half dazed and breathless he was flung against another rock this time with a great effort he managed to hold on and when he stood up gasping he found that the water now reached only to his knees in another minute he and harry were safe on dry land  half an hour later they crossed the other creek and soon afterward frank sat down limply in the warm sunlight which at last came filtering between the thinner trees  i must have a rest he gasped  theres just this trouble harry pointed out if you rest any time you wont want to get up again  if i go on now ill drop in another few hundred yards declared frank  it was probably no more than the truth he had been clever at athletics and open air games but as it happened he had been able to learn them easily besides he had been indulged by his mother and had been rather a favorite at school and as one result of it he fell short of the hardihood usually acquired by the boy who has everything against him after all an hours exercise in a gymnasium or an hour and a half spent over a game amidst applause and excitement is a very different thing from the strain of unrelaxing effort that must be made all day when there is nobody to cheer he did not want to rest but his wornout body rebelled and mastered him  arentyouplayed out he stammered weakly  oh yes replied harry with a grin still in this country youre quite often dead played out and have to go on again  but if you cant  then said harry dryly you have to keep on trying until youre able to  it struck frank that this might be painful and his heart sank after a while he tried another question  dont people get lost in the bush every now and then  why yes was the answer there was a man strayed off from a picnic just outside one of the cities not long ago and they didnt find him until a month or two afterward he was lying dead not a mile from a graded road  frank shivered inwardly at this  still i suppose you generally have something to guide youthe moss on the north side of the trees ive heard that people who dont know about it walk around in rings  i must have gone pretty straight the only time i was lost laughed harry and its mighty hard to find moss in some parts of the bush in others its all around the trees id rather have a big peak as a guide you have heard about people walking round but i wonder whether you have heard that when theyre badly scared theyll walk right across a trail without seeing it  is that a fact frank asked in astonishment  sure said harry a lost man will sometimes walk across a logging road without the slightest idea that hes doing it anyway i know where the homestead lies its only a question of holding out until we reach it  frank was sincerely pleased to hear this and by and by he rose with an effort and they went on again     chapter iii  the ranch   dusk was not far away when the boys stumbling down a low hillside came into sight of an oblong clearing in the forest with a wooden house standing on one side of it that was all frank noticed for he found it difficult to keep himself on his feet and his sight seemed hazy indeed he fell down once or twice in the steeper places and had some trouble in getting up and after that he had only a confused recollection of crossing an open space and entering a dwelling a man shook hands with him and a woman in a print dress made him sit down in a low chair before she set out a bountiful meal soon after he had eaten a considerable share of it harry led him into a very little room where a bed like a shelf with a side to it was fixed against one wall five minutes later he was blissfully unconscious of his recent painful experience  the sun was streaming in through the window when he awoke feeling wonderfully refreshed and dressing himself in some overalls which had been laid across the foot of his bed he walked out into the larger general room it had uncovered walls of logs and a very roughly boarded floor and there seemed to be little in it besides a stove a table and several chairs  a brownfaced man with a little gray in his hair sat at one end of the table and at the other end sat a woman resembling him and of about the same age harry sitting between them was apparently engaged in narrating their adventures frank who took the place laid out for him found that his supper had not spoiled his breakfast for he fell upon the pork potatoes dried apricots hot cakes and syrup with an excellent appetite when the meal was over the man led frank into another room and filling his pipe asked him to sit down  wed better have a talk he said you can take the chair yonder  frank looked at him more closely when he sat down mr oliver who was dressed in duck overalls was rather spare in figure though he looked wiry his manner was quiet and his voice was that of an educated man but he had somewhat piercing gray eyes  i had a sincere regard for your father he began on that account alone i should be glad to have you here but first of all we had better understand each other you mentioned that you had been in business in minneapolis and afterward in winnipeg didnt you like it  no sir replied frank who felt that it would be wiser to answer carefully any questions this man might ask still that wasnt exactly why i gave it up thoughand he hesitatedto say i gave it up isnt quite correct  if i remember you called it being fired in your letter mr oliver suggested with a twinkle in his eyes what led up to that  slack trade in the last case id like to think it was only the grudge a bullying clerk had against me in the other  then if you had been allowed you would have stayed with the milling business though you didnt care for it  yes responded frank anyway id have stayed until i could have got hold of something i liked better  mr oliver nodded in a way which suggested that he was pleased with the answer  well he said that brings us to the question why you came out here was it because you had heard that it was a good country for hunting and fishing  franks face flushed no sir he replied i wanted to earn a living and i understood that ahe was going to say a live man but thought better of itany one who wasnt too particular could generally come across something to do quickest in the west in fact id like to begin at once after buying my ticket and getting odd meals ive only two or three dollars left  twofifty to be precise my sister took your clothes away to mend now its possible that i might manage to get you into the office of some lumber or general trading company in one of the cities how would that do  id rather go on to the land id like to be a rancher  how much do you know about ranching  very little but i could soon learn  it was franks first blunder and he realized it as he saw the gleam of amusement in mr olivers eyes  its by no means certain commented the latter there are men who cant learn to use the ax in a lifetime well let it go at that and say youre willing to learn have you any idea of making money by ranching  frank thought a moment well he said finally id naturally wish to make some but i dont think that counts for most with me id rather have the kind of life i like  the trouble with a good many men is that when they get it they find out they like something else quite sure that hunting and fishing arent taking too prominent a place in your mind if they are id better tell you that the favorite amusement in this country is chopping down big trees theres another fact that you must consider it takes a good deal of money to buy a ranch and unless its already cleared you have to wait a long while before you get any of the money back this place cost me about nine thousand dollars one way or another and in all probability theres not a business on the pacific slope in which i wouldnt get twice as much as im getting here for the money though ive been here a good many years now what do you expect to do with two dollars and a half  what he had heard had been somewhat of a shock to frank and the question was difficult to answer  i might earn a little more by degrees sir he said hopefully  mr oliver smiled at him encouragingly  its possible and theres cheaper land than mine while a smart man used to the country can often get hold of a small contract of some kind now ill tell you what well do wait a month and then if you find that you like the life ill hire you for what anybody else would give you  with that he arose signifying that the discussion was over and frank went out of doors and joined harry in the clearing the latter held a big handspike with an arched iron hook hinged to it and he invited frank to assist him in rolling logs  it will give you some idea how a ranch is cleared he said to begin with you had better take a look around  frank did so and first of all noticed the rather rambling house part of which was built of logs notched into one another at the ends though the rest which had evidently been added to it later was of sawed lumber it was roofed with what he fancied were red cedar shingles on the other side of it carefully fenced off with tall split rails stood orderly ranks of trees some in delicate pink and white blossom harry told him they were apples and prunes and peaches nearer him were one or two fields of timothy grass and fresh green oats and then more of the latter growing among fernengirdled stumps sawed off some six feet above the ground beyond them in turn halfburned branches were strewn among another stretch of stumps then there was a narrow belt where great trees lately chopped lay in tremendous ruin and behind them again the forest rose in an unbroken wall  now explained harry you have the whole thing in front of you if youll begin at the bush and work back toward the house first you chop down the trees then you burn them up and raise your first crop or two round the stumps afterward by degrees you grub up the stumps and get the clean tilled land when its been worked a few years it will grow almost anything  but wheres the stock frank asked i had a notion that a ranch was a place where you raised no end of horses or cattle  thats on the plains laughed harry on this side of the rockies its any piece of cleared land with a house on it at quite a few of the ranches they raise nothing but fruit as you asked the question though our cattle are in the bush they run there and live on what they can find until we round them up now well get to work  he turned away after a pair of brawny oxen that were plodding leisurely across the clearing and in a little while they halted on the edge of what harry called the slashing this was a belt of fallen timber which ran around most of the open space as frank gazed at the chaos of great trunks and mighty branches he felt inclined to wonder how mr oliver had managed to get them down  what will you do with these he asked  saw or chop off the bigger branches harry answered then well wait until the trunks are good and dry in the fall and put a fire to them it will burn up all the small stuff and leave them like this  he pointed to the rows of blackened and partly burned logs which lay between the slashing and the halfcleared soil and frank noticed that most of them had been sawed into several pieces  couldnt you sell them for lumber he inquired  no replied harry for one thing its quite a long way to the nearest mill and wed have to build a skidway for a mile or two down to the water besides in a general way its only the redwood and red cedar that the mills have much use for  then he gave frank a handspike that lay close by and between them they prized up one end of a log so that he could slip a chain sling under it the other end of the chain was attached to the yoke of the oxen and when he called them the big white and red beasts hauled the log away until he stopped them and went back for another frank did not find much difficulty in this but it was different when they had drawn six or seven of the logs together and laid them side by side harry said that the next lot must go on top of the others and frank was wondering how they were to get them there when his companion laid two or three stout skids some distance apart against the first of the row these it was evident would serve as short slanting bridges but frank was still not clear as to how the next log could be propelled up them  when harry brought it up he slipped the chain along toward its middle though it cost the boys an effort to prize the mass up with their handspikes after which he made one end of the chain fast on the opposite side of the row around which he led the oxen the other end he hooked to their yoke so that it now led doubled across the row and around the trunk they wished to raise he said that when the chain was pulled the log would roll up it he next shouted to the oxen who plodded forward straining at the yoke while he and frank slipped their handspikes under opposite ends of the log  heave he cried send her up  frank did his utmost with the perspiration dripping from him and the veins on his forehead swelling but the ponderous mass rolled very slowly up the skids and several times he fancied it would drag the oxen backward and slide down on him indeed for about half a minute it hung stationary though harry who dared not draw out his handspike shouted frantic encouragement to the straining beasts then it moved another inch or two and one released skid shot up as though fired out of a gun when the log rolled upon the first of the preceding ones they worked it well across them and then freeing the chain went back for another though franks arms felt as if they had been almost pulled out of their sockets  you want somebody to keep the oxen up to it as well as two to heave when the logs are as big as these said his companion still some of the small ranchers do the whole thing alone  frank could not help wondering what kind of men these were but in the meanwhile he was obliged to bend all his thought on his difficult task which grew heavier when having ranged the logs in two layers they commenced the third the skids were now too short to reach the top of the second tier without making the slope rather steep and harry said that they must cut some new ones a couple of axes lay close by and handing one to frank he strode into the bush and stopped in front of a young fir  the butt ought to make a skid he said ill leave you to get it down and ill look for another you do it like this  spreading his feet apart and balancing himself lightly he swung the heavy longhafted ax above his head the big blade descending buried itself in the trunk and rose with a flash when he wrenched it clear this time he struck horizontally and a neat wedgeshaped chip flew out  now he said handing the ax to frank you can go ahead  he turned away and frank swung the ax experimentally once or twice the thing looked easy whirling up the blade he struck with all his might it came down into the notch harry had made but it was the flat of it that struck and while the haft jarred his hands the blade glanced and just missed his leg this appeared somewhat extraordinary and he was a little more cautious when he tried again he hit the tree fairly this time but almost a foot above the cut and he was commencing to feel indignant when he dragged the steel out again which in itself was not particularly easy he then struck horizontally but the blade did not seem to go in at all and at the next attempt the ax buried itself in the soil just grazing his boot this steadied him for he had no desire to lame himself for life shortening his hold upon the haft he used it after the manner of a domestic chopper until at length when his hands were blistered and he was very hot the tree went down with a crash then turning around he saw harry watching him with a look of amusement  have you got yours down frank asked  oh yes harry replied and another ive chopped them through for skids he pointed to the hacked and splintered log looks as if something had been eating it doesnt it  franks face grew rather red you couldnt expect me to drop into it all at once give me a week or two to pick up the swing and balance of it  a week or two harry seemed to address the clustering firs they sure raise smart folks back east  how long were you learning retorted frank  well said harry thoughtfully you could call it most of twelve years i used to go whittling with a toy tomahawk soon after i could walk of course they confiscated the thing now and then once it was after id just brought down a oneleg round table  did you ever cut yourself  harry rolled up his trousers and pointed to a big white mark below his knee  i could show you two or three more of them he commented dryly there are quite a few bush ranchers who havent got all their toes on  he cut a skid from the butt of the log and when they went back to the pile the work which before had been hard now became more or less dangerous they had to prize and sometimes shoulder up the ponderous masses of timber threehigh and frank was far from feeling over the effects of the previous twodays march still if his companion could manage it he was determined that he could and he toiled on soaked in perspiration straining and gasping over one of the heaviest tasks connected with clearing land until to his vast relief miss oliver appeared in the doorway jingling a cowbell as a signal that dinner was ready  they went back to work after the meal and frank somehow held out until the middle of the afternoon it seemed very hot in the clearing and the scorching sunrays beat down upon the back of his neck and shoulders one of his horribly blistered hands commenced to bleed he was almost afraid to straighten his back and his arms were sore all over at last as they were heaving up a heavy log it stuck just on the edge of the tier and frank who felt his breath failing him and his heart beating as though it would burst could hear the oxen scuffling furiously on the other side of the pile  heave harry shouted another inch will land her  i cant frank panted with his hands slipping upon the lever  then look out warned harry let go of the thing and jump  frank did not remember whether he let go or whether the handspike was torn from his grasp but he jumped backward as far as he could and staggered a few paces farther when he saw the big log rolling down after him then he fell headlong there was a crash and a great trampling of hoofs and he wondered whether the log would crush the life out of him when he scrambled to his feet however it had stopped not far away and in a few moments harry appeared from behind the pile  it pulled the oxen backward right up to the logs he explained then he looked sharply at frank we havent done badly for one day and aunt sophy wants me to haul in some stovewood you sit there and rest yourself awhile  he went away with the oxen and frank was thankful to do as he was told for his heart was heavy and he was utterly worn out his hands were torn and blistered and the logs that he had partly lifted with his body had bruised his breast and ribs if this was ranching it was horrible work and he felt that he would break down altogether if he attempted much more of it it was nothing like his dream of riding through the bush on spirited horses after halfwild cattle then the troublesome question as to what he should do if he gave it up had to be faced he had found that he had no aptitude for business and he had a suspicion that work would be quite as hard in a logging camp or in a sawmill it was clear that he could not go home even if he had the money for his fare which was not the case and he felt very forlorn and miserable  in the meanwhile the twigs he lay upon were pleasantly soft and it was cool and peaceful in the lengthening shadow of the firs there was a curious rhythmic drumming sound which he found most soothing and which he afterward learned was made by a blue grouse not far away the pungent smell of withering fir and cedar sprays in the slashing dulled his senses until at last his troubles seemed to melt away and he fancied that he was back in boston where nobody had ever required him to heave ponderous logs upon one another  it was a couple of hours later when mr oliver walking back that way with harry stopped and looked at the pile  you have put all those up since this morning he asked  harry said that they had done so and mr oliver glanced down with a little smile at frank who lay fast asleep  its rather more than i expected the lad must have done his share but it might have been better if you had started him at something easier  he stood it all right until a while ago and i think hed have seen me through if it hadnt been for the walk yesterday shall we crosscut some of those branches tomorrow instead  no replied mr oliver after a moments reflection it might be wiser to let him see the worst of it if he stands a weeks logging theres no doubt that hell do he paused a moment and looked down at frank again i dont think hell back down on it hes very much like his father as i remember him a good many years ago  then he laid his hand on franks shoulder  get up boy suppers ready     chapter iv  target practice   the two boys spent most of the following week rolling logs and they were busy among them one hot afternoon when mr oliver walked out of the bush nearby as they did not immediately see him he stopped and stood watching them in the shadow for a few minutes frank was feeling more cheerful by this time though his hands were still very sore and as a good many of the logs were burned on the outside he was more or less blackened all over he was getting used to the work and jake who had arrived with the sloop in the meanwhile relieved him and his companion of the heaviest part of it turning around presently at a sound frank saw mr oliver smiling at him  if i were as grimy as you i think id go in for a swim he said its hot enough and theres a nice beach not far away i dare say harry will go along with you while jake and i put up these logs  harry lost no time in throwing down his handspike and they set out together down a narrow trail through the woods which led them out by and by upon a head above the cove in which the sloop lay moored standing on the edge of the crag frank looked down upon the clear green water which lapped smooth as oil upon a belt of milkwhite shingle and broke into little wisps of foam beneath the gray rocks at the mouth of the cove beyond this the sea flashed silver in the sunlight like a great mirror except where a faint fitful breeze traced dark blue streaks across it dim smudges of islands and headlands broke the gleaming surface here and there and high above it all was a cold white gleam of eternal snow  in a few minutes they had scrambled down a winding path and frank stripping off his clothes waded into the water abreast of the sloop which lay swinging gently about a dozen yards from the beach  can you swim off to her shouted harry  frank said that he thought he could and set about it with a jerky breast stroke for he was not very proficient in the art the water was decidedly cold and he was glad when he reached the sloop clutching her rail where it was lowest amidships he endeavored to pull himself out to his disgust he found that his feet would shoot forward under the bottom of her with the result that he sank back to the neck after each effort when he had made two or three attempts he heard a shout  hold on youll never do it that way  harry shot toward him his limbs gleaming curiously white through the shining green water though his face and neck showed a coffeebrown as did his lower arms which he swung out above his head rolling from side to side at every stroke he grasped franks shoulder and pushed him toward the stern of the sloop  now he said when he clutched it there are just two ways of getting out of the water into a boat if she has a flat stern you make for there and get your hands on the top of it spread a little apart then you heave yourself up by a handspringthough that isnt very easy  frank smiled at these instructions but said nothing it was easy for him because he had learned the trick in a gymnasium suddenly jerking down his elbows which ever since he had grasped the stern were as high as his head he shot his body up until his hands were down at his hips then as his waist was level with the sloops transom he quietly crawled on board harry however had to make two or three attempts before he succeeded and then he looked at his companion with undisguised astonishment  ive never done it right away yet he said admiringly say do you know how to dive  no replied frank that is ive scarcely tried  harry led him forward where the boats sheer was higher and he could stand a couple of feet or so above the water  you only get half the fun out of swimming unless you can dive he said lets see what kind of a show you make  frank stiffened himself and jumped at least that was what he meant to do but as it happened he merely threw himself flat upon the water and the result was rather disconcerting he felt as though all the breath had been knocked out of him and in addition to this all the front of his body was smarting he was about to swim toward the stern again when harry stopped him  hold on he called you may as well learn the other way of getting out and if shes a sailing craft with a bowsprit its much the easiest one swim forward to the bow  frank did so and saw that a wire ran from the end of the bowsprit dipping a little below the water where it was attached to the boat he had no difficulty in getting his foot upon it and after that it was a simple matter to crawl on board his chest and limbs were still smarting and were very red when he joined harry the latter regarded him with a look of amusement  youll get hurt every time if you dive like that he said look here and he stood up on the boats deck you want to get your weight on the fore part of your feet all ready to shove off before you go then you must shoot as far forward as you canfalling on it wont doand hollow your back and stiffen yourself once youre under that is when you want to skim along just below the surface watch me  leaning forward a little he sprang out from the boat a lithe tense figure with hands flung straight forward over his head they struck the water first and he went in with an impetus which swept him along scarcely a foot beneath the top then his speed slowly slackened and he had stopped altogether about a length of the boat away when he raised his head and swam back to her  you dont want to try that in less than four feet until youre sure you can do it right he said when he had climbed on board the other kind of divings different then taking up a galvanized pin he threw it in see whether you can fetch it theres about eight or nine feet of water here you can open your eyes as soon as your heads in and you wont have any trouble in coming up again jump and throw your legs straight up as you go  frank managed this time not to drop in a heap as he had done before he also opened his eyes under water for the first time and found it perfectly easy to see it was like looking through green glass he could make out the pin lying a long way down beneath him it was however impossible to reach it the water seemed determined on forcing him back to the top and when he abandoned the struggle to get down he seemed to reach the surface with a bound  how far did i go he gasped  about six feet its quite as far as i expected  harry plunged and frank who had climbed out in the meanwhile saw him striking upward with his feet until he turned and came up with a rush holding the pin in one hand flinging it on board he headed for the beach and was standing on the shingle rubbing himself with his hands when frank joined him  i guess you had two towels when you went swimming back east he laughed  frank looked up inquiringly acknowledging that he usually had taken one  well said harry we have them at the homestead but there are ranches in this country where you wouldnt get even one  no towels exclaimed frank in some astonishment what do they use instead  some of them cut a very little bit off of a cotton flour bag those bags are valuable because they keep them to mend their shirts with ive a notion that the other fellows sit in the sun  frank laughed and scrambled into his clothes after rubbing himself with his hands he was commencing to realize that whether harry was joking with him or not it was unavoidable that they should have different ways in different parts of so big a country indeed now that he was some four thousand miles from boston he felt that instead of its being curious that the people were slightly different it was wonderful that they were so much the same if one measured four thousand miles across europe and asia one would get frenchmen at the one end and wild cossacks or nomad tartars at the other with perhaps a score of wholly different nations speaking different languages between  they had an excellent appetite for supper when they went back to the ranch and after the meal was over mr oliver took down a rifle from the wall  you can bring yours along harry he said and then turned to frank in a general way a rancher doesnt get much time for hunting and he seldom goes out for the fun of the thing but an odd deer or grouse comes in handy now and then anyway before you can hunt at all you must learn to shoot and you may as well begin  dads a pothunter chuckled harry at least thats what the two smart sports we had round here last fall said he was  a gleam of amusement crept into his aunts eyes but mr olivers face contracted into a slight frown  harry knows my views but you had better hear them too he said to frank im certainly what those fellows called a pothunter though they very foolishly seemed to think that one ought to be ashamed of it most of the ranchers in this district take down the rifle only when they want something to eat and thats the best excuse there is for shooting is it a desirable thing to destroy a dozen harmless beasts for the mere pleasure of killing and leave them in the bush for the wolves and eagles  dont the game laws prevent that sir frank asked  they limit a man to so many head of this and that and in a general way he brings no more out with him but it doesnt by any means follow that he hasnt killed a bear or a deer that he doesnt mention in some lonely ravine the sport who hasnt a conscience is as big a pest in a game country as the horn and hide hunter used to be and we have to thank him for practically exterminating several of the finest beasts in north america  wouldnt the clearing of virgin country and the way the farms and ranches spring up account for it  only to some extent its my opinion that there are more deer and bears about the smaller ranches than you could find anywhere else all this is no reason why you shouldnt learn to shoot that is to hit your game just where you want to and kill it there and then  he walked out with his rifle and the boys followed him across the clearing here harry fixed a piece of white paper about two feet square with a black dab in the middle of it on the trunk of a big fir after which he came back to where the others were standing  how far do you make it his father asked  about a hundred yards  mr oliver now turned to frank  as i think you told me you couldnt shoot ill give you a short lecture on the principles of the thing when theyre after birds most men use a scatter gun it will spread an ounce of shotseveral hundred pelletsover a sixfoot circle at a distance of about forty yards but the rifle is the great weapon of western america take this one and open the breachnow look up the barrel  i can see little grooves twisting round it like a screw said frank  thats the rifling it serves two purposes the bulletyou use only onehas to screw round and round to get out and that gives the explosion time to act upon it it increases the muzzle velocity then it gives the bullet a rotary motion and anything spinning on its axis travels very much straighter than it would do otherwise its the twisting motion that keeps a top from falling over  frank could readily understand this and he remembered what he had read about the gyroscope  now continued mr oliver we have to consider the pull of the earth upon the bullet which would bring it down and to counteract this you have to direct it rather upward the slight curve it makes before it reaches its mark is called the trajectory and it naturally varies with the distance you arrange it by the sights there are two of them one on the muzzle and one near the breach the last one slides up and down like this the farther off the mark is the higher it must go as you have to get them both in line its evident that pushing the back one up will raise the muzzle you can understand that  frank said that he could and mr oliver pushed the rearsight down and snapped a lever  its cocked though it hasnt a shell in it at a hundred yards or less the sight goes down about the limit he handed frank the rifle stand straight left foot a little to the left and forwardthat will do now bring the rifle to your shoulderleft hand under the barrel near the rearsight elbow well down right hand round the small of the butt thumb on the top try to hold it steady  frank found it difficult the rifle was heavy and the muzzle seemed to want to drop but mr oliver stopped him when he let his left elbow fall in toward his side  bring it down and wait a moment before you throw it up again he advised  frank did so once or twice and at length his instructor seemed satisfied  now well aim he said drop your left cheek on the stockyoud better shut your left eye try to see the target through the hollow of the rearsight with the front one right in the middle of it  it seemed singularly difficult the square of paper now looked exceedingly small and the sights would wobble across it after several attempts however frank got them comparatively steady  put your forefinger on the trigger mr oliver directed dont pull but squeeze it slowly and steadily holding your breath in the meanwhile  this was worst of all for frank found that he pulled the sight off the target when he tightened his forefinger after he had made an attempt or two mr oliver told him to put the rifle down  see what you can do harry he said  standing  yes said mr oliver turning to frank again standings hardest kneeling easier and lying down easiest of all but when youre hunting in thick bush you generally have to stand  harry slipped a shell into his rifle and pitched it to his shoulder it wobbled for a moment and then grew still after that there was a spitting of red sparks from the muzzle which suddenly jerked followed by a sharp detonation a second or two later there was a thud and harry laughed as he stood gazing at the mark while a little blue smoke curled out of the muzzle and the opened breach  its well up on the left top corner he said  frank was blankly astonished he could certainly see the square of paper but it seemed impossible that anybody could tell whether there was a mark on it as a matter of fact very few people who had not been taught how to use their eyes could have done so  then mr oliver took up his rifle and frank noticed that his whole body and limbs seemed to fall into the best position for holding it steady without any visible effort on the mans part the blue barrel did not seem to move at all until at length it jerked and harry grinned exultantly at frank when a thin streak of smoke drifted past them  thats the pothunters way hes about two inches off the center  mr oliver gave frank the rifle and this time he slipped in a shell  if you cant get the sights right bring it down he directed dont dwell too long on your aim  frank held his breath and stiffened his muscles but the foresight would wobble and the target seemed to dance up and down in a most exasperating manner at length he pressed the trigger he felt a sharp jar upon his shoulder but to his astonishment he heard no report after what seemed quite a long time there was a faint thud in the forest  youve got something but i guess its the wrong tree laughed harry  after that frank tried several shots finally succeeding in hitting the tree a couple of feet above the mark mr oliver who had taken out his pipe in the meanwhile nodded at him encouragingly  you only need to practice steadily he said for the rest anything that tends toward a healthy life will make you shoot well whisky and tobacco most certainly wont  harrys eyes twinkled as he glanced at his fathers pipe  one of them hasnt much effect on him i dont know whether i told you about the bag the two sports who were round here last fall nearly made i got the tale from webster on the next ranch  frank said that he would like to hear it and harry laughed  well he began webster was sitting on a log in the bush just outside his slashing looking around kind of sorrowful at the trees it seemed to him they looked so big and nice it would be a pity to spoil them when ive been chopping until my hands are sore i sometimes feel like that  it doesnt lead to riches interrupted his father dryly  by and by harry continued webster heard a smashing in the underbrush it kept coming nearer but it wasnt in the least like the sound a bear makes or a jumping deer you dont know theyre around unless theyre badly scared anyway webster sat still wondering what it could be until he saw a man crawling on the ground he was coming along very cautiously but you couldnt have heard him more than half a mile away by and by he disappeared behind a big tree and as there hadnt been a deer about for a week webster wondered if the man was mad until there was a blaze of repeater firing in the bush then fremont his logging ox came out of it like a locomotive and headed for the range so fast that webster couldnt see how he went he grabbed his logging handspike and found a sport abusing another for missing in the bush  what in the name of wonder are you after he asked  weve been trailing a deer two hours one of them declared a mighty big deer must have been an elk  an elk sure i saw it added the other  there isnt a blamed elk in the country said webster  youll see persisted the other i tell you i pumped the cylinder full into him  quite sure of that webster asked  the other man said that he was and webster waved his handspike  then its going to cost you sixty dollars and ill take a deposit now he said its my ox fremont youve been after  did they give it to him frank broke in  five dollars harry answered webster looked big and savage and they compromised on that  but had they hit the ox  harry chuckled give a man who isnt a hunter a repeater and hell never hit anythingunless its what he isnt shooting at  anyway its better to stick to the single shot at first mr oliver remarked then you take time and care and its more likely that when you shoot you kill no humane person has any use for the man who leaves badly wounded beasts wandering about the woods  he rose and shook out his pipe  well be getting back he added theres only one way of making it easy to rise at sunup  they walked toward the house together and it seemed to frank that there was a good deal to be said for this ranchers views he did not tell tall stories and boast of what he had shot but frank had seen enough to realize that it was most unlikely that he left any sorely wounded animal to die in misery it was not often that mr oliver molested the beautiful wild creatures of the woods but when he fixed the sights on one of them he killed it clean     chapter v  the mysterious schooner   three or four weeks slipped by uneventfully and frank was commencing to like the simple laborious life at the ranch he and harry were standing together one evening on the shingle down in the cove it was close upon high water and a long swell worked in breaking noisily upon the pebbles while they could see the blue undulations burst into snowy froth about the dark rocks at the entrance the sun had just dipped it was wonderfully fresh and cool and a sweet resinous smell drifted out of the forest behind them  harry glanced at a canoe which lay close by it was about fourteen feet long and just wide enough to sit in and had been hollowed out of a cedar log by a siwash indian the bow which swept sharply upward had been rudely cut into the likeness of a birds head the craft was kept there so that anybody who wished to reach the sloop could go off in her  i dont think its quite high water yet and the breeze is dropping harry was saying theres just enough to take us a mile or two down the beach over the tide with the spritsail set then we could lower the mast and paddle home  wouldnt she sail back ray asked  no was the answer only with a fair wind you cant beat a thing like that to windward theres not enough of her in the water  frank said that he would like to go and after running the canoe down they lifted the short mast into place and set the little sail it filled when a few strokes of the paddle had driven them out of the cove and they slid away rising and falling smoothly with the swell running after them harry took hold of the rope that held the foot of the sail fast to a peg  you want to keep the sheet handy in a very small craft he instructed then if a hard puff of wind strikes her you can slack it up or let it go altogether when the sail will blow out loose theres more weight in this breeze than i expected  it seemed to frank from the gurgle at the bows and the way the foam slipped by them that they were sailing very fast but for a while he watched the rocky heads that dipped to the water open out one after another and then close in again behind them the woods that crept between them down to the strips of shingle were rapidly growing shadowy and the ridges of water that followed them seemed to be getting darker though here and there one of them was flecked with bright wisps of froth at length harry let the sheet go and brought the canoe around  well have the mast down and get back he said  they had no trouble in rolling up the sail and laying the mast in the bottom of the craft but when they dipped the paddles harry kneeling in the stern and frank toward the bow the latter realized that their next task would not be quite so easy a chilly wind which seemed considerably stronger than before they turned struck his face the bows splashed noisily throwing up little spurts of spray and now and then the narrow craft lurched rather wildly over the top of a swell he worked hard for about twenty minutes and then glancing astern was a little astonished to see that a rock which had been opposite them was now a remarkably small distance behind harry who had evidently followed his glance scowled disapprovingly  well have to paddle thats a cold fact he declared the tide seems to have turned quite a while before it ought to have and the breeze is getting up again we might find slacker water right inshore  they edged close in to the rocks the sight of which did not add to franks comfort though the boat crept on a little faster the swell broke in long white swirls about their feet and it was evident that any attempt to land there was out of the question besides even if they managed to reach the bush there was no trail to the ranch and he had no desire to struggle through the tangle of fallen branches and dense thickets in the darkness his knees and hands were getting sore but he toiled on patiently with the singleended paddle while the canoe lurched more viciously and little showers of spray flew in over her bow it was becoming exceedingly hard work to drive the craft into the rising head sea the foamgirt rocks were however slowly crawling by and at length after laboring panting and breathless around a somewhat larger head harry suddenly stopped paddling  hold on he exclaimed just keep her from swinging and look yonder  frank glad of a brief rest gazed astern it was neither light nor dark for a pale moon hung low in the sky casting a faint silvery track upon the water which was now flecked with white froth a little off shore across the sweep of radiance there moved a tall black spire of slanting canvas with the foam leaping up about the shadowy strip of hull beneath  the schooner said harry significantly shes beating up over the tide and shell probably stand close in but i dont think they could see us against the land  he spoke as if he did not wish to be seen and for no very clear reason frank felt glad that they lay in the shadow of a big black head the schooner was coming on very fast rising it seemed to him bodily until he could make out the curl of piledup water that flowed away beneath her depressed side the mass of straining sailcloth hid most of her slanted deck and he could see nobody on board her but it seemed curious that she carried no lights then it occurred to him that she was heading straight for them and he was about to dip his paddle when harry stopped him  keep still he commanded theyll have to come round before they reach us  frank could now hear the roar of water about the bow of the vessel and in a minute or two she swayed suddenly upright and there was a great thrashing of canvas as shooting forward she came round she was very near them and as her boomforesail and mainsail swung across leaving clear the side of the deck they had shrouded he saw two or three shadowy figures busy forward they became more distinct as she drove back into the moonlight which fell upon the form of her helmsman frank could see him clearly and there was he fancied something peculiar about the man  the splashing top of a sea slopped into the canoe as they got way on her and they taxed their strength to the utmost during the next hour the craft bucked and jumped as they laboriously drove her over the confused swell which was rapidly getting higher and there was already a good deal of water washing about inside her once or twice frank held his breath as a threatening mass of water heaved up ahead but in each case she lurched across it safely and presently they found smoother water under another crag he gave a sigh of relief when at length they reached the cove and beached her upon the shingle they turned her over to empty before they ran her up and then harry sat down upon a boulder frank already had discovered that he seldom talked of anything they had done as though it were an exploit  im quite puzzled about that schooner he said presently  why  harry paused and thought a moment well its a sure thing shes the vessel that crept past us the morning we were lying beneath the point and though shes been seen three or four times now theres no notice in the papers of any arrival that seems to fit her she has the look of being built for the canadian sealing trade and most of the craft in that business are mighty smart vessels  doesnt a ship have to carry papers saying where shes from and where shes going  oh yes assented harry still she might clear from somewhere in canada say for the halibut fishingive heard theyre trying to start it thereor something that would keep her out a month or so then as there is no end of quiet inlets in british columbia and a good many here she could run up and down from one to another and go back with a few fish and thered be nothing to show what she had been doing in the meanwhile  you think its something illegal  if it is anything honest i dont see why she was beating up without her lights in the strength of the tide when shed have slacker water over toward the other side only thered be a chance of her being seen from the seattle boat if she ran across yonder now its a general idea that theres a good deal of dopethats opiumsmuggled into this country and now and then chinamen too our people wont have any more of them but though they have no trouble in getting into canada they seem to like the states better i guess wages are higher  have you talked to your father about it  i told him what wed seen the other time and he looked kind of amused or as if he didnt want to be bothered about the thing though that may not have been it either unless he tells you right out you can never figure on what hes thinking anyway ill say nothing more to him unless theres some particular reason  harry was afterward sorry that he had arrived at this decision and for that matter so was his father but it was the next morning before this came about in the meanwhile the boys went back to the ranch and soon afterward retired to rest in the room they now shared frank went to sleep at once and it was some time later when awaking suddenly he fancied that harry had left his bed which was fixed against the opposite wall a faint light from outside crept into the room and frank made out a black figure standing by the open window slipping softly to the floor he moved toward it and harry raised his hand warningly when he joined him  what are you doing here frank inquired  well answered harry since you ask me i dont quite know but i fancied i heard somebody about the ranch keep still and listen  he spoke in a low and rather strained voice and frank who was uneasily impressed by it leaned out of the window there was a moon somewhere in the sky but it was obscured by clouds and only a dim uncertain light filtered down it showed the great black firs which rose a rampart of impenetrable darkness beyond the rather less shadowy clearing across part of which the fruit trees stretched then ran back in regular rows little clumps of deeper obscurity which presently grew blurred and faded into one another the wind had apparently dropped again for it was impressively still  i cant hear anything whispered frank  im not sure that i did rejoined harry it may be that seeing that schooner put the thing into my head but well wait a little now that were up  for a couple of minutes they waited in silence then harry suddenly gripped his companions arm  look he whispered across the clearingyonder  frank fancied that he could make out a shadowy object in the open space between the fruit trees and the forest it was very dim and indistinct and he realized that he would not have noticed it only that it moved shortly afterward it disappeared and a faint rattle like that made by two pieces of wood jarring together came out of the deep gloom beneath the firs  the fence suggested harry it sounded like the top rails going down  the fence was made of split rails interlocked together in the usual manner without the use of nails and it seemed to frank very probable that anybody climbing over it in the darkness would be apt to knock one or two of them down the question was who would be likely to climb over it since there was no one living within some miles of the ranch then he caught another sound which seemed farther off it suggested the crackle of rotten branches or torndown undergrowth but it ceased almost immediately  slip on your things whispered harry im going down  in a few moments they crept softly down the stairway barefooted and harry opened the outer door very cautiously he picked up an ax outside and they moved silently around the house stopping now and then to listen there was only a deep stillness nothing seemed to move though frank wished that he had at least a good thick stick in his hand he had an uncomfortable feeling that they might come upon a man hiding in some strip of deeper gloom as they slowly crept along the wall when at length they had satisfied themselves that there was nobody about harry sat down  i cant figure out this thing he mused it seems to me that whoever those strangers were they havent been near the house and its a quiet country anyway he glanced down at his bare feet id go along and look around the barn and stables only that id certainly stub my toes and it wouldnt be any use nobody steals horses around here they couldnt get rid of them if they did  the outbuildings stood at some little distance from the house and frank who remembered that they had strewn the trail to them with broken twigs in dragging some branches from the slashing agreed with his companion that it would not be wise to traverse it in the darkness with unprotected feet  couldnt you slip into the kitchen and get our boots he suggested  not without waking dad answered harry hes in the next room and he sleeps lightly im not anxious to bring him out if no harms been done  hed get angry  no hed only smile and somehow that makes you feel quite cheap and small besidesand he hesitatedthere was another time when i roused them for nothing and i dont want to do it again you wouldnt either if you had stood as much about it from jake as ive had to ever since  they decided to say nothing about the matter unless some reason for doing so appeared in the morning and creeping back through the house as silently as possible they went to bed they awoke a little later than usual and going down found mr oliver standing at one side of the kitchen table rather grave of face with jake who also looked thoughtful opposite him a strip of paper with some writing on it lay between them mr oliver looked around as the boys came in  did either of you hear anything suspicious last night he asked  yes said harry hesitatingly in fact we came down  he briefly related why they had done so and jake broke in  then why in the name of wonder didnt you call somebody  its a reasonable question said mr oliver  harry explained with some diffidence that they were afraid of being laughed at and frank felt a little uncomfortable under the ranchers steady gaze  well said the latter dryly i suppose your idea was natural and well let it go at that its perhaps scarcely worth while to point out that most people get laughed at now and then and theres no reason for believing that it hurts them i wonder if you will be surprised to hear that my team has gone  they were certainly somewhat startled  i found this stuck up on the stable door said jake pushing the strip of paper across toward them  the boys read the straggling writing if you want your team back keep your mouth shut  for a moment they looked at each other in silence and then mr oliver turned to them  its all we know in the meanwhile have you anything more to tell us  harry diffidently mentioned the schooner and his father drew down his brows  whether her appearance has any connection with the matter is more than i can say but ill sail up to the settlement this morning you and frank can go on with the drain cutting while i am away  just then miss oliver came in to get breakfast ready and when the meal was finished the two boys made for the clearing where they were cutting a trench when they reached their destination harry sat down and pushed back his hat  this thing isnt very clear to me but im beginning to get the drift of it he announced its quite likely that dad knows a good deal more about it than i do but until he has it all worked out he wont tell first of all well allow that theyre smugglers on that schooner they borrowed two of our horses and that fixes it  you couldnt smuggle a great deal on two horses frank pointed out  sure admitted harry still they might have picked up another team somewhere else and you want to remember that it only pays to smuggle things that are valuable and can be easily moved now one packhorse load of dope would be worth a good many dollars and you cant move anything much easier than a man hes got feet  this was incontestable but frank considered the matter  if you turned a number of chinamen loose in the bush wouldnt they be recognized as strangers at any settlement they reached and have to give an account of themselves to somebody  the trouble is that although i believe they have to carry papers of some kind its mighty hard to tell one chinaman from another and they all work into each others hands  your idea is that the smugglers have confederates  they have them sure said harry theres some diking being done on a salt marsh not far away and the last time i was there it struck me there were some hardlooking white toughs on the workings then theres a small chinese colony behind the settlement and its thick bush with only a few ranches for some leagues beyond just the kind of country for running dope through  are the ranchers likely to stand in  no not in a general way but its possible that a man here and there living by himself in the bush would say nothing if they borrowed a horse or two its not nice to have a gang of toughs up against you  your father doesnt seem inclined to look at it that way  harry laughed ill allow that theres a good deal of sense in dad it would be clear to him that he couldnt well give them away afterward if he did nothing this time theyd certainly have got him and dads not the man to let a gang of dope runners order him round he paused a moment and added significantly if they try any bluffing in this case therell be trouble  frank asked no further questions and they set about the trenching     chapter vi  at the helm   mr oliver did not come back until nightfall he said nothing about his visit to the settlement and several days passed before the boys heard anything further of the matter in the meanwhile they went on with the drain they were cutting across a swampy strip of clearing and one afternoon they stood in the bottom of the fourfoot trench harry was then busy with a grubhoe cutting through the roots and breaking up the wet soil which his companion flung out with a longhandled shovel it was unpleasantly hot and the flies were troublesome franks hands were too muddy to brush them away and they crawled about his face and into his ears he had already decided that draining was about the last occupation he would have chosen for a scorching afternoon had the choice been open to him  he stood stripped to shirt and trousers in about a foot of water and because he had not learned the trick of pitching out the soil part of every shovelful fell back upon him his shirt was spattered all over and patches of sticky mire glued it to his skin there was no doubt that ranching was considerably less romantic than he had supposed it to be and logging and ditching struck him as particularly uninteresting and somewhat barbarous work but he was beginning to realize that all the agricultural prosperity of his country was founded on toil of a very similar kind the wheat and the fruit trees would not grow until man with patient labor had prepared the soil for them and what was more significant mr oliver had made it plain that their yield varied in direct proportion with the work bestowed on them natures alchemy it seemed could transmute the effort of straining muscle into golden sheaves glowingtinted apples and velvetskinned peaches and prunes  it was clear to frank that if he meant to become a rancher he must make up his mind to face a good many unpleasant tasks and he swung up the mire shovelful by shovelful though his back and limbs were aching and he had to work in a horribly cramped position he was young and though there were times when the work seemed almost too much for him it was consoling to feel when he laid down his tools at night that he was growing harder and tougher with every days toil for his muscles were now beginning to obey instead of mastering him he could go on for several hours after they commenced to ache without its costing him any great effort  by and by however there was an interruption and frank was by no means sorry when mr oliver came up with a stranger and called them out of the trench  this is mr barclay whose business is connected with the collection of the united states revenue he said i believe he would like a little talk with you  he walked away and left them with the stranger who sat down on a log and took out a cigar he was a little man and rather stout dressed carelessly in store clothes with a big soft hat and a white shirt which bulged up above the opening in his halfbuttoned vest it occurred to frank that he looked like a country doctor from out rather bushy eyebrows shone a pair of whimsical twinkling eyes when he had lighted his cigar he indicated the trench with a large plump hand  been making all that hole yourselves he asked  yes sir replied harry  interesting work  that depends on how you look at it said harry flippantly would you like to try  mr barclay waved his hand it isnt necessary did something of the same kind years agoonly if i remember it was rather wetter  where was that harry inquired with an air of languid politeness at which frank felt inclined to chuckle  place called forks butte creek it was a twentyfoot trench  harry seemed astonished and his manner suddenly changed  you were with the boys at forks butte when they swung the creek  sure assented mr barclay with a laugh i didnt expect youd have heard of it you certainly werent ranching then  ive heard of it lots of times declared harry turning excitedly to frank it was one of the biggest things ever done by a few men this side of the cascades the oldtimers talk about it yet a mining rowthere were about a dozen of them working some alluvial claims on a disputed location i dont know the whole of it but the thing turned upon the frontage and they stood off a swarm of jumpers while they shifted the creek  something like that said mr barclay in those days they interpreted the mining laws with a certain amount of sentiment whichand in some respects its a pitythey dont do now he paused and flicked the ash from his cigar i understand you have been seeing a mysterious schooner  his tone was sufficiently ironical to put harry on his mettle and he furnished a full and particular account of the vessel when he had finished mr barclay glanced at him with amusement in his eyes  you have an idea there might be smugglers on board of her he suggested  its more than an idea im sure  i wonder if you could tell me why  it was rather difficult to answer but harry made the attempt furnishing his questioner with half a dozen reasons which did not seem to have much effect on him  well he persisted youre convinced she had opium and chinamen on board her  arent you  mr barclay looked up with a smile at the present moment i cant form an opinion after all its possible  he rose and as he was strolling away toward the house harrys face contracted into an indignant frown  that man must have been cooking or something of the kind at forks butte he broke out contemptuously anyway it was the last time he ever did anything worth talking about did you ever run up against such a stuffed image  frank was far from certain that this description was altogether applicable to the stranger but harry seemed so much annoyed that he did not express his opinion and they got down into the trench again when they went back to the ranch an hour later they heard that mr oliver and mr barclay had gone to a neighboring ranch and intended to make a journey into the bush if they could borrow horses when the boys were eating breakfast the next morning miss oliver turned to harry  we have run out of pork and the flour is almost gone she said i meant to ask your father to bring some when he went up to the settlement but i forgot it and jake must bring in those steers today  well go broke in harry quickly theres a nice sailing breeze  his aunt looked doubtful you have never been so far with the sloop unless jake was with you and isnt there a nasty tiderip somewhere still i dont know what i shall do unless i get the flour  she yielded when harry insisted and shortly afterward the boys paddled off to the sloop and made the canoe fast astern they set the big gaff mainsail and harry sculled her out of the cove before he hoisted the jib then he made frank take the helm  its a head wind until were round the point yonder but youll have to learn to sail her sometime he said the first thing to remember is that shell only lie up at an angle to the wind and if you make it too small she wont go through the water you want to feel a slight strain on the tiller  he hauled the sheets in until the boom hung just over the boats quarter and while frank grasped the tiller she slid out into open water bright sunshine smote the little tumbling green ridges that had here and there crests of snowy foam and she bounded over them with a spray cloud flying at her bows she seemed to be making an excellent pace but harry shook his head  no he objected youre letting her fall off that is the angle youre sailing her at is too big shell go faster that way but she wont go so far to windward dont pull so much on your tiller and shell come up closer  frank tried it but the boat sailed more slowly and presently her mainsail flapped  now youre too close warned harry youre trying to head her right into the wind pull your helm up again  frank did so and when the boat gathered speed he ventured a question  if you keep her too close to the wind she wont sail and if you let her fall off shes not going where you want how do you find out the exact angle she ought to make  harry laughed it depends on the boat the cut of her sails and how smart you are at the helm one man would shove her to windward a point closer than another could and keep her sailing faster too its a thing that takes time to learn and there are men you couldnt teach to sail a boat at all  frank found that it became easier by degrees though his companion did not appear altogether satisfied the sloop had dipped her lee rail just level with the water now and she rushed along bounding with a lurch and splash over the small frothtipped seas he began to understand how one arrived at the proper angle by the slant at which the wind struck his face as well as by watching the direction of the seas which came charging down to meet her in regular formation then harry said that as they had stretched out far enough to clear the point they would go about upon the other tack  shove your helm downthats to leenot too hard he ordered and as frank obeyed him there was a sharp banging of sail cloth and the boat swinging around swayed upright  in another moment the wind was on her opposite side and she was heading off at an angle to her previous course while harry with one foot braced against the lee coaming struggled to flatten in the sheet on the jib the big mainboom had swung over of its own accord amidst a great clatter of blocks by and by when the point slid away to lee of them harry told frank to pull his helm up and then he pointed to a confused mass of gray rocks and trees rising above the glistening water several miles away  now he said shell go there straight and all you have to do is to keep her bowsprit on yonder head its a fair wind and when youve got that you want to slack out the sheets until the sails are as far outboard as theyll go and still keep full if your sheets are too tight youll know it by the weight on the tiller  he let a couple of ropes run out through the clattering blocks and the sloop slanting over a little farther seemed to leap forward the sparkling green ridges which came tumbling up on one side of her swung her aloft with the foam boiling along the edge of her lee deck and then surged away in turn and let her drop while another came rolling up instead of being a mere thing of wood and canvas she seemed to become animate charged with vitality the springy way she rushed along was strangely exhilarating frank became fascinated watching her bows go up and the snowy straining sail sweep across the dazzling blue at every lurch while he became conscious of a sense of control and mastery as he gripped the tiller he felt that he could do what he wanted with this wonderful rushing thing  for she was certainly wonderful there was no doubt of that because among all of mans works and inventions there is none that more nearly approaches the simplicity of perfection and adaptability to its purpose than the modern sailboat it has taken centuries to evolve her each builder adding a little to the work of those who went before and balancing in her making often without knowing it the great natural forces one against another until at last science justified what man did so that with this frail creation one may brave the untrammeled winds of heaven and the onslaught of the seas  by and by the headland they had been nearing thrust them off their course and outside it lay a nest of islets with a strong stream running up between as it ran to windward it broke up the regular breezedriven waves into short foaming combers with hollowed breasts and tumbling tops which flung up wisps of spray frank glanced at this tumult with some anxiety and it was a relief to him when his companion offered to take the tiller  you had better let me have her harry said she wants handling in a jump like that id heave a reef down to reduce the sail only that it would take us some time to tie it in and therell be smoother water once were past the islands as well have to beat through you can get the sheets in  frank found this no easy task for he had no idea that the sails could pull so hard and harry had to help him with one hand then the latters face became intent as they plunged into the turmoil the seas looked big and angry now in fact as usually happens they looked a good deal bigger than they really were but they were breaking in a threatening manner and came on to meet the sloop in whitetopped phalanxes she went over some with a disconcerting plunge and swoop but she rammed a few of the rest driving her jib and bows in and flinging the brine all over her when she swung them up her deck was sluicing and every now and then a green and white cascade came frothing over the coaming into the well frank however noticed that instead of letting the boat meet the combers his companion occasionally pulled his tiller up so that swinging round a little she brought the ridge of frothing water farther on her side as she plunged over it  i thought you had to face a nasty sea headon he said  did you harry responded then watch that smaller one  a slope of water came tumbling on some yards ahead and as the boy eased his helm down an inch or two the bows came up to meet the sea they struck it full in its hollowed breast and the next moment there was a shock and half the deck was lost in a rush of foam  like me to plug another laughed harry  frank begged him not to do it the result of the experiment was rather alarming and harry let her fall off a little to dodge the onslaught of the succeeding combers until at last they grew smaller as the stream spread itself out in open water then he gave frank some further instruction  if you were pulling or paddling a small craft it would be safer to bring her headon because you have to remember that shed be going mighty slow but when youre sailing a boat thats carrying her speed its evident that you dont want to ram her right at a comber if you do shes bound to go bang into it when you see one that looks threatening you let her fall off slightly and she goes over slanting he broke off for a moment with a laugh seems to me im always on the teach you come here and take the tiller while i get some of the water out of her you can head for that point to starboard  he busied himself with the bucket while frank steered the boat and an hour or so later they ran into a little sheltered inlet where they brought her head to wind and pitched the anchor over after that they bailed out the halfswamped canoe and dropping into her paddled ashore     chapter vii  a warning   frank looked about him with some curiosity when they reached the settlement which struck him as a singularly unattractive place in a hole chopped out of the forest that crept close to the edge of the water stood a few small log houses and several roughly boarded shacks tall fir stumps surrounded them and here and there provision cans and old boots lay among the fern in which a few lean hogs were rooting farther on however there was an opening in the bush for the boy could catch the gleam of water between the trees and in one place the great columnar trunks cut against the soft green of a meadow the grass was bright with sunshine but dim shadow hung over the forestshrouded settlement  a forlorn spot said harry i dont know why the folks first pitched here but they raise a little fruit and now and then a seattle boat comes along its thin gravel soil on this strip and thats probably the reason they havent done any more choppingthere are salt meadows farther alongbut if theyd any hustlers among them theyd have got out their axes and let a little daylight in he waved his hand contemptuously theyre a mean crowd anyway except the storekeeper and ive wondered how he makes a living out of them now well go along and get that flour  they moved on down the trail which was torn up by the passage of jumper sledges until they reached a frame building which frank had not noticed at first it stood back a little and was larger and neater than any of the rest a veranda ran along the front of it and in one window small flour bags and more provision cans were displayed a couple of men in blue shirts and overalls lounged smoking on the veranda in a manner which suggested that they had never hurried themselves in their lives and they seemed to be the only inhabitants of the place as the boys walked up the stairway harry pointed to a notice pasted up in the window frank stopped and read it aloud        twenty dollars will be paid to any one identifying       the man who recently drove a pair of horses off the       oliver ranch  with a laugh harry looked up defiantly at the lounging men thats olivers answer he said they told him to keep his mouth shut  one of the men grinned seems to me it was good advice do you figure any one round here is going to earn those twenty dollars  harry shook his head i dont he answered still my only reason for believing it is that the money isnt big enough anyway that notice will serve its purpose it makes it clear that we mean to fight  the lounger grinned again and harry marching past him with his head up entered the store a man who was sitting behind the counter rose when the boys came in and raised his hand in a manner which seemed to indicate that caution was desirable  youre wanting some groceries he asked  flour harry answered a seventypound bag if youve got it some pork tooyou know the piece we take you might send them down to the beach if theres anybody in the place whos not afraid of carrying a flour bag  the storekeeper smiled and strolled casually toward the window coming back he leaned upon the counter  your aunts mighty particular about her pork he said raising his voice a little better come along into the back store and see what ive got  they followed him into a smaller room where he first of all threw several big slabs of pork down upon a board making it seemed to frank as much noise as possible  twelve pounds in this lot he said loudly then lowering his voice those fellows outside havent gone and i dont want them to hear you havent found your horses yet  harry admitted that they had not done so and the man nodded gravely  well he said i guess theyll turn up presently i couldnt tell your father that because there were other folks in the store when he handed me the notice what i want to say is that hes not wise in bluffing the boys you had better tell him thats my opinion  how much do you know about the thing harry asked directly  very little but i can guess a good deal quite enough anyway to convince me that you folks had better lie quiet and let the boys alone  harry glanced scornfully toward the veranda  pshaw he growled we dont want to meddle but its another matter to let those slouches drive off our team thats my view though i dont know what my father means to do about it he hasnt told me  he never does tell folks the storekeeper answered with a trace of dryness i guess hell wait and kick when hes ready but you tell him from me that hes up against quite a big thing he raised his voice well ill send that pork and flour along  the boys went out and met one of the loungers strolling casually across the store though frank had a suspicion that he had come in softly some time earlier as they were walking down to the beach harry glanced up the strip of sheltered water  theres a chinese camp a little way up the creek he said nothing much to see there but we may as well take a look at it  they paddled across a strip of shadow where the reflections of spreading cedar and towering fir floated inverted in the still green water until the ripple from the bows broke across and banished them after that they slid out into the sunlight where a narrow belt of cultivated land ran back on either hand on one side it was partly hidden by a bank of soil at the end of which three or four men were leisurely working they merely looked down as the canoe slid past  hard cases said harry presently if i was sheriff id clean this hole right out there are decent folks here but the curious thing is that when you let two or three toughs into a place they seem to get on top  frank made no comment and soon they were once more paddling into the shadow of the forest the creek was growing smaller and at length they ran the canoe ashore and struck into a narrow trail through the bush  it was now getting on into the afternoon and frank felt sorry that they had not eaten the lunch miss oliver had prepared for them before they left the sloop it was very hot and very still except when now and then the drumming of a blue grouse came sharply out of the shadows by and by however the wood became a little thinner and harry pointed toward an opening between the trees  thats the place he said not much to look at but its good land you can see the maples yonderthats always a favorable signand somebody with money has lately bought quite a piece of it to start a fruit ranch on the chows have taken the contract for clearing it and if any dope has been landed in the neighborhood theyre probably mixed up with the thing  frank glanced toward the opening and sitting as he was in dim shadow the open space he looked out upon seemed flooded with dazzling brightness in the background and some distance away little blueclad figures were toiling with axes that flashed as they swung amidst a confusion of branches and fallen logs the staccato chunk of the blades ripping through the heavy stillness nothing else however seemed to move and the air was filled with a languorous resinous smell rows of stumps stretched out from the spot on which the chinamen were working breaking off before a cluster of bark and splitboard shacks that stood beneath the edge of the forest a man dressed in loose blue garments was seated motionless outside one of the shacks before two logs from between which a little smoke curled straight up into the air presently the man stood up and just then harry seized franks shoulder  look round a littleto the left he whispered  frank did so and was astonished to see another man slip quietly out of the forest and approach the shack his face was not discernible but there was something peculiar in the way he walked and his dress made it evident that he was a white man  have you seen him before harry asked softly  i cant locate him but ive an idea that hes not quite a stranger said frank  well said harry im open to make a guess at him just as the schooner went about that night i had a look at her helmsman he had his back to me but it was moonlight and i could see that one shoulder hunched up in a kind of curious manner  frank looked again and it seemed to him that there was something unusual in the way the man held his shoulder it was somewhat higher than the other though it hardly amounted to a deformity  slip in behind that tree whispered harry pointing toward the bush well creep up through the shadow if he goes into the shack  they spent some minutes moving forward in and out among the trees and in the meanwhile frank saw the stranger enter the shack and the chinaman follow him then he and harry walked out of the bush scarcely a score of yards from the rude building and headed straight for it as they approached the chinaman became visible in the doorway where he stood waiting for them he appeared to be an old man for his face was lined and seamed but it was absolutely expressionless an impassive yellow mask and frank felt baffled and repelled by it as soon as it was evident that the boys intended to enter his dwelling he moved aside and when they stood in the little shadowy room frank was astonished to see that there was nobody else in it this seemed incomprehensible for there was only one door in the place in the meanwhile the chinaman was looking at them quietly  its quite hot observed harry  velly hot assented the other who did not seem in any way disturbed by the fact that they had so unceremoniously marched in  harry appeared embarrassed after this as though he did not know what to say next until he was evidently seized by an inspiration  got any chow john he asked  velly good chow answered the chinaman lice blue glouse smokee fishee  blue grouse said harry disgustedly aside to frank its the nesting season but i guess that wouldnt count for much with them he turned to his host im not a heathen savvy cook american got any flour you can make biscuits or flapjacks of  you leavee chow to me said the other cookee all same big hotel seattle tacoma san flisco  its quite likely said harry looking round at frank you can trust a chinaman to turn out a decent meal ill walk round a bit in the meanwhile you can sit here and rest  frank did not particularly wish to rest but he fancied that his companion had given him a hint and while the chinaman busied himself with his pots and pans he sat down outside the shack he had been up early that morning and after the steady arduous work at the ranch it was pleasant to sit still in the strip of shadow and let his eyes wander idly about the clearing among other things he noticed that a little trickle of water flowed across it and that the soil was quaggy in the neighborhood he concluded that the stranger who had so mysteriously disappeared must have crossed the wet place  it was some little time before harry came back and the chinaman then set out their dinner frank had no idea what some of it consisted of and his companion was unable to enlighten him but it was excellent when they had finished the man turned to harry  one dolla he said gravely  harry handed it over readily and smiled at frank when they strolled back into the bush  it wasnt what id figured on when i first walked in but i had to make some excuse he said just now id very much like to know how far it went with him he paused and looked thoughtful i guess it wasnt a very long way the image is ahead of us by a dollar  frank laughed you had some reason for going for that walk  oh yes replied harry i wanted to make sure of things and the ground was soft there were some footprints in itgoing from the shackand theyd been made quite lately by a white mans boot john sticks to his slipper things in a general way anyhow it was the man we saw who left those tracks  how do you know that  there were a lot of others about but theyd been made earlier the water had got into them but there was very little in those i was interested in  frank was conscious that this was a point which would probably have escaped his notice but he had not lived in the bush and learned to use his eyes  its very curious how the fellow got out of the shack without our seeing him he said  it looks curious until you begin to think now though i tried to keep my eye on it all the while the trees kept getting between me and the shack as we made for it and what i couldnt see you couldnt see either you were close behind me which in one way was where we were wrong if we had crept in well apart the same tree wouldnt have bothered both of us though if wed done that it would have doubled the chances of our being seen  a tree isnt such a very big thing frank objected  no said harry the point is that it will shut an object a good deal bigger than itself out of your sight he stopped a moment and pointed toward a neighboring cedar well say that ones three feet in diameter but as youre standing it will shut off a good deal more than a track three feet wide through the bush you want to run a line from your eye to both edges of the trunk and then carry them out behind it the farther you run them the farther they get apart and as you cant see round a corner everything in the wedge they enclose is shut out from view got that into you it will come in useful when youre trailing a deer  it was quite clear to frank now that it had been explained but his companion went on  well he added it wouldnt have taken that fellow more than a few seconds to slip out of the shack and in behind it then if he kept it between him and us hed be hidden until he reached the bush  yes said frank it must mean that he saw us and didnt want us to see him  youre getting quite smart said harry with a grin i dont know if you noticed it but you trod on a rotten branch that smashed he didnt want us to know him again but id pick that fellow anywhere by his back and walk now why was he so anxious that we shouldnt see him talking to the chinaman  it was a suggestive question but frank could not answer it and harry said nothing further reaching the canoe they paddled down the creek until they came abreast of the sloop and saw the provisions lying upon the shingle some little distance from the water for the tide had ebbed since their arrival when they had run the canoe in frank assisted harry in getting the flour bag on his back but gave a sudden cry of dismay as a white cloud flew all over him  hold on he cried put it down its running out  harry dropped the bag and drew down his brows as he gazed at the little pile of flour which lay at his feet then he suddenly stooped down  the bag seemed a sound one frank suggested  oh yes said harry shortly theres only one thing the matter with it see here and he laid his finger on a long slit somebody has stuck a knife into it  a mean trick frank broke out wrathfully  harry stood up with a flash in his eyes its rather more than that its a hint anyway if youll get hold of the other end well pack the bag down with the cut uppermost  in spite of this precaution they spilled a good deal of the flour before they got it on board the sloop but harry said no more about the matter and hoisting sail they slid out of the inlet with a faint breeze abeam of them they found it fair and the breeze only a little stronger when they had left the woods behind and frank sat at the tiller while the sloop glided rapidly through the smooth blue water with no more than a drowsy gurgle beneath her bows the tide was running down with them now and it was only when he glanced toward the beach that he realized how fast they were going  a pleasant salt odor of drying weed was mingled with the scent of the firs in front of them a wonderful vista of white snow mountains emerged from fleecy cloud and far beneath the silvery vapor appeared the faint and shadowy blurs of distant hillsides clothed with mighty forest overhead the big white sail swayed languidly to and fro cutting sharply into the blue and frank felt that he would like to sail on like this for hours lounging at the helm and listening to the water as it slipped along the sides with a light fair wind he could guide the boat wherever he wished by the slightest touch of the tiller and it was pleasant to see how steadily he could keep her bowsprit pointing to a low rocky head that rose a patch of soft blue shadow against the evening light  the voyage however came to an end almost too soon and the rocks and firs were growing dim when they ran into the cove and picked up their mooring buoy after they had stowed and covered the sails they went ashore and both boys were very tired and warm when they reached the homestead harrys clothes were covered with flour which had left a white trail along the way miss oliver was standing in the lamplight when they came in and noticed the white patches on their clothes  you have let him give you a burst bag she exclaimed  harry looked meaningly at frank no he said i think it was all right when it left the store and i dont think we have spilled more than a few pounds perhaps we had better skip it into the barrel it will save the stuff from running out when you move it  they managed to carry it away between them and when they had emptied it harry turned to frank  if she starts talking about that bag head her off on to something else he said i dont want her to get imagining trouble every time we leave the ranch  when miss oliver resumed the subject at supper frank attempted to divert her attention and fancied that he succeeded though he wondered why she smiled at times when the boys had gone to their room she picked up the bag and stretched it out under the light then her face grew grave as she saw the slit in it being a clever woman however she decided not to mention her suspicions     chapter viii  salmon spearing   when the boys came in for breakfast next morning jake was standing in the kitchen and miss oliver sat opposite him looking unusually thoughtful  whats the matter harry asked  jake turned toward him slowly  i dont know that theres anything very wrong he said leaders come back  leader was the name of one of the missing horses and frank started as he remembered what the storekeeper had said but feeling miss olivers eyes upon him turned his head and looked out into the clearing  wheres tillicum inquired harry  that replied jake is more than i can tell leader was standing outside the stable when i went along and i cant make out why the other horse wasnt with him hed have come with leader if anybody had turned them into the trail together  harry called to frank and went out of the door jake followed them to the stable where they found the horse looking rather jaded but except for that very little the worse jake nodded reassuringly when harry had felt him over  no sign of anything wrong he said there was a good deal of dried mud on him before i fixed him up and he seemed mighty keen on his corn they hadnt given him very much  what do you make of it harry asked  about as much as you do answered jake they turned him loose on the trail when theyd done with him and thats all there is to it i guess the question is what theyve done with tillicum one things certain if he doesnt turn up your fathers going to be mighty mad  harry agreed that this would be very probable though he did not think his father would show it as there was nothing more to be said they went back to the house where somewhat to their relief miss oliver made no allusion to the affair and they proceeded quietly to eat breakfast  are there any spring salmon in the river she asked presently looking across at harry  yes he responded there are a few coming up  then you might take frank with you this morning and try to get me one i dare say jake will smoke it miss oliver smiled at frank you dont get salmon prepared that way back east  we have it canned said frank ive an idea ive seen some smoked but i cant remember is it very nice i thought you didnt care for salmon here  fresh salmon jake said curtly is only good for hogs and if you keep it long enough for growing potatoes with still he added thoughtfully i dont know that you call it fresh then  miss oliver laughed wait until you try it smokedas jake does it he can prepare it as some of the siwash do i believe they taught him in british columbia  jake shook his head solemnly no he said i cant cure salmon as some of the indians do youd get nothing like it in a new york hotel but i guess i can dress it most as well as any white man you go along and get me a fish harry id try the pool by the big fall  they set out a few minutes later taking with them a pole which had a big iron hook lashed to it and a long indian salmon spear there was a small fork at one end of the latter on which were placed two nicely made bone barbs attached to the haft by strips of sinew harry removed them to show frank that they would slip off their sockets easily leaving the clearing they struck into a narrow trail through the bush and after half an hours scramble over fallen logs and through thick fern they reached the river  it poured frothing out of shadowy forest and leaped over a rock ledge in a thundering fall beneath which it swirled around a deep basin and then after sweeping down a white rapid spread out over a wide belt of stones there were rocks on either side of it and as the trees could find no hold on them warm sunlight streamed down upon the foaming water harry sat down on a ledge above the pool with the spear beside him and pointed to a great bird wheeling on slanted wings above the shallow  a fish eagle he said here are salmon making up  frank watched the circling of the majestic bird which did not seem much afraid of them it had a white head and a cruel beak and once when it swept over him he noticed the fixed gaze of its cold impassive eye splendid as it was he somehow shrank from the thing it looked so powerful and utterly merciless when it stopped in the air dropped and struck he saw a splash as a writhing silvery creature was snatched up in its talons  got him wrong cried harry you watch hell have to let go again  so far as frank could see the eagle had seized the salmon by the middle of its back the fish twisting itself crossways as it was carried up into the air the next moment there was a splash in the water and the bird swooped down again when it rose it held its prey differently and frank fancied he could see one wicked claw gripping the fish close by the back of its neck while the other was spread out toward its tail in any case the salmon did not seem able to wriggle now and the eagle flew off with it and vanished among the tops of the black firs  not a big fish but ive a notion the eagle could lift a thing as heavy as itself said harry theyre mighty powerful it might be the one he dropped though i think its another  frank had no idea how much an eagle weighed but he realized something of the capabilities of a bird that could carry off this fish apparently without an effort and what was more astonishing drag the tremendously muscular creature out of the water which was its home then his companion touched his shoulder  watch those two fellows in the eddy said he theyre going to rush the fall  frank saw two slim shadows shoot out beneath a wreath of circling foam and flashwhich seemed the best word for itthrough the crystal depths of the slacker part of the pool they were lost in the snowy turmoil near the foot of the fall and a few minutes passed before he saw them again then one shot out of the water like a bow that had suddenly straightened itself gleamed resplendent with silver and plunged into the foam again harry pointed him out the other and though it was a moment or two before he could see it he marveled when he did it had its dusky back toward him for now and then the dorsal fin rose clear and it was swimming up a thin cascade which poured down a steep slope of stone that any creature should have strength enough to stem that rush of water seemed incredible but there was no doubt that the fish was ascending inch by inch then it found a momentary harbor in a little pool just outside the main leap of the fall and shot out of it again with its curious uncurving spring frank watched it eagerly when it dropped into the fall and it was with a sense of sympathy that he saw its gallant efforts wasted as it was suddenly swept down before reaching the bottom however it had evidently rallied all its powers for it flashed clear into the sunlight and had recovered a fathom when he lost sight of it once more  after that he glanced back toward the shallows and saw that other birds had appeared he did not know what they were and harry could only tell him that they were fishhawks of some kind as he watched them wheeling or stooping dropping upon the sparkling stream and screaming now and then the boy began to form some idea of the desperate battle for existence that is fought daily and hourly by the lower creation  there dont seem to be a great many salmon he remarked  its a thin run said harry therell probably be more of them in the next one once upon a time as i expect youve heard these rivers were so thick with fish that you could walk across their backs though ill allow ive never seen anything of that kind  frank was not astonished at the last admission this brownskinned cleareyed boy who could sail a boat and hold the rifle straight was not one to talk of the wonderful things he had seen and done he left that to the whiskyfaced sports of the saloons who were probably capable of butchering a crippled deer at fifty yards with the repeater  i suppose the salmon have plenty enemies he suggested  oh yes said harry in the sea the seals and porpoises get their share of them then as they head for the rivers there are the fish traps and in canada the seinenet boats along the shore after that when theyre in fresh water they have to run the gauntlet of the indians birds and bears  bears frank interrupted  sure said harry theyre quite smart fishers even the little minks get some of the salmon stranded in the shallow pools the indians set long baskets narrow end downward for them near the top of the falls these of course are fresh from saltwateryou can see theyre silverybut they lose that brightness as they go up the larger rivers and on the columbia and fraser they push on hundreds of miles up tremendous cañons up falls and rapids toward the rockies those that fetch headwaters are scarred and battered with the bright scales and most of their fins and tails worn right off them once theyre through with the spawning they die  then they go straight to the place where they spawn  yes the salmons really a seafish its born in fresh water but it goes down to the ocean as soon as its big enough and its generally believed that it stays there three or four years though its a fact that we know mighty little about the salmon yet then it comes back to the same place and spawns and dies you see theres a constant succession coming up he broke off with a laugh now well try to get one there are three or four big fellows yonder all you have to do is to slash at them with the hook  frank perched himself upon a jutting shelf of rock and presently two or three swift shadows flitted by he swung up the pole and made a sudden sweep at them only to see the hook splash two or three feet behind the last ones tail incidentally he came very near to going headforemost into the pool then another fish swept toward him and this time he landed the hook some inches in front of its nose after which he made several more attempts succeeding only in splashing himself all over he was beginning to discover that his hands and eyes needed a good deal of training one it seemed must judge speed and distance and strike simultaneously but the trouble was that he needed a second or two to think and naturally while he thought the fish got away  by and by he turned and watched harry who had not struck once yet he stood upon a ledge alert strungup and steadyeyed but absolutely motionless with the long spear running up above his shoulder at last however he drove his right arm down and the beautiful straight shaft sank into the pool it stopped suddenly for a second quivering and then bent and twisted upward in the boys clenched hands  frank ran toward him wondering that the slender shaft did not immediately break when he observed that one barb had slipped off its socket and that the fish struck by it was now held by the short length of sinew a moment or two later harry jerked it out upon the bank by a quick vertical movement and knocked it on the head it lay still after this a beautiful creature of some seven or eight pounds with the sunlight gleaming on its silver scales frank glanced once more at the long spear it occurred to him that this was also perfect in its way and could not have been better adapted to its purpose  its curious that an indian should be able to make a thing like that he remarked i dont think a white man could turn out anything as handy unless of course he had one to copy  the point is that it took the siwash a mighty long while to make the salmon spear said harry its quite likely they spent two hundred years over it their spears are all on the same pattern so are their traps and canoes seeing a puzzled look cross franks face he smiled an indian is no smarter than a white manin fact when you stop to think of it hes not half as smart though most everything he makes is excellent its this way if we want a saw for a new purpose or a different kind of wood we write to the disston people or somebody of the kind and they set their boss designer to work he considers and then because he knows all about the physical sciences he draws the thing on paper and sends it to the forges or grinding shops in a general way that saw does its work though i guess if the designer had to use it for a year or two hed make the next one better  of course agreed frank  its different with the indians harry continued one fellow made a fish spear ever so long ago and found that it wouldnt do he made the next one different and was satisfied with it but his son made it a little longer and thinner then his grandson altered the barb and his son added another one after that each fellow made it a little handier until nothing more could be done to it and they stuck to the pattern he turned and glanced at the spear this thing is the product of the skill of ever so many generations  it was simple but convincing for it explained the efficiency of the indians tools and also why he had not progressed he worked along the same line sticking to one simple implement until he had perfected it and though this was his greatest disadvantage the man who killed the fish generally made the spear he got so far and stopped content and incapable of going any farther the white man on the other hand changed his methods continually with his changing needs and what counted more than all he very seldom made the tools he used because he had discovered that somebody who did nothing else could make them better when the americans of the pacific slope wanted salmon they did not whittle spears but sent east to the cordage factories whose owners brought in fibers from all over the world and spun the netting with which to build gigantic fish traps  we could do with another fish ventured harry lets see if you can get one  frank took up his pole again it was a heavy and clumsy affair but harry had told him that he would probably break the indian spear they waited awhile until another swift shadow swept around with the eddy beneath their feet  hold on cried harry wait till the stream heads him and then strike as quick as you can  the fishs speed was checked for a moment as it entered the furious rush beneath the fall and frank who could just see its dusky back amidst the foam swung his pole there was a splash and then a curious shock which sent a thrill through him and the haft jerked sharply in his hands  heave him out cried harry that thing wont break  frank tugged with all his might and the salmon flew up over his shoulder the next moment he had seized it and was almost reluctant to let it go when his companion clubbed it on the head  twos as many as we have any use for and well go along said the latter we havent made much of a show at that draining lately  frank would have preferred to stay where he was but he followed harry toward the bush and soon after they struck a cleared trail to the ranch which was however not the way they had come a little later they were somewhat astonished to see a group of figures among the trees and hurrying forward they found mr oliver and mr barclay talking to jake who apparently had been driving home two or three steers  mr oliver looking unusually grave nodded to the boys we have just met jake he said he tells me tillicums back a little way up the trail with a broken leg  i guess hes done murmured jake adding significantly i wouldnt have left him like that if id had a gun  go on with the steers said mr oliver well turn back  the boys accompanied him and mr barclay and leaving the trail by and by where the bush was thinner they stopped before a pitiable sight it was tillicum who stood awkwardly before them his head lowered and one leg that seemed distorted out of its usual shape hanging limp caked mire was spattered about the poor animal its coat was foul and every line of its body seemed expressive of pain and exhaustion as it raised its drooping head and looked at them pitifully frank felt a thrill of hot anger against the outlaws who were responsible for its condition mr oliver stepped up to the horse and gently felt of its injured limb after which he turned abruptly toward mr barclay and frank noticed that his face was set  theres only one thing to be done he said have you a pistol  havent you his companion asked with a slight trace of astonishment in his tone  if id had one would i have wanted to borrow yours retorted mr oliver  well said mr barclay its seldom i carry one but in this case it seemed advisable he put his hand into his pocket here you are its a big caliber  mr oliver took the weapon and held it behind him and turning back toward the horse gently stroked its head then there was a flash and detonation and the beast dropped like a stone after a moment the rancher turned around with a very curious look in his eyes with the smoking weapon clenched hard in his hand  ive had that faithful animal six years he said in a harsh voice well get away  they walked on in silence for a while and then mr barclay spoke  the breaking of its leg was probably an accident he suggested  yes said mr oliver its possible he broke it after they turned him loose but that doesnt seem to affect the case he paused and looked around at his companion you understand that im with you right through this thing  nothing more was said until they approached the ranch when mr oliver turned to the boys  ill take the fish he said you can go on with whatever you were doing  they moved away toward the drain and when they reached it harry stood still a moment or two  its a long while since ive seen dad look half so mad he said when he sets his face that way its sure to mean trouble anyway when i saw tillicum i felt kind of boiling overas well as sorry  did you notice what mr barclay said about the pistol frank asked  why of course said harry thoughtfully now i dont know what theyve been after but its plain enough that there was some danger in the thing mr barclay doesnt seem extra smart but theres something in his look that suggests he wouldnt be easy scared and he took a pistol along then he laughed in a significant manner and jumped down into the trench its my idea those dope fellows are going to be sorry before dad gets through with them and now well go on with the draining  he fell to with the grubhoe and for the next half hour worked furiously after which jake appeared and called them in to dinner     chapter ix  a plain hint   mr oliver bought another horse from one of his scattered neighbors and a few days afterward he and jake set off for an inlet along the coast near which a few ranchers lived harry explained to frank that as they clubbed together and bought their supplies from seattle a little steamer from the latter place called at the inlet now and then to deliver the goods and his father had ordered a mower which was to be sent down by her  mr oliver did not come back until late in the evening a couple of days later but as soon as he arrived he and jake set to work to put the machine together and it was getting dusk when at last they left it standing beneath the trees near the edge of a ravine early on the following morning the boys went back with them to see if it would work satisfactorily in cutting a little green timothy but as they crossed the clearing jake who was leading the team a little distance in front of his companions stopped suddenly  you didnt go back and move that machine after we left it he asked  no replied mr oliver what made you think i did  jake looked at his employer rather curiously well he said somebody must have moved it the things gone  mr oliver broke into a run and the rest followed when they reached the clump of trees they could discover no sign of the mower except for the track of wheels among the withered needles and undergrowth this led toward the ravine at the bottom of which a little water flowed and frank saw mr olivers face harden as he followed this guide a minute later they stood on the brink of the declivity and saw the mower lying upon its side among the stones thirty or forty feet below them the slope was almost precipitous but mr oliver went down sliding amidst a rush of loosened soil and frank and harry with some difficulty scrambled down after him a glance was sufficient to show them that the implement was not likely to be of the least use to its owner mr oliver examined it quietly and then clambered back up the side of the ravine after which he sat down and took out his pipe before he turned to jake  every bit of castiron in it is smashed he said the pinion wheels are broken and the other parts are bent ill have to order another one  jake made a gesture of sympathy  if i could get hold of the folks who did the thing it would be a consolation but i havent the least notion how to trail them  one man couldnt have moved it said mr oliver  there were three of them the question is what brought them here i guess they didnt come just to smash the machine  mr oliver seemed lost a moment in contemplation  i think youre right he said at length they probably came because this is the easiest way of getting through to the settlements in the basker district and the beach behind the head makes a handy landing well go along and look around i dont think theyd try the cove its too near the house  they turned into a bush trail together and when they reached the beach a little while later jake stooping over a furrow in the smooth shingle by the waters edge looked up at mr oliver  a sea canoe grounded here soon after last high water he said you can see where they ran her down when it had ebbed a little  mr oliver who was still quietly smoking nodded  yes he said its very much as i expected with a sheltered landing here and as good a trail inland as they could find its not difficult to understand why those fellows were anxious that i should stand in with them or at least leave them alone this thing of course was meant as a warning then he addressed the boys you neednt wait you can get some more of those branches sawed off in the slashing  they moved away and left him talking to jake and it was not until they had reached the bush that harry made any observation  ive a notion that were up against the meanest kind of toughs but in the long run ill back dad he said its quite likely that if we lie low you and i may get a hand in later on  frank made no answer though the prospect his companion suggested was not unpleasant to him going back to their work they sawed up branches until nightfall on the following afternoon they were still engaged at the same task at some distance from the house when they saw jake who had set out for a neighboring ranch in the morning enter the clearing dragging a big and evidently very unwilling animal after him he sat down upon a log and harry dropped his ax  its websters dog he said to frank i heard that somebody had given him one well go along and look at him  they found jake rather breathless and very red in face holding the end of a chain fastened to the collar of the dog who crouched close by watching him with wicked eyes and white fangs bared a serviceable club lay beside jake but it seemed to frank that he had got as far away from the animal as the chain permitted the lad was however not astonished at this for he fancied he had never seen as intractable and generally unprepossessing a dog as this one  dads borrowed him from webster harry suggested  it seemed to me webster was mighty glad to get rid of him and didnt want him back said jake guess if he was mine i wouldnt be anxious to keep him either  frank moved a pace or two nearer the dog holding out his hand but speedily retired when it growled at him savagely after that jake turned to harry  youre fond of dogs he suggested wouldnt you like to pat him  no said harry edging away i wouldnt try it for five dollars what kind of a brute is he  well said jake i figure that fellow has a considerable mixture of ancestors though theres a strain of the bull in him thats where he got his stylish mouth from hes about as amiable as a timberwolf and he has the gait of a bear while its my opinion theres more sense in a plow ox than there is in him  when did you leave websters harry next inquired  soon as dinner was over responded jake dryly  and supper will be ready soon what in the name of wonder have you been doing harry looked around at frank its about three miles  jake grinned coming alongand resting this fellow kind of decided hed sit down every now and then and i let him hes a dog thats been accustomed to doing just what he wants  did you have to cross the creek asked frank who noticed that the mans long boots and part of his trousers were wet  no said jake curtly the critter took a notion hed like to go in and as i couldnt let him loose i had to go in too we splashed around in it for quite a few minutes  harry broke into a burst of laughter and jake handed him the club i want to get in by supper suppose you put a move on him  he stood up and jerked the chain but the dog bared his teeth again and declined to stir harry getting behind him tapped him with the club and he swung round savagely straining at the chain  now said jake i know how well fix him you make him mad and then head for the ranch while he gets after you and ill try to hold him  no said harry decisively i dont think well try that way go on and lead him  the animal moved off at last and shambled toward the house looking bigger and considerably more clumsy than the largest bulldog frank had ever seen he walked into the kitchen docilely but when miss oliver approached him harry cried out in dismay  keep away he warned he isnt safe  loose the chain said miss oliver and to their vast astonishment the dog walked up to her wagging his disreputable tail and crouching down licked her hands she patted his great head gently and then turned smilingly to the boys  im afraid webster has been rough with him she said its clear that hes a womans dog  a womans dog echoed harry scathingly well the man who gave that beast to a woman must have been crazy  during the next few days the dog made himself at home at the ranch though with the exception of miss oliver he still eyed its inhabitants suspiciously jake said that though almost fully grown he was young and had no sense yet then the dog commenced to follow the boys about at a distance and once fell upon and destroyed their overall jackets which they had taken off when they went to work they found him sitting upon the tatters evidently feeling proud of himself for he wagged his tail and barked delightedly when they approached as a rule he did not make much noise but his growl was deep and ominous with something in it that discouraged any attempt at undue familiarity  while they were ruefully inspecting their ruined garments jake came up and leaned against a neighboring tree  he wants training harry he observed if he was my dog id break him in  the question retorted harry indignantly is how its to be done ill own up that i know very little about training dogs and thats not the kind of one id like to begin on he turned to frank considering that a good many of the ranchers live almost alone its rather a curious thing that there are very few dogs in this part of the country  jake fixed his eyes dubiously upon the animal who trotted up a little nearer and growled at him  well he said hes sure a daisy but i guess he can be taught and the first thing is to let him see youre not afraid of him  harry snickered then suppose you try to prove it haul him up by the ear and teach him hes not to eat my jacket  jake judiciously disregarded this suggestion theres one trick most dogs learn quite easy its to guard you put down some of your clothes for instance and make him see that nobodys to touch them until you come back then hell sit tight until you do and i guess in this fellows case thered be mighty little wrong with the nerves of the man whod put a hand on them  if its to be clothes theyll have to be somebody elses said harry anyway ill mention it to my aunt its my opinion shes the only person who could teach him anything  how miss oliver taught the dog they did not know but she succeeded for when the boys walked up to the house at supper time one evening a week or two later harry who reached the door first came out hurriedly  the brute wont let me in he explained i confess it sounds kind of silly but perhaps youd like to try  frank approached the door cautiously and stopped when he reached it the dog crouched near the center of the kitchen floor with a womans straw hat in front of him from which there trailed a couple of chewedup feathers he looked up at frank with a low warning growl which said very plainly come no farther  they called him endearing names which so far as they could see had not the least effect but neither of them felt equal to entering the kitchen until miss oliver walked in by another door then the dog let her take the hat wagging his tail with satisfaction  hes a good deal more intelligent than you seem to think she said give him your hat harry and then go out and wait for a few minutes before you come back for it  harry did so and the dog made no trouble when he picked up the hat but he would not let frank go near it in the meanwhile after that they tried two or three more experiments of the same kind though frank took no part in them which was a thing he regretted when he went for a swim an evening or two later  on this occasion the tide was almost full the water in the cove was pleasantly warm and bright sunlight streamed down upon it showing the white shingle a fathom beneath the surface now and then frank went down toward it for he had learned to swim under water and look about him while he did so but by and by he headed for the entrance to the cove with the overhand side stroke which harry had taught him swinging his left arm forward over his head his face dipped under and then rose in the midst of a ripple as his hollowed palm swept backward under his crooked elbow to his thigh while his legs swung across each other like a pair of scissors the brine gleamed and sparkled as it slipped past him and when he reached the entrance to the cove he slid up and down the smooth green undulations with a pleasant lift and fall it was so exhilarating that he went farther than he had intended and he was feeling a little breathless when at last he turned back but when he reached the spot where he had undressed trouble awaited him  the dog was seated upon his clothing watching him with suspicious eyes and it growled when he stood up kneedeep frank hesitated the dog did not look amiable but he was beginning to feel cold and he walked slowly forward a pace or two then the creature raised itself on its forepaws with white fangs bare and once more broke into a deep ominous growl there was no doubt that it intended to guard his clothes  he threw a piece of shingle at it and was glad on the whole that he had not succeeded in hitting it when it stood up with bristling hair and a most determined look in its eyes frank floundered back into the water wondering uneasily if it was coming in after him and then standing still up to his waist considered what he should do it was evident that he could not stay where he was much longer and the dog showed no sign of going away it was equally impossible for him to walk back to the ranch without his clothes and in the meanwhile he was growing unpleasantly chilly then he noticed that although the shadow of the crags above rested upon the spot where he stood the sunshine fell upon a boulder which rose out of the water not far away swimming to it he crawled out and found it a little warmer there but this brought him no nearer to finding a way out of the difficulty  he did not remember how long he lay shivering upon the stone but the shadow had crept across it and the tall firs above him showed up more blackly against the evening light when at last harry came clattering over the shingle and stopped in astonishment on seeing him  whatever are you doing there he asked  waiting until your dog goes home said frank he wont let me have my clothes if you hadnt come i expect id have to stay here until tomorrow  harry couldnt help grinning when he observed the resolute animal wouldnt it have been easier to come out and whack him off  no said frank decidedly if you were in my place you wouldnt want to try  harry walked up to the creature and picked up the clothes whereat it rose immediately and wagged its tail as though satisfied in having done its duty  he doesnt seem to mind me harry observed dryly anyway theres no reason why you shouldnt come out now unless of course youre happier where you are  frank swam across dressed and ran all the way to the ranch but it was half an hour before he was moderately warm again the next day he set about teaching the dog to guard it occurred to him that it was not desirable that harry and miss oliver should be the only ones to whom the animal would give any stray article of clothing he might come across  a week or two later miss oliver went away on a visit to tacoma and mr oliver who had bought a new mower commenced to cut his timothy hay the machine could only work on the cleared land and where the stumps were thick he set the boys to mow with the scythe frank found it troublesome work for the big roots ran along the surface of the ground the fern had grown up among these roots and it was their task to cut and pick it out from the grass while every few minutes the scythe point struck a root and sometimes stuck in it in places it struck gravel which made dents in it and the blade often got entangled among shooting willows and young fir saplings frank decided that while it was evidently a costly and difficult thing to clear a ranch it must be almost as hard for its owner to keep what he had won since the forest persistently crept back again  suppose you left this place alone for a couple of years he asked stopping to whet his dinted scythe  you wouldnt know it again harry answered with a smile it would be a waste of willows with young firs growing up between them you couldnt tell it from the bush only that the trees all round would be higher  frank dropped his scythe blade and leaned upon the haft he had been mowing since sunrise and the shadows were now rapidly lengthening his back ached and his hands were sore and he found it a relief to stand still a moment and look about him on one side of the clearing the slanting sunrays struck deep into the forest forcing up great columnar trunks out of the shadow on the other the fretted pinnacles of the firs cut sharp against the sky and between stretched long swathes of fallen timothy and fern already turning yellow not far away mr oliver sitting in the mowers saddle was guiding his team along the edge of the grass which fell beneath the rasping knife and the clink and rattle of the machine rang sharply through the still evening air frank stripped to blue shirt and trousers found everything his eyes rested on pleasant and he felt that after all he had done wisely when he left the cities  then he noticed jake who had been to the settlement crossing the clearing with some letters in his hand he gave them to mr oliver who pulled his team up and sat still for some minutes reading them after that he stepped out and walked toward the boys  you might take the team along harry and put the kettle on the stove he said well have supper as soon as its ready  harry moved away and mr oliver leaned against a neighboring stump with his eyes fixed thoughtfully on frank  ive a letter from your mother he said she wants to know if im satisfied with you he paused a moment and added with a smile thats a question i think i can answer in the affirmative  thank you sir said frank  then mr oliver continued she goes into one or two other matters on which she seems to want my opinion in the first place somebody has offered to find you an opening in the office of a philadelphia business firm youll have to decide about it and it seems to me that the choice is rather a big one you see if you stay out here ranching two or three years it will probably spoil you for a business life in the eastern cities  frank thought hard for a minute or two there was no doubt that ranching when it included clearing land as it generally seemed to do was remarkably arduous work in the case of a man with little money it evidently meant almost incessant toil for it was only by persistent effort that one could chop and saw up the great trees and grub the stumps out still he was growing fond of it and what was more he was conscious that he was gaining a resolution and muscular vigor that in all probability he would never have acquired in the crowded cities  finally he looked up i dont think i would care to go back to them now he said  mr oliver nodded gravely your mother doesnt seem to think a great deal of this opening but on the other hand you want to bear in mind that if you expect to make money in ranching you must be able to invest it raising cattle and fruit for sale is a trade and a trader gets no more than a certain interest on his money and the wages which an equally capable managing clerk or foreman in the same profession would receive there are few respectable businesses in which that interest is a very big one as the result of this the trader must be content with a little unless he has the money to earn him more  yes said frank somewhat ruefully thats clear im afraid i can hardly count on much  your mother mentions that when you are three or four years older she might perhaps be able to raise you about two thousand dollars  i suppose that wouldnt go very far sir  it certainly wouldnt buy you a ranch anywhere near a city but you might get land enough to make a small one back in the bush if you bought such a place you would probably have to go out and work at one of the sawmills or logging camps now and then it would be several years before you could make much of a living because it would cost you so much to bring your stock to market  yes said frank i suppose that is why the land would be cheap  mr oliver made a sign of assent its a difficulty which is however usually got over in this country you hold on and cultivate your land and by and by the market comes to you somebody starts a sawmill or a pulp mill in the locality or if theres ore about a smelter new trails are cut settlements spring up and presently a branch railroad comes along and the rancher can sell everything he can raise he broke off for a moment and smiled rather dryly in such a case you may get big prices but if you average them out over the years of working and waiting youll find you have earned them and that after all the stuff you sell is mighty cheap  then he handed frank the letter id consider it carefully the mail wont leave for the next three days and now well go along to supper  harry had managed to prepare a meal and when it was over mr oliver turned to the boys  a friend of mine in victoria has written asking me to look at a big piece of bush land he thinks of buying on the west coast of vancouver island he offers to pay my expenses and a fee and ive an idea that we might run across in the sloop if we get moderately fine weather after the hay is in i wonder if you would like to go with me  there was no doubt that the prospect appealed to them and mr oliver smiled his approval  then he said you had better hustle that hay in well start as soon as were through with it     chapter x  a breeze of wind   the hay was almost in when frank and harry stood one evening close under the apex of the roof in the log barn the crop was heavy and because the barn was small it had been their business during the afternoon to spread and trample down the grass jake flung up to them they had been working at high pressure at one task or another since soon after daylight that morning and now the confined space was very hot though the sun was low its slanting rays smote the cedar shingles above their bent heads and the dust that rose from the grass floated about them in a cloud and clung to their dripping faces frank felt that the veins on his forehead were swollen when they paused a moment for breath leaning on their forks  i suppose we could get a couple more loads in and there cant be more than that said harry dubiously i wouldnt mind a great deal if the next jumperful upset  frank devoutly wished it would for he felt that he must get out into the open air but a few moments later they heard the plodding oxens feet and the groaning of the clumsy sled the sounds ceased abruptly and jakes voice reached them  tramp it down good he called youve got to squeeze in this lot and another  frank choked down the answer which rose to his lips but the hay must be got in and the boys fell with their forks upon the first of the crackling grass jake flung up to them there seemed to be more dust in it than usual and before the jumper was half unloaded they were panting heavily when at last the oxen hauled the sled away they stood doubled up kneedeep in the hay with their backs close against the roof  i cant see how were to make room for the last lot harry gasped still i guess it has to be done  they set to work again packing the hay into corners and stamping it down and his occupation reminded frank of what he had heard about mining in a thin seam of coal it seemed hotter than ever the dust was choking and at every incautious move he bumped his head or shoulders against the beams the last sled arrived before they were ready for it and they crawled about half buried dragging the grass here and there with their hands and ramming it with their feet and knees into any odd spaces left at length the work was finished and wriggling toward the opening in the wall harry caught at the edge of it and finding a foothold on a log beneath boldly leaped down frank was however less fortunate when he followed his companion for some of the hay slipped away beneath him and without the least intention of leaving the barn in that undignified fashion he suddenly shot out through the hole he felt the air rush past him and then somewhat to his astonishment found himself on the ground none the worse except for the jar of the fall  if id tried to do that its very likely id have broken my leg he panted  he sat down and threw off his hat it was delightful to feel the breeze upon his dripping face and to be out in the fresh air again he had been at work for fourteen hours and was aching all over but that did not trouble him the hay was safely in and there was some satisfaction in the feeling that he had done his part in a heavy piece of work looking about him he noticed that the shadow of the firs had crept half across the clearing and that thin wisps of fleecy cloud were streaming by high above their tall black tops then he heard harry speaking to his father  theres a smart southerly breeze and the tide is running ebb he was saying whats the matter with starting for victoria right away  havent you done enough for today mr oliver asked with a smile  i dont feel as fresh as i did this morning harry admitted anyway when weve got a fair wind and three or four hours ebb going with us it would be a pity not to make the most of them  mr oliver looked doubtful im anxious to get away because as ive arranged to meet a man in victoria well have to take the steamer unless we can slip across very shortly ive an idea that we may get more wind than well have any use for before sunup still we could run in behind the point at banningtons if it was necessary  then jake broke in if youre going ill get supper and pack some bread and pork along to the sloop  mr oliver assented and an hour later they paddled off to the sloop the dog jumped into the canoe with them and when they got on board he quietly sat down on the floorings while jake helped the boys to hoist the mainsail when they came to the jib mr oliver stood up on the deck looking about him  i think wed better have the smaller one he advised  they were ready at length and jake who was to stay behind called the dog as he was about to jump into the canoe harry was busy forward just then with the mooring chain in his hand and the loose jib thrashing about him while the big mainboom jerked over mr olivers head as he sat at the helm the dog however showed no signs of moving  give him a shove said jake addressing frank when he gets up on deck pitch him in  frank turned toward the dog and then stopped abruptly when it showed its teeth and growled  it looks as if he meant to go along jake remarked with a grin prod him with the boathook if he wont move  frank was dubious as he imagined the dog might resent the prodding at that moment harry who had been too busy to notice what was going on hauled up the weather sheet of the jib  im clear he called to his father ill cant her head to lee when youre ready  mr oliver put the helm up as the bows swung around and when the sloop slanted over jake made a futile grab at the dog then shouting to frank he dropped into the canoe and clutched the rail as the sloop forged ahead but the boy was busy with the mainsheet and did not look up in another moment jake let go almost immediately afterward the sloop came round and when she stretched away toward the mouth of the cove the canoe dropped astern  stand by your jibsheets called mr oliver well have to come round again  they were very busy during the next few minutes for the cove was narrow and the wind was blowing in when at length they swept out into the open water the dog crawled up to harry and licked his hands harry looked at his father who made a little sign of assent  i suppose hell have to stay he sighed when that dog decides on doing anything its wise to let him do it now well square off the mainboom  they let the sheet run until the big mainsail swung right out and the sloop drove away rolling viciously short foamflecked seas came tumbling after her but as the tide was running the same way under them lessening the resistance very few broke angrily frank had learned enough by this time however to realize that it would probably be different when the stream turned in the meanwhile the boat was sailing very fast with a little ridge of frothing water washing by on either side when she lifted and a thin shower of spray blowing all over her now and then the great sail with the heavy boom beneath it swung upward in an alarming fashion frank noticed that mr olivers eyes were gazing intently before him and that his hands were clenched tightly upon the tiller  she seems rather bad to steer he said  yes said mr oliver without looking up you have to be careful when youre running before a fresh breeze its remarkably easy to bring the mainsail over with a bang if you let her fall off too much and the result of that would probably be to tear the mast out of her its considerably worse when theres a big sea coming along behind  frank glanced astern the sun had gone and the sky was strewn with ranks of hurrying clouds while the sea was flecked with smears of white  arent you pressing her a little harry asked shed be easier on the helm if we lowered the peak or tied a reef in  id like to pick up the hootalquin reef before its dark answered mr oliver im not sure well get very much farther tonight you wanted a sail and i fancy youre going to be gratified  during the next hour frank had to admit that this remark was warranted the breeze steadily freshened and there was no doubt that the sea was rising it frothed in a white hillock on either side of the boat and little trails of foam swirled about her deck frank could see that she was overburdened by the sail she was carrying but mr oliver still sat with a set face at the tiller and showed no desire to leave his post in the meanwhile it was getting dark forest and beach had faded to a faint shadowy blur and there was only a steadily narrowing stretch of foaming water in front of them frank was very wet and the spray beat upon him continually at length when the light had almost gone a dusky patch of something grew out of the gathering gloom ahead and fancying it to be a rocky point he felt considerably relieved because there would be shelter behind it a minute or two later mr oliver called to the boys  get forward and ease the peak down he ordered then back the jib well tie two reefs in  arent we going in here harry asked  his father shook his head no its too dark i could take her through in the daylight but there are one or two rocks in the channel well have to try for banningtons  frank felt a twinge of disappointment banningtons was still a good way off and it seemed to him that the gale was increasing every moment he scrambled forward with harry however and when they loosened the rope the tall peak of the sail swung down soon after they had done this mr oliver put down his helm causing the mainboom to jerk and thrash to and fro furiously while as the boat came up head to wind a white sea struck her side and foamed on board her  handy with the throat shouted mr oliver i dont want to leave the helm  they slacked another rope making the gaff sink farther down after which they tied up about a yard of the inner bottom corner of the sail to the foot of the mast this was comparatively easy but it was different when standing in the water on the lee deck they grabbed the tackle beneath the boom and endeavored to pull the leach or outer edge of the mainsail down it would not come and the heavy spar struck them as it jerked in board flinging frank off into the well  get another pull on your topping lift ordered mr oliver  they jumped forward to do it but it proved no easy task for they had to raise the outer end of the heavy boom they were struggling with the tackle again when mr oliver laid both hands on the rope  now he shouted heave and bowse her down  they succeeded this time and afterward hung out over the water while they knotted the reefpoints beneath the spar then when they had trimmed the jib over mr oliver put up his helm and the sloop drove on again into the darkness with shortened sail  the boys sat down as far under the side deck as they could get out of the worst of the spray with the dog crouching in the water which washed about the floorings at their feet  why didnt your father help us more than he did frank asked presently  he couldnt leave the tiller for more than a moment or two said harry when jake and i reefed her the day we took you off the steamer there wasnt as much wind of course there are boats in which you can lash the helm but thats not always possible if dad had let go the tiller shed have fallen off and started sailing which would have dragged the tackle from our hands or pitched us in and then shed have come up again banging and shaking he kept her heading so that the mainsail was lifting slack with no weight in it  frank was commencing to realize that the handling of a sailboat was rather a fine art it is as much of a machine as a steamer but it is also of the kind whose efficiency depends directly upon the human eye hand and brain man has evolved a number of such instruments and in the right hands they are far more wonderful than the others any one for instance can learn the pianola but to extract fine music from a cremona violin is a very different matter  it blew steadily harder and there was as frank noticed a difference in the sea for the flood stream was now setting up against them and was growing shorter and more turbulent there was a smaller interval between the waves which seemed to become steeper and less regular they curled over and broke about the boat with a sound that reacted unpleasantly upon franks nerves and he was thankful that he could after all see very little of them the sloops motion also changed one moment she seemed to be moving almost slowly and the next she swung up in a quick savage rush with her bows in the air and the white foam boiling high about her sometimes too there was a thud and a splash astern and the decks were swept by a deluge of seething water  in the meanwhile the boys had contrived to light a lamp in a little box which held a compass and they laid it on the thwart before mr oliver though as he explained in a word or two it was particularly difficult to steer an exact course in a sea of that kind it was on the boats quarter that is she was traveling with the wind almost behind her at a long slant across the course of the waves but each time an extra big wave foamed up astern mr oliver let her fall off and run right down wind with it to prevent its breaking on board  frank wondered how he did it for the seas were following them and it was quite dark but mr oliver had no need to look around he had for guides the sound of the oncoming seas the pull of the tiller and the motion of the boat and besides from long experience his brain worked subconsciously he did not pause to consider when the bows climbed out and the stern sank down in a rush of foam and had he done so in all probability he would have brought the big mainboom smashing over to run a foreandaft rigged craft and a sloop in particular before a badly breaking sea is a difficult and somewhat perilous thing and the ability to do it comes only from long acquaintance with the water and perhaps from something in the helmsmans nature  the boat sped on furiously though they presently lowered the peak down to reduce the sail further and by degrees frank became conscious of an unpleasant nervous tension that seemed to sap away his hardihood there was nothing to do in the meanwhile but he felt that if he were called upon for any difficult or hazardous service he would find himself incapable of it he was drenched and shivering and he did not want to move he only wished to cower beside harry under the partial shelter of the coaming this was however a feeling that other folks occasionally experience who go to sea in small vessels which they have to grapple with and overcome it is when there is no particular call on him and he can only stand by and watch that terror gets its strongest hold on the heart of a man  at length mr oliver called to the boys we must be close abreast of banningtons he said the end of the point should be to leeward get forward harry where you can see out beneath the jib  frank followed his companion as he crawled up on the little deck he did not want to seem afraid but he held on tight with one hand when they knelt in the water that splashed about them he could see the frothy seas beneath the black curve of the jib but for what seemed a very long while there was nothing else then harry suddenly raised his voice  points right ahead he sang out and the next moment jumped to his feet theres a black patch a little to weather  up peak for your lives cried mr oliver  he left the helm with a bound and all three struggled desperately with a rope while as the bagged mainsail extended and straightened out a sea broke on board the boat then they floundered aft and dragged in the mainsheet with all their might after which mr oliver jumped for the helm again while the boys flattened in the jib  were the wrong side of the point gasped harry im not sure shell beat round it  there was no difficulty in imagining what was likely to happen if she failed to do so and frank who did not think she would last long if she washed up among the boulders before the sea that was running clung to the coaming in a state of tense suspense what seemed to be a continuous sheet of spray whirled about him the boat slanted over at an alarming angle with half her lee deck in the sea and the tops of the confused breaking waves through which she plunged washed all over her this was sailing with a vengeance and a very different thing from lounging at the tiller while she swung smoothly across the water before a fair wind she was now thrashing to windward for her life with the full weight of the sea on her weather bow and a foamswept reef lying in wait close to lee of her and whether she would claw off it or not depended largely upon her helmsmans skill  frank could see him dimly a black shape gripping the tiller and he was unpleasantly aware of the fact that there would speedily be an end of them all if he lost his nerve for a moment or made a blunder it happens now and then at sea that the safety of crew and vessel hangs upon the brute strength of human muscle and the simple valor which enables a man to do what is required of him on the moment without flinching empty assurance and a consequential air are of uncommonly little service then such occasions are a very grim test of manhood and as a rule it is not the loud talker who best stands that strain  frank admitted afterward that he was badly scared which was not in the least unnatural it was more important that he should nevertheless realize that it was his business to trim the jib over when this was necessary his companion who was gazing to leeward presently raised his voice  broken water close ahead he announced  stand by your jib shouted mr oliver we must try to heave her around  frank let the lee sheet run groping deep in the water for it as mr oliver put down the helm and with a frantic thrashing of canvas the sloop came up into the wind there was a moment of suspense during which she seemed to stop and the boy felt his heart thumping furiously he knew that if she fell off again on the previous tack nothing could save her from going ashore suddenly he heard harry call to him  haul it up he shouted we have to box her off  frank hauled with all his might and the thrashing of the head sail ceased it caught the wind and a sea fell upon the boat as the bows swung around then they jumped to the opposite side of her and struggled desperately to haul the lee sheet in as she forged ahead again after which there was nothing to do but wait and wonder if she was driving in toward the shore or working out toward open water they stood on for half an hour seeing nothing and then came round halfswamped only to stagger away on the opposite tack running once more into horribly broken water as they did so harry shouted that there were boulders the end of the point he fancied close to lee  she wont come about in the rabble said mr oliver  it was evident that they must now either scrape around the point on that tack or go ashore and frank felt his nerves tingle as he gazed into the spray he fancied that there was something black and solid beyond it but could distinguish nothing further then the blackness faded the sea seemed to become a little more regular and harry cried out hoarsely were round  down peak called mr oliver well have to jibe her  frank had learned that to jibe a boat is to turn her around stern to wind instead of headon which is the usual way and scrambling forward with harry he helped lower the peak after that they again floundered aft leaving the mainsail reduced in size and grabbed the sheet as mr oliver put up his helm the bows swung around as the boat went up with a sea and the big boom tilted high up into the darkness above the boys they struggled savagely with the sheet which slightly restrained it until the boat rolled suddenly down upon her side as the sail jerked over and the rope was torn swiftly through their hands there was a crash and a bang and frank was conscious that the water was pouring over the coaming he clung to the sheet however and while mr oliver helped them with one hand they got a little of it in after which the sloop rising somewhat drove forward a few minutes later the sea suddenly became smoother the wind seemed cut off and frank made out a black mass of rock rising close above them they ran on beneath it until mr oliver rounding the boat up bade them pitch the anchor over     chapter xi  mr barclay joins the party   when the boat brought up to her anchor the boys spent some time straightening up her gear and pumping her out the work put a little warmth into them but they were glad to crawl into the cabin when it was done there was scarcely room in it to sit upright and with the moisture standing beaded everywhere it looked rather like the inside of a well mr oliver had lighted the stove and a lamp was burning by and by he took off a hissing kettle and when they had made a meal they lay down in their wet clothes amidst a raffle of more or less dripping ropes and sails fortunately the place was warm and frank was thankful to stretch himself out along the side of the boat he was discovering that mental strain of the kind he had undergone during the last few hours is as fatiguing as bodily labor  but he did not immediately go to sleep the craft rocked upon the long swell which worked in round the point with now and then a sharp rattle as she plucked hard at her cable sometimes she swung suddenly around upon it as an eddying blast swept down from the rocks above and the drumming of the halliards against the mast broke continuously through the moan of the wind among the trees ashore and the deeper rumble of the ground sea at last however he fell into a heavy slumber and it was daylight and harry had put the spider on the stove when he awoke again he made his breakfast before he went out on deck to find that the wind had dropped a little and it was raining hard the dim slategreen water lapped noisily upon the wall of rock close by and glancing seaward he saw nothing but a leaden haze and a short stretch of tumbling combers mr oliver had gone out earlier and was standing on the deck looking about him  theres no great weight in the wind though the seas still rather high he said presently i think we can push on for victoria  frank who fancied they would not get there before that night was by no means so keen about the sail as he had been on the previous day he felt that it would be considerably pleasanter to remain in the shelter of the point until the sun came out or the wind went down and it seemed to him that harry shared his opinion the dog also looked very draggled and miserable and had evidently had enough of the voyage they however set the mainsail leaving the reefs in hauled up the anchor and hoisted the jib as the sloop stretched out across the waste of tumbling water after which the boys went below to straighten up the breakfast things frank once or twice felt a little sick as he did so and he noticed that harry wore a somewhat anxious look  its not blowing as hard as it was when we ran in but i dont think dad would have gone unless hed some particular reason harry said at length i wonder who the man is he expects to meet in victoria because im inclined to believe its not the one who wants him to look at the land the worst of dad is that he keeps such a lot to himself  they crawled out again shortly afterward and found the seas getting longer and bigger once or twice a blur of something went by that might have been the end of an island and mr oliver changed his course a little but after that the dim green water stretched away before them empty and only broken by smears of snowy froth and the sloop drove on before the combers which came up out of the haze astern of her in long succession  it was toward noon and mr oliver had gone into the cabin to get dinner ready leaving harry at the helm when glancing around frank saw an indistinct mass of something break out of the mist it grew into the shadowy shape of a steamer while he watched it  theres a big vessel close by he said touching his companions arm  harry glanced over his shoulder sure he nodded whats more shes coming right along our track get in some mainsheet while i luff her  he changed the sloops course a trifle but in the meanwhile the steamer was growing in size and distinctness with a marvelous rapidity her great bow seemed to be rising out of the water like a headland over which frank could just see the tiers of white deckhouses one mast and the tall smokestack then he glanced forward at the sloops wet deck and the low strip of her doublereefed mainsail looking very small among the tumbling seas and it occurred to him that it would probably be difficult for the steamers lookout to see them he felt rather anxious when he glanced back astern  she still seems to be coming right down on us he said  harry called his father who hurried out and glanced at the vessel  shall we get up and yell the boy asked  no said mr oliver curtly they couldnt hear you to windward let her come up farther  frank helped drag some more mainsheet and then looked around again with a very unpleasant thrill of apprehension the black bow seemed almost above them and the sea leaped against a wall of plates as the great mass of iron swung slowly out of it and sank down again then from somewhere beside the smokestack a streak of white steam blew out and a great reverberatory roar came hurtling about them mr olivers anxious face relaxed  theyve seen us he said her helms going over  the bow drew out and lengthened into an increasing strip of side another mast became visible with a double row of white deckhouses and a tier of boats between here and there a cluster of diminutive figures showed up among them and then the great ship sped by with the whole of her size revealed the sloop plunged madly on her screwtorn wake but in another minute or two she had drawn away and was melting into the haze again  a big boat said mr oliver she was very close to us you had better keep your eyes open while i get dinner  the rest of the dismal day passed uneventfully but toward evening the haze commenced to roll aside and they saw blurred black pines looming up ahead of them a little later they ran into victoria harbor and hiring a siwash to take them ashore walked through the streets of what struck frank as a very handsome city until they reached a hotel here they ordered supper and after the meal was over the boys who had changed their clothes sat with mr oliver in the almost deserted smoking room he seemed to be expecting somebody which somewhat astonished frank but he noticed that harry smiled meaningly when mr barclay walked in he was dressed in lightcolored sporting garments with a belt around his waist and a leather patch on one shoulder and there were gaudy trout flies stuck in his little cloth cap he threw the cap on the table before he shook hands with mr oliver and the boys smiling as he caught harrys eye  well he asked indicating the flies what do you think of them  harry grinned again as he laid his finger on one  youre not going to get many trout with that fellow unless theyve different habits in british columbia they wont come on for quite a while  mr barclay removed the fly and put it into a wallet  thanks he said its some time since i did any fishing then he seemed to notice the manner in which the boy was surveying his clothing its a sports getup but are you acquainted with any reason why a united states citizen shouldnt get a little innocent amusement catching canadian trout  no sir answered harry coolly still there are quite a few trout in the rivers on the american side of the boundary it makes one wonder if you had anything else in view besides fishing in coming to british columbia  mr barclay regarded him with an air of ironical reproof  in a general way young man its most unwise to blurt the thing right out when you have a suspicion in your mind its better to let it stay there until you have good cause to act on it he turned to mr oliver im inclined to doubt the advisability of leaving your sloop lying where she is in full view of the wharf  then you recognized her  at a glance the trouble is that there are one or two acquaintances of yours who might do the same  mr oliver looked thoughtful  ive been considering that but it was getting dark when we ran in and we had better move the first thing tomorrow now with this unsettled weather im not very keen on sailing up the west coast which is open to the pacific and the place we are bound for is rather a long way  then go east advised mr barclay there are a number of inlets on that side of the island within easy reach of the railroad and you ought to reach the nearest of them in a few hours ill go on with the cars tomorrow and if you dont get in at one of the way stations ill wait for you at wellington then we could cross to the west coast by the alberni stage and hire a couple of indians and a sea canoe it wouldnt be a long run from there  mr oliver agreed to this and getting up early next morning they slipped out of the harbor and some hours afterward crept into a forestgirt inlet where they left the sloop there was a depot nearby and getting on board the cars when the next train came in they found mr barclay awaiting them early in the afternoon they alighted at a little wooden colliery town and next day they crossed the island in the stage over a very rough trail which led through tremendous forests once they passed a wonderful blue lake lying deepsunk between steep walls of hills then they crossed a divide and came winding down into a valley with water flashing at the foot of it it was evening when they arrived at a straggling settlement on the banks of a riband of salt water twisting away among the forestshrouded hills and found several indians there who had come up in their sea canoes  mr oliver hired a couple of them and they started after they had purchased a few stores a light pinescented breeze was blowing down the valley when they thrust the canoe off from the shingle they had no sooner done so however when the dog arose with a deep growl which indicated that he objected to the indians going with them as his actions did not seem to have the desired effect he seized the nearest indian by the leg and it was only when harry belabored him with a paddle that he could be induced to let go then he barked at them savagely until frank drew him down upon his knee with a hand about his neck while the siwash raised two little masts in the meanwhile the boy watched the men with interest and decided that they had very little in common with the prairie indians he had seen in pictures and from the cars  they were dressed neatly in clothes which had evidently been purchased at a store and though their faces were brown and their hair rather coarse and dark there was nothing else unusual about them they talked with mr oliver and mr barclay freely in what harry said was chinook a readily learned linguafranca in use on parts of the pacific slope then frank fixed his attention upon the canoe a long narrow and beautifully shaped craft with the usual tall birdshead bow she was rather shallow but harry said that this made her paddle fast he added that though these canoes would sail reasonably well when the breeze was fair the indians usually drove them to windward with the paddle unless the sea was too heavy in which case they generally made for the beach and pulled the craft out  frank remembered that this or something like it was the ancient practice and that it was only by slow degrees that man had discovered he could still make the wind propel his vessel to its destination when it blew from ahead greek and roman triremes alexandrian wheat ships and viking galleys had made wonderful voyages and they all carried sail but they set it only when the wind was fair when it drew ahead they stowed their canvas and thrashed the lean hull through the seas with their long oars now after perfecting his vessels underwater body inventing the center board and learning how to make flatsetting sails man was going back to the oldtime plan only that instead of relying upon the muscle of closepacked rowers he used improved propellers tricompound reciprocators and turbines  one of the siwash shook out the two spritsails which sat on a pole stretching up to the peak from the foot of the mast and when he had led the sheets aft his companion knelt astern with a paddle held over the gunwale slanting gently down to the faint breeze the craft slid away through the smooth green water with a long ripple running back behind her the log houses dropped astern and were lost among the trees a valley filled with somber forest and a rampart of tall hillside slipped by and as they crept on from point to point the strip of still water stretched away before them between somber ranks of climbing trees  frank had no idea how far they had gone when the light began to fail though he fancied that the shallow craft now slipping forward so smoothly was sailing a good deal faster than she seemed to be at length one of the siwash loosened the sheets and stowed the sails while his companion turned the bows toward the beach she slid in and grounded gently on a bank of shingle in a little cove where a gigantic forest crept down to the water they got out and ran her up filled their kettle at a tinkling creek hewed resinous chips from a fallen fir and built a fire then they cut armfuls of thin spruce branches with which to make their beds and presently sat down to an ample supper  when it was over the indians went down to the canoe and mr oliver and mr barclay drew a little apart from the boys frank lying near harry beneath a big cedar raised himself up on one elbow and watched the firelight flicker upon the mighty trunks on the one hand they were lost in the gloom of the dense mass of dusky foliage but on the other their great branches cut against the sky which was still softly blue and a blaze of silver radiance stretched across the water for a halfmoon had just sailed up above the opposite hill out of the silence there stole a faint whispering from the tops of the taller trees and the languid lapping of water among the stones but there was no other sound and once more frank was glad that he had not exchanged the stillness of the wilderness for the turmoil of the cities he had now definitely decided to become a rancher  it grew colder by and by and wrapping his blanket around him he wriggled down closer among the yielding spruce twigs the great trunks grew dimmer and the smoke wisps which drifted among them became less distinct by degrees they all grew mixed togethera confusion of sliding vapor and spectral treesand he was conscious of nothing more     chapter xii  the stranger   a couple of days later the party pitched their camp in the depths of a lonely valley sloping to the pacific which was not far away it was filled with great redwoods balsams and cedars and as frank gazed at the endless rows of towering trunks it struck him as curious that mr olivers friend should think of buying this tract of giant forest for ranching land he said so to harry who laughed  theres no rock or gravel on it and that counts for a good deal said his companion if the soil looks as if it would grow things its about all the average man expects on this side of the rockies a few trees more or less dont matter its the same with us right down the pacific slope the only difference is that on this island the firs seem just a little bigger he appeared to admit the latter fact reluctantly adding i guess thats because its wetter in canada  they were standing outside a little tent of the kind most often used in the western bush it was supported by a ridge pole resting at either end upon two more which were spread well apart at the bottom and crossed near the top a short branch stay stretched back from each pair and a few turns of cord lashing held the whole frame together they had cut the poles in five minutes in the bush and had brought the light cotton cover with them rolled up in a bundle a good many men in that country live in such shelters during most of the year mr barclay sat on one of the hearth logs which were rolled close together in front of the tent and mr oliver stood in the entrance  but the place must be such a tremendous way from a market said frank in response to harrys last remark  mr oliver smiled its not long since i tried to explain that a good many of the bush ranchers have to wait until the market comes to them they stake their dollars and a number of years of hard work on the future of the country  some of them get badly left now and then said mr barclay dryly youll find laidout townsites that have never grown up all along the pacific slope there are stores and hotels falling to pieces in one or two ive struck then changing the subject are you boys coming across with me to the river for some fishing tomorrow  they said that they would be glad to do so and mr barclay turned to mr oliver well give you another two days to finish your surveying and then well meet you at the rancherie on the inlet we spoke of we can camp in the bush outside the tent for a couple of nights  they started early the next morning taking one indian with them to pack their provisions and the dog who insisted on accompanying them they were plodding along a hillside toward noon when mr barclay who was walking in front with their guide looked back at the boys  get hold of the dog as soon as we stop and keep him quiet he cautioned  after that they moved forward in silence for some minutes while the trees grew thinner ahead of them until mr barclay stopped behind a brake of undergrowth the dog broke into a short throaty bark and then growled hoarsely until frank knelt beside him and laid a hand upon his collar when he had quieted the animal who by degrees had become attached to him he arose and found he could look down upon a narrow slit of valley into which the sunlight poured a creek swirled through the bottom of it and he was astonished to see a swarm of blueclad figures toiling with grubhoe and shovel upon its banks and a cluster of bark shelters in the widest part of the hollow  chinamen he said what can they be doing one never would have expected to find a colony of them here  mr barclay smiled in a somewhat curious fashion  theyre washing gold its a remarkably simple process if youre willing to work hard enough you shovel out the soil and sand and keep on washing it until its all washed away any gold there is remains in the bottom of the pan  but if theres gold in that creek how is it there are no white men about  probably because they couldnt make wages theres a little gold in a number of the creeks right down the slope but where the quantitys very small nobody but a chinaman finds it worth while to look for it  mr barclay sat down and spent some minutes apparently carefully watching the blueclad figures toiling in the sunlight below after which he got up and signaled for them to go on again the boys however dropped a little behind and presently harry gave his companion a nudge  i guess you noticed that when you said one wouldnt have expected to find those chinamen here barclay didnt answer it  yes said frank thoughtfully i suppose you mean he wasnt astonished when he saw them  youve hit it first time harry assented that mans on the trail and though i cant tell you exactly who hes getting after ive my ideas he paused with a chuckle im not sure now hes quite so much of a stuffed image as he seemed to be  frank said nothing in answer to this a few minutes later harry touched his arm as mr barclay turning suddenly shouted  get hold of the dog  frank grabbed at the animals collar but missed it and the next moment the dog had vanished then there was a crash in the bush and a beautiful slender creature with long legs and little horns shot out from behind a thicket and flung itself high into the air it fell again this time with scarcely a sound into a clump of fern rose out of it and in a wonderful bound cleared a fallen trunk with broken branches projecting from it then it was lost in another thicket and the dogs harsh barking rang through the silence of the woods once or twice again frank caught a momentary glimpse of a marvelously agile creature rising and falling among the undergrowth and then there was only the yelping of the dog which became fainter and fainter and finally broke out at irregular intervals mr barclay sat down upon the fallen trees  i suppose well have to wait until that amiable pet of yours comes back he said on the whole its fortunate the deer broke out now instead of a quarter of an hour earlier  they waited a considerable time before the dog crept up to them wagging his ragged tail in a disappointed manner harry shook his fishing rod at him threateningly  id lay into you good only it wouldnt be any use he said the more youre whacked the worse you get  the dog wagged his tail again and jumped upon frank who patted him before they resumed the march  its rather curious but thats the first deer ive seen since ive been in the country he said do they always jump like that  well said harry in a general way they are quite hard to see and you can walk right past one without noticing it when its standing still their colors match the trunks and the fern and whats more important its not often you can see the whole of them in fact ive struck as many deer by accident as ive done when ive been trailing them now and then you almost walk right up to one though i havent the least notion how it is they dont hear you because as a rule the one youre trailing will leave you out of sight in a few moments if you snap a twig anyway a scared deer goes over whatever lies in front of him there are very few things he cant jump and he comes down almost without a sound  the rest of the journey proved uneventful and early in the evening they made camp on the banks of a frothing river which swept out of the shadow crystal clear in this it differed as harry explained from most of the larger ones on the pacific slope which are usually fed by melted snow and stained a faint green mr barclay whose boots and clothes were already considerably the worse for wear sat down beside a swirling pool and took out his pipe  theres no use pitching a fly across it yet i suppose he said we may as well get supper before we start  the siwash prepared the meal and remained behind with mr barclay when it was over while the two boys went down stream with a rod he had lent them which harry insisted frank should take there were he urged plenty of trout in the river near his fathers ranch though it was very seldom he had leisure to go after them they wandered on some distance beside the water which ran almost west toward the pacific and wherever the forest was a little thinner the slanting sunrays streaming between the serried trunks smote along it frank who had as it happened once or twice got a week or twos fishing in the east kept his eyes open but it was only twice that he fancied he noticed the faint dimple made by a shortrising trout  id have expected to find a river of this kind thick with fish he said  theres sure to be a good many in it answered harry you wait about another half hour  whats the matter with starting now urged frank isnt that one rising in the slack yonder  see if you can get him said harry smiling  frank swung the rod straining every effort to make a neat clean cast and he succeeded the flies dropped lightly about a foot above the dimple made by the fish and swept down stream across the spot where he had reason to suppose it was waiting there was no response however and nothing broke the rippling surface when the flies floated down a second time frank laid down the rod  its curious he murmured  harry laughed hold on a little youve seen three fish rising now and thats quite out of the common  frank sat down again and waited until the sunlight faded off the river and the firs about it suddenly grew blacker soon afterward what seemed an almost solid cloud of tiny insects drifted along the surface of the water which was immediately broken by multitudinous splashes  now you can begin said harry  frank clambering to a ledge of rock swung his rod and as the flies swept across an eddy there was a splash and a swirl and a sudden tightening of the line he got the butt down as the winch commenced to clink and harry waded out into the stream lower down holding his wide hat  let him run but keep a strain on he cried youve got a big one  the fish fought for three or four minutes gleaming a streak of silver through the shadowy flood as it showed its side then sprang clear and changed again to a halfseen dusky shape that drove violently here and there then it came up toward the bending point of the rod and at length harry slipping his hat beneath it lifted it out  nearly three quarters of a pound he said your trace is clear now try again and never mind about the slack and eddies pitch your flies anywhere  frank did so and they had scarcely fallen when there was a second rush but this fish seemed smaller and he dragged it out unceremoniously upon the shingle it was the same the next cast and for a while he was kept desperately busy when at length he laid the rod down harry announced that they had a dozen fish  well try the next pool now he added some of these trout arent half a pound and id like you to get a real big one  the next pool proved to be some distance away and there was nothing but rock and foaming water between but when they reached a slacker place where the current circled around a deep basin frank had four or five more minutes fishing during which he landed several trout then the flies seemed to vanish and there was scarcely a splash on the shadowy water  you may as well put the rod up harry advised its a sure thing you wont get another  frank tried for a few minutes but finding his companions prediction justified sat down near him among the roots of a big fir at the foot of the pool where he had been fishing the stream swept furiously between big scattered boulders in a wild white rapid it was narrower there and a ledge of rock slightly hollowed out underneath rose above it on the side on which they sat a little more than a hundred yards away the woods were now darkening fast and the chill of the dew was in the air which was heavy with the scent of redwood and cedar in places the water still glimmered faintly and except for the roar it made everything was very still  suddenly harry pointed to the dog who was lying near frank  get hold of him he said in a low voice if nothing else will keep him quiet well roll your jacket round his head  frank who had taken off his jacket which was badly torn when he began fishing laid his hand on the dog as it arose with a low growl then as it tried to break away from him he seized its collar and held on with all his might while harry flung the jacket over it though the thing cost them an effort they managed to hold the animal still between them in the meanwhile there was a crackle of undergrowth and frank saw a man who walked in a rather curious manner move out from the shadow even when he was clear of the overhanging branches it was impossible to see him distinctly but frank recognized him with a start there was something wrong with one of the dark figures shoulders  the man moved on away from them until he stopped at the edge of the overhanging rock where he stood for a moment or two then he leaped out suddenly and alighted on the top of a boulder about which the white froth whirled frank fancied that only a very powerful person could have safely made such a leap and there was no doubt that whatever it was that had caused the mans unusual gait it had not affected his agility the next moment he jumped again and coming down rather more than kneedeep in the rapid floundered through it and vanished into the shadow beneath the trees then harry looked around at his companion with a smile  ill own up that barclays smart after all he said hes sure on the trail anyway perhaps wed better head back to camp in case some more of them come along  it was quite dark when they reached the fire the siwash had made and found mr barclay who now seemed rather wet as well as ragged sitting beside it with his pipe in his hand when they had compared their fish with those he had killed they lay down among the withered needles on the opposite side of the fire  its good fishing sir but you must be very keen to come so far for it said harry looking up innocently at mr barclay  the red light of the fire was on mr barclays face and frank saw that he glanced thoughtfully at harry  it certainly is he answered i believe you have already said something very much like your last remark still you see i dont propose to come often  frank suppressed a chuckle if harry had intended to surprise the man into some admission he had not succeeded yet  and we go on to the rancherie in a couple of days harry added from what the indians told me i dont think wed get any fishing there wouldnt it be better to stay here a little longer  no said mr barclay quite apart from the difficulty of sending your father word what you suggest doesnt strike me as advisable for one or two reasons  harry seemed to realize that he was making no progress and looking meaningly at frank suddenly changed his tactics  theres something i should perhaps have told you sir though i dont know whether it will interest you anyway not long ago frank and i were up at the chinese colony behind the settlement near our ranch perhaps you have been there  ive heard of it said barclay dryly  then in a few words harry described how the man they had endeavored to trail had vanished at the chinamans shack and frank saw a look of eager interest cross mr barclays usually stolid face  you suggest that the fellow didnt want you to see him he asked  that was certainly how it struck me  and he walked rather curiously and one shoulder seemed a little higher than the other i think you mentioned that  i did repeated harry  mr barclay seemed to reflect but there was now sign of deeper interest in his expression  did you notice whether he had red hair and gray eyes  no said harry with a grin though i cant be sure about it ive a notion that his hair was dark as it happened i only saw his back but id know the man again he paused impressively in fact i hadnt the least trouble about it when i saw him half an hour ago  mr barclay started and there was no doubt that he was astonished at this  you ran up against him here  no said harry i only watched him from behind a fir he crossed the creek heading south and didnt notice us  mr barclay settled back again and seemed lost in thought after all he said shortly its possible  then he changed the subject and they talked about fishing until the fire died down when they spread their blankets upon their couches of soft spruce twigs     chapter xiii  the schooner reappears   it was early in the evening when after a toilsome march mr barclay and the boys reached a siwash rancherie built just above highwater mark on the pebbly beach of a sheltered inlet frank had already discovered that the northern part of the pacific slope is a land of majestic beauty but he had so far seen nothing quite so wild and rugged as the surroundings of the indian dwelling behind it a great rock fell almost sheer leaving only room for a breadth of shingle between its feet and the strip of clear green water on the opposite side mighty firs climbed the face of a towering hill so steep that frank wondered how they clung to it and at the head of the tremendous chasm a crystal stream came splashing out of eternal shadow seaward a wet reef guarded the inlets mouth with its outer edge hidden by spouts of snowy foam upon which the big pacific rollers broke continually ranging up in tall green walls and crumbling upon the stony barrier with a deep vibratory roar which rang in long pulsations across the stately pines  the rancherie was a long and rather ramshackle singlestoried wooden building not unlike a frame barn only lower and frank discovered that although it was inhabited by the whole siwash colony there were no divisions in it but each inmate or family claimed its allotted space upon the floor a tall pole rudely carved with grotesque figures stood in front of it and it occurred to frank as he inspected them that he was face to face with the rudiments of heraldry the nobles of ancient europe he remembered blazoned devices of this kind upon their shields and their descendants still painted their lions and griffins and eagles upon their carriages and stamped them upon their note paper he was probably right in his surmises though there are different views upon the subject of totem poles and the siwash who ought to know most about them seem singularly unwilling to supply inquirers with any reliable information  a group of brownfaced blackhaired men and women dressed much as white folks stood about the rancherie and near them were ranged rows of shallow trays of bark containing drying berries frank noticed that the woods were full of the latterhat berries salmon berries and splendid black and yellow raspberries several big sea canoes were drawn up at the edge of the water and mr oliver sat near one of them with another cluster of siwash gathered about him they had spread a number of peltries out upon the stones which mr oliver explained were seal skins frank examined one and found it difficult to believe that this coarse greasy and nastily smelling hair was the material out of which the beautiful glossy furs were made he confided his views to harry  yes said the latter theyre not much to look at now they have to go through quite a lot of dressing and ive heard that in the first place all the long outside hair is plucked out theres an inner coat he looked at the men its done in england isnt it  mr barclay smiled a good deal of it is anyway then he addressed mr oliver youre buying some of these peltries  one or two was the answer we want an excuse for this visit  mr barclay made a sign of assent and after chaffering with the indians for a few moments mr oliver broke in again theyre cheap thats sure i suppose these fellows would rather sell them on the spot for dollars down than pack them along down to alberni or some other place where theyd probably have to take grocery stores in payment if youre open to make a deal well take two or three between us we ought to get our money back with something over in victoria  mr oliver kept up the bargaining for a while and then explained that he and his companion did not care for the rest of the skins which were inferior to those they had chosen one of the siwash thereupon informed him that more canoes were expected in a day or two adding that he would probably be able to show them further peltries if they could wait their arrival  tell him well stay said mr barclay at the same time you had better ask him if theres any likelihood of our getting down to victoria by water you can say weve had about enough crawling through the bushits a fact that i haveand lead up to the question naturally  frank observing a twinkle in harrys eyes watched the indians faces when mr oliver addressed them but they remained perfectly expressionless  i cant get anything out of them about the schooner mr oliver reported at length this fellow says the easiest way would be to send our indians back for the canoe which ill do its possible that we may chance upon a little more information later on  where do they get the skins frank asked presently when the indians had left them  thats a point they dont seem much inclined to talk about mr barclay answered they probably follow them in their canoes as they work up north though its only odd seals they pick up in that way the principal supply comes from the pribyloff islands up in the bering sea its supposed that with the exception of a few which frequent some reefs lying nearer russian asia practically all the seals in the north pacific haul out there for two or three months every year the american lessees club them on the land but the crews of the canadian schooners kill a number in open water outside our limit they claim that although the seals are born on american beaches we dont own them when theyre in the sea but as its suggested that theyre not always very particular about their exact distance from the islands their proceedings make trouble every now and then im talking about the fur seals there are several other kinds which are more or less common everywhere  he broke off and sat smoking silently for a while looking at the skins  they seem to have taken your fancy mr oliver observed presently  its a fact mr barclay assented i was just thinking id like to take that big one and the other yonder home with me my daughter minnie visits east in the winter now and then and shes fond of furs though so far i havent been able to buy her any particularly smart ones theres a man i know in portland who can fix up a skin as well as any one in london he was a good many years in alaska trading furs for the a c c and some of the russians who stayed behind there taught him to dress them  mr oliver laughed i suppose the thing is quite out of the question  it is said mr barclay dryly you ought to know that the united states charges a big duty on foreign furs  on foreign ones broke in harry nudging frank a seal born on an american beach could certainly be considered an american seal  when you import goods into the united states you require a certificate of origin young man  that fixes the thing said harry on your own showing those seals originated on the pribyloffs theyre american  ingenious exclaimed mr barclay with a longing glance at the skins theres some reason in that contention but wont you go on you dont seem to have got through yet  in case you felt justified in taking a skin or two continued harry thoughtfully id like to point out that as a rule the customs fellows dont trouble about a sloop the size of ours we just run up to our moorings when we come back from a yachting trip and theres a nice little nook forward which would just hold a bundle of those peltries its hidden beneath the second cable  mr barclay picked up a piece of shingle and flung it at him  you can stop right now before you get yourself into difficulties what do you mean by proposing a smuggling deal to a man connected with the united states revenue  im sorry harry answered with a chuckle i should have waited until the rest had gone  mr barclay regarded him severely though his eyes twinkled  your smartness is going to make trouble for you by and by he said go and see what that siwash is doing about our supper  harry moved away but presently came back to announce that the meal was ready when it was over the boys strolled off toward the reef leaving the men sitting smoking on the beach  that boy of yours told me what seemed a rather curious thing last night said mr barclay and he briefly ran over what harry had related about the man with the peculiar shoulder  mr oliver listened in evident astonishment  its the first time ive heard of the matter he exclaimed what do you make of it  in the meanwhile i dont quite know what to think if that man is boss of the gang it explains a good deal that has been puzzling me but i must own its considerably more than i expected the general idea was that hed cleared out of the country which would have been a very natural course in view of the fact that hed probably have been sandbagged if hed show himself after dark on any wharf of two of the coast states anyway your sons description was quite straight he seemed sure of him  harrys eyes are as good as yours or mine said mr oliver with a smile mr barclay wrinkled his brow  theres a point that struck methough i cant say if it explains the thing the boys only young yet he has imagination and its possible a fondness for detective literature like the rest of them now well assume that he had heard of a certain sensational casea particularly grewsome crime on board an american shipand the arrest of the rascal accused of it i neednt point out that the fellow only escaped on a technical point of law and that his picture figured in some of the papers isnt that the kind of thing thats likely to make a marked impression on the youthful mind  i can see two objections responded mr oliver in the first place harry was away in idaho while the case was going on the second ones more important harry might try to put the laugh on you as he did not long ago but when he makes a concise statement its to be relied upon in such a case ive never known him to let his imagination run away with him  mr barclay spread his hands out in a deprecatory manner  then well take the thing for granted and it certainly simplifies the affair id no trouble in finding the chinese colony and though ive no idea how they get the dope that doesnt matter the point is that its very seldom anybody is likely to disturb them in this part of the bush and there are two inlets handy a schooner could slip in here a dozen times without being noticed by anybody except the siwash then we have the fact that a notorious rascal who has evidently a hand in the thing was seen heading for the chinese colony it seems to me decisive  what are you going to do about it mr oliver asked  wait and keep my eyes open if it appears advisable i may communicate with the canadian authorities later on though of course we must contrive to get our hands on the fellows in american waters ive an idea it can be done  mr oliver said nothing further and by and by when a thin haze rolled down from the hillside and night closed in they strolled toward the rancherie where they were given a strip of floor space not far from the entrance the boys came in a little later and lay down apart from them and nearer the door but frank did not go to sleep the rancherie was hot and the dull roar of the combers on the reef came throbbing in and made him restless he lay still for what seemed a considerable time and at last there was a low sound which might have been made by somebody rising stealthily after which a dim black object flitted out of the door then harry who lay close to him touched his arm  are you asleep he asked very softly  no answered frank wheres that fellow going  get out as quietly as you can was harrys reply  frank had kept his shirt and trousers on and after feeling for his boots he arose cautiously holding them in his hand in another moment or two he had slipped out into the cool night air and was crossing the shingle in his stockinged feet once or twice a stone rattled but he supposed the sound was lost in the clamor of the reef for nobody seemed to hear it when they had left the rancherie some distance behind they sat down  now said harry ill tell you my idea theyre expecting the schooner and dont want her to run in while were about theyve probably had a man on the lookout down by the entrance and i expect the fellow who went out has been sent by the boss or tyee to learn if the other one has seen her  its curious some of them didnt hear us frank observed thoughtfully  im not sure that they didnt harry admitted anyway they couldnt stop us without some excuse and if im right they certainly wouldnt want to tell us why they wished us to stay in of course he added it might make them suspicious but i dont know any reason why we should point that out to barclay the great thing is to keep out of sight in case they follow us  they put on their boots and crept along in the gloom beneath the rock heading toward the reefs a little breeze blew down the hollow setting the dark firs to sighing and part of the inlet lay black in their shadow the rest sparkled in the light of a halfmoon which had just risen above the crest of the hill they could hear the soft splash and tinkle of water rippling among the stones but now and then this sound was drowned as the roar of the reef grew louder and deeper presently a dim filmy whiteness in front of them resolved itself into a glimmering spray cloud and fountains of spouting foam and when at length they stopped among a cluster of wet boulders they could see a black ridge of rock thrusting itself out half buried into a mad turmoil of frothing water it lay in the shadow of the rock and there was no moonlight on the ghostly combers which came seething down upon it a little outshore however the sea sparkled with a silvery radiance except where the shadow of a black head fell upon it there was not more than a moderate breeze but the pacific surge breaks upon and roars about those reefs continually  a little thrill ran through frank as he leaned upon one of the wet boulders it was the first time he had trodden a pacific beach and he realized that he had now reached the outermost verge of the west he could go no farther the ocean barred his progress and beyond it lay different lands whose darkskinned peoples spoke in other tongues the white mans civilization stopped short where he stood then as he watched the ceaseless shoreward rush of the big combers and looked up at black rock and climbing pines a strange delight in the new life he led crept into his heart dusky shadow and silvery moonlight seemed filled with glamour and he was learning to love the wilderness as he could never have loved the cities besides he was there to watch for the mysterious schooner and that alone was sufficient to stir him and put a tension on his nerves it was more than possible that there were other watchers hidden somewhere in the gloom  he did not know how long they waited with the salt spray stinging their faces and the diapason of the surf in their ears but at last she came breaking upon his sight suddenly and strangely as he felt it was most fitting that she should do her black headsails swept out of the shadow of the neighboring head the tall boomforesail followed and a second later he saw the greater spread of her after canvas she drove on growing larger into a strip of moonlight when for the wind was off the shore he saw her hull hove up on the side toward him with the water flashing beneath it and frothing white at her bows  shes closehauled said harry theyll stretch across to the other side and then put the helm down and let her reach in its a mighty awkward place to make when the winds blowing out  she plunged once more into the shadow but frank could still see her more or less plainlya tall slanted mass of canvas flitting swiftly through the dusky blueness of the night she edged close in with the reef still carrying everything except her main gafftopsail and then as her headsails swept across the entrance the splash of a paddle reached the boys faintly through the clamor of the surf and they heard a hoarse shout  theres a canoe yonder announced harry the siwash in her is hailing them theyve heard him her peaks coming down  a clatter of blocks broke out and the upper half of the tall mainsail suddenly collapsed then the schooners bows swung around a little until they pointed to the seething froth upon the opposite beach  what are they doing frank asked shes going straight ashore  harry laughed excitedly no he said that siwash has told them to clear out again and it will want smart work to get her round in this narrow water theyve dropped the mainsail peak because she wouldnt fall off fast enough  frank watched her eagerly for the next moment or two her bows were swinging around but they were swinging slowly and the beach with the white surf upon it seemed ominously close ahead he saw two black figures go scrambling forward and haul the staysail to windward but she was still forging across the inlet then her bows fell off a little farther the trailing gaff swung out with a bang and frank saw the masts fall into line with him and a bent figure behind the deckhouse struggling with the wheel in another moment her mainsail came over with a crash and she was flitting out to sea again  now cried harry back up the beach for your life were going in swimming  you can do what you like grunted frank im heading straight for the rancherie  after the swim urged harry get a move on and loose your things as you run ill explain later  he ran on flinging off his clothes and plunged into the water when they drew near the rancherie in another moment or two frank waded in after him and was glad he had done so when he heard the soft splash of a canoe paddle somewhere in the gloom he fancied that the siwash would see them which as he realized was what harry had desired they were some distance from the mouth of the inlet and he did not think the schooner would have been visible from the spot which led him to believe that if the indians had noticed their absence their present occupation might serve as an excuse for it  he did not see the canoe reach the beach but in two or three minutes harry suggested that they might as well go out and putting on some of their clothes they made for the rancherie creeping into it softly they lay down and soon afterward went to sleep     chapter xiv  a test of endurance   the boys were sitting on the beach next morning after breakfast when mr oliver looked across at harry who had not yet said anything about their adventures  what were you two doing last night he asked casually  harry started then you heard us  i did said his father you were out of the door before i quite realized what was going on and it didnt seem altogether wise to commence talking when you came back but thats not the point you havent answered my question  we went in swimming harry informed him with a grin  considering that most people would prefer to swim in daylight i wonder if you had any particular reason for choosing the middle of the night mused mr oliver thoughtfully  why yes was harrys answer ive a notion it was rather a good one i wanted the siwash to see us in the water because it would explain the thing there were at least two of them about the beach though only one left the rancherie after we came into it  then the fellow must have gone out a good deal more quietly than you did because i didnt hear him i suppose you felt you had to get after him and see what he was doing  mr barclay smiled and waved his hand  sure he broke in the temptation would be irresistible what else would you expect from two enterprising youngsters like these who have no doubt been studying detective literature and the exploits of other young men in the brave old jayhawking days  a flush crept into harrys face but he answered quietly  well its perhaps as well we went because i can tell you what the siwash were watching for we saw the schooner  mr barclay gave a sudden start and cast a significant glance at mr oliver  the dramatic climax theres no doubt you have sprung it upon us smartly but now you have worked it off you can go ahead with the tale  harry told him what they had seen and when he had finished mr barclay seemed to be considering the matter ponderously then he turned to mr oliver  it seems to me theres nothing more to keep us here  no said the rancher on the other hand it might perhaps be better if we waited until those canoes arriveif its only for the look of the thing  his companion made a sign of agreement and neither one said anything further on the subject the boys lounged about the beach and gathered delicious berries in the woods most of the day and on the following day two more canoes ran in their crews had however traded off their peltries somewhere else and shortly after their arrival mr oliver and his party left the inlet in the canoe which he had sent the indians back to bring the weather had changed in the night and when they paddled down the strip of sheltered water their ears were filled with the clamor of the surf and the hillsides were lost in thin drizzle and sliding mist a filmy spray cloud hung about the entrance and beyond it big gray combers tipped with froth came rolling up in long succession the sight of them affected frank disagreeably and he was not astonished when mr oliver who spoke to one of the indians suggested that he and harry had better help with the spare paddles until they were far enough off shore to get the masts up  frank found it hard enough work for the sea was almost ahead and the canoe lurched viciously pitching her bows out the crag beyond the inlet however still slightly sheltered them and straining at the paddle with the rain in their faces they made shift to drive her over the big graysided ridges though every now and then the frothing top of one came splashing in at length one of the siwash lifted the short mast forward into its place and thrusting in the sprit shook loose the sail his companion who knelt aft gripping a longbladed paddle seized the sheet and the craft gathering speed headed out toward the point to lee of them when she had cleared it the siwash raised a second mast farther aft and setting the sail upon it slacked both sheets after which the canoe drove away at what seemed to frank an astonishing pace as a matter of fact she was traveling very fast for a narrow shallowbodied craft of that kind is very speedy so long as the wind is more or less behind her  sitting with his back against her hoveup weather side he noticed rather uneasily that the opposite one was almost level with the brine then he glanced astern at the combers that followed them and was by no means comforted by the sight they were unlike the short tumbling waves he had seen already in landlocked water for they were larger and longer and swept up with a kind of stately swing until they broke into seething foam their rise and fall seemed measured and they rolled on in their ceaseless march in wellordered ranks it struck him that the canoe was carrying a dangerous press of sail but nobody else appeared disturbed and he admitted that the indians probably knew how much it was safe to spread  isnt she making a great pace he asked of mr oliver who sat nearest him  yes was the answer ive made two or three trips in these canoes but i never saw one driven quite so hard these fellows are probably afraid the breeze will freshen up and want to get as far as possible before it does  they ran on for a couple of hours seeing nothing but the ranks of tumbling combers except at intervals when the haze thinned a little and they made out a shadowy mass which might have been high and rocky land over the port side in the meanwhile the seas were steadily getting bigger and a good deal of water came in at irregular intervals by and by the boys were kept busy bailing it out and the indian who was not steering held the sheet of the larger sail  at length when the tops of two or three seas splashed in over the foamwashed stern in quick succession the helmsman raised his hand and there was a wild thrashing as his companion loosened the aftersheet rolling the sail together he flung the mast down and the canoe ran on with only the forward one set which seemed to frank quite sufficient the sea was on her quarter and each comber that came up boiled about her in a great surge of foam and heaved her up before it left her to sink dizzily into the hollow each time she did so frank was conscious of a curious and unpleasant feeling in his interior  he had however no difficulty in eating his share of the crackers and canned provisions mr oliver presently handed around and after that he was kept too busy bailing to notice anything until late in the afternoon when he heard the two indians muttering to one another the result of the discussion was that one of them pulled the sprit out and folding down the peak left only a small threecornered strip of sail frank understood the cause for this when he glanced at the seas which looked alarmingly big it was disconcerting to realize that they could take no more sail off the canoe unless they lowered the mast altogether and where the beach was he could not tell he had seen no sign of it for the last two hours and it was now raining viciously hard  nobody seemed inclined to talk and there was only the roar and splash of the combers behind them as they drove wildly on until when dusk was close at hand the dim shadow of a hill rose up suddenly on one side of them then the indian hauled the sheet and presently when the water became smoother called to his companion who thrust the sprit up again after that the canoe put her lee side in every now and then but very soon a foamfringed point stretched out ahead they swept around it and after skirting a halfseen rocky beach ran with spritsail thrashing into a little basin down to which there crept rows of mistwrapped trees  frank was thankful to get out when the helmsman ran her ashore and the work of assisting the indians to chop branches and make a fire put a little warmth into him they made supper when darkness closed down and afterward the indians erected a rude branchandbark shelter while the white men and the boys huddled together in the tent it was better than sitting in the foamswept canoe but frank longed for the sloops lowroofed cabin  he went to sleep however wet as he was and after an early breakfast next morning they started again with both spritsails up in torrential rain the water was comparatively smooth though the doleful moaning of the firs fell from the halfseen hills and mr oliver announced that the entrance to the canal they had come down was not far away frank had learned that on the pacific slope canal generally means a natural arm of the sea  they reached its entrance presently sailing closehauled and on stretching across it the canoe plunged viciously on a short whitetopped sea the wind was blowing straight down the deep rift in the hills and frank remembered with regret that alberni stood a long way up at the head of the inlet they came back on the other tack making almost nothing and the siwash pulled the masts down before one of them spoke to mr oliver  i suppose they cant get the canoe to windward suggested mr barclay  he says well have to paddle mr oliver answered there seem to be four paddles in her and that will leave two of us to relieve the rest in turn  harry and frank took the first spell with the indians and they had had enough of it before an hour had passed the wind was dead ahead of them and though they crept in close with the beach they were met by little spiteful seas it was necessary to fight for every fathom thrashing her slowly ahead by sheer force of muscle franks hands were soon sore and one knee raw from pressing it against the crafts bottom he got hot and breathless the rain was in his face and his side began to ache and it was a vast relief to him when mr oliver finally took his place  the mists were thinning when he sat down limply in the bottom of the craft and great rocky hills and dusky firs crawled slowly by except when now and then a fiercer gust swept down whitening all the inlet and they barely held their own by desperate paddling then as it dropped a little they forged ahead again it was dreary as well as very arduous work but there was no avoiding it for their provisions were almost gone and there was no trail of any kind through the bush frank felt that even paddling into a strong head wind was better than smashing through continuous thorny brakes and floundering over great fallen logs  one hand commenced to bleed when he next took his turn but that was as he realized not a matter of much importance they had to reach alberni sometime next day and his chief concern was how it could be done then the pain in his side set in again and became rapidly worse and he set his lips tight as he swung gasping with each stroke of the splashing blade they won a foot or so each time the paddles came down and it was somewhat consoling to recognize it he felt that if he had been called upon to do this kind of thing after sleeping wet through upon the ground when he first came out he would have immediately collapsed but he was steadily acquiring the power to disregard bodily fatigue  there was no change as the day slipped by it rained pitilessly and the wind continually headed them as they labored on wearily with set wet faces and straining muscles the stroke must not slacken for the moment it grew feebler the canoe would drive astern they kept it up until nightfall and then beaching the canoe lay down once more in the tent which strained in the wind they were aching all over when they rose next morning and the work was still the same but they reached alberni worn out early in the evening it was a very small place then though it afterward sprang up into a mining town two or three ranch houses stood in their clearings beside a crystal river and a few more buildings clustered at the head of the inlet half hidden in the bush there was a store and a frame hotel among them and mr oliver who took up quarters in the latter told the boys that the stage would start on the following morning the indians were given shelter in one of the outbuildings and the hotelkeeper insisted on locking up the dog who growled at everybody about the place  im not scared of dogs he explained but that one of yours wont let me get about my own house besides i guess hed eat some of those chinamen before morning if you leave him loose  they were standing near a window and mr oliver glanced at one or two blueclad figures lounging under the dripping trees  you seem to have a number of them about he remarked i saw another lot as i came in what are they doing here  stopping for the night was the answer theyre camping in a barn of mine and going on to the gold creek at sunup though they may start earlier if the rain stops quite a few of them have come in over the trail lately  then there must be a regular colony in the bush broke in mr barclay who had strolled up  no replied the hotelkeeper thats the curious thing they keep on coming in by threes and fours but blake from the ranch higher up the river was through that way not long ago and he said he didnt see many of them yonder about two dozen he figured but more than that have come through here to my certain knowledge  it looks as if the goldwashing didnt pay and the rest had gone on somewhere mr barclay suggested carelessly  the hotelkeeper looked bewildered well he said this is the only trail to the settlements and they certainly havent come back this way its mighty rough traveling through the bush as you ought to know  mr barclay smiled ruefully as he glanced down at his torn clothing and badly damaged boots thats a sure thing besides theyd have their truck to pack along which would make it more difficult those fellows generally bring a lot of odds and ends with them  oh yes assented the hotelkeeper most of them have their slung baskets on poles anyway ive no fault to find with them they make no trouble  he walked off and when mr barclay and mr oliver went out harry gave a triumphant glance at frank  now he said you see what our friend has found out without giving himself away the question is where do those chinamen who dont stay with the goldwashing get to  frank laughed i expect barclay could give you an answer theres another thing he could probably guess at and thats what theyve got in some of those slung baskets  then they moved back toward the lighted stove for the rain drove against the frame walls and it was damp and chilly in the big bare room     chapter xv  a midnight visitor   it was getting dark when the boys retired to their room in which two beds were standing at opposite corners harry chose the one nearest the door and they left the window open the room was as usual in such places very scantily furnished but it appeared very comfortable after their camps in the dripping bush and frank found it a luxury to get his clothes off and lie down upon a comparatively soft mattress  a draught blew in at intervals through the window and the door which would not shut swung to and fro it was raining as hard as ever for frank could hear a muffled roar upon the shingled roof and the pines outside were wailing dolefully he soon went to sleep however but was awakened later by the sound of voices and a soft patter of feet below the rain seemed to have stopped at last though he could hear a heavy splashing from the branches of the firs close by and he fancied that the chinamen must be starting there was however no sign of morning when he glanced toward the window which showed only as a faintly lighter square in the surrounding obscurity in fact it seemed unusually dark which struck him as curious since there was a moon but the hotel stood in a valley shrouded by giant trees and he supposed that the sky was thick with cloud  he heard the voices grow fainter and the footsteps gradually recede until they were lost in the moaning of the pines and he felt that he did not envy the chinamen their journey he wondered why they had not waited until sunrise before starting and then remembered that a rancher he had met had told him that a trail led out of the settlement for some distance he supposed it would be light before the chinamen should reach the end of it and plunge into the forest about a quarter of an hour had slipped away when lying half asleep he thought that he heard some one in the room he could see nothing but the window and could hear little else than the sound of the wind among the trees but raising himself very cautiously on one elbow he distinctly heard a faint sound that suggested a stealthy movement this seemed very curious for he felt almost certain that if his companion had had any idea of trying to find out something about the chinamen he would have told him besides which the chinamen had gone  while he lay still listening with tingling nerves there was a soft scraping and presently a very pale blue flame broke out showing a shadowy figure in a loose robe bending over harrys bed with a light in its hand frank did not pause to consider what the strangers intentions might be but reached for his boot which was a heavy one and flung it with all his might at the shadowy objects head it struck the boarded wall with a startling crash the light suddenly went out and he sprang from his bed in the darkness with a cry of harry  well said his companion drowsily whats the matter  wheres the chinaman shouted frank darting toward the door  he ran out into a passage with harry blundering half awake behind him and noticed that there was an open window near the door which had been shut when he had last seen it on reaching it he espied what seemed to be the roof of a low outbuilding not far below but there was very little else to be seen except the loom of the dusky pines which were beginning to stand out against the sky then he heard a rush of pattering feet and a yelp on the stairway close by and a furry body flung itself against his knee he recognized the dog who almost immediately darted into the room it came out again sprang to the window ledge and bounded to the roof beneath he heard a soft thud on the shingles and a bark that sounded farther off and then for a moment or two there was silence again  it was broken by the sound of a door flung open and mr barclay came along the passage very lightly dressed with a lamp in his hand telling them to follow he walked into the boys room and placed the lamp on a bureau before he sat down on the nearest bed  now he asked whats the cause of this commotion  i dont know said harry perhaps frank can tell you he seems to have been throwing his boots about  frank a little nettled narrated what he had seen mr barclay smiled  you say the man was standing by harrys bed he observed did you notice if he had a big knife in his hand  hed nothing but a match frank answered shortly  now thats curious said mr barclay do you suppose he meant to set the bed on fire or have you any idea what he was doing  frank heard a slight sound and looking around saw mr oliver standing in the doorway while just then a shout came down the passage apparently from the hotelkeeper  whats the trouble is there anything wrong  were trying to find out mr barclay replied it doesnt seem to be serious anyway  then ill put a few clothes on before i come along said the voice and a door banged  he seemed to be looking down at harrys face said frank who saw that mr barclay was waiting an answer  mr barclay now turned and favored harry with a critical gaze  i cant understand what the fellow wanted to do that for then he smiled back at frank these are decadent days he wouldnt have got away with his scalp on if hed come creeping into the room of the james boys  harry flushed i suppose you mean to hint that frank imagined it all sir well he told you the man struck a match and though sulphur matches dont give much light they make a considerable smell do you notice any particular odor in this room then he stooped suddenly and picked up a halfburned match what do you make of this i havent struck one  mr barclay examined the match with an abstracted expression and while he did so the dog pattered into the room wagging his tail in a deprecatory manner as if to excuse himself for not overtaking the intruder he jumped distractedly around the boys for a moment and then crouched down upon the floor with a short length of broken cord trailing from his collar mr oliver pointed to it with an amused smile  it seems to me the dog must have imagined something of the same kind as frank did he observed  by this time the hotelkeeper arrived and gazed on with astonishment while mr barclay briefly explained the cause of the commotion  ive never heard anything like this since ive been in the place he declared the chinamen are out on the trail now better see if you have lost anything  the couple of dollars that frank had brought with him proved to be still in his pocket and harry fished out the dollar which belonged to him his cheap watch was safe beneath his pillow and frank declared that he had left his silver one at the ranch this appeared to make the matter more inexplicable to the hotelkeeper  if the fellow had gone off with something i could have understood it he said in a puzzled way  its most likely that frank saw him almost immediately after he came in said mr oliver as he pitched his boot at him the man was probably startled and got out without wasting any time in looking round then the dog broke loose and went after him  the hotelkeeper agreed with this and shortly afterward mr oliver telling the boys not to trouble themselves any further about the matter followed him out with mr barclay they turned into the latters room where mr oliver sat down  i imagine that franks notion is correct he said as harry told you he and frank once paid a visit to the chinese camp near our ranch where he saw the man with the high shoulder and followed him to a shack from which he disappeared if the chinaman who crept into the room chanced to have been about the camp when the boys were there its quite possible that he did wish to see harrys face  that mr barclay admitted is my own opinion though it seemed wiser not to impress it on the boys i dont suppose you want them to get to making any investigations on their own account  no rejoined mr oliver on the other hand theyve taken a certain part in the matter already in fact it might have been better if id left them behind the trouble is that if the chinaman recognized harry it would probably give him some idea as to why we made this visit  mr barclay nodded his head yes he said its a pity but after all im rather glad i made this trip its going to prove worth while  nothing further was said on the subject and silence settled down again on the hotel there was bright sunshine when the party started with the stage next morning and after spending the night at a little colliery town they took the train south getting off at a small station they found the sloop safe in the cove where they had left her mr barclay however went on with the peltries to victoria which was not far away and there managed to dispose of them after which he hired a horse and rode back to the inlet they set sail as soon as he arrived and after two days of light winds duly reached the cove near the ranch  a few months slipped by peacefully the smugglers showed no sign of further activity and mr oliver got his oat crop in undisturbed one way or another he kept the boys busy from morning until night but at last when the maple leaves were beginning to turn he told them to take their rifles and go hunting and they set off one morning after breakfast  it was a still clear morning and now that the fall was drawing on there was a change in the bush here and there a maple leaf caught a ray of sunshine and burned like a crimson lamp the fern was growing yellow and the undergrowth was splashed and spattered with flecks of varying color even the light in the openings seemed different it was at once softer and clearer than the glare of summer and the shadows seemed thinner and bluer than they had been but there was no difference in the great black firs they lifted their fretted spires high against the sky as they had done for centuries and they would remain the same until the white mans ax should sweep the wilderness away  the boys were floundering waistdeep in withered fern and tangled undergrowth when they heard a rustling and scurrying somewhere near their feet and harry breaking off a rotten branch from a fallen fir hurled it into a neighboring thicket  a fool hen he shouted jump round this bush and try to put it up  frank fell into the thicket in his haste but he still heard the scurrying in front of him when he scrambled to his feet he kicked a clump of fern and there was no doubt that something rushed away from underneath it after which he plunged through the brake with harry some yards away on one side of him but there was nothing visible they hunted the unseen creature for what he supposed was about ten minutes with no better result then a plainly colored bird about the size of a pigeon rose from almost under his feet and flew to a fir branch some twenty yards away where it perched and looked down at its pursuers unconcernedly  it doesnt seem scared now said frank in astonishment  it isnt harry answered with a laugh the thing feels quite safe once its on a branch i guess thats why its called the fool hen though its proper name is the willow grouse walk up and try a shot at itonly you must cut its head off  frank crept up nearer with a caution which was wholly unnecessary for the bird did not seem to mind him in the least when he stopped close beneath it and pitched his rifle to his shoulder but as he gazed at it over the halfmoon of the rearsight it seemed to him that its neck was exceedingly small he could not keep the forebead fixed on it and bringing the rifle down he rested before he tried it again then he felt the butt thump his shoulder and the barrel jerk and a little wisp of smoke drifted across his eyes and hung about the bushes when it cleared the grouse to his astonishment was sitting on the branch as calmly as ever  it likes it said harry try againonly at its neck  trying again frank succeeded in inducing the bird to move to a neighboring branch after which he braced himself with desperate determination for the third attempt this time the jar upon his shoulder was followed by a soft thud and he understood why he had been warned to shoot only at its neck when he picked up his victim the big 44 bullet had horribly shattered it  could you have shot its head off he asked after he had thrown it down in disgust  why yes said harry anyway i can generally manage it if the thing sits still most of the bush ranchers could do it every time  he made this good presently when they found another bird for it dropped at his first shot without its head half an hour later they saw a blue grouse perched rather high up in a cedar  this fellow wont sit to be fired at harry explained better try it kneeling where you are if you can get the foresight up enough  frank knelt with his right foot tucked under him and his left elbow on his knee it steadied the rifle considerably but he had to cramp himself a little to raise the muzzle holding his breath he squeezed the trigger when a part of the bird filled up the curve of the rearsight but he was mildly astonished when harry walked toward him with the grouse in his hand  i guess this one could be cooked he said dubiously well take it along  frank surveyed his victim with a thrill of pride it was larger than the willow grouse in fact it seemed to him a remarkably big and handsome bird in spite of the hole in it and he thrust it into the flour bag on his back with unalloyed satisfaction  is this the thing that makes the drumming in the spring he asked  harry said that it was and they scrambled through the bush for a couple of hours without seeing anything further until they approached a swampy hollow with a steep hillside over which the undergrowth hung unusually thick  there ought to be a black bear yonder they like the wild cabbage said harry well try to crawl in its a pity there isnt a little wind ahead of us  they spent half an hour over the operation and frank realized that trailing had its drawbacks when he found that it entailed burrowing among thorny thickets and crawling across quaggy places on his hands and knees in spite of his caution sticks would snap and it seemed to his strungup imagination that he was making a prodigious noise at last however there was another sound some distance in front of him which suddenly became louder  a bear sure cried harry excitedly going off up hill shoot if you can see it  frank gazed intently ahead but could see absolutely nothing though he could hear a smashing and crashing which presently died away again on the slope then harry brought down his rifle and turned away  you can generally hear a black bear he said he goes straight and rips right through the things a deer would jump hes a kind of harmless beast anyway  could we find a deer frank asked his hopes still high  well try when weve had dinner replied his companion i havent seen any lately though that doesnt count for much because it would be possible not to notice one if the woods were full of them still they seem to have a way of clearing right out of the country every now and then for no particular reason the bear and the timber wolves do the same thing  they ate their dinner sitting among the roots of a big cedar while a gorgeous green and red woodpecker climbed about a neighboring trunk then harry stood up and shouldered his rifle  after this well leave the birds alone he announced you dont want to make a noise when youre trailing deer     chapter xvi  frank kills a deer   they plodded through the bush for an hour or two without seeing any living thing except a few pigeons and harry began to look doubtful  if it was early morning id try one of the rock outcrops where nothing grows he observed the deer get up on to those places out of the dew then as its afternoon i dont know which way to head  frank glanced at his clothes keen as he was on hunting he would not have been sorry to head for home for his duck trousers were badly torn and one of his boots which had been rather the worse for wear when he started was almost dropping off his foot they trudged on however and accident favored them as it often does when one is hunting for at last when they were in very thick bush harry dropped suddenly behind a patch of withered fern  look there he said softly right ahead of you yonder  frank gazed ahead with straining eyes but he could only see the great trunks stretching back in serried ranks he had heard somewhat to his astonishment that it is not often that a novice can see a deer in the bush even when it is pointed out to him but now it seemed the thing was true he could have declared that there was not a deer anywhere within the range of his vision  right in front whispered harry impatiently about seventy yards off oh look yonder  he stretched his hand out and at last frank noticed what seemed to be a very slightly different colored strip of something behind a narrow opening in a thicket it might have been withering fern or a cluster of fading leaves but he would never have imagined it to be a portion of a deer then his doubts vanished for it suddenly moved  where shall i shoot he asked beneath his breath  at the bottom of the bit you can see was the low answer  frank threw up his rifle he was too eager to kneel or lie down and it scarcely seemed probable that the deer would wait until he was comfortably ready he lined the sights on a twig immediately in front of the object and though his hands had quivered he found them growing steadier as he squeezed the trigger he heard no report but there was a crash in the thicket as the smoke came drifting back and harry ran forward with a shout  come on he cried youve hit it  frank ran his fastest though running of any kind was extraordinarily difficult in places the withered fern was higher than his head and there seemed to be innumerable bushes in his way while when he endeavored to avoid them he generally came upon a giant tree which had to be scrambled around still there was no doubt that the deer was not far off for he could hear it floundering through the brakes and fern and by and by he came upon a trail of red splashes scattered here and there upon the leaves  its hit bad panted harry if we can hold out well get it yet  they did their utmost for the next half hour but they never once saw the deer which by the decreasing sound seemed to be drawing away from them and frank felt that it would be impossible for him to keep up the pace many minutes longer he was breathless and dripping with perspiration and his clothes were torn all over indeed eager as he was it was almost a relief when the sound in front of him gradually died away and harry stopped gasping and leaned against a fir  what are we going to do about it now frank asked  trail that deer was the breathless answer its not going very far you can tell by the noise it made that it was hit too bad to jump  frank was of the opinion that it had gone quite far enough already but he silently watched harry who began to walk up and down looking carefully about him  it went through this bush he said at length after that it must have crossed the fern yonder then scrambling forward he waved his hand come on the trails quite plain  frank followed him with some trouble and once more saw the red splashes on the leaves now and then they lost them for a little while and the undergrowth did not seem to have been disturbed but on each occasion harry contrived to find the spots again he traced them from place to place moving more slowly and cautiously while frank painfully broke through the thickets in his wake they were both nearly exhausted when an hour after the shot was fired they came to a little creek  it lay down here said harry well stop a minute or two guess that deers most as played out as we are  this seemed very probable to frank as he glanced at the broad red smear upon the damp soil and for the first time he was troubled by a sense of compunction as he realized that there were two sides to hunting the pursuers labor was severe enough but he could imagine what the flight must have cost the sorely wounded creature who had so far managed to keep in front of them he was scratched and torn and exhausted but at least he was sound in limb while the deer must have staggered on in anguished terror with its life steadily draining from the cruel bullet hole somewhere in his mind there was now a wish that he had not made so good a shot  do you think were far behind it he asked  i dont but that doesnt count answered harry we have to follow it anyway i remember when i got my first deer dad was with me and before i fired he asked if i thought i could hit it where i wanted i said i did and he told me to make sure because if the beast got away with a bullet in it id have to trail it until it dropped he stopped with a significant laugh as it happened we followed it close on three hours through the thickest kind of bush andi wasnt so big thenit was mighty hard work to get back to the ranch afterward  frank fancied that in the present case he might drop before the deer did though he realized that mr olivers rule was in one way a merciful one and undoubtedly calculated to encourage careful shooting when he had recovered his breath a little they started again but it was half an hour later when they caught a glimpse of the deer painfully laboring through a clump of fern on the slope of a steep rise harry pitched up his rifle and though the animal disappeared again immediately after they fired they knew it was still going on by the snapping of twigs and the rustling in the fern  harry was sure that he had hit it and making a last effort they broke into a run which frank remembered for a considerable time afterward the slope seemed to be getting remarkably steep he could scarcely see a dozen yards in front of him through the undergrowth and several times he stuck fast for a moment or two in tangled thickets then he fell into a horrible tangle of rotting branches dropping his rifle and bruising himself cruelly and he only succeeded in forcing himself along because his companion shouted breathlessly that the deer was rapidly flagging frank could hear it very plainly now  at last when they reached the summit of the rise it came out into open view for a moment the bush was thinner there with less growth between the trees and he saw the animal limp out from a thicket dragging an injured limb he flung up his rifle and harry who was a little in front fired almost as he did the deer staggered made a feeble bound and vanished as if the earth had opened under it a moment or two later harry stopped with a hoarse gasping shout  frank stumbled forward and found him standing on the brink of what seemed to be a very deep ravine the almost precipitous sides of which were shrouded in young firs and densely growing bushes harry was gazing dubiously into the gully  i dont quite know how were going to get down but well have to try he said the deers at the bottom done for and i dont feel like going home and telling dad we left it besides its quite likely he might send us back for it  then if it has to be done we may as well get about it said frank wearily  slinging his rifle he crawled over the edge and went sliding and slipping down for about a dozen yards until he fell into the branches of a young fir after that he plunged into several bushes before he could stop again and eventually lowered himself foot by foot clutching at whatever seemed strong enough to hold him until he alighted kneedeep in a splashing creek nearby the deer lay motionless where it had fallen upon the stones it was a beautifully symmetrical creature but it seemed to frank smaller than he had expected  a young blacktail said harry anyway thats what we call them though i believe its really the muledeer theres another blacktail weve got the deer names kind of mixed up on the pacific slope  frank regarded the animal dubiously it seems to me the most important question is how were going to get it home  pack it answered harry but id better open it up first you can sit down while i do it if youd rather  frank would very much have preferred to sit down out of sight while the deer was dressed but it occurred to him that it would scarcely be fitting to leave the disagreeable part of the work to his companion  no he persisted ill help as much as i can  well said harry dryly if you want to go hunting its a thing youll have to learn  the operations that followed were singularly unpleasant and frank felt a good deal less enthusiastic about hunting when he washed his hands and the sleeves of his jacket in the creek after they were over  i dont know if ill eat any of that deer he said  youll get over it harry assured him with a smile anyway in my opinion deer meat isnt much of a delicacy its that stringy you could most make lariats of it unless you keep it until its bad  frank felt inclined later to agree with this statement but in the meanwhile harry got the deer which he had not yet skinned upon his shoulders with its fore legs pulled over in front of him and they started back for the ranch it was however some time before they could find a way out of the gulch and then they only gained the summit by an arduous scramble after that they found themselves in exceedingly thick bush with nothing that frank could see to guide them there was probably not much light at any time down among those great trunks whose branches met and crossed high overhead and what there was seemed to be getting dim  if we keep on going down well strike something by and by urged harry the slopes naturally toward the beach  the first thing they struck was a remarkably steep hillside up which they struggled frank now carrying the deer which he found heavy enough before he reached the top then a narrow valley opened up before them which did not seem to be what harry had expected there were one or two ponds in the bottom of it and he gazed at them thoughtfully  we might get a duck he mused they ought to be coming down from alaska now its freezing up there  they floundered down the declivity and though frank would have preferred to push on straight for home harry insisted on creeping through the long harsh grass about the edge of the water they tried one of the ponds with no result but at last harry dropped suddenly behind a tall clump of grass  look he said there are two or three ducks yonder you take the nearest keep the foresight as fine as you can  frank saw one or two small objects floating just outside the grass across the pond they seemed to be a very long way off and though he feared that he could not keep the sights upon any of them standing the ground looked horribly quaggy to kneel in this could not be helped however for it seemed that getting wet and torn did not count when one was hunting and he pressed his right knee down into the mire he could just see one of the ducks when he closed his left eye and he had misgivings as to the result when he squeezed the trigger harrys rifle flashed immediately after his there was a rattle of wings and a startled quacking and he saw two ducks with long necks stretched out fly off above the trees another seemed to be lying on the water and remembering the size of the bullet he had no fear of that one getting away  the next thing is to get it said harry its not going to be easy  he was perfectly right they spent a long while struggling around the pond into which they had to wade nearly waistdeep before harry contrived to rake the duck in toward him with the muzzle of his rifle it did not look a sightly object when he had secured it but he decided that there was enough of it left to eat  is it the one you shot at he asked with a grin  i cant say frank answered i shouldnt be surprised if it wasnt  well said harry were not going to quarrel about the thing what we have to do is to make a beeline home well come along again in a week or two the ponds are full of ducks for a little in the spring and fall  only then  theyre not so plentiful betweenwhiles harry answered of course our worst winters arent marked by the cold snaps you have back east and quite a few of the ducks stay with us while some put in the summer too but in a general way every swimming bird of any size heads north to the tundra marshes by the polar sea in spring in the fall they come back again how far i dont knowlower california mexico perhaps right away to bolivia and peru going and coming the big flocks stop around here to rest a while he smiled at his companion a mallard ducks a little thing but he covers a considerable sweep of country  he picked up the deer and they went on again but darkness overtook them before they reached the ranch utterly worn out with most of their garments rent to tatters and frank who had carried the deer the last mile or two gave a gasp of relief when he laid it down     chapter xvii  mr websters guns   it was about a week after the boys hunting trip when mr olivers nearest neighbor mr webster drove up to the ranch in a dilapidated wagon it was dark when he arrived for the days were rapidly getting shorter when jake had taken his horse away he laid what appeared to be a small armory on the kitchen table and sat down by the stove he was a young man with a careless goodhumored expression and harry aside informed frank that his ranch was not much of a place  ive brought you my guns along said mr webster addressing mr oliver and then looked down at the dog who had walked up to him in the meanwhile and now stood regarding him with its head on one side hello he added patting it id most forgotten you you have managed to put up with him miss oliver  miss oliver said that she had grown fond of him and the dog after standing up with a paw upon the mans knee dropped down on all fours at the sound of her voice and trotted back to her without waiting for another pat  i always had a notion he was an ungrateful as well as an ordinary beast said mr webster would you have fancied my dog would leave me like that after all ive done for him i guess ive laid into him with most everything about the ranch from the grubhoe handle to the riding quirt  mr oliver laughed but why have you brought your guns  for you to take care of my place gets damp in winter without the stove on and im going away for a month or two ive taken on a logbridge contract with a fellow i used to work with on one of the new settlement roads the man whos been clearing land up the creek took the few head of stock i had off my hands and the fruit trees will grow along all right without worrying anybody until i get back again if one hadnt to do so much cutting every now and then theyd be a long sight handier than raising stock  well mr oliver assured i think we can promise to look after the guns i didnt know you had so many of them  mr webster arose and walked toward the table though i never was a great shot guns are rather a hobby of mine i neednt say anything about these twosingleshot marlin winchester repeaterbut the oldtimers seem to have a notion that a man must excuse himself for keeping a scatter gun thisand he picked up what seemed to frank a handsome single barrelis a thing i bought for a few dollars last time i was in portland i allowed she would do to keep the pigeons off my oats not much of a gun but she throws out the shell then he took up a double gun with the brown rubbed off the barrels leaving bright patches this ones different theres some tone about her a sport i once had boarding with me gave her to me when he went away said id given him a great time and as he was fixed it might be two or three years before he could get out into the woods again  he sat down on the table and looked over with a smile at the boys i dont know any reason why you two shouldnt have those guns until i come back theyll keep better if theyre used and rubbed out once in a while and theres a box of shells in the wagon you cant call yourself a sport until you can drop a flying bird with the scatter gun and theres considerably more to it than most of the oldtimers who can only plug a deer with a rifle seem to think  he evidently noticed the interest in franks face for he proceeded to demonstrate standing up with the double gun held across him a little above his waist  now he added you dont want to aim poking the gun about you keep it down and your eyes on the bird until youre ready and then pitch it up right on the spot first timeits better with both eyes open if you can manage it the gun went in to his shoulder and frank heard the striker click after which the man swung the muzzle half a foot or so say you missed youve still got the second barrel  they heard no more for there was an appalling crash a short cry from miss oliver and a yelp from the dog who jumped into the air while a filmy cloud of smoke drifted about the room when it cleared mr webster who had opened the door sat down on the table looking very sheepish and turned toward miss oliver  im sorrydreadful sorry he observed contritely i hadnt the least notion there was anything in the thing  mr oliver glanced at the ragged hole high up in the log wall and then looked at mr webster with ironical amusement in his eyes  your instructions were good as far as they went but you have forgotten one rather important point he turned to the boys its this never bring a gun of any kind into a house without first opening the magazine or breach and if theres a shell in it immediately take it out its a precaution thats as simple as its effective and though there was perhaps some excuse for an accident in the old days when a man couldnt readily empty his gun unless he fired off the charge theres none now  sure agreed mr webster who seemed to be getting over his confusion for he addressed the boys again with winter coming on the best sport i know with a scatter gun is shooting flighting duck and theres plenty of them along the beach theyve a way of moving around in flocks between the light and dark which is the best time though you can get them through the night if theres not too bright a moon a good place would be those patches of sand and mud behind the islands especially when the tides just leaving the flats take the sloop or canoe along sometime and try it  the boys thanked him and franks eyes glistened as he handled the light single gun  what are you going to do with your team asked mr oliver changing the subject  anson down by nares hill will take them for their keep but i might have made a few dollars out of them if id been staying on  hows that  well in a significant tone a man came along three or four nights ago i dont know where he came from and i dont know where he wenthe just walked in with the lamp lit when i was getting supper he wanted to know if i was open to hire him a team for a night or two  what kind of a man  a stranger he looked like a sailor and seemed liberal said he wanted the team particularly and if id have them handy when he turned up we neednt quarrel about the figure that must have meant i could charge most what i liked  what did you say  mr webster smiled i just told him the horses were promised and i couldnt make the deal anywayand he added this in a different voiceid no notion of going back on you  thanks said mr oliver quietly and they talked about other matters until webster making a few more excuses to miss oliver drove away when he had gone she looked at her brother and laughed softly  i was startled but not very much astonished when the gun went off she said the little incident was so characteristic of the man  the next day the boys commenced practicing at flungup meat cans with the cartridges he had given them and in a week they could hit one every now and then at thirty yards soon afterward mr oliver went away he only told the boys that he was going to tacoma but harry thought it possible that he wanted to see mr barclay since mr websters story made it clear that the dope runners were about again he announced ingenuously that they had better try the flightshooting while his father was away because if they came back all right with several ducks he would probably not object to their going another time miss oliver seemed doubtful when they casually mentioned the project to her but as she did not actually forbid it they set out with the sloop late one afternoon taking the dog with them  it was falling dusk and the tide had been running ebb two or three hours when they beat in under the lee side of one of the islands they had passed on a previous occasion on their way to the settlement after anchoring the sloop where she would lie afloat at low water some distance off the beach they got into the canoe and paddling ashore crossed the island which was small and narrow it was covered with thin underbrush and dwarf firs and on its opposite side a broad stretch of wet sand and shingle with pools and creeks in it stretched back toward the channel which cut it off from the mainland  to the eastward the pale silver sickle of a crescent moon hung low in the sky but westward a wide band of flaring crimson and saffron still burned beneath dusky masses of ragged cloud and the uncovered sands gleamed bloodred in the fading glow a cold wind stirred the pines to an eerie sighing and the splash of a tiny surf came up faintly from the outer edge of the sands the whole scene struck frank as very forbidding and desolate and he fancied that there was a threat of wind in the sky something in the loneliness troubled him and for no particular reason he felt half sorry that he had come he realized that it would have been much more cozy in the sloops cabin than upon that dreary beach and he said something about the weather to harry  well be sheltered here if the breeze does come up and this looks just the place where we ought to get a duck his companion answered there arent many spots like it around this part of the coast where weve generally deeper water perhaps wed better move on a little nearer yonder clump of firs theyll hide us from any birds that come sailing down to the flats  whats the matter with the dog frank asked whats he snuffing at  the animal was trotting about with his nose upon the ground and would not come when they called him  i dont know said harry carelessly perhaps somebodys been across the island lately though i dont think its often a white man lands here  they took up their stations a little apart from each other among some very rough boulders with the nearest of the firs on a rocky ridge some thirty or forty yards away from them their ragged branches cut in a sharp ebony pattern against the sky which was duskily blue it was very cold and the wind seemed fresher for the trees were rustling and moaning and the calling of distant wildfowl came up through the increasing murmur of the surf  franks boots had suffered from hard wear in the bush and as he had stumbled into a pool his feet were very wet but he crouched behind a boulder clutching the singlebarreled gun with cold fingers and watching the sky beyond the fir tops for what seemed a considerable time nothing moved across it except a long wisp of tornedged cloud and he was commencing to wonder whether it would not be better to go back to the sloop when harry called softly and he heard a new sound in the darkness somewhere beyond the firs it suggested the regular movement of a row of fans which was the best comparison that occurred to him for there was a kind of measured beat in it and in another few moments he recognized it as the rhythmic stroke of wings then a double line of dark bodies spreading out from a point in the shape of a wedge appeared close above him against the sky  he saw that they had long necks but that was all for they were coming on with an extraordinary swiftness there was a crash as harrys gun flung a streak of red fire into the darkness then frank pitched up the single barrel pulling hard upon the trigger as the butt struck his shoulder he felt the jar of it and saw a whirling blaze after which he swung around when harrys gun flashed again  the wedge which had scattered was reuniting he could just see it dotted upon the sky but he fancied that one dark object had come whirling down and struck the flats outshore of him a few seconds earlier  one sure cried harry ive an idea theres a cripple too trailing on the ground wheres that dog i wonder if hed hunt it up  they called but there was no sign of the animal  hed probably sit down and eat it if he got it said frank laughing as he isnt here wed better get after the birds  they soon picked up the dead one a mallard harry said but it was some minutes before they saw the other fluttering across a patch of wet sand breaking into a run they were astonished to find that they did not get much nearer and it must be admitted that frank fired again without stopping it after that it led them through several pools and runlets of water until at a flash of harrys gun it lay still but they were almost up to their knees in a little channel before they retrieved it  i wonder how long well have to wait before some more ducks come said harry as they made their way back to the boulders then he suddenly looked about him where can that dog have gone  they called a second time but there was still no answer and while they listened it struck frank that the sound of the surf was growing more distinct  he seemed to be trailing something when i last saw him he answered i dont feel keen on going after him the top of the islands rough perhaps wed better wait here until he comes  they waited for about ten minutes and then a succession of quick barks reached them apparently from across the island there was something startling in the sound and frank turned sharply toward his companion  he doesnt bark like that for nothing hadnt we better go along he suggested  they started on the moment stumbling among the boulders and splashing into pools the going was no easier when they reached the firs but they broke through them somehow and when at length they approached the beach which was steep on that side the dog came bounding toward them and then ran back with a growl to the edge of the water looking around with strained attention frank made out the sloop a dim dark shape upon the water for the moon was covered now after that he ran down toward the edge of the tide but there was nothing unusual to be seen though the dog again yelped savagely as he stopped close beside the animal harrys voice reached him  wheres the canoe he cried  it was a moment or two before frank saw her and then he started and cast a quick glance at the strip of beach left uncovered by the ebbing tide the breeze was off the shore and on arriving they had thrown over a lump of iron with a rope made fast to it and then paddled the canoe ashore and shoved her out again to drift off as far as the rope would allow her in order to avoid dragging her down over the rough stones when they went away now she seemed farther off than she should have been and in another moment he realized that she was moving  shes adrift he shouted  then we will have to get her harry answered  frank laid down his gun and threw off his jacket harry could swim better than he could but harry was some distance back and the beach was very rough while it was clear that every moment would increase the distance between it and the canoe he struck his knees against something which hurt as he floundered into the water stumbling among the stones but that did not matter then and as soon as it was deep enough he flung himself down a horrible chill struck through him as he swung his left arm out and he was badly hampered by his boots and clothes and though he swam savagely the canoe was still some way in front of him when at length he turned breathlessly upon his breast what was worse she was steadily drifting farther off shore  chilled and anxious as he was he thought quickly he was far from certain that he could get back to the beach and even if he did so he would have to spend the night wet through without any means of making a shelter the sloop was lying a good way out and he did not think that harry could swim so far in that cold water he was quite sure that he could not and it was evident that there was nothing for it but to overtake the canoe  for what seemed a very long time he swam desperately and then just as he was almost alongside the craft something came up behind him and seized his arm turning his head with a halfchoked cry he saw that it was the dog who apparently intended to stick fast to him the animal however hampered him terribly and flinging it off he made a last effort and contrived to clutch the canoe before it seized him again holding on by the low stern he tried to recover his breath while he wondered if he could manage to lift himself in it seemed to him that if he failed to do it at that moment he could not expect to succeed afterward in which case he would in all probability have to let go before very long setting his lips he made the attempt and falling headforemost into the canoe he lay still for a few moments gasping until he rose and pulled the dog on board then he hauled up the iron which was still attached to the rope though it was not upon the bottom and found a paddle two or three minutes later he was back at the beach and harry got in  make for the sloop as fast as you can he said  frank now chilled to the bone was glad to paddle and they were soon alongside harry handed him up the birds and guns when he got on board and then made the painter fast  ill start the stove first thing while you tie two reefs in the mainsail he said i guess well want them and the work will warm you  he disappeared below and before he came out again frank had managed to get the tack and leach down which was not so difficult now that the sail lay along the boom  harry gave him a quick look  go in and strip yourself he said theres a blanket forward and some coffee in the can ill be down by the time you have wrung out your things     chapter xviii  running a cargo   on crawling into the cabin frank found the stove burning fiercely with the register open full blast he was sitting near it wrapped in a thick blanket from which his bare legs and arms protruded when harry joined him  this should thaw you out the latter said the place would do for drying fruit in got any coffee left  frank gave him some and when he had drunk it harry examined some of the garments which were hanging about the stove  theyll be getting fairly dry in half an hour or so and then well pull out for home he added its breezing up quite smart now and id lie here until morning only aunt would get badly scared she wouldnt say anything but if jake got to talking it would probably make trouble when dad comes home  how did the canoe get adrift frank inquired sleepily  that said harry with an excellent imitation of mr barclays manner is a point i have been investigating to begin with the killick had been hauled up since we pitched it over and let go againonly on the last occasion it was made fast so it wouldnt quite fetch the bottom he raised his hand in protest as frank was about to speak its a sure thing one strand was chafed where i took a turn with the rope and that frayed bit had got moved a fathom or two along i felt about until i struck it  frank started for this confirmed a hazy suspicion which had already been in his mind but he stooped to pat the dog who was licking his uncovered foot  hold on your tongues rough he said before he looked up at his companion what do you make of the thing  well said harry the man who did it wanted it to look as if the canoe had gone adrift by accident he was on the island when we came along and the dog got after him its most likely he went off in a boat or canoe while we were making for the beach after wed heard the barking seems to me hed some reason for wanting to keep us here  you think he was one of the dope men suggested frank  i wouldnt be greatly astonished if we saw the schooner on our way home harry answered with a chuckle  there was some excuse for his amusement because frank looked somewhat ludicrous as he sat thinking hard with his brows wrinkled down and the blanket falling away from him  ive an idea he announced at length the question of course is why should the man who set the canoe adrift have landed on a desolate place like this i expect its just its desolateness that brought him here now the smugglers probably find it difficult to get hold of the dope in canada and they may have to save it up in small parcels until its worth while to send the schooner through she couldnt come often with only a case or two because it wouldnt pay and it would increase the chances of somebodys seeing her on the other hand they may not be able to get rid of the stuff immediately when she brings a big lot and in that case theyd be likely to make a cache of part of it where nobody would be likely to strike it and their friends could come for it later this island ought to be just the place  harry made a sign of assent  i guess youve hit it first time but ill go up and get the mainsail on her i can manage it alone with two reefs in and you can stay where you are until your clothes are a little drier unless i call you  he went out and frank heard a clatter of blocks and flutter of canvas after that there was a sharp rattling as harry hauled in the anchor chain and then the boat suddenly slanted over with a jerk which flung frank backward against the side of her as he got up he heard the water splash about her bows a few minutes later they began to swing sharply up and down and the thuds against them made it evident that the sloop was plunging closehauled through a short head sea by and by the plunges grew more violent and struggling into his clothes which were partly dry frank put out the lamp and crawled out into the well for a minute or two he could see nothing as he held on by the weather coaming though he felt the buffeting of the wind and the sting of the spray upon his face then by degrees he made out that the sloop was lying down on one side with the small black strip of her doublereefed mainsail slanting sharply above her and a filmy white cloud flying at her bows suddenly the frothing water began to glitter and on looking up he saw that the moon which had grown brighter had just emerged from behind a bank of flying cloud then harry who sat at the helm called to him  look yonder just over the bowsprit end he cried  frank gazing where his companion told him saw a bright red twinkle low down above the sea and apparently two or three miles away  a fire he exclaimed on the island by the point isnt it  a signal harry assented guess its to show the schooner men the bush gang are ready he broke into a laugh which reached frank faintly theyre figuring were safe on the island out of the way you couldnt see that fire from the beach we were left upon  what are you going to do  stand right on to where the fire is we have to make a long leg on this tack anyway when were close up with the point well consider get a little more head sheet in if you can  it cost frank an effort though the sloop was carrying her smallest jib and when he had made the rope fast he crouched beside his comrade in the partial shelter of the coaming with the dog at his feet it was blowing moderately fresh and the sloop was very wet for the tide was running with her and she thrashed on at a great pace pitching the water all over while the red twinkle ahead grew steadily higher and brighter it was the only thing that frank could see because the moon had disappeared again  in the meanwhile he wondered what his companion meant to do for he fancied that harry had something in his mind the latter was like his father in some respects since he did not as a rule explain what his intentions were until he was reasonably sure that he could carry them out one result of this was that while each seldom did less than he said he would he not infrequently did a good deal more folks of this kind frank reflected inspired one with confidence  at last when the fire was large and bright a head loomed up above it with the wavering glow falling upon its rocky face on one side of the crag there was a strip of darkness which frank supposed was water and a little nearer him a long shadowy patch which he knew to be an island he turned to harry who was just then glancing up at the sky  well run right into the light if you stand on much longer he pointed out  he had hardly spoken when the red blaze sank down amidst an upward rush of sparks and as it died away harry laughed  that means one of two things he said either theyve given the schooner up or she has her anchor down inside and theyve no more use for a light that might set folks wondering though i dont know that anybody would be likely to see it  anyway youll go ashore if you stand on persisted frank  its not my intention that we should stand on said harry glancing up again at the cloudbarred sky we can just weather the island as shes lying and when thats done i could put up my helm and run through the sound behind it ill do it if the moon keeps in if the schooners inside yonder we ought to see her  frank was rather staggered by the boldness of the idea the strait seemed narrow and he fancied that it would be further contracted by shallows now that the tide was getting low while it appeared very probable that if they saw the schooner her crew would see them if she were landing cargo there would be boats about and he did not think it would be pleasant to fall in with them after the pains somebody had taken in setting the canoe adrift still though he was very dubious about its wisdom the prospect of the adventure appealed to him and harry seemed to take his consent for granted  well carry a fair wind through the latter announced if its necessary we could lower the peak down and that would leave very little canvas to be seen you had better shorten the canoe up while i luff shes half full and towing heavily  the mainsail thrashed and the speed slackened when he put down his helm and frank hauling with all his might dragged the canoe up a little closer astern and made her fast with a shorter rope after which harry got way on the boat again it seemed to frank to be blowing harder and she swayed down farther plunging furiously through the short seas with a white belt of surf which had shadowy rocks behind it to lee of her the moon was still hidden but it was evident that they were very close to the end of the island by and by the white line to lee suddenly vanished and they stretched out into the dark water with a high black mass not far ahead  weve got to jibe her said harry get the peak down  the deck was horribly slanted and slippery but frank made his way forward along it while the seas which seemed steeper there drenched him with showers of cold brine he found the halliard and let it go and scrambling aft as the head of the sail swung down helped his companion who was struggling with a rope while he jammed the tiller over with his shoulder  handy cried harry you must check the boom as it comes over  the craft was coming round with her stern to the wind and as she did so the canoe came up on the top of a sea and struck her with a crash frank had however no thought to spare for her he was dragging at the mainsheet as the big boom tilted up into the darkness above his head while the sloop rolled heavily then the upper part of the bagging sail swung over with a bang and he whipped the rope around something as the heavy spar followed it the sloop rolled at the same time until half her deck was in the sea the sheet was torn furiously through his hands and the canoe hit her with another heavy thud as she swayed up again then it drove astern and frank had space to gather his breath and look about him as they swept on into smoother water  harry was edging in toward the low black ridge of the island and there was a higher mass on the opposite side crested with what appeared to be rows of pines with a dark gap between them they could now hear the surf on the weather side of the island which told them that they were already behind it four or five minutes later the channel twisted and as they swept around a black rock two or three lights blinked out ahead with a low red blaze behind them apparently on the opposite beach  there she is ready to clear at the shortest notice said harry stretching out a pointing hand theyve kept the boomforesail and most of the mainsail on her though i guess the anchors down well get the centerboard up  they were drawing nearer the lights rapidly but it was two or three minutes before frank who heaved the board up into its case could make out a black mass of fluttering canvas against the sky then harry spoke again  theres a shingle bank runs out not far ahead and there cant be much water over it now the tides nearly run out im afraid ill have to pass on the other hand of the schooner  frank could understand why he did not want to do this since the channel was narrow and they must pass between the lights of the vessel and the fire upon the beach it seemed to him that it would be singularly awkward if they met a boat coming from or going to the latter which however was precisely what befell them  harry ran the sloop off as far as he dared and frank was watching the schooners black hull rise higher when he made out a dim shape that moved between her and the beach  a boat sure cried harry get the mainsheet in well have to take our chances of the shoal  he helped frank with one hand but the task was almost beyond their strength and while they dragged at the rope the halfseen boat and the schooner seemed to be flying toward them then as they made the rope fast and the sloop headed in toward the island a pale gleam from a light on the vessel fell upon her it seemed impossible to frank that they should not be seen but nobody hailed them and while he listened expecting every moment to hear a shout a clatter of blocks broke through the splash of approaching oars even behind the island the water was rather broken and the men seemed to be pulling hard  a moment later the light faded off the sloop though frank could see the schooner comparatively plainly her tall shadowy canvas was fluttering athwart the light and beneath it a cluster of indistinct figures rose and fell as they heaved up something with a tackle he could hear their voices clearly and he was glad to remember that the dusky ridge of the island rose behind the sloop though he wished his companion would run closer in with it he had seen all he wanted and only desired to get away as soon as possible  it became evident by and by that harry had run in closer than was advisable for there was a crash and the sloop suddenly stopped almost immediately afterward she lay over with her boom and most of her deck on one side in the water while the tide twisting her bows around threatened to pour into her over the depressed coaming as she had come up nearly head to wind her mainsail thrashed furiously jerking the boom up out of the sea every now and then and letting it splash in again while the flapping jib seemed likely to snap off the head of her rattling mast loose ropes appeared to be flying everywhere and frank clung stupidly to the coaming uncertain what to do they were aground unfortunately close to the schooner and he feared within sight of the men on board her harrys voice however roused him to make an effort  jump forward with the big oar we must get her off he said the tides still falling  frank trod upon and fell over the dog who fortunately was unable to see anything over the coaming he scarcely heard it yelping as he scrambled along the steeply slanted deck dragging the heavy oar they got it over and thrust upon it in desperate haste in an attempt to cant her bow off but as the tide swung her farther around her side came up against the oar threatening to break it or pitch the boys over the rail and for a while they strained every muscle in vain then she suddenly swung back in the midst of a furious swirl and frank fell down on something that seemed unpleasantly hard harry flinging the oar upon the deck dropped close by feeling for a rope  get up and get hold he cried breathlessly we must box her round with the jib you can lie down afterward  frank scrambled up and pulled in a frenzy and the boat swung farther around then the mainsail ceased fluttering and jumping aft they fell into the well where frank fancied that he trod upon the dog again harry immediately seized the tiller thrusting it to weather and the sloop commenced to move slowly through the water though there was a harsh grinding beneath her by and by she suddenly shot forward again  shes off exclaimed harry give her sheet  frank let the mainsheet run and afterward leaned breathlessly upon the coaming with a thrill of relief as they drove out into the deeper water but it appeared that his companion was not satisfied yet  she should run over to the opposite side without bringing the boom across he said there seems to be a big rock yonder and we could heave her to in the gloom of it if i remember its good water  what for asked frank who was anxious to get out of the channel  well said harry weve seen the schooner a boat and a fire upon the beach but after all thats not a great deal to go upon we want to make sure what shes putting ashore  the boom lifted ominously as he ran her off and frank fancied that somebody would certainly hear the crash if he jibed it over she stretched across however and rounding her up close beneath a dark rock they hauled the jib to windward and waited though they were in deep shadow a stream of flickering radiance fell upon the water not far away and lighted up a narrow strip of beach a few minutes passed and then harry touched his companion who saw several men cross the shingle with loads upon their shoulders their figures showed black against the light and frank fancied that they were carrying square wooden cases after them came several more figures but these carried nothing and were dressed differently they looked like chinamen and they had evidently just got out of an unseen boat  now said harry i guess that will do if youll trim the jib over ill get way on her  frank was glad to do it he felt that he had seen quite enough and it would be wiser to get away before any misadventure befell them they ran out of the channel and were thrashing closehauled into a rather steep head sea when harry spoke again  there were four cases in the last lot and another boat went ashore he observed it looks as if they would swamp the market dopes dear and a little of it goes a mighty long way  perhaps there was something else in some of the cases suggested frank  its possible though from the little i know of the tariff i havent an idea of what it could be anyway thats a proposition we can leave to barclay they were certainly chinamen and passengers who landed  how do you know they were passengers frank inquired  harry laughed if theyd been anything else theyd have had to carry those boxes as a general thing an american doesnt work while a chinaman watches him  nothing more was said and half an hour later when pale moonlight once more streamed down upon the water the schooner swept out of the gloom astern of them after that they went about and clung to the shadow along the land until they lost sight of her shortly before they ran into the cove  it was very late when they reached the ranch but they merely informed miss oliver that they had had some trouble through the canoe going adrift and had been compelled to beat back against a strong head wind     chapter xix  the cache   mr oliver came home soon after the boys visit to the island and when he had heard harrys narration of their adventures he made him tell it over again in the presence of mr barclay whom he had brought back with him they were sitting in the logwalled kitchen in the evening with their chairs drawn up about the stove and mr barclay holding his pipe in his hand listened gravely  well he said when harry had finished you seem to be considerably more fortunate in these matters than i am you have seen the schooner several times and other interesting things while i havent even had a glimpse of the man with the high shoulder yet i suppose ill have to admit at last that ive been upon his trail for some time and have made some progress  you might as well have admitted it in the beginning retorted harry some folks progress slow  mr barclays eyes twinkled as a rule its difficult to hustle the government of the united states and im inclined to think the same thing applies to that of other countries however as i said we have got ahead a little at the other end for example we have a tolerably accurate notion where the dope goes  then why dont you corral everybody who has anything to do with it  mr barclays gesture seemed to beg the boys forbearance  its a sensible question for one thing strictly speaking its not my particular business which is really to sit in an office and dictate instructions most of the time to some extent these jaunts ive had with your father have been undertaken by way of innocent relaxation although they may prove useful in case certain gentlemen send me along a list of peremptory questions on which they want reports they do things of that kind now and then  i didnt think it was your business to take a smuggler by the neck and haul him along to the sheriff said harry with a reproachful air still you could call out your subordinates and send them off to round up the dope crowd couldnt you there must be some official machinery for doing that kind of thing  there is assented mr barclay refilling his pipe the trouble is that it makes a certain amount of commotion and when silence is important you have to be careful how you set it to work as a rule its wiser to have everything ready first the most careful plans fail sometimes if your assistants are more keen than judicious thatand he smiled at the boysis why i was dubious about taking you into my confidence before  thank you sir said harry with ironical courtesy do you mind making what you mean to do a little plainer  ill try in the first place smuggling doesnt seem to be considered a crime unless youre caught at it in fact a government of any kind is generally looked upon as fair game and few people think much the worse of a man who succeeds in doing it out of part of its revenue how far that ideas right or wrong doesnt concern me what i must do is to prevent it from being acted on too often and taking the notion for granted we dont want to put the laugh upon ourselves if it can be avoided  harry made a sign of comprehension still if you sent your people down here they should be able to corral part of the gang  i agree with you barclay answered dryly its possible anywaybut what would the result be three or four persons of no importance might be seized the rest would get away with a warning and our plans would all be sprung then the stout goodhumored man seemed to change for his expression suddenly hardened and a look which the boys had never noticed there before crept into his eyes no sir we want them all and when we move we expect to gather in the whole rascally combination  how can we butt in  with your fathers permission you might in the first place invite me to an evenings flight shooting  wouldnt it be better to go across the island in the daytime with the dog and jake and a couple of spades  no replied mr barclay if my opinions of any value i dont think it would be wise besides i understand that the best time for getting a shot at flighting ducks is in the twilight  miss oliver laughed softly enterprise is a good thing and so is selfconfidence she broke in on the other hand i fancy that one can have too much of them and a headstrong impatience is one of the faults of the young west  mr oliver looked at harry who grew a trifle red  theres truth in that he remarked on the whole it might be better to leave all arrangements to the man in charge and just do what he suggests  sure assented harry and as he offered no more suggestions the matter was decided with a few more words  late in the next afternoon the boys set out with mr barclay in the sloop and as what wind there was blew off the land they crept along close in with the beach which was high and rocky and shrouded with thick timber when they drew abreast of the island the tide was higher than it had been on the last occasion but mr barclay said that they had better leave the sloop in the little bay in front of them and cross the channel in the canoe he was a heavy man and when he cautiously dropped into the craft her stern sank ominously near the water  youll have to get farther forward and sit quite still said harry in a tone of authority but with an amused look  he took his place astern with frank who picked up the other paddle in the bow and a stroke or two drove them out into the rippling tide it was growing dark though the sky overhead was softly blue and there was a glimmer of pale saffron around part of the horizon to the eastward the moon was just appearing above a bank of cloud the wind which had freshened blew very cold and frank shivered until the paddling warmed him and he found that he could spare no thought for anything else the tide was running over the shallows with a ripple that splashed perilously high about the side of the deeply loaded canoe and now and then whirling eddies drove them off their course once too they ran aground and harry had to get in kneedeep to shove the craft off while when they approached the end of the island they had to struggle hard for several minutes against the stream which broke into little frothing waves during which the canoe got very wet they came through however and reaching smoother water ran the canoe in and pulled her out after which frank was about to walk off up the beach when harry stopped him  one learns by experience and i dont feel like swimming he observed well carry her right up and hide her in the bushes  they did so with some difficulty and harry afterward waited until mr barclay spoke  we came out shooting said the latter i dont see any reason why we shouldnt get a duck  he turned to harry as if to ascertain whether he objected to this but the boy laughed  if you dont know of any i neednt bother about the thing he answered theres a moderate breeze right off the beach and the guns couldnt be heard far to windward  im not sure id mind them being heard if anybody chanced to be about it might save the inquisitive stranger from wondering what we were doing here and the excuse strikes me as a nicer one than going swimming late at night in front of a siwash rancherie  harry chuckled wait until you fall over your boot tops into a pool or follow a crippled duck through the water  i shall endeavor to avoid the first thing said mr barclay theres a remedy for the other so long as ive two assistants  they went back to the beach and waited there some time until frank heard a regular beat of wings and a drawnout wedge of dusky bodies appeared above the trees dotted upon the sky he was farthest from them and he watched mr barclay who had brought a gun with him standing an indistinct halfseen figure thirty or forty yards away at last the man threw up his arms there was a quick yellow flash a crash and then a second streak of flame leaping from the smoke after that there followed two distinct and unmistakable thuds and frank pitched up his gun as harry fired he heard two jarring reports and running forward saw mr barclay pick up a bird that had fallen almost at his feet  theres another over yonder the latter remarked  harry found it in a minute or two and handed it to him  one with each barrel he said and added with a rueful laugh i dont see any more about  then i think well take a look around the island mr barclay answered  he left the beach with the boys but they dropped behind him and let him take the lead when they reached the scrubby firs which were scattered more or less thickly about the rocky ground frank fancied that harry had some reason for doing this and the supposition was confirmed when mr barclay stopped a moment beside a brake of withered fern and then after stooping down carefully skirted it as he went on again the sky was clear and though the moon was in its first quarter it shed a faint elusive light  that man can shoot and it looks as if he was quite as smart at picking up a trail said harry in a low tone anyway if id been looking for a strangers tracks id have tried yonder fern and id have been as particular not to smash any of it down as he was ive an idea he must have chuckled sometimes when i got guying him he paused and added thoughtfully its the kind of fool thing youre apt to do unless youre careful  after this they spent a considerable time wandering up and down a portion of the island though frank fancied that mr barclay who asked harry a question now and then had some purpose that guided him the moonlight was too dim and the shadows among the trees too dense for him to follow a trail steadily but he seemed to be prospecting for likely places where footprints or brokendown undergrowth might be found at length they reached a little stony hollow with a rock that rose some six or seven feet on one side and dark firs clustering close about it here mr barclay stopped and looked about him before he turned to harry  now he said this is a spot that could be easily described and located by anybody who happened to be told about it that rock would make a firstclass mark if you had anything to bury for somebody else to dig up where would you put it  harry walked about the place stepping carefully upon the stones and avoiding the scattered underbrush until he reached a clump of withered fern  right here he replied and kneeling down pulled some of the yellow fronds about then he looked up sharply this stuffs very dead and its lying flat he exclaimed farther on the stems arent broken and some of them dont seem quite dried up yet  frank acknowledged that these were things he would not have noticed but mr barclay nodded  somebody else may have fixed on the same spot as you have done he said its possible though i dont think its more than that there might be half a dozen similar places on the island but if youll handle the fern carefully it wouldnt do any harm to make a hole  they had brought a light spade with them and after harry had cleared the ground frank set to work with it he had taken out only a few shovelfuls of soil and shingle when he gave a cry of surprise as he struck something that seemed more solid  harry and mr barclay stooped down beside him the latter struck a match and lighted a piece of paper he took from his pocket and before it went out frank had cleared the soil away from the top of a small wooden case  its rather more than i could have reasonably expected said mr barclay but when you havent much to act upon its wise to make the most of what youve got and leave the rest to chance now you may as well shovel that dirt back  arent you going to take the thing out frank asked in astonishment  no replied mr barclay i dont think its necessary it wouldnt be the first time id seen opium and we dont want to leave too plain a trail behind us as we have spent some time on the island already hadnt you better get to work  frank flung back the soil and when he had finished harry replaced the loose fern which he had carefully laid aside he did not however seem satisfied with the way he had arranged it and when he looked up at mr barclay his manner was diffident  im afraid i cant do any better in the dark he said  it will probably be dark when the next man comes along mr barclay answered anyway the first breeze of wind or heavy rain will straighten things up in the meanwhile well get back to the sloop  they turned away but they had scarcely gone a hundred yards when mr barclay put his hand into his pocket and stopped  ive dropped my pipe he said it was rather a good one  then i know where it is frank broke in you must have pulled it out with the paper i heard something fall but i was too interested to bother about it if youll wait ill go back and get it  the others sat down when he left them but he spent some minutes scrambling about near the fern before the faint gleam of a silver band upon the pipe caught his eye picking it up he turned back to rejoin his companions and a few moments later he reached an opening between the firs by which they had left the hollow the trees rose in black and shadowy masses on either side but their ragged tops cut sharply against the sky and a faint uncertain light shone down into the gap between them soon after he strode into it frank stopped abruptly for there was a crackle of dry twigs and a soft rustle somewhere in front of him and he could think of no reason why harry or mr barclay should come back if they had wanted him to do anything they could have called him  he felt his nerves tingle as he stood and listened the sound had ceased and he could only hear the wind among the firs whose tops rustled eerily but presently the unmistakable fall of a heavy foot came out of the shadows then he shrank back instinctively a pace or two into deeper gloom for there was no doubt that somebody was approaching and while he waited a black figure appeared in the opening not far in front of him the faint light was behind the man and he showed up against it dim and indistinct but frank realized that he was not mr barclay he looked taller and less heavily built then the boy dropped noiselessly and held his breath for a brittle branch had cracked under him the stranger stopped and seemed to be gazing about him  he moved on again however and frank turned his face toward the ground fearing that it might show white in the gloom but it was only by a determined effort that he held himself still and mastered the desire to crawl back farther into the shadow he knew that if he yielded to it he would be on his feet in another moment and might break away into the bush or do something else which he would afterward regret he realized that mr barclay and harry must have seen the stranger and had for some reason kept out of sight and let him go by  in the meanwhile the man was drawing nearer and frank made out that he was carrying something it seemed almost impossible that he could pass without seeing the boy and the effort it cost the latter to lie still became more arduous it would have been an unspeakable relief even to spring up and face the stranger with empty hands then he drew level and once more frank set his lips as he listened to the footsteps at every moment he expected them suddenly to stop they continued however and although since he dared not turn he could not see the man now it was clear that he had passed  frank waited a minute or two longer and then rose softly with a gasp of fervent relief he was annoyed to feel that he was still quivering with the tension and he stood still a few moments to regain his composure before he went quietly back toward his companions as he neared the spot where he had left them mr barclay stepped out from behind a tree  you met that man he asked  yes said frank that is i saw him coming and kept out of the way he walked close by me and i think he was carrying a spade  he was mr barclay assented i was afraid he might surprise you but we couldnt shout and warn you without alarming him which i didnt want to do for one or two reasons well wait here until hes through with the business that brought him  he drew frank farther back among the trees and soon after they sat down a faint rustling followed by a clatter of stones reached them from the hollow there was no doubt that the man was digging up the case harry who was lying near franks feet moved restlessly and at length he rose  that fellows certainly one of the gang he said i dont see why we shouldnt get him frank and i could work around behind the hollow and head him off while you walk in  well said mr barclay dryly what would follow  you could have him sent up  i daresay i could what would be the use of it  youd have got one of them anyway  sure said mr barclay and id have scared off all the rest i suppose i must be greedy but i wouldnt be content with one bush chopper who probably only takes a hand in now and then as i believe i told you im after the whole gang  harry said nothing further for a while and then he stopped and listened  hes coming back he whispered  the sound of footsteps came out of the shadow and presently frank saw a dusky figure pass among the trees carrying something upon its shoulder besides the spade they waited until there was silence again and then moved quietly back to the beach from which they saw a canoe cross the channel half an hour later they paddled across and duly reached the sloop  if that man had known she was here he would probably not have gone mr barclay observed as he didnt see her when there was a little light left its reasonable to suppose he couldnt have noticed her coming back in the dark and on the whole im satisfied with the result of the trip but it might be better if you went somewhere else for your flight shooting after this  then they set the mainsail and started back for the cove keeping close in along the beach     chapter xx  mr websters slashing   a month passed which the boys spent quietly in grubbing up stumps and chopping then mr oliver suggested that they go over to mr websters ranch and burn off his slashing as he had promised its absent owner to send them he added that they could camp there for the night and get a little hunting when they had done the work there was a nipping air when they started early in the morning each with a packet of provisions and a blanket upon his shoulder and the newly turned clods in the clearing were ironhard the pacific slope is warmer in winter than the atlantic coast but there are times when the cold snaps are sharp enough in its northern part and the boys were glad to plunge into the shelter of the woods where the frost was less stinging  they reached the ranch without much trouble and when they stopped at the slip rails frank who had not been there before looked about him the bush clearings are much alike but this one was smaller than mr olivers a little very rudely built log house stood at one end with thick timber creeping close up behind it there was also an unusual quantity of underbrush among the stumps near the door which frank had occasion to notice more particularly later in the meanwhile it struck him that the place had an uncaredfor look and harry seemed to share his opinion  websters a very ordinary rancher he remarked he cant stay with a thing and finish it when hes about halfway through he lets up and starts something else any other man would have grubbed out all that withered stuff about the house and chopped back the bush behind it its not safe to have big trees growing so close  why asked frank  because of the fires they come along every now and then its lucky theres no wind to speak of because i wouldnt put a light to this slashing if there was  frank glanced at the belt of fallen timber behind the fence on one side of the clearing it had been badly cut and some of the trees lay across each other while only a few of the branches had been sawed off and the undergrowth had not been mowed if the fall had not been a dry one it would have been difficult to burn the slashing then he glanced up at the leadengray sky above the pine tops and fancied that it looked threatening the dense wall of somber sprays seemed unusually harsh of aspect and there was something curious about the light everything was gray and rawedged and he shivered for the faint wind had blown across a wilderness of snowy mountains  its not the kind of day for hanging round he said lets get to work  entering the house they found a can of coal oil and plenty of rags for a heap of wornout clothing lay in a corner  theyll hold oil and thats about all theyre good for harry remarked i expect its months since webster pitched them there with the idea that he might mend them sometime  frank carried out one or two of the duck garments and when they had torn them up and soaked them in coal oil he and harry set about lighting fires here and there in the slashing after which they stood near the door of the house and watched the conflagration the fires spread rapidly and one side of the clearing was soon wrapped in crackling flame that worked backward from the neighborhood of the fence licking up branches and undergrowth as it neared the bush that did not stop it for the fire had flung out advance guards which leaped forward swiftly through the withered fern and hurled themselves in crimson waves upon the standing trunks they seemed to splash upon them flinging up fountains of blazing brands and sparks that seized upon the lower sprays and sprang aloft until each assaulted tree was wrapped in fire from base to summit the conflagration made the draught it needed and by and by it roared in what seemed to frank malicious triumph as it pressed onward into the forest under a cloud of rolling smoke where it would stop he did not know but he was almost uncomfortably impressed by the spectacle  its a fullpower burn said harry approvingly guess its going to clean up this slashing and now well look around and see if websters left anything we can make our dinner in  there was a stove in the house but they soon discovered that it did not burn well and harry glanced disgustedly at the spider frank discovered  a hole in the bottom of it he said contemptuously thats the kind of thing webster uses ill be astonished if you dont find another hole in the kettle you had better go along to the well and fill it  in a few minutes frank came back with the kettle which fortunately did not leak and harry set it on the stove and laid a piece of pork in the spider which he tilted on one side  its going to be about an hour before that kettle boils and though i feel like doing it theres no use in straightening up this shack in the meanwhile because the man would muss it up again as soon as he comes back theres a slough beyond the rise yonder and as it lies to windward we might get a shot at something we could be back before dinners ready  frank would have preferred to stay where he was as he had already done a good mornings work he assented however and accompanied harry up a steep and very rough slope and down the opposite side of it when they reached the bottom they plunged into a waste of tall grass and halfdecayed vegetation among the roots of which the frost had not penetrated as the result of this they sank to the knees here and there and frank more than once fell down he soon had enough of it but he was beginning to realize that there was very little worth doing in the bush which could be accomplished so to speak with ones gloves on the small rancher and hunter must expect to get wet and ragged as well as weary and dirty and must face the unpleasantness cheerfully and mend his clothes afterward the only other course was to stay in the cities  presently harry discovered the tracks of a deer leading out of the valley and pointed them out to his companion  you wont mind waiting for your dinner he asked  nonot very much frank answered dubiously  this satisfied harry who led the way up the hillside and it seemed to frank that they scrambled over fallen logs and branches and through thick undergrowth for the greater part of an hour before they crept carefully down again to another hollow though they floundered all around it there was no sign of the deer and frank was relieved when his companion intimated that they might as well go back to the ranch dinner was the first thought in both their minds when they reached it but it struck frank that the fire had become a tremendous conflagration and he noticed that a dense cloud of smoke was blowing across the clearing  its a real fierce burn and theres more wind than there was but well get a meal before we look around harry remarked  there were however one or two difficulties in the way of their doing this the kettle had boiled nearly dry and the pork had disappeared through the burnedout bottom of the spider harry said that he could manage to fry another piece on the rim of it if frank would refill the kettle and eventually they sat down to dinner and spent a long while over it then harry got up reluctantly  i guess we had better see what the fires doing he observed  frank was almost appalled when he reached the doorway the whole clearing was thick with smoke out of which there shot up a furious wall of fire that rose and fell with a crackle resembling volleys of riflery and a roaring even more disconcerting what was worse it seemed to be creeping into the thick bush behind the house and harry running a few paces toward the corner of the building stopped aghast with the red light flickering on his dismayed face  dad promised hed get websters slashing burned but it wasnt in the contract that wed burn off his house he said well have to hustle see if theres an ax and grubhoe in that woodshed  frank found the tools and while he attacked the larger bushes near the back of the house harry began to cut down the undergrowth in front of it by and by frank came back and they dragged the brush away toward the clearing where it could burn harmlessly but the smoke grew more blinding and every now and then a shower of sparks fell about the boys fires sprang up among the underbrush and falling upon them with the ax and spade they savagely thrashed them out frank burned his hands in doing so but there was no time to trouble about that and he toiled on coughing and choking until at last they were forced to stop for breath  they stood close in front of the house with a mass of withered fern and halfburned brush smoldering in front of them while a sheet of fire rose and fell amidst dense clouds of smoke behind the building the daylight appeared to be dying out but frank could not be sure of that because it was almost dark one moment as the smoke rolled about them and the next they stood dazzled by a flood of radiance  we have done most all we can said harry wearily it was the wind getting up that made the troublei should have noticed itbut if it stands for the next half hour we ought to save the house the fires eating back into the bush all the while  should we get any of the things out frank asked  im not smart at handling hot stoves and theres mighty little else in the place harry answered with a laugh i wouldnt bid a dollar for websters pans and crockery and he made the table and the two chairs still i dont know any reason why we shouldnt sling them out  just then the smoke rolled down about the boys in a blinding cloud there was a great snapping and crackling and a shower of blazing fragments drove them back thirty or forty yards across the clearing presently the smoke thinned and a row of stripped trunks behind the house was outlined against a tremendous sheet of flame frank took off his hat and shook a few red embers from the crown of it  when we were getting those rags i noticed a keg behind them he said  a keg said harry sharply  a little keg it looked thick and strongly made  the red light struck full upon harrys face and frank saw that consternation was stamped upon it  then he said its full of coarse treesplitting powder some of the ranchers use it for blowing out stumps did you notice whether it had been opened  the head seemed loose and one of the hoops had been started  sure said harry with dismay in his voice then he broke out in quick anger its just the kind of thing webster would leave lying around near his stove without taking the trouble to head it up again hell have some detonators lying loose tooive heard he uses giant powder weve got to bring them out  they looked at each other with set faces while the sparks whirled about the house and both were conscious of an almost uncontrollable impulse to vacate the clearing with the greatest possible speed it was to their credit that they mastered it and in a moment or two harry spoke again  the sparks shouldnt get at the keg if we put a jacket over it and one of us could carry all the detonators websters likely to have in his pocket  frank had heard that the big copper caps which are used to fire giant powder will contain a tremendously powerful fulminate and he was conscious of a very natural reluctance to carry a number of them about his person through the showers of fiery particles that fell about the building indeed he afterward confessed that if harry had not been with him nothing would have induced him to approach it how he screwed up his courage he did not know but as the flame leaped up again the sight of a strip of blazing fence had its effect the rest of it had been destroyed and he felt they must make an effort to save the house  it wouldnt take us long to get the powder out he said with a note of uncertainty in his voice  harry sprang forward and frank was glad that he did so he realized that this was not a matter for calm discussion and vigorous action was a relief another cloud of smoke met them as they drew near the house and the sparks that came flying out of it fell thick about them the heat scorched their faces and they gasped in the acrid vapor while franks eyes were smarting intolerably when he staggered into the building there was however less smoke inside it and a fierce light beat in through one window flinging the old clothes about they came upon the keg and found that the head was lying loose working in desperate haste they forced the top hoop upward and harry wrapped a woolen garment over the top of the keg after that he flung everything in a lidless wooden case out upon the floor and pounced upon a little box that fell among the rest  detonators he shouted whats in the packet near you  frank tore the paper savagely it looks like thick black cord  fuse said harry its harmless i dont see any giant powder hold on ill look around his sleeping room  he vanished through an inner door and frank soon heard him throwing things about the suspense of the next few moments was almost unbearable a pulsating radiance alternately lighted up the room and grew dim again and the roar and crackle of the fire set his nerves tingling then harry ran back toward him  i cant find any giant powder he reported and added get hold of the keg well carry it between us  frank set his lips as they sprang out of the door with it the keg was not remarkably heavy but it was an awkward shape and too big for either of them to carry on his shoulder or beneath his arm indeed frank felt his hands slipping from its rounded end and he was horribly afraid of dropping it among the patches of smoldering undergrowth and glowing fragments which lay all about him a few moments later thick smoke whirled about him and he hardly breathed as he struggled through it until it blew away again then to his relief he saw that the house was some distance behind them and they were clear of the worst of the sparks they went on however to the opposite side of the clearing where they deposited the powder and then dropped the detonators a little farther on after which harry sat down on the frozen ground panting heavily  its done and i want to get my breath he said the next time i burn a slashing ill see theres no powder about the place before i begin  frank made no answer he was glad to sit still and recover for the strain had told on him indeed he was almost sorry when his companion stood up again  perhaps we had better get back and pitch some water on the roof he suggested i was too busy to think of that before  the wind seemed to be dropping and the sparks were not quite so bad when they reached the house they found a bucket and after smashing more of the ice upon the shallow well frank climbed up on the woodshed which reached to the low roof the latter was covered with cedar shingles and he wondered why it had not ignited because the sparks were still dropping upon it and there were several charred spots this however was not a question of much consequence and harry kept him busy during the next half hour sluicing the roof with water which he passed up in the bucket some of it went over franks hands and clothing and it was icy cold but they worked on steadily while the fire worked back farther from them into the bush it had burned most fiercely when it had the dry branches in the slashing to supply it but these were all licked up and though the small stuff blazed the great standing trunks would not burn there were already rows of them rising charred and blackened columns behind the slashing  at last harry called frank down from the roof  you can let up he said its hardly likely well have any more trouble theres a lamp and some canned stuff in the shack and as well have to camp here ill make some coffee its quite dark now  frank concluded that it had been dark some time though he had not noticed when dusk crept down he was glad to find the stove still burning when he entered the house very wet and aching in every limb the kettle was soon boiling and as there was no bottom in the spider harry who had found a bag of flour and a can of syrup contrived to make some flapjacks and what he called biscuit on the top of the stove he said that this would be no drawback because mr webster never blacked the thing and frank found no fault with the cakes when they ate them hot with syrup  then they filled up the stove with the full draught on and lounged contentedly beside it while their clothing dried on them they had had a heavy day but now that the danger was over they were no more than comfortably weary and the thrill of the last stirring hours remained with them frank felt that they had done something worth while that afternoon  when he diffidently pointed it out harry laughed  sure he agreed still its quite likely that webster will get jumping mad when he sees his fence though it wont take him many days to split enough rails for a new one  a little later frank walked across the room and opened the door the undergrowth on one side of the clearing gleamed white with frost on the other side a few big branches still snapped and glowed and there was a red glare behind the black rows of trunks but it was now broken by patches of darkness and he could see that the fire was rapidly dying out he came back with a shiver and sat down in his warm seat beside the stove     chapter xxi  a night on the sands   there was a sprinkle of snow upon the ground and the boys were working in mr olivers slashing one afternoon a week after their visit to mr websters ranch when harry who had just hauled up a log stopped his oxen and addressed his father  it looks as if it would be a fine night he remarked  yes said mr oliver ive no fault to find with the weather well get most of the logs piled for burning if it lasts  harry smiled at frank dads slow to take a hint i wasnt thinking of the logs  i can believe it mr oliver retorted anyway they have to be hauled out and its easier to do it now than when the soils soft and boggy  frank who had been heaving the sawed trunks on top of one another with jake agreed with the rancher the big masses of timber slid easily over the snow and they were clean to handle which was something to be thankful for after the difficulty they had had in moving them when they were foul with clotted mire the frost as he had discovered seldom lasted long in that country but it was very cold and the firs towered flecked with snow against a clear blue sky  i was wondering if there was any reason why we shouldnt try to get a duck tonight said harry we wont go near the island where the cache is theres a flat behind the other one to the southward  i can think of one reason his father answered you wont feel like working tomorrow and theres a good deal of loghauling to be done  well be ready to start as usual persisted harry  then you can go on that condition but youll have to stick to it i dont mind your getting a few hours shooting now and then but i expect you to be ranchers first of all when theres work on hand  harry repeated his assurance and mr oliver made no more objections when they had heaved up the next log jake turned to the boys  therell be a moon and i guess youre not going to do much on the flats he said you want to cut two very short paddles and put some spruce brush that you can lie on in the canoe then if you keep quite flat you might creep up on a flock of ducks in one of the channels you cant do it if you use the ordinary paddle kneeling  he split them two flat slabs off the butt of a cedar but mr oliver who was chopping nearby looked around when harry began to hack them into shape  what are those for he asked  paddles harry answered with some hesitation  youre logging just now said his father dryly i want another tier put up before its dark  harry laid down the halffinished paddles and grinned at frank  i guess dads quite right but his way of staying with it gets riling now and then  frank laughed one day when harry had hurt his knee and there was no work of any consequence on hand mr oliver had taken him out into the bush and the boy had a painful recollection of the journey they had made together no thicket was too dense or thorny for the rancher to scramble through and he prowled about the steepest slopes and amongst the thickest tangles of fallen logs with the same unflagging persistency until at the first shot he killed a deer mr oliver was as his son and jake sometimes said a stayer one who invariably put through what he took in hand he was the kind of person frank aspired to become though he was discovering that he was not likely to accomplish it by taking things easily success it seemed could only be attained by ceaseless effort and constant carefulness  he went on with the logging though the work was remarkably heavy and it was an occupation he had no liking for but he helped harry to finish the paddles after supper then they carried a bundle of spruce twigs down to the canoe and though there was not much wind tied a reef in the sloops mainsail which mr oliver had insisted on before they loosed the moorings  an hour later and shortly before low water they let go the anchor in a lane of water which wound into a stretch of sloppy sand it was just deep enough for the sloop to creep into with her centerboard up and the flats ran back from it into a thin mist on either side it was very cold and the deck glittered in the pale moonlight white with frost frank stood up looking about him while harry arranged the twigs in the canoe but there was very little to see the sky was hazy the moon was encircled by a halo and wet sand and winding water glimmered faintly at one point he could dimly make out the dark loom of an island but there was no sign of the beach in front of him though he could feel a light wind on his face it was very still except for the ripple of water and the occasional splash of undermined sand falling into the channel which seemed startlingly distinct once he heard a distant calling of wildfowl but it died away again  dropping into the canoe when his companion was ready he took up one of the longer paddles the water was quite smooth and they made good progress but harry did not seem satisfied  if id had any sense id have brought a pole to shove her with he complained its handier in shallow water and the ducks seem to be a long way up a creek that runs out on the beach makes this channel  frank paddled on watching the sloppy banks slide by and the palely gleaming strip of water run back into the haze in front of him until at last it forked off into two branches  well try this one said harry i believe it works right around behind the island the flood should come up that end first and it ought to drive the feeding birds back over the sands to us  the water got deeper as they proceeded for frank could feel no bottom when he sank his blade but there was no sign of any duck until at last they heard a faint quacking in the mist soon afterward there was a shrill scream as a flock of some of the smaller waders wheeled above their heads  now said harry well try jakes idea if the ducks arent on the water theyll be along the edge of it where the banks soft you dont often find them feeding where the sands dry and hard  they placed the guns handy and lying down upon the spruce brush dipped the short blades frank found the position a very uncomfortable one to paddle in and he could not keep his hands from getting wet though the water was icy cold they were fast becoming swollen and tingled painfully in the stinging frost still the boys made some progress and at last looking up at a whisper from harry frank saw a dark patch upon the water some distance in front of him harry edged the canoe closer in with the bank which had a slope of two or three feet on that side  after that they crept on slowly because they dared not use much force for fear of splashing and franks wet fingers were rapidly growing useless the ducks became a little more distinct and he could see other birds moving about in the faint gleam on the opposite bank some of them standing out against the wet surface looked extraordinarily large though he could not tell what they were  at last a sudden eerie screaming broke out close ahead and frank started and almost dropped his paddle as a second flock of waders rose from the gloom of the bank they flashed white in the moonlight as they turned and wheeled on simultaneously slanted wings then they vanished for a moment as their dusky upper plumage was turned toward the boys gleamed again more dimly and the haze swallowed them they had however given the alarm and the air was filled with the harsh clamor of startled wildfowl  now cried harry before the ducks get up  frank flung in his paddle and pitched his gun to his shoulder with the barrel resting on the side of the canoe it sparkled in the moonlight distracting his sight and stung his wet hand but he could see dark bodies rising from the water ahead as he pressed the trigger harrys gun blazed across the bows and following the double crash there was an outbreak of confused sound the sharp splash of webbed feet that trailed through water a discordant screaming and the beat of many wings indistinct objects whirled across the moonlight and as frank with stiffened fingers snapped open the breach harrys gun once more flung out a train of yellow sparks then the smoke hung about them smelling curiously acrid in the frosty air and they seized the paddles to drive the canoe clear of it when they had left it behind them the lane of water was empty except for one small dark patch upon it and the clamor of the wildfowl was dying away they had paddled a few yards when frank made out that something was stumbling away from them along the shadowy bank but they were almost abreast of it before he could get another shell into the chamber the bird lay still when he fired and harry picked up the duck on the water after which he ran the canoe ashore  so far as i could see the rest of them headed across the flat toward the other channel he said it looks soft here but as youll have to get out to pick up the duck yonder it might be a good idea if you followed them over the sand ill work along the creek and its likely that any birds i put up will fly over you  this seemed possible to frank who realized that the walk would warm him and he stepped out of the canoe into several inches of slushy sand floundering through it he picked up the duck and threw it to harry who shoved the canoe out  i wont go far and you had better head back toward the forks in half an hour or so he said ill probably be waiting  the canoe slid away and frank felt sorry that he had left her when he reached the harder top of the bank the level flat which stretched away before him into the mist looked very desolate and the deep stillness had a depressing effect on him he also remembered that in another hour or less the flood tide would come creeping back across the dreary waste he could however think of no reasonable excuse for rejoining his companion and turning his back on the channel he set out across the sand nothing moved upon it as he plodded on the silence seemed to be growing deeper and he had an idea that the haze was denser than it had been still he determined to make the round harry had suggested and quickened his pace  it was some time later when he heard a double report that sounded a long way off and he stopped to listen when the clamor of the wildfowl broke out again it died away but he fancied that a faint rhythmic sound stole out of the silence that followed it a minute later he was sure that a flight of ducks was crossing the flat and what was more that the birds were heading toward him as yet he could see nothing of them for there was now no doubt that the mist was thicker he crouched down as the sound increased as it occurred to him that he would be too plainly visible standing up in the moonlight on the level flat  the sound drew nearer growing in a steady crescendo until he wondered that a ducks wing could make so much noise and at last a number of shadowy objects broke out of the mist flying low and swiftly in regular formation the gun flashed and the ducks swept on and vanished all but one which came slowly fluttering down out of the mist  frank spent nearly a minute fumbling with stiffened fingers while he crammed in another shell and then saw that the duck was running across the sand some way off closing the breach he set off after it and had got a little nearer when it rose fluttered awkwardly and fell again though it was able to make good progress on its feet twice he got within sixty yards of it but on one occasion it flew a little way and on the second it swam across a long pool which he had to run around indeed it led him a considerable distance before he brought it down  picking it up he stopped and looked about him it was pleasant to feel a little warmer but there was nothing to guide him toward the other fork of the channel except the drift of the mist and the chill of the wind upon one side of his face and he could not be sure that the wounded bird had led him straight the flat was level and bare except for little pools of water on which were glistening filaments of ice it was however too cold to stand still with wet feet and consider and deciding that the sooner he got down to the forks the sooner he would be back on board the sloop he set off briskly he had had enough of wandering about that desolate waste  at last to his relief he saw a faint silvery glimmer ahead in the mist and turning off he struck the channel a little lower down there was no sign of a duck or anything else but he was by no means sorry for this for his one idea was to get back to the forks as soon as possible and the surest way of doing it was to follow the creek it appeared to be a considerable distance though he walked as fast as he could splashing straight through shallow pools and slipping in halffrozen mud and when at last he reached the spot where the channels branched off he could see nothing of harry or the canoe what troubled him almost as much was the fact that the stream was now flowing inland and after a quick glance at it he shouted with all his might his voice rang along the water and level sand but though he called again no answer came out of the drifting mist then he slipped his hand into his pocket to get a cartridge and drew it out again with an exclamation of disgust recollecting that he had only picked up three or four loose shells in the canoe  for a moment he stood still considering and it occurred to him that the situation was not a pleasant one the flood tide was making and he did not know how far off the beach was while he had no desire to spend the night in the woods he could not see the island and in order to reach it he would have to cross the main channel which as he remembered was moderately deep on the whole it seemed wiser to wade through the smaller fork and if harry did not overtake him in the meanwhile try to get on board the sloop she would float in very shallow water with her centerboard up and he had touched bottom with the canoe paddle a few yards away from her  when he had arrived at this decision he plunged into the water which immediately rose above the top of his long boots it was horribly cold but this caused him less concern than the fact that it rippled strongly against his legs which made it clear that he must get down to the sloop as fast as possible he was over his knees before he got across and then he ran his hardest along the edge of the channel which seemed to be growing wider at every moment the palely gleaming water was perfectly smooth but it was moving with an ominous speed  he grew breathless but he did not slacken the pace he went straight splashing through trickling water and into pools while he strained his eyes for the first glimpse of the sloop but he could only see the mist which hid the sand thirty or forty yards in front of him at last he made out a strip of something solid low down ahead and then what seemed to be a mast and a few moments later he stopped at the waters edge there was nothing but water in front of him and it was no longer quite smooth little ripples ran along the sand and one broke about his feet while he gazed at them it did not recede but splashed on and when he looked around there was at least a yard of water behind him then he struggled with a paralyzing sense of dismay and strove to keep his head it was necessary to think and think very hard  he could not wait where he was with the water deepening about him while if he went back and did not find harry before he reached it the creek which he would no longer be able to cross would head him off if he followed it up on the near side it would take him away from the canoe and he did not know how far off the beach was there was evidently only one thing to be done and that was to get on board the sloop even if he had to swim  she seemed a horribly long way out but he splashed in hurriedly afraid to wait a moment lest his resolution should melt away and he was soon waistdeep with a strong stream swirling around him it was almost impossible to keep his feet the gun hampered him and the coldness of the water seemed to check his breathing and take the power out of his limbs he could not go back however and face a journey through the mist across the waste of sand and setting his lips he struggled on twice he was almost swept away but at last making a savage effort he clutched the stern of the craft and scrambled up on to her deck  the first thing he did was to light the stove and when a pleasant warmth began to fill the cabin he was conscious of a strong desire to sit still and dry his clothes that unfortunately was out of the question and he reluctantly crawled out and stood up on deck there was nothing but water around him now it stretched back on every side into the mist and the only sounds were the soft lap of the tide and the ripple it made flowing over thinly covered sand then having already decided that harry would have some difficulty in paddling against the stream he set about getting sail upon the craft to go in search of the canoe  the mainsail looked remarkably big and heavy and he was thankful that there was a reef in it which made the task a little easier before he got it up then he spent several minutes in very hard work heaving the boat up to her anchor and bruised his swollen hands in the determined effort it cost him to break it out after that he set the jib and the sloop slid gently away with the wind abeam of her he did not know exactly where she was going but he shouted as loudly as he could every now and then and at last there was a faint answering cry  he called again and the cry rose more clearly after which he hauled the sheet and changed his course and by and by the canoe appeared out of the haze close ahead a few moments later harry paddled alongside and handing up the ducks and his gun made the canoe fast before he turned to frank  do you know where youre heading for he asked  no frank confessed ive only a notion that its in toward the land  then well drop the jib and pitch the anchor over well have to wait until the stream slackens before we get out again  they followed his suggestion and frank was glad indeed to creep back into the cozy cabin  this is uncommonly nice drawled harry sitting down with a smile of content it was horribly cramping in the canoe and my hands were most too cold to paddle  what kept you inquired frank  i must have gone farther than i intended and when i turned back the tide was running up so strong i could hardly make head against it i was getting scared about you when i reached the forks and saw how the water was spreading on the sand after that i didnt spare myself but i was mighty glad to hear your shout  did you get any more ducks  no said harry i had only one shota long one  frank who told him to make some coffee stripped off part of his clothes and dressed himself in an old blanket after which they sat beside the stove for an hour or so until harry crawled out and said that there was a little more wind and the mist was thinning  shortly after this they heaved the anchor and started again but once more the wind fell light and a couple of hours had passed and they were almost frozen when they reached the cove below the ranch the house was dark when they crept into it and went straight to bed while it cost frank a determined effort to get up before daylight next morning his clothes were still damp and he felt sore and aching but he took his place with the others when they sat down to breakfast  logging seemed a particularly unpleasant task that day but he had to go on with it and he fancied that mr oliver with whom it was necessary to keep pace worked harder than he usually did frank was completely exhausted when as darkness fell they went back to the ranch  are you going out again after ducks tonight mr oliver asked him  no said frank ruefully i feel as if it would take me a week to get over the last trip  im not very much astonished mr oliver answered with a soft laugh still i dont mind admitting that you stood up to your work today     chapter xxii  the ultimatum   the frost soon broke up and it was raining heavily one afternoon when the boys were at work in an excavation they had driven under a big fir stump shortly after their shooting trip frank very wet and dirty lay propped up on one elbow with his head and shoulders inside the hole chopping awkwardly at a root his legs and feet were in a pool of water outside and there was very little room to swing the ax while at every blow the saturated soil fell down on him grubbing out a stump in wet weather is a singularly disagreeable task  harry crouched close beside him where he was partly sheltered from the rain by the network of roots which rose above his head the boys had spent most of the day cutting through those which ran along the surface of the ground and digging to get at the rest until they had been forced to drive a tunnel to reach one or two which went vertically down for it was an unusually large stump at last when his ax shoved through the obstacle frank paused for breath and as it was getting dark in the excavation harry lighted a piece of candle the light fell upon a massive shaft of wet wood which sank into the ground  nobody fixed as we are could chop through that he grumbled its the big taproot and it would take most of another days shoveling to make room to get at it with the crosscut it looks as if wed have to put some giant powder in wheres that auger  frank reached out for the boring tool which resembled a huge corkscrew only that instead of a handle it had a hole at its upper end for the insertion of a short lever  ill bore while you get things ready if you like he suggested do you often use dynamite  we never fire a shot when we can help it though there are ranchers who get through a lot of the stuff giant powders expensive and though labors expensive too you have to figure whether a shots going to pay its worth while if it will save you grubbing most of the day slant the hole you bore a little upward while i go along for the magazine  harry crawled out of the excavation and frank slipped a crossbar through the hole in the auger driving the point of the latter into the wood it went in easily but the work grew harder as he twisted it round and round kneeling with his shoulders against the roots while the candle flickered and big drops of water trickled down on him the position was a cramping one and his wet hands slipped upon the crossbar but he had become accustomed to doing unpleasant things and it was evident that one could not clear a ranch without grubbing stumps  by and by harry came back and telling him to hold the light carefully produced what looked rather like a yellow candle and a piece of black cord with a copper cap nipped down on the end of it  thats the detonator he said pointing to the cap you saw one or two of them at websters ranch  i didnt feel inclined to stop and examine them then frank answered with a laugh  theyre very like the caps used for guns only as you see theyre bigger and its wise to be careful how you pinch one down on the fuse the stuff they fill the end with is mighty powerful sos giant powder but its peculiar because it will only burn unless you fire it with something that makes a bang at least thats what it does in a general way the trouble is you can never be quite sure of it  he worked the soft yellow substance over the detonator after which he thrust it gently into the auger hole and pressed a handful of soil down on it frank was thankful when he had finished for having heard of the tremendous powers of the giant powder he did not care to be shut up with it among that network of roots then harry straightening the strip of black fuse which projected from the hole took a quick glance about him  well make sure we can get out before we light it he remarked taking the candle and holding it to the fuse you dont want to stay around once the fuse is burning crawl back and hold those roots up out of my way  the candle was by this time sputtering and sparkling and frank swung himself up out of the hole and set off madly across the clearing shouting to mr oliver and jake who were at work not far away his companion following close behind stopped him presently  hold on he shouted with a laugh you neednt run right down to the cove giant powders kind of local in its action and that charge isnt going to turn the whole clearing upside down  they waited behind a neighboring stump and a few minutes later frank who had felt himself thrilled with expectation was grievously disappointed he had looked for a spectacular result but there was only a dull heavy thud a sound of rending and splitting and a wisp of vapor out of which a little soil flew up  now said harry well go along and have a look but well work around the stump and come at it down the wind  why frank asked  his companion snickered only that it would probably knock you over id let you go and see its wise to keep clear of the gases after firing giant powder they havent the same effect on everybody but most men who get a whiff of them want to lie down for the rest of the day  they approached the stump cautiously on its windward side but there was not much to see it appeared to have been split and was slightly raised but it had certainly not been blown to fragments as frank had expected  do you think the shot has cut the root he asked  no said harry with a smile you couldnt call it cutting it has melted it swallowed it blotted it right out youll find very little of that root tomorrow and there wont be any pieces lying round either  he broke off and grabbed franks arm as the latter moved toward the other side of the stump  come back he warned the gas is hanging about yet  frank noticed a rather unpleasant smell and was conscious of a pain in his head but it passed off as they crossed the clearing together as it was getting too dark to work mr oliver and jake joined them before they reached the house they changed their clothes when they went in and after toiling in the rain all day frank was glad to sit down dressed in dry things at the wellspread table the room was very cozy with its bright lamp and snapping stove and the doleful wail of the wind and the thrashing of the rain outside emphasized its cheerfulness he felt languidly content with himself and the simple strenuous life he led for the most part though they had occasional adventures it was an uneventful one and some time had passed since they had heard anything of the dope runners he wondered what had become of them or if they had found smuggling unprofitable and had given it up  supper was about half finished when there was a knock at the door and the dog rose with a growl harry seized the animals collar just as a man appeared in the entrance his clothes were black with water and a trickle of it ran from the brim of the soft hat he held in one hand he was a young man and the paleness of his face suggested that he was from the cities  is it far to carthew creek he inquired  eight or nine miles mr oliver replied the trails very bad and youll have some trouble in keeping it on a night like this have you any reason for going straight through  i believe a steamboat calls tomorrow and i thought of going back with her ive had about enough of these bush trails  then well put you up said mr oliver obligingly you can get on again first thing in the morning youre wet enough now arent you  the stranger admitted that he was but seemed to hesitate  i dont want to trouble miss oliver he said still as it happens ive a message for you  mr oliver said that he would give him some dry clothes and the two withdrew to get them they came back a few minutes later and sat down at the table the stranger made an excellent meal and mr oliver waited until he had finished before he asked a question  have you walked in  from the settlement the other answered as i expected to get back by the steamboat i left my hired horse with porteous at the store  porteous doesnt keep the store  the other fellow got hurt chopping a week or so ago a log or a big branch fell on him and they sent him off to seattle porteous is running the business until he gets better  frank fancied that mr oliver was displeased at this but there was no change in his manner toward his visitor  is he running the post office too he asked  oh yes i had to tell him something about a letter  you mentioned that you had some business with me i suppose youre looking up orders for fruit trees  the stranger smiled im a store clerk by profession out of a job at present names t graham watkins now you know me  he turned to miss oliver with a bow but she made no comment and he glanced toward the boys  weve got to have a talk he added addressing mr oliver im not sure youd want these young men or your sister to hear  you can tell it here said mr oliver dryly i can make a guess at your business and if im right ive no objections to the others staying where they are  then its just this the folks i represent arent pleased with you theyve a notion that youve been bucking against them for the last few months and trying to find out things theyd rather keep dark  i presume youre referring to the dope runners why didnt they come themselves  thats easily answered said mr watkins i understand you havent seen one of them yet and they dont want to give you an opportunity of doing so  harry grinned at frank across the table unnoticed by the speaker  in my case it doesnt matter the latter added ive merely called to give you a message  arent you rather hanging fire with it mr oliver asked  i feel kind of diffident i dont want to say anything that might alarm your sister  miss oliver smiled you neednt hesitate my brother generally takes me into his confidence and i dont think either of us is very easily startled  wont you send the boys away anyhow  no said mr oliver quietly i think i mentioned that id rather let them stay  well said the other this is the position the gentlemen you mentioned can land their stuff near here and get it away through the bush easily that is if youll lie by and take no hand against them there are other routes but theyre longer and more difficult and my friends would rather stick to this one if its possible the question is how can they make it worth your while to shut your eyes and leave them alone  harry suddenly straightened himself and frank noticed the quick flush of anger in his face but miss oliver was smiling and the ranchers voice was as tranquil as usual  the answers very simple he said it cant be done  mr watkins appeared astonished  i want you to consider your position he repeated  i may tell you that i considered it carefully some months ago but theres a point id like to mention has it struck you that i might promise to fall in with your friends views and all the same give them away  it was talked about mr watkins answered we decided it wouldnt be in keeping with what we knew about your character and youd certainly be sorry you had done it afterward  now were coming to the second and more important half of the message said mr oliver  youre right was the answer im to understand that when you say you wont meet my friends views its your last word  yes said mr oliver firmly  then my message is a plain one let up or look out i want you to fix your attention on the last part of it you have quite a nice place here a highclass barn and homestead and a good hay crop and theres nobody living within some miles of you except webster  precisely said mr oliver they cost me a good deal of very hard work and i shall try to keep them now i suppose youve said your piece  mr watkins raised his hand as if to beg his forbearance  youve heard it all i only want to add that im quite willing to start right now for carthew if you wish it  mr oliver laughed naturally and easily  no he said youre my guest for the night after this well change the subject and talk about something else he looked around harry will you bring the cigar box out  mr watkins did not appear to be a brilliant conversationalist but he discussed politics and railroad extension with his host and frank found himself wondering at and admiring the ranchers attitude he had shown no sign of anger and had never failed in courtesy threats had apparently no effect on him and he had received them with a quiet amusement which appealed in particular to the boys fancy it seemed ever so much finer than blustering indignation but he thought that there would be a striking change in mr olivers manner if he were ever driven to action  mr watkins took his departure after breakfast next morning after which mr oliver wrote two letters before he called the boys  i want you to take the sloop and go up to the settlement he said you will mail this letter there its to barclay though it isnt directly addressed to him  harry looked thoughtful  of course he said hesitatingly ill do that if you wish it but porteous is a mean white isnt he mightnt he open the thing  its possible mr oliver answered with a smile as it happens ive no great objections to his reading it and im mailing it with him as an experiment dont put it into the box but hand it to him when you have done that sail back along the beach and then head right across to banningtons where youll mail this other letter as you cant be back tonight you had better take some provisions with you start as soon as you can  the boys were off in half an hour for the rain had stopped and there was a clear sky and a moderate breeze as they sailed out of the cove harry from his place at the helm glanced at his companion with a chuckle  when you come to understand him dads unique he said porteous will open that letter hes mean enough for anything and its been my opinion all along that hes in with the gang  but wont it give your fathers plans away if he reads it  not much said harry havent you got hold yet the letters about hunting and theres most likely an order in it for winchester shells or something else that will put porteous off the track hes probably not an expert at opening envelopes and it wont take barclay long to tell whether anybody has been tampering with the letter the other one will go through without being interfered with theyre white at banningtons  that wont get over much of the difficulty after all frank objected wont your fathers answer bring watkinss friends down upon the ranch  its possible said harry ive a notion that when they come dad will be ready for them and i fancy barclays nearly through with his trailing  you expect hell make a new move then  harry laughed sure he said that little fat man will get everything fixed up without making the least fuss then hell bring his hand down once for all and smash the whole doperunning gang i dont mind allowing that i was quite wrong about him at the beginning  they said nothing more upon the subject and they safely reached the cove next day after a long cold sail     chapter xxiii  mr oliver outwits his watchers   a day or two after they had got back to the ranch mr oliver asked the boys if they would like another trip and as both of them preferred it to grubbing stumps they paddled off to the canoe with him the same evening a fresh breeze sprang up as the sun went down and they had a fast and rather wet sail daylight was breaking across the scattered pines when the party left the sloop and walked up a trail within sight of a little lonely settlement  as they approached it a harsh clanking and the tolling of a bell rose from behind the trees and they had to wait while a locomotive and a string of freight cars jolted across the trail into a neighboring side track when the train had passed mr oliver and his companions crossed the rails and entered a desolate flag station which consisted of a roughly boarded ironroofed shack and a big water tank in front of it was an open space strewn with fir stumps and beyond the latter three or four frame houses rose among the trees the door of the shack was shut and while they stood outside it the sound of an approaching train grew steadily louder and a jet of steam blew noisily from the valve of the locomotive waiting in the side track  a seattle train said mr oliver they dont seem to be flagging her and she probably wont stop  frank stood looking about him with a curious stirring of his heart there was a gaudy poster pasted up on the shack announcing cheap tickets to seattle with a line or two about a circus and some attraction at an opera house in the meanwhile the scream of a whistle came ringing across the shadowy trees and the boy was troubled by the familiar sights and sounds the wet rails the freight cars and the brilliant poster reminded him of the cities he had turned his back upon some time ago  then though the daylight was rapidly growing clearer a big blazing lamp broke out from among the firs with a cloud of steam streaming behind it and a locomotive and a row of clanging cars swept through the depot the lights from the windows flashed into franks face flickered upon the shack and rows of stumps and grew dim again after which the din receded and came throbbing back fainter and fainter as he listened to it a sudden fierce longing seized the boy he wanted to hear the clamor of the cities again to see the big stores and the hurrying crowds almost a year had elapsed since he had even seen a train and a journey of two or three hours would take him back to the stir and bustle of civilization away from the constant monotonous toil with ax and saw in the lonely bush  he wondered what his people were doing in boston in the winter season there were festivities and gayety there and he had once enjoyed them with his old companions who had most likely forgotten him some had gone into business two were at harvard and another had entered the army but he stood dressed in miry long boots and old wellmended garments still damp with salt water in a little desolate depot in the wilderness he fancied that he was justified in feeling rather sorry for himself  then with an effort he drove these thoughts away after all his place was not in the cities he had no money and there was nobody to give him a fair start in life while he admitted that it was very doubtful that he had any talent for business he might perhaps become a clerk or something of the kind but it once more occurred to him that he was better off in the bush indeed though he scarcely realized this the bush had already made a striking change in him and it is possible that his eastern friends would have had trouble in recognizing him as the pale lad they had sent away to minneapolis his face was bronzed and resolute he was taller tougher and broader around the chest and he could now toil all day at a task which would once have broken him down in a couple of hours then he started as he noticed that mr oliver was looking at him with a smile  you seem to be thinking rather hard the rancher remarked  i was frank admitted hesitatingly it was the train that put the ideas into my mind  i fancied it might be something of that description said mr oliver shed soon have taken you up to seattle and nowadays its a very short run to chicago where you could get on to one of the atlantic flyers i suppose you feel that youd like to make the journey  i didfor a minute or two frank confessed with an embarrassed smile then of course i realized that it was impossible  somewhat to his astonishment mr oliver laid a hand upon his shoulder  the wish was very natural but stay where you are my lad theres more room out here in the western bush and youre making progress this is going to be a great country and you wont be sorry you came out in a few more years  im not sorry now frank answered sturdily with a flush in his face  mr oliver turned away as the agent opened the door of his shack and they went into the little untidy office  i want to send a message south said mr oliver writing something on a form its a code address i suppose i could get an answer in an hour or so  oh yes said the agent theyll be beginning to move about in seattle now and if the mans in his office therell be no delay in the meanwhile they would give you a good breakfast at the hotel  mr oliver thanked him and as they left the depot two men whom they had not noticed hitherto met them mr oliver glanced at them sharply but he did not speak and a few minutes later they sat down to an excellent meal in the primitive wooden hotel when they had finished the proprietor strolled in and sat down for a chat with them  is there much going on about the place mr oliver asked offering him a cigar  yes said the hotelkeeper accepting the proffered cigar with alacrity weve struck quite a boom theres a man clearing a lot of ground for a fruit ranch and putting up a smart frame house then theyre cutting a couple of new trails the boys are making good wages and theyre all of them busy  i saw two men just now who didnt seem to have much to do said mr oliver carelessly and harry gave his companion a nudge with his elbow  they dont belong here was the answer one of them lives down the beach and does some fishing with his boat the other man came in from the south yesterday on the cars and i dont know what hes after i told him i could put him on to a job and he said he didnt want it  as theyre together hes probably going in for fishing with the first one mr oliver suggested  the hotelkeeper pursed his lips and looked as if he were solving a hard problem  its a puzzle to me how larry makes a living its only now and then he sends a little fish away and i cant see what hed do with a partner then he changed the subject youre thinking of buying land  no said mr oliver i sailed over in my boat to dispatch a wire it was much easier than riding a long way to the nearest office now that the trails are soft  theyre bad sure assented his companion and they continued to discuss ranching until mr oliver finally rose and said he would walk across to the depot the boys followed him a few paces behind harry addressed his companion with a look of admiration for his father  i guess you noticed how dad found out about those fellows without letting the man think he was curious he said  frank said that he had noticed it and added  i wonder what the fellow came up from the south for  that said harry significantly is a point i expect dads doing some hard thinking on just now  they walked into the agents office and sat down to wait as he told them that he had as yet received no answer to the telegram the door near which frank sat stood partly open and he noticed that the two men were lounging close outside it he quietly touched mr olivers arm indicating them with a glance the rancher knitted his brows and presently spoke to the agent  there are two men who seem to be waiting for you outside he said  the agent walked across to the door  back again larry he said impatiently whats the matter now  whens that fish box of mine coming along the man inquired  i dont know said the agent next freight most likely if its been delivered to us at the other end  wont you wire up the line about it  no said the agent if youll put up the stamps ill wire to the fish store you billed it to  the man looked indignant i tell you its in the railroads hands do you think ive nothing better to do than hang about this depot every time a freight comes through he paused a moment with his eyes on the ground then went on anyway now im on the spot i may as well wait for the next one she should be along in about an hour wont you let me in  the telegraph instrument began to click just then and the agent turned toward him sharply  theres no room you can wait at the hotel  perhaps the message is about his box broke in the other man  frank glanced around at them they were dressed like most of the bush choppers in rough working clothes and there was nothing particularly noticeable in their appearance but he fancied that they had some reason for wishing to get into the office  no sir said the agent they dont wire about the delivery of an empty box on this road get out i want to shut the door  frank noticed that one of the loungers had thrust his foot against the post but the agent seeming to lose his temper slammed the door on it the man withdrew it with an exclamation and the agent turned toward the instrument which was now clicking rapidly he tapped an answering signal and then wrote upon a strip of paper which he handed mr oliver the latter read the message and handed it to the boys        first route unsatisfactory second preferred it       ran meet me nine tonight everett if possible  frank was puzzled but he fancied that harry understood the message better than he did  thanks said mr oliver addressing the agent your two friends outside seemed uncommonly anxious about that box  thats a fact said the agent larry was worrying me about it before it was light i dont know the fellow who came along with him but it struck me that he was listening to the instrument as if he understood it though he couldnt have heard more than the depot call of course he added thoughtfully most any one who had worked on a railroad would know the code but i cant figure why they should make so much fuss about a box thats scarcely worth a dollar  its curious mr oliver answered indifferently you might lend me your train schedule  the agent gave him the companys time bill which also included the coast steamboat sailings and mr oliver walked back with the boys to the hotel there was nobody in the general room when they reached it and they sat down near the stove  now he began as we have taken you into our confidence and its probable that you can help you may as well understand the situation thoroughly the message was of course from barclay though it bears a clerks name and it means that porteous has opened the letter you left him i fancy hell regret it but that is by the way barclay received the second letter untampered with and the rest is plain enough the only question is how im to keep the appointment without putting the fellows at the depot on my track  you believe theyre in league with the smugglers frank inquired  mr oliver smiled it seems very likely heres a man who keeps a boat and as you have heard folks wonder how he makes a living by his fishing if the boats moderately fast you can imagine how useful he would be to the smugglers by taking messages from place to place and communicating with the schooner then we have another man who seems able to read the telegraph turning up and trying to hear barclays message  but how could they have learned that you expected it frank asked  im not sure porteous may have suspected something and sent a mounted man off to wire one of the gang besides the fellow who has the boat may have been across with her it wouldnt be hard to surmise that i would wire from here though they may have had a man watching the nearest office i could have reached by land on horseback he paused a moment and looked at the boys gravely all this points to the fact that were up against a big and remarkably wellorganized gang  frank had no doubt that mr oliver was right but he asked a question  why did barclay choose everett when its so far from the field of their operations  thats exactly why he fixed on it there would be less probability of somebody connected with the gang recognizing us and ive met him there already the fact that he doesnt mention any particular hotel should have told you that but what we have to consider is how im to get there without these fellows following me its important that i should be back at the ranch as soon as possible and you and harry must manage to arrive there the first thing tomorrow  frank understood the necessity for this the nights were long the bush was lonely and mr olivers wooden house and barns which had cost him a good deal of money would readily burn while now when there was only jake to take care of them they would be more or less at the smugglers mercy then harry who in the meanwhile had been examining the schedule looked up  ive an idea he said theres a train goes south in the afternoon and a steamboat which calls at everett goes up the sound this evening well suppose we order dinner here and start for banningtons a little before the cars come in the steamboat would stop to pick up there if shes signaled and with this breeze we should get down shortly before she passes  mr oliver turned to frank  how does that strike you he asked  the trouble is that the other men would follow us in their boat the boy objected then a light dawned upon him as he saw the twinkle in mr olivers eyes you mean thats what harry intended them to do  exactly harry broke in with a grin they raise brainy folks in boston and youre getting hold those fellows will get after us as soon as they can hoist sail on their boat and well give them a run for it the point is that while theyre following us dad will be on the cars  but how is he going to elude them  that harry admitted sagely wants some thinking out  they made their plans in the next halfhour and some time after dinner was over walked toward the beach nobody seemed to be following them though they could not be sure of this since the trail wound about through the bush but when they reached the canoe another boat which they had not noticed on arriving lay moored a few hundred yards away they were obliged to carry the canoe down some distance over very rough stones and on reaching the waters edge mr oliver took a quick glance about him  im afraid one plans spoiled he said  the boys glanced back toward the trail and frank saw two figures saunter out on to the beach harry frowned as he glanced at them  you cant slip back into the bush without their seeing you he warned  no said mr oliver still i think theres a means of getting over the difficulty shove the canoe in theyll have to carry their boat down and our boats lying nearer the head yonder than theirs is  frank did not understand how the rancher intended to evade his pursuers and fancied that harry was not much wiser they had soon launched the canoe however and were paddling off to the sloop running the mainsail up in haste then the boys set the jib as she drew out from the beach and frank noticed that the other men were hoisting sail upon their boat as fast as they could manage it the sloop however was already some distance away from them and it was not long before she picked up a freshening breeze lying well over to it she gathered speed and close to lee of her frank saw a low rocky head down the face of which straggled stunted pines and underbrush he fancied that she would be hidden from their pursuers when she had sailed around the end of it but on glancing back as they approached the corner he saw that the other men had started after them they were three or four minutes behind but he had no idea yet how mr oliver meant to elude them he was still wondering about it when the rancher spoke to him  get hold of the canoe painter he ordered the moment were around the corner well haul her up and youll put me ashore youll have to be smart about it because you must be back on board before the other boat rounds the head  harry had already taken the helm and the sloop was sailing very fast with the canoe lurching and splashing over the short seas astern of her they broke in a broad fringe of foam upon the stony beach thirty or forty yards to lee and as the boat swept on the bay behind closed in and the seaward face of the cliff opened out ahead frank could still see the boat astern but as he stood in the well with his hands clenched upon a rope he knew that in another moment the rocks would shut her out then sure enough she suddenly vanished and shortly afterward he heard mr olivers voice  haul he shouted  harry flung loose the mainsheet but the boat did not quicken her speed immediately and frank found it desperately hard to drag up the canoe though mr oliver had seized the rope behind him haste was however necessary if the rancher was to slip back to the depot unsuspected at last the canoe ran alongside with a bang and mr oliver dropped on board while frank nearly upset her as he followed him each of them seized a paddle and the boy had a momentary glimpse of the sloop rolling with her slackened mainsail thrashing to and fro while harry struggled to haul the jib to weather after that he looked ahead and swung his paddle and as the breeze was blowing on to the beach a few quick strokes drove them in through the splashing surf she struck the stones violently for they had no time to be careful and mr oliver jumped ashore running into the water to thrust her out frank contrived to twist her around though it taxed all his strength after which he hazarded a single glance behind him mr oliver had disappeared among the several masses of fallen rock and clumps of small growth which were scattered about the slope  so far the plan had succeeded but frank had still to reach the sloop which was a different matter from paddling ashore there was a fresh breeze ahead of him and a little splashing sea heaved up the canoes bows and checked her speed in addition to this it is a rather difficult thing to keep a canoe on a straight course with a singleended paddle which can only be dipped on the one side and in order to do so one must give the blade a back twist which retards the craft unless it is skillfully managed frank who had hitherto practiced it only in smooth water found that the bows would blow around in spite of him he grew hot and breathless and though he set his lips and strung up his muscles he made very little progress  paddle shouted harry who had been watching his maneuvers shove her through it cant you get a move on i cant run in any nearer without getting her ashore  frank made another desperate attempt but a splashing sea broke about the bows driving the canoe off her course again and while he savagely swung the paddle harry surveyed him contemptuously  culcha he jeered guess you loaded that up in boston but what you want is sand cant you get a bit of a hustle on youre sure born playedout back east  frank felt a little more blood surge into his hot face this was more than he felt inclined to stand from any westerner of his own weight but it was clear that he could not rebuke his reviler fittingly until he reached the sloop and the veins swelled up on his forehead as he furiously plied the paddle once more a sea broke about the bows and this time part of it splashed in while as he tried the backfeather stroke the canoe lurched and began to swing around in spite of his redoubled efforts harry spread out one hand resignedly  well he said its our own fault for letting you into the canoe the trouble was you couldnt be trusted alone with the sloop either pshaw weve no use for folks of your kind in this country  this was intolerable because part of it was true and frank felt his heart thumping painfully but he made a last effort and panting straining taxing every muscle to the utmost he drove the canoe ahead and eventually managed to grasp the sloops lee rail he could not speak and as he breathlessly crawled on board harry snatched the rope from him and made it fast  trim that jibsheet over he commanded  frank obeyed him and when they hauled on the mainsheet the sloop once more gathered speed while frank glancing astern saw a strip of slanted sail appear around the corner of the head then he glanced ashore and though he saw no sign of mr oliver the slope to the beach was not remarkably steep and he fancied that the rancher would not have much trouble in ascending it     chapter xxiv  a fast run   after they had trimmed sail frank sat still for a while to recover his breath and if possible his composure he felt that it was necessary to demand an explanation from his companion though they had once or twice had a difference of opinion this was the first time that harry had been insulting and frank found it impossible to pass over what he had said when he felt able to speak clearly he looked his companion in the eyes  now he began ill admit that you can shoot and sail a boat rather better than i can but that doesnt entitle you to talk as you did just now  i dont know if it matters but ive a notion that i did shout harry answered calmly  that only makes it worse frank burst out warmly you couldnt call it shouting either i once heard a coyote on the prairie and it had a much sweeter voice than you have  to his astonishment harry grinned  oh well he said but wont you get down under the mainboom before you go on i dont want those fellows astern to see there are only two of us on board the sloop  frank did as he suggested whereupon harry waved his hand and smiled graciously  now he added you can go ahead  frank found it harder than he had expected his anger was beginning to evaporate and harrys good humor was embarrassing still he made another effort  in the first place he resumed there are just as smart and capable folks in massachusetts as there are anywhere else  thats quite right assented harry i dont see why there shouldnt be but i suppose youre not through yet you want to call me down  when you say things of that kindyou frank stammered and stopped when he observed his companion still smiling  sure said harry i ought to be pounded with the boathook if id meant them  frank gazed at him in bewilderment you didnt mean them  no said harry not a word of it  then why did you say them  well replied his friend thats a reasonable question now it was mighty important that you should get alongside before our friends astern came into sight and though you werent making very much progress it seemed to me you were doing all you knew  i was frank assured him  still i had an idea that if i could make you jumping mad you might do a little more its hard to tell what youre capable of until youre real savage and i thought id whip you up a bit where you were most likely to feel it  franks indignation vanished and he changed the subject with a laugh  do you think those fellows suspected anything he asked  no said harry they were too busy getting sail on her to notice exactly how far ahead we were when we ran out of the bay and it will probably only strike them that theyre not quite so far astern as they expected all we have to do now is to lead them along toward banningtons id rather keep them sailing than have them prowling round the depot asking questions and perhaps sending telegrams and ive a notion we can leave them when we like shes drawing away from them now and weve only a small jib on her  his surmise proved correct for an hour later the other boat had diminished to a dusky patch of sail far astern dusk soon commenced to fall and the wind seemed to be freshening but as they swept around a rocky point harry changed his course and told frank to make a stout rope fast to the bucket and pitch it over  it will hold her back and let the other fellows come up he said with a grin theyll probably figure their boats faster in any weight of wind and we dont want to run out of sight of them  it grew dark and for a while the sky was barred with heavy clouds until the moon broke out when they saw the pursuing craft sweeping up close astern in the midst of a blaze of silvery radiance she had now however a mass of canvas swung out on either side of her and frank wondered what sail she was carrying  theyve boomed out a jib as a spinnaker harry explained i dont see why we shouldnt do the same particularly as it will make them keener on following us to banningtons one of them means to go south with the steamer if dad gets on to her now well heave in that bucket and when its done theyll open their eyes  it was not easy to haul in the bucket indeed once or twice it was nearly torn away from them but at length they accomplished the task  its awkward running a boat with a spinnaker unless you have a crew remarked harry with a somewhat puzzled look still i feel we ought to give those fellows a run for their trouble and i cant get clear of them with only the mainsail drawing a jib set in the ordinary way is no use when youre before the wind  the other boat had drawn almost level with them and came surging along some forty yards away rising and falling with the foam piled up about her bows and a great spread of canvas that swung up and down as she rolled on either side  hello shouted harry where are you going  north was the laconic answer  harry chuckled as he turned to frank well as dad will be in everett by this time i dont see why they shouldnt come along with us as far as they like but well let them draw ahead before we get up the spinnaker id rather they didnt notice i had to set it alone  the other boat forged past them and she was growing dim ahead when harry pulled out a bundle of canvas from beneath the side deck  its an extra big jib we carry in light winds but it makes a good spinnaker he said youll have to keep her straight before the wind because its a mighty awkward thing to set  frank took the helm and watched his companion as he shook the big sail out all over the boat after which he led a rope fastened to one corner of it through a block at the end of a long spar that lay along the deck he thrust this out over her side and made its inner end fast to the foot of the mast  a spinnaker boom always goes forward of the shrouds and you lead the guy aft outside them he said get hold of it and stick fast its easy so far but in a minute the circus will begin you want two pairs of hands to set a spinnaker in a breeze of wind  frank glanced at the short seas which surged by glittering in the moonlight flecked with wisps of snowy froth and it struck him by the way the boat swung over them with the foam boiling about her that she was carrying sufficient canvas in her mainsail then harry calling to him to mind his steering hauled on a halliard and a mass of thrashing canvas rose up the mast it blew out like a halffilled balloon lifting up the boom which was run out on the opposite side to the mainsail and seemed bent on soaring skyward over the masthead after that the boom swung forward with a crash the mast strained and rattled and frank feared that the great loose sail would tear it out of the boat he saw harry lifted off his feet and flung upon the deck after which the forward part of the boat was swept by flying ropes and billowy folds of canvas among which his companion seemed to be futilely crawling to and fro presently his voice reached frank hoarse and breathless  haul on the guy he cried shell pitch me over or whip the mast out if this goes on  frank dragged at the rope with all his might but he could not get an inch of it in and he dared not take his right hand off the tiller for fear of bringing the big mainboom over upon the spinnaker which would probably have caused a catastrophe indeed he fancied that one was inevitable already since it seemed impossible that harry could control the big loose sail which was now wildly hurling itself aloft  i cant move it he shouted  harry came aft with a jump and grasped the guy  now he said together get both hands upon it hold the tiller with your elbow  for the next half minute there was a furious struggle and as the boom went up again frank felt that they were beaten his companion however hung on desperately panting hard and by degrees the boom swung down and back across the boat and the sail flattened out  make fast cried harry breathlessly i can manage the sheet  he floundered forward to the foot of the mast and when he came back the spinnaker was drawing steadily and the sloop had changed her mode of progress she no longer rolled viciously or screwed up to windward as she lifted on a sea but swayed from side to side with a smooth and easy swing and frank could steer her with a touch upon the tiller in spite of that steering was ticklish work for the mainboom and the spinnaker boom went up and came down until they raked the glittering brine alternately and frank realized that it would be singularly easy to bring one crashing over upon the other there was no doubt that the boat was sailing very fast and he hazarded one swift glance over his shoulder at the canoe she was surging along astern hove up with her forward half out of the water and a seething mass of foam hiding the rest of her harry however glanced forward somewhat anxiously  that booms lifting too much he said one of us ought to sit on it do you feel able to steer her  frank said that he believed he could manage it  well said harry if you jibe either sail across youll either pitch me in or break my leg even if you dont roll the boat over sing out the moment you feel her getting too hard upon the helm  scrambling forward he crawled out along the spinnaker boom to which he clung precariously lifted up high one moment and the next swung down until his feet were just above the foam sometimes they splashed in and frank bracing himself until every nerve was strung up felt horribly uneasy in spite of that the wild rush through the glittering water which boiled about the boat was wonderfully exhilarating she seemed a mass of straining sail which swayed in the moonlight above an insignificant strip of hull half buried in snowy foam over her black mainsail peak dim wisps of clouds went streaming by and from all around there was a tumult of stirring soundthe clamor at the bows the swish of water as the canoe came charging up to her and the splash of tumbling seas everything ahead however was hidden by the sail and he was wondering where the other boat was when harry called to him  slack the guy a foot or two and let her come up a little dont let it get the run of you or youll pitch me in  frank was very cautious as he eased the rope out around a cleat after which when the spinnaker boom had drawn forward he found that he could luff the boat when she had swerved from her course a trifle he could see the other boat close ahead and it gave him some idea how fast both craft were traveling she seemed nothing but sail indeed except for the tornup track of foam that marked her passage she looked much less like a boat than some wonderful phantom thing flying at an astonishing speed across the sea swiftly as she sped however there was no doubt that the sloop was creeping up on her and frank felt himself quivering all through as the distance between them lessened yard by yard then suddenly the contour of her canvas changed and she swung around from leeward across the sloops bows franks heart gave a sudden leap as he wondered what he must do and his nerve almost deserted him until harry called again  more guy he sang out theyre trying to luff us we must keep their weather  although fearful that it might overpower him frank slacked the guy out inch by inch and as the sloop came up a little farther he saw the whole of the other boat again the sloops bowsprit was level with her quarter she was scarcely a dozen yards away leaping plunging swaying through a flungup mass of foam but they were steadily drawing up with her and the boy could have shouted in the fierce excitement of the moment two or three minutes later they were clear ahead he could no longer see the other boat and he dared not risk a glance back at her indeed it was a relief to him when harry came scrambling aft  well get that guy in again he said unless something gives out those folks wont catch us up  they had a desperate struggle with the guy but harry laughed gayly when they had made it fast  theyll follow us on to banningtons sure he said we should be there in half an hour and i dont mind allowing that ill be glad to get some of this sail off her  after a while a black bank of cloud spread across the moon and frank wondered anxiously how much of the half hour had gone he had now only the pull on the tiller to guide him as they drove on furiously and the strain of concentrating all his faculties on his task was beginning to tell on his strength once or twice he imagined that he came perilously near to bringing the mainboom over and he would have called harry to the helm if he had felt certain that he could cling to the slender lurching spar as well as his comrade could he was getting nervous and the seething rush of water past the boat was becoming bewildering  at length however he made out a dark and hazy mass over the edge of the mainsail which he supposed was land and in another few minutes a blinking light appeared he called to harry who merely twisted himself around on the boom with the object of looking out beneath the sail and then told him to keep her heading as she was after that the land rose rapidly growing blacker and a second light appeared this was closer to them and frank thinking he saw it move noticed a green blink beneath it  presently both lights disappeared behind the sail and some minutes later frank almost let go the tiller as the deep blast of a steamers whistle rang out close ahead on the instant harry swung himself down from the boom  let go your guy he shouted down helm get the mainsheet in  frank could never clearly remember all that followed in the next two or three minutes during which he was desperately busy he let the spinnaker guy run and the big sail which heaved up the spar beneath it swung wildly forward then he shoved down his helm and the mainboom slashed furiously as the boat came up toward the wind the sheet blocks seemed to be banging everywhere about him as he hauled at the rope and he could hear nothing but the savage thrashing of loosened canvas harry was struggling forward with a mass of billowing sail that threatened to sweep him off the narrow deck while flying ropes whipped about him presently out of the din there rose another sonorous blast of the steamers whistle  the next moment frank saw her heading it seemed straight for them blazing with tiers of lights and in almost nerveless haste he pulled up his tiller the bolt fell off he saw harry flung down with the spinnaker rolling about him and he scarcely dared to breathe as the rows of lights ahead lengthened and the black wedge of the steamers bows faded from his sight it was now her side he was gazing at and it was evident that she was swinging around in less than another minute she had forged past them and leaving the helm he scrambled forward to aid his companion for a moment they had a brief struggle with flying ropes and billowing sail and then they clambered back into the well where frank sat down with a gasp of fervent satisfaction  well he panted im glad thats over and you had better take the helm ive had enough  harry glanced toward the steamer which was growing less distinct  a close call he remarked it looked as if she was going slap over us i couldnt see her sooner because of the sail shes running into banningtons  they heard her whistle a little later but they were then close in with a shadowy point of land and looking back frank made out a faint blur on the water far behind them which he knew must be the other boat when he pointed it out harry laughed  they cant see us against the land but ive an idea theyll be in soon enough to learn the steamer didnt pick one of us up he said that will start them wondering why we drove her so hard and where weve gone now you had better get the stove lighted and the supper on     chapter xxv  the united states mail   the boys reached the ranch the next morning and mr oliver who followed by a different route a couple of days later seemed satisfied with the result of his journey  if the dope men leave us alone for the next three weeks were not likely to be troubled with them afterward he said barclay expects very shortly to be ready for what he calls his coup  i suppose he didnt mention exactly when he would bring it off harry remarked  no said mr oliver with a laugh barclay usually waits until hes certain before he moves and hes not addicted to spoiling things by haste in the meanwhile you may as well keep your eyes sharply open  wont it be awkward to communicate with him if you have to go to banningtons every time you mail a letter frank asked  thats a point which naturally occurred to me mr oliver answered there are however reasons for believing that barclay will be able to get over the difficulty  he said nothing further on the subject but it cropped up again one evening when mr webster arrived at the ranch in time for supper he told them that he had finished the bridge he had gone away to build and when they sat about the stove after the meal was over he turned to mr oliver  have you heard that porteous has been fired out of the store and theyve got a man down from tacoma he asked  no replied mr oliver indifferently  anyway you dont seem much astonished  mr oliver smiled at this i cant say i am what was the trouble  its generally believed porteous was tampering with the mails and that brings up another thing i want to mention im puzzled about it as well as pleased  harry unobserved by mr webster grinned at frank looking solemn again as his father caught his eye  well said the latter politely  its just this said mr webster when i came through the settlement this morning the man who fills porteouss place gave me a letter it requested me to send in a formal application if i was open to have my place made a postoffice and carry the mails for this and the carthew district they dont pay one very much but it only means a journey once a week  then what are you puzzled at  well said mr webster his eyes bent thoughtfully on the fire you and the carthew folks tried to have a mail carrier appointed some time ago and you heard that the authorities were considering your representations i guess thats about all they did theyre great on considering and as a rule they dont get much further it strikes me as curious that they should give you the postoffice now considering that they wouldnt do it when you worried them for it the next point is that although i applied the other time i dont know anybody in office or any political boss who would speak for me  frank noticed the smile broaden on harrys face but mr webster was intently watching mr oliver who answered carelessly  its a poor job one that only a local man could undertake and i dont know any one else who wants it he said what are you going to do about it  send in the application right away thats partly what brought me over ill have to get you and two of the boys at carthew to vouch for me  therell be no trouble about that mr oliver assured him after which they changed the conversation before mr webster went away he asked the boys to spend a day or two with him and do some hunting  mr oliver let them go at the end of the week but he said that they had better meet mr webster at the settlement where miss oliver wanted them to leave an order for some groceries and that if any letters had arrived for him one of them must bring them across to the ranch they reached the settlement saturday evening soon after the weekly mail had come in when they had finished their supper at the store mr webster bundled his mails promiscuously into a flour bag which he fastened upon his shoulders with a couple of straps  there seems to be quite a lot of letters remarked harry as he lifted up the bag  mr webster frowned letters he growled most of the blamed stuffs groceries it strikes me im going to earn my dollars the boys who run short of sugar or yeast powder or any truck of that kind expect me to pack it out give the thing a heave up theres the corner of a meat can working into my ribs  they set out shortly afterward following a very bad trail driven like a tunnel through the bush and when they had gone a mile or two mr webster lighted a lantern which he gave to frank  hold it up and look about he said its somewhere round here jardine has his letter box nailed up on a tree  frank presently discovered an empty powder keg fixed to a big fir and mr webster wriggling out of the straps dropped the bag with a thud as it happened it descended in a patch of mud  hold the light so i can see to sort this truck he said and plunged his hand into the bag it was white when he brought it out  somethings got adrift he commented they never can tie a package right in the store  with some difficulty he at last found the letters though this necessitated his spreading out most of the rest and the groceries on the wet soil then he deposited those that belonged to jardine in the keg and went on again  dense darkness filled the narrow rift in the bush and the feeble rays of the lantern were more bewildering than useful but they covered another two miles before they stopped at a second keg when webster discovered that a couple of letters he fished out were stuck together with halfmelted sugar he tore them apart and rubbed them clean upon his trousers smearing out the address as he did so  its lucky i looked at them first because i couldnt tell whose they are now he said anyway as i guess the stuff hasnt had time to get inside steve will know theyre his when he opens them he raised the bag a little and examined it this things surely wet  i expect it is said harry the last time you stopped you dumped it in the mud didnt they give you some sugar for this place at the store  why yes said mr webster i was forgetting it hold the lantern lower frank while i look for it  he pulled the flour bag wider open and presently produced a big paper package which seemed to have lost its shape  half the stuffs run out he added thats what has been mussing up the mail pitch this truck out and well skip the rest of the sugar out of the bottom of the bag  it took them some time to deposit the various bundles of letters and packets among the wineberry bushes beside the trail after which mr webster shook a pound or two of loose wet sugar into the opened package it appeared to be mixed with flour and other substances and harry smiled as he glanced at it  its off its color he remarked  that said mr webster will serve steve right and save me trouble the next time he wants sugar hell walk into the settlement and pack it out himself when youve put that truck back the mail will go ahead  they threw the things back into the bag but while they were engaged in this task harry held up a bundle of letters to the light and separated two of them from the rest  these are dads he mused it strikes me theyd be safer in my pocket  they saw no more powder kegs but by and by they stopped at a ranch where they delivered a newspaper and a pound of coffee and then plodded on in thick darkness which was only intensified by the patch of uncertain radiance that flickered upon the trail a yard or two in front of them even this failed them presently when frank fell and dropped the lantern it went out and neither he nor harry who struck a match could open it  im afraid ive bent the catch said frank  its not going to matter much mr webster answered i guess we can fix the thing when we reach my place and there isnt another ranch until we come to it  they trudged along in silence for another hour the trail seemed darker than ever and it was oppressively still even the great trunks a few yards away were invisible and once or twice frank walked into the bushes that clustered among them at last however the sound of running water came out of the gloom and grew louder until the boy fancied that there must be a rapid creek somewhere below them neither he nor harry had been that way before as they expected to get some shooting he was carrying the double gun which was beginning to feel heavy while harry had brought a rifle when the roar of water had grown so loud that they could scarcely hear each others footsteps mr webster stopped  theres an awkward place close ahead and you had better let me go in front he warned keep a few yards behind and close to the bank on your left side the trail goes down a gulch and theres a steep drop to the creek  he moved on until the boys could just see his black and shadowy figure the hollow beneath them was filled with impenetrable gloom and they went down cautiously trying to follow him and feeling with their feet for the edge of the bank on one hand they had gone some little way when mr webster seemed to stagger and suddenly disappear then there was a crash amidst the underbrush a sound which might have been made by a heavy body rolling down a slope and a hoarse cry which was almost drowned by the clamor of the creek  the boys stopped abruptly uncertain what to do mr webster had evidently fallen down the declivity but they could not tell where he was in the darkness or if it was possible to reach him frank fancied that if he once moved out from the bank he would probably step over a ledge and plunge down into the creek which it was evident would be of no service to mr webster by and by he was sincerely glad to hear a sound below him which seemed to indicate that the man was endeavoring to clamber up again on recalling the incident afterward he decided that they had stood waiting about a quarter of a minute  we must get down somehow he said to harry  his companion did not answer but gripped his arm warningly then to franks astonishment another sound rose up somewhere in front of them and a voice followed it  is that you webster it asked  sure was the answer ive pitched right down the gulch  frank would have scrambled forward but harry held him back  hold on he said softly he doesnt seem hurt  a crackling and snapping below them suggested that somebody was cautiously scrambling through the undergrowth toward mr webster while the latter was evidently crawling up the ascent frank wondered why harry had restrained him until a blaze of light suddenly broke out it showed a very steep bank with clumps of brush scattered about it dropping to a foaming creek mr webster holding on by the stem of a stunted pine with the flour bag lying some distance higher up and another figure moving toward him a third man stood on the brink of the declivity holding a blazing pineknot where the boys stood however there was deep shadow  mr webster so far as frank could make out was gazing at the man nearest him in astonishment  well he said sharply what do you want  the mail answered the other stop right where you are  then the meaning of the situation dawned on frank at that moment he saw mr webster scramble forward to intercept the man who was making for the bag the latter however was nearer it and he had crept almost up to it while mr webster was still several yards away without a moments hesitation frank sprang out into the flickering light  keep back he shouted dont touch that bag  the radiance fell upon the barrel of his gun and the next moment harry emerged from the gloom with his rifle thrust forward they decided afterward that the strangers could only have seen two indistinct figures with weapons in their hands and that there was nothing to indicate that they were not grown men  hold him up shouted mr webster scrambling forward furiously as if to seize the man  the latter stooped swiftly and made a grab at the bag as frank pitched up his gun though he kept the muzzle of it turned a little from the bent figure but just then harrys rifle flashed behind him and there was sudden darkness as the light fell into a thicket confused sounds followed the detonation but it became evident to frank now quivering with excitement that three separate persons were smashing through scrubby undergrowth as fast as they could manage then one of them stopped while the rest went on  have you got the bag cried harry  its in my hand said mr webster  they heard him floundering toward them while the other sounds grew fainter until he emerged from the gloom close beside frank and threw the bag at his feet  give me your gun he said shortly stop where you are  he disappeared again but in another moment they saw him raking in a clump of brush from which a pale light still flickered after which he came back toward them with something blazing feebly in his hand  bring the bag and be careful how you walk he said  when they joined him he was stooping over a short strip of wire stretched across the trail about a foot above the ground holding the pineknot so that the light fell upon it  i guess thats the reason i fell down he said you didnt touch that fellow harry  i didnt mean to was the answer i wanted to scare him off and i was mighty thankful when i saw id done it  well said mr webster i expect that was wiser it would have made things worse for your father if youd plugged him anyway theyve cleared and we may as well get on  arent you hurt frank inquired  theres a nasty rip on my leg and my arm feels mighty sore but thats all the damage seems to me i havent much to complain of considering how far i fell  he flung the pineknot down into the ravine as he turned away and they had crossed the creek and were ascending the other side before one of them spoke again  did you recognize either of the men harry inquired  no said mr webster on the whole i dont know that id want to do it though im kind of sorry i didnt get my hands upon the nearest fellow it was those two letters for your father he was after  yes said harry gravely youre right in that  the trail got narrower presently and when the boys fell a little behind harry laid a hand on franks arm  im not sure that dad and barclay would have had webster made mail carrier if they had expected this he whispered theres no doubt the dope men are growing bolder     chapter xxvi  mr barclay lays his plans   it appeared that one of the letters which harry had secured was from mr barclay and shortly after the boys got back to the ranch mr oliver sent them off to banningtons with the sloop mr barclay he said was expected down by the next steamer and they must be there in time to take him off it proved to be an uneventful trip and they returned to the cove with their passenger just as a gloomy day was dying out mr oliver was shut up with his guest for an hour after supper that night but at length he called the boys into his room where mr barclay lay in a big chair with a cigar in his hand he looked up with a smile when they came in  no doubt youll be pleased to hear that we expect to round up your doperunning friends before the week is out he said anyway i fancy it was a relief to my host  theres no doubt on that point mr oliver assured him i dont mind admitting that the suspense and the uncertainty as to what they might do were worrying me rather badly  frank was surprised to hear it for the rancher had certainly shown no sign of uneasiness  you mean youre going to break up the gang once for all and corral the whole of them he asked  something like that answered mr barclay lazily if theres no hitch in the proceedings i dont expect many of them will be left at large when our traps are sprung though the affair will have to be managed with a good deal of caution  harry smiled there oughtnt to be any hitch you have been a mighty long while fixing up the thing  that remark said mr barclay is to some extent justified over in europe they say slow and sure though i dont suppose its a maxim thats likely to appeal to young america well paraphrase it into this form dont move until you know exactly what you mean to do and how youre going to set about it and then get at it like a battering ram  a battering ram must have been a clumsy oldtime contrivance harry objected  there are reasons for believing it could strike very hard said his father with a smile  it would naturally take a long while to work the thing out frank broke in addressing mr barclay  it did the little stout man assented we had to get hold of a clue here and another there and follow them up as far as possible without giving anybody the least idea what we were after it might have been more difficult if one hadnt been purposely placed in our hands a week ago  somebody has been giving the gang away asked frank  that doesnt quite describe it mr barclay answered to be precise somebody has sold them it appears that one man a little smarter than the rest discovered that the gang was being watched that scared him and as it happened hed had a difference of opinion with the bosses about the share he claimed to be entitled to he didnt point his suspicions out to them but when as he said they couldnt be induced to do the square thing he came along to one of my subordinates who sent him to me im not sure that id have got much information out of him then if i hadnt been able to convince him that he and his partners were already more or less in my hands  frank was impressed by what he had heard indeed he was conscious that he was half afraid of the man who sprawled lazily in his chair smiling at him he appeared so easygoing and he had bantered harry so goodhumoredly but all the time he had been following up the smugglers trail with a deadly unwavering patience and a keenness which missed the significance of no clue however small now when at last the time for action had come the boy felt that he would strike in the swiftest and most effective manner  if theres any small part you can give us he said hesitatingly  there is said mr barclay to the delight of frank and his companion it appears that they intend to land a parcel of dope and some chinamen at a place down the straits of fuca it will be done at nightthe moon will be only in her first quarter next weekand the schooner will stand out to the westward keeping clear of the traffic to wait for the next evening before going on to the place where shes to make another call the men and the dope will be seized soon after theyre put ashore without anybody on board the vessel being the wiser if our plans work out right but its important that we should know as soon as possible if anything has gone wrong and it will be your business to bring me on a message well have a small steamer and a posse hidden ready at this end and when the schooner runs in two nights later shell fall into our hands with the rest of the gang wholl be waiting for what she brings  frank looked at mr oliver who nodded his consent  yes he said ive promised to let you go though in this case youll have to take jake along  then mr barclay spread out a chart upon the table and pointed first to an inlet which appeared to lie at some distance from any settlement  youll run in here in the dark and lie close in with the beach until youre hailed by a mounted messenger which will probably be early on the following morning when he has given you his message you must manage to deliver it to me herehe laid his finger on another spot on the chartat the latest by the second evening following thats important as its impossible for me to get the news by mail or wire  he gave them some further instructions and half an hour had slipped by before he seemed satisfied that they knew exactly what they were to do then he nodded  i think youve got it right he said the great thing is not to be seen if you can help it and if its possible you must only run in at either place in the dark  the boys spent the next two days in a state of eager anticipation which however became much less marked when one lowering afternoon after a long cold sail they beat the sloop out to the westward down the straits of fuca they had kept watch alternately with jake during the previous night throughout most of which it had rained hard and now frank who admitted to himself that he had had enough sailing for a while was feeling rather limp and weary he sat beneath the coaming as far as he could get out of the bitter wind when at last he raised his head to look about him he saw nothing very cheerful in the prospect before him  the light was dim the low gray sky to windward looked hard and threatening and a long gray blur which he supposed to be land rose up indistinctly over the port hand ahead dingy formless slopes of water heaved themselves up slowly one after another in dreary succession they were ridged and wrinkled here and there and now and then a little wisp of white appeared on one of them for the long swell of the pacific was working in the breeze was very moderate as yet and each time the sloop sluggishly swung up her bows and lurched over one of the undulations her mainboom jerked and lifted amidst a harsh clatter of blocks while the water inside her went swishing to and fro the noise presently aroused jake who was sitting silently at the helm  one of you had better get her pumped out he said you havent done it since we started and you wont find it easy by and by  it doesnt look nice up yonder said harry glancing windward  its either blowing hard in the pacific or going to do it and well get it presently id be better pleased if we were nearer that inlet its eight or nine miles off and the winds dead ahead  the dope men would rather have a black wild night wouldnt they suggested frank  theyre going to be gratified harry answered significantly  frank glad to do something to warm himself set to work at the little rotary pump and a stream of water splashed and spread about the deck which slanted and straightened irregularly he was still busy when jake called to him  you can let up and get that jib off her strip it right off the stay were not going to have any use for a sail of that kind get out the small one harry  theres no wind to speak of yet harry protested  well said jake grimly youll have plenty before youre through  harry dragged up the small sail and when frank had lowered the larger one they proceeded to strip it off the stay it took them some little time but frank glancing at the slowly heaving leaden water fancied that there was no need for haste until as he and his companion bundled the canvas off the deck jake called to them  up with that jib he ordered get a hustle  they had the halliard in their hands and the sail was half set when it blew out suddenly and there was a sharp creaking the sloop slanted over wildly and a curious humming rippling sound broke out to windward glancing around a moment frank saw that the swell was growing white and a rush of cold wind nearly whipped his cap away then jamming his feet against a ledge with the deck sloping away beneath him he struggled furiously to hoist the jib while disjointed cries reached him from the helmsman  heave jake roared i can do nothing with her until you have it set  they got the sail up somehow though by the time they had finished the sloops lee rail was in the sea and then flung themselves upon the mainsail they were breathless with the effort before they had tied two reefs in it and frank wondered at the change in their surroundings when at length he sat down in the well  the sea which had run in long and almost smooth undulations before they began to reef now splashed and seethed about the boat and each big slope of water was seamed with innumerable smaller ridges bitter spray was flying thick in the air water already sluiced about the deck and it was disconcerting to recollect that they were still eight miles from the inlet this would not have mattered so much had it not lain dead to windward which meant that they must fight for every yard they made  there was shelter to lee of them they could put up the helm and run but though they were wet through in a few minutes they braced themselves for the struggle while the savage blast screamed about them and the ominous sound frank had noticedthe splash of waves that curled and brokecame more loudly out of the gathering gloom ahead though his physical nature shrank from the task before him frank would not have chosen to go back it was a big thing they were taking a hand in the climax which all their previous adventures had led up to and he recognized that they must see it through at any cost  at last he was playing a mans part acting in close coöperation with the government of his country and mr barclay who had elaborated the scheme with infinite patience and foresight counted upon him and his comrade that they should fail him now was out of the question but frank was glad that jake sat at the tiller harry was quick and daring but he was young and in this fight there was urgent need for the instinctive skill which comes from long experience the helmsmans stolidness was more reassuring he gazed up to windward gripping the tiller with the spray upon his rugged face ready for whatever action might be necessary loud talking and an assertive manner were of no service here what was wanted was raw human valor and steadfast nerve it was fortunate that jake who was tranquil and goodhumored possessed both  darkness shut down on them suddenly as they thrashed her out to westward full and by lurching with flooded decks over the charging seas their whitened tops broke over her her canvas ran water and every other minute she plunged into a comber with buried bows the combers growing rapidly higher broke more angrily and her progress changed into a series of jerks and plunges which at times threatened to shake the spars out of her frank could see the black mainsail peak above him swinging madly up and down and it seemed at times that half her length was out of the water which was not improbably the case for the foam upon her hoveup deck poured aft in cascades over the low coaming and splashed about their feet by and by for she was shallowbodied like most centerboard craft it began to gather in a pool which washed to and fro across the floorings in her lee bilge and at a shout from jake he started the pump it needed no priming for as soon as he unscrewed the covering plate the sea ran down and there was now nothing to show what water it flung out because half the lee deck was buried in a rush of gurgling foam and the combers tops broke continuously over the bows  still the work roused and warmed him and he toiled on battered and almost blinded by flying brine while he wondered how long the boat would stand the pressure of her largely reduced sail he did not think they could tie another reef in because it seemed certain that something must burst or break the moment a rope was started besides even had it been possible reefing was out of the question their harbor lay to weather and a boat will not sail to windward in a vicious breeze unless she is driven at a speed which is greater than the resistance of the opposing seas  they thrashed her out for two anxious hours since it appeared doubtful that she would come round and a failure to stay her would be perilous in the extreme but at last jake called to the boys  weve got to do it somehow he said stand by your lee jibsheet and tail on to the mainsheet the moment you let it run hold on till i tell you well wait for a smooth  a smooth as it is termed by courtesy is the interval that now and then follows the onslaught of several unusually heavy seas and at length as the boat swung up with a little less water upon her deck jake seemed satisfied  now helms alee he shouted  they let the jib fly and jumping for the mainsheet hauled with all their might while jake helped them with one hand as the boat came up to the wind then as a comber fell upon her they sprang back to the jibsheet and hauled upon it while the spray flew all over them it struck frank that if the boat did not come round there would very speedily be an end of her while he watched holding his breath the bows swung around a little farther and working in frantic haste they let the sheet fly and made fast the opposite one which was now to lee she forged ahead on the other tackand the most imminent peril was past  it was two hours later when they raised the land again and though one or the other of them had pumped continuously the water was splashing high about their feet jake had however made a good shot of it for he recognized a ridge of higher ground marked upon the chart and they drove in toward it battered swept and streaming frank felt strangely limp when at length they ran into smoother water and jake made one significant remark  were through he said but if wed had to make another tack it would have finished her  the black land grew higher until they could make out masses of shadowy pines and eventually dropping the jib and peak they ran her in behind a point with very thankful hearts and let go the anchor half of their task was finished and they could take their ease until morning broke     chapter xxvii  the derelict   the wind freshened after they reached shelter and it blew very hard for a time frank found sleep impossible though he was glad to lie snug in the warm cabin with the lamp burning above him and the stove snapping cheerfully the sloop lurched and rocked drawing her chain tight now and then with a bang while a muffled uproar went on outside her frank could distinguish the angry splash of water upon her bows and the drumming and rapping of loose ropes against the mast though these sounds were partly drowned by the furious clamor of the ground sea beyond the point and a great deeptoned roaring made he supposed by long ranks of thrashing trees once or twice when jake who crawled out to see if the anchor was holding left the slide open the sound filled the cabin with tremendous pulsating harmonies  besides this the boys face smarted after the lashing of icy spray and he wondered whether mr barclays plans were working out successfully and what fresh adventures awaited harry and himself on the morrow all of which was sufficient to keep him in a state of restless expectation he envied his companion who presently went to sleep but it was toward morning when at last his own eyelids closed and he got a few snatches of fitful slumber broken by fantastic dreams he was awakened by a chill upon his face and looking around saw that jake had gone out again into the well the roar of the wind did not seem so overwhelming as it had been though there was no doubt that it was still blowing hard by and by jake called out  youd better get up he said ive a notion that theres somebody hailing us  frank crawled out shivering with harry grumbling half asleep behind him and when he stood in the well found he could see a hazy loom of trees across the little white waves that came splashing toward the boat they made a sharp rippling sound pitched in a different tone from the din that rose all around the latter swelled and sank and he was slightly surprised when he was able to hear what seemed to be a faint shout it rose again more clearly and there was no longer any doubt that somebody on the beach was hailing them  can we get ashore he asked  youll have to try said jake the mans to windward of us and it will be a stiff paddle but if you cant manage it youll blow across to the beach on the other side of the inlet safe enough and he may be able to get round to you anyway i dont want to leave the sloop shed have picked up her anchor once or twice if i hadnt given her more cable  what time is it harry inquired  about seven oclock jake answered well have daylight soon after youre back  they hauled up the canoe and were not surprised to find that she was full of water it took them some time to bail her out and frank felt anxious when at last they pushed her clear of the sloop it was difficult to tell how far off the beach was and for the first few moments they could make no progress against the blast then they won a yard or two in a partial lull and after that for a while barely held their own by determined paddling thick rain drove into their faces and the spray from the bows and splashing blades blew over them frank was breathless when they reached the beach and it cost him an effort to scramble over the uneven stones as far as the edge of the bush where a shadowy figure stood beside a horse its head drooped and even in the darkness which was not very deep its attitude was suggestive of exhaustion the man was dimly visible and they felt sure that he was the messenger they expected  youre here on barclays business he said  yes said harry have you a message for him  the man fumbled in his pocket and took out an envelope  thats from the boss i guess it will explain the thing but he said id better let you know that wed had trouble  then you didnt get the dope men  we corralled three of them the rest broke away one of the boys got a bullet in him and hes been lying in the rain all night i dont know how were going to pack him out  things went wrong said frank  they did the man assented one of the boys got his pistol off by accident just after the boat had come ashore and that gave our plans away the boats crew shoved off and several men whod been landed broke through in the dark anyhow when the trouble was over wed got one case of dope two whites of no account and a chinaman  and the schooner  she was heading out to sea with mighty little sail on her when i left youll be able to take word through to barclay  i dont know harry answered dubiously its too dark to tell what the seas like now i suppose theres no other means of warning him  no said the man even if i could get a message on to the wire they wouldnt be able to deliver it at the other end but he has to be warned somehow  if youll come off well give you breakfast it should be light enough to see what the weathers like by the time you had finished harry suggested  it cant be done was the answer ive to go on for a doctor and raise a crowd to run those fellows down ive already stayed longer than i should  your horse is played out frank objected  ill hire another theres a ranch somewhere ahead ill say you have taken that message  well do it if its any way possible said harry  the man turned away without another word and they heard him stumbling through the wood beside his horse until the roar of the wind drowned the sound after which they went back to the canoe they had no trouble in reaching the sloop for they were driven down upon her furiously and on clambering on board they found that jake had breakfast ready  it was daylight when they crawled out of the cabin after the meal but the sky was hidden by lowflying vapor and gazing seaward they could see only a short stretch of big leader combers which rolled up out of the haze crested with livid froth jake shook his head doubtfully at harry  youll have to stop a while he said she wouldnt run for half an hour before that sea we couldnt start till after dinner if the wind dropped right now but its falling and we might get away in the afternoon  the morning dragged by while the boys chafed at the delay though they had no doubt that jake was right and neither of them felt any keen desire to face the sea that was tumbling in from the pacific still the roar of the wind steadily diminished and the sloop rode more easily and at length jake offered to make the venture after they had had a meal  they lashed three reefs down before they started leaving only a small triangular strip of mainsail set but that proved quite enough and during the first few minutes frank felt almost appalled as he glanced at the great gray combers that heaved themselves up astern most of them were hollow breasted and their tops curled over flinging up long wisps of foam and roaring ominously as a rule they broke divided on either side of the boat piling up in a snowy welter high about her shrouds but now and then one seemed to break all over her and most of her deck was lost in a furious rush of water twice the canoe which was too big to stow on deck charged up and struck her with a resounding crash and then broke adrift and disappeared  by degrees however franks uneasiness diminished somewhat to his astonishment the light and buoyant craft stood the buffeting and by the time dusk fell the seas were getting smaller still they were big enough and the boat appeared to be driving before them at an extraordinary speed by eight oclock in the evening they had shaken out one reef and soon afterward frank lay down in the cabin because jake said that he had no intention of entrusting either him or harry with the helm which was on the whole a relief to both of them to run a small craft before a breaking sea in the dark is a very severe test of nerve and it is perhaps worse when the combers still come foaming after her after the wind has somewhat fallen  in spite of the violent motion frank managed to sleep until he was awakened some time after midnight by a shout from jake crawling out partly dazed with his eyes half open he saw that the sky had cleared and that a crescent moon was shining down then close ahead of them he saw the schooner  she was also running for her stern was toward them though for a moment or two it was hidden by the white top of a sea and frank could only make out the forward half of her sharply tilted deck her bowsprit and two torn jibs above it were high in the air and her black boomforesail all bunched up with its gaff which had swung down jammed against the foremast shrouds she carried no after canvas and the reason became evident when as her stern lurched up frank saw that her mainmast was broken off short she sank down again while a comber foamed high about her rail which was shattered on one quarter where the falling mast had struck and a mass of canvas and tangled gear trailed in the sea beneath it what struck the boy most however was the erratic manner in which she was progressing for her bows swung up to windward every now and then until all her side was visible and she lumbered off at angle to her course and then came lurching back again she was herringboning as it is called at sea in an extraordinary fashion and she seemed low in the water  in the meanwhile the sloop was coming up with her fast and jake stood up at the tiller to see more clearly  theyve been in trouble sure he said i could tell there was nobody at her helm when i first saw her and thats why i ran up so close ease the peak down one of you i dont want to run by until weve had a look at her  harry did so and as they stood watching her the schooner slued round until she was almost beam to wind the sea streamed down her weather side which rose up like a wall and frank could see her wheel behind the low deckhouse jerking to and fro there was no sign of life anywhere on board her  deserted jake said shortly they must have jibed her and smashed her mainmast she seems a smart vessel seems to me she ought to fetch a good many dollars  the sloop was sailing more slowly now with her peak swung down keeping pace with the schooner but a little behind her and the boys gazed hard at jake his rugged face looked very thoughtful in the moonlight  its a fair wind to the islands and shed come up until it was abeam with the foresail set if it was necessary he said it wouldnt be much trouble to sail her in and she could be beached somewhere in smooth water anyhow id like to get on board her  if you ran up close alongside when she screws to windward one of us could jump harry suggested eagerly theres a raffle of ropes over her quarter  jake seemed dubious it might be done and barclay would be uncommonly glad to get his hands on her but i cant leave the sloop somebody has to take that message  put us on board urged harry how far is it to the islands  with this wind and the whole sail on her she ought to fetch them by daylight then jake seemed to hesitate looks as if there was water in her but one could wear her round and fetch the land to southward if she was leaking very bad  the boys looked at each other and the same impulse seized upon both of them this was an adventure such as they had never dreamed of and with a fair wind they would only have to keep the vessel running until they picked up the land it would not be difficult for she was under very easy sail and the only hazard would be in the attempt to get on board her then harry jumped forward and hauled up the peak  run alongside as quick as you can he said  jake put down his helm a little and the boys stood up on the weather deck with tense set faces as the sloop crept in under the schooners lea the latter slued to windward while the spray flew over her rolling until her deck on the side nearest them was level with the sea and then fell off again and sluggishly heaved her bows high above the foam this herringboning was the danger since it would need nerve and skill to get near her without wrecking the sloop a blow from the big lurching hull would probably send her to the bottom  frank felt himself quivering all through as they closed with the derelict yard by yard until when she once more lumbered round to windward jake put down his helm a little farther the sloop shot in beneath the black hull which broke the sea and partly sheltered her but as she swept forward amidst a long wash of foam franks courage ebbed away from him a great white swell lapped about the wall of wet planking close in front of him and the top of it was higher than his head it seemed impossible that he could spring out from the lurching sloop and by any means clamber up all his senses shrank from the dangerous task but with a determined effort he braced himself if harry made the attempt he would do it too and he clenched his hands and set his lips as the schooners side came sinking down  dont jump unless you are sure you can reach her shouted jake  they were now scarcely a fathom from the trailing wreckage and the schooners rail was dipping lower it seemed just possible to clutch it by a desperate leap and the next moment harry launched himself out into the air frank followed struck the wet planking and seizing a trailing rope held on by it with his legs in the sea then he dragged himself up clear of the water and harry who was kneeling in the opening in the broken rail reached down to him  frank clutched his hand and in a few more seconds was almost astonished to find himself breathless and dripping safe upon the schooners deck a glance showed him the sloop abreast of her quarter and about a dozen yards away  jake did that mighty smartly harry gasped ill get to the wheel while you look around her     chapter xxviii  a grim discovery   frank had some difficulty in getting about the vessel she was rolling wildly and loose ropes and blocks whipped blindly to and fro but he noticed that the boat had gone and the cleanly severed shrouds indicated that her mainmast had been cut loose after it had fallen over the side it was evident that the crew had made some attempt to save the vessel before they abandoned her the mainboom had disappeared though the broken gaff and part of the sail were still attached to the hull by a mass of tangled gear scrambling forward he found the anchor lying still hooked to a tackle and half secured with its arms upon the rail which suggested that the smugglers had sailed in haste and had been kept too busy afterward to make it fast it was reassuring to discover that the anchor could be dropped without much trouble if this became necessary then he came upon a lantern hooked beneath the forecastle scuttle and went back to report to harry the latter who was standing at the wheel listened to him attentively  well he said at length i cant figure out the thing and unless some of the dope men explain it i dont think were likely to be much wiser as jake said it looks as if they had jibed her by accident which would probably rip out the mainmast but although its easy to bring the mainboom over on a foreandaft rigged craft its mighty seldom that a capable sailor does it then as theres water in her they must have bumped her on a reef though she could only have struck once or twice before she drove over it thats as far as i can get and the first thing is to find out what water there is below its fortunate you have a lantern  frank looked around there was no doubt that the wind was falling and the schooner having only part of her forward canvas set steered easily the sloop which had sheered off a little farther was sailing abreast of her with lowered peak about a hundred yards away rising and falling with the long combers which however broke less angrily  jake will stand by for three or four hours harry explained after that hell have to haul her up to make the inlet where we were to join barclay but it will be close on daylight by then  frank was glad to hear it there would be some peril in getting on board the sloop if that became necessary but it was comforting to see her close at hand in the meanwhile he shrank from going below and made no move to do so until harry spoke again  im anxious about that water and you had better get down he said go in by the house therell probably be a lazaret below it with an opening in the deck  frank reluctantly scrambled forward around the house the door of which faced toward the bows and being out of the wind there he contrived to light the lantern though he struck several matches in the attempt the house which occupied most of the vessels quarter was low so that the mainboom could swing over it and it was evident that the cabin floor was sunk some feet below the level of the deck frank thrust the door open and then stood hesitating holding up the lantern which did not burn well and only flung a faint light into the obscurity before him he could hear an ominous gurgle of water below when the schooner rolled and made out three or four steps which seemed to lead down into it as he placed his foot on the first of them the vessel lurched wildly and he went down with a bang while the lantern flew out of his hand for no very evident reason except that he was overstrung he could have shouted in alarm as he lay upon the wet flooring in the dark he had struck his knee in his fall and for a moment or two he feared to move it  then he noticed a pale reflection against what he supposed to be the bottom of a seat and as it was evident that the overturned lantern had not quite gone out he crawled toward it as he did so the splash and gurgle of water seemed much louder than it had done on deck he could hear it surge against the sides of the vessel and the hollow sound jarred upon his nerves he longed to escape from the oppressive obscurity and get out into the moonlight by his companions side but he reflected that it would not be pleasant to tell harry that he had run away from the darkness and left the lantern he determined to secure the latter and he was moving toward it on hands and knees when his fingers struck something that felt like a pistol he let it lie however and stretched out his hand for the lantern setting it upright the flickering flame grew brighter and standing up he flung the uncertain light about him there was undoubtedly a revolver on the uncovered floor which was dripping wet and he thought it curious that the smugglers should have left the weapon lying in that position but ever since he had boarded the schooner he had been troubled by an uncomfortable sense of strangeness the fact that her crew had abandoned her apparently without a sufficient reason suggested a mystery then he raised his hand so that the radiance touched a little clampeddown table and as it did so he started and came near dropping the lantern again for a man sat at the table with his head and shoulders resting upon it as if he had suddenly fallen forward  frank afterward confessed that his first impulse was to run toward the door and he was never quite certain why he did not do so but he stood still holding up the lantern while his heart throbbed painfully and his flesh seemed to creep the bent figure was unnaturally still but when the schooner lurched and the table slanted it fell forward a little farther all in one piecewhich was how he thought of itand as a heavy sack would have done that was too much for frank and clambering up the steps he ran back to harry in breathless haste  you look as if something had scared you said the latter with a trace of anxiety in his voice  frank leaned against the house and his face showed white and set in the moonlight  theres a man lying across the table in the cabin he panted  harry started but he pulled up his helm a spoke or two  shell come up if i leave her but that wont matter much he said well go back together  frank felt a little easier now that he had a companion and he was more collected when he stood in the cabin holding up the light while harry who called first and got no answer walked cautiously toward the huddled figure then he shrank back a pace or two  the mans dead he said  after that neither of them moved for half a minute during which the deck slanted wildly beneath them and then frank proceeded very reluctantly toward the table harry followed him and when they stooped over the shadowy figure frank caught a partial glimpse of a yellow face and saw that the man wore a loose blue jacket  turn the light a little said harry in a low hoarse voice and when frank had done so he looked around at him  its the man we got dinner with the day we went up the creek hes been shot he added  once more the horror of the thing was almost too much for frank but just then a furious thrashing of loose canvas and clatter of blocks broke out above them and relieved the tension  shes luffing with the sea on her quarter said harry i must get back to the helm but well wait a moment and look around first lower your lantern theres something on the floorno i dont mean the pistol though you can pick that up  he stooped down beside frank who held the lantern close to the wet planking and saw for the first time a broad wet stain upon it leading toward the steps that was enough for both of them and saying nothing further they scrambled toward the door they did not stop until they reached the wheel and then harry spent a few moments getting the vessel before the wind again  were no wiser about the water yet he said at length with a strained laugh  no said frank i didnt think about iti only wanted to get out as quick as i could he broke off and then added what do you make of it  harry stretched out one hand for the pistol opened it and held it up in the moonlight  theres a shell still in he said the man it belonged to must have dropped it in a mighty hurry its clear that there was a row on board her either before or after she lost her mast that chinaman had a bullet through his head and somebody else was hurt though he got out of the housethe stains showed that i wonderand he dropped his voiceif we ought to search the forecastle  im not going down frank answered decisively  well said harry i dont feel like it either thats the simple fact  again there was silence for a while and both were glad that the solid end of the house stood between them and what lay in the cabin then frank roused himself  weve forgotten about the water but the hatch is smashed he said i expect they dropped the boat upon it in heaving her out i might get down that way  you had better try said harry glancing around and pointing to the sloop which was now nearer them jake must have edged her in when he saw the schooner come up with no one at the helm he added its nice to feel that hes about  frank agreed with him once more he found the sight of the sloop curiously reassuring but he scrambled forward and wriggling through a hole in the broken hatch clambered partly down a beam there was water below him but there was less than he expected and he could not hear any more pouring in though he recognized that this would have been difficult on account of the gurgling and splashing that was going on after listening for a minute or two he went back to harry  theres a good deal of water in her he said hadnt we better heave some of it out  i dont think it would be worth while was harrys answer you could hardly work the pump alone and if i left the helm shed keep running up into the wind and yawing about id rather shove her along steadily toward the land  then cant we get the foresail properly set and drive her a little faster frank inquired she ought to bear it now the winds dropping  it was not only the leak that troubled him he wanted to escape as soon as possible from the horror that seemed to pervade the vessel and his companion eagerly seized upon the suggestion  why of course replied harry i might have thought of it but ive been kind of dazed since we got out of the cabin  they went forward and led the halliards to the winch but they would have had trouble in setting the partly lowered sail if the schooner had not come up into the wind and relieved the strain on it by degrees they heaved up the gaff and peaked it after which they went aft as the vessel plowed faster over the falling sea  now said frank the question is where are we heading for  ive been worrying over that while we set the sail harry responded if we hauled her up right now we might perhaps fetch the inlet where we arranged to join barclay but wed have to jibe the foresail over and as i would have to keep the helm while i brought her round and you wouldnt be able to check the sheet alone its very likely that something would smash when the boom came across besides that wed have a strip of rocky coast to lee of us presently and we mightnt be able to keep her off it with only the foresail set on the other hand so far as i can recollect from looking at the chart the islands are dead to leeward and wed only have to keep her running to reach them theres a sound where wed find smooth water once we sailed her in that would be the wiser plan  frank concurring in this sat down near the helm he felt that he would not like to go far away and he remembered that night watch long afterward  the moon crept on to the westward getting lower and now and then flying clouds obscured the silvery light the combers still came surging after them crested with glittering froth though they no longer broke about the rail and there was a constant gurgling and splashing of water inside the lurching vessel at last jake jibed the sloops mainsail over and stood away from them the moon was very low now and frank grew somewhat uneasy as he watched the boats canvas fade into the creeping gloom shortly afterward the moon dipped altogether and it was very dark  we cant be far off the land said harry i dont want to come up with it before daylight but with no after canvas on her i dont suppose we could round her up and wait if we did im not sure we could get her to fall off againone of the jibs is torn to ribands and the others split well have to keep her running  they drove on and presently a faint gray light crept across the water to the east a little later when all the sky was flushed with red and saffron a long black smear cut sharply across the glow  the first of the islands announced harry its right abeam we must get some foresail sheet in  they had difficulty in doing so though they led the sheet to the winch but the schooner came up closer afterward and when the sun had climbed above a bank of cloud the end of the island was rising before them and a strip of water opening up beyond it half an hour later they ran in with the foresail peak lowered down and frank gazed anxiously ahead as they drove on more slowly up a broad channel on one hand there were rocks and scrubby pines with larger trees behind but he wondered what the result would be if a reef or a jutting point lay in front of them the vessels speed however grew slower still the water became smoother and at last harry looked around at him  if youll unhook the tackle and cut the lashing you ought to get the anchor over he remarked ill luff her as far as possible and youll heave the thing off when i drop the foresail  there followed a clatter of blocks and a furious rattle of running chain which presently stopped then as the swinging vessel drew her cable out they toiled desperately at the windlass to heave up more of it from below the task was almost beyond their strength but somehow they managed it and harry clapped on a chain stopper  that should hold her he said theres not much wind now id be glad to leave her if i could get ashore  this however was out of the question since the canoe had gone and very much against their will they waited on board for several hours until at length a trail of smoke arose above the pines then a little steamer with foam about her bows appeared from behind a point and the hoot of her whistle rang sharply across the water  barclay sure said harry im certainly glad to see him  a few minutes later mr barclay climbed on board and went down into the cabin and all over the vessel with them before he made any remarks at length he turned to the boys as they stood by the rail  you have done a very smart thing and i dont think youll have any reason for regretting it he said pointedly this is a good setoff against the failure at the other end jake got in with the message and we started as soon as id had a talk with him fortunately we were able to creep along through the sounds and its scarcely likely that any of the smugglers can have seen us  but what has become of this vessels crew frank asked  i dont know replied mr barclay well probably ascertain something about them later  do you expect to corral the rest of them tonight harry broke in  its possible said mr barclay with a trace of dryness the first thing however is to beach this vessel and then you and jake must get off in the sloop theres a good deal to be done and i want to run the steamer back out of sight up the inlet as soon as it can be managed  he called some of his companions on board and when frank and harry sat down to an excellent meal in the steamers cabin they heard the men heaving the schooners anchor     chapter xxix  the raid   daylight was breaking when the boys ran into the cove near the ranch after a quick passage and saw mr oliver standing on the beach  ive been looking out for you rather anxiously he said when he had shaken hands with them has barclay been successful  no said harry not altogether some of the dope men got away at the first place where they landed  mr oliver looked rather grave at this how many of them escaped  i dont know exactly the messenger said several besides the crew of the schooner abandoned her and it seems likely that they got ashore that would make two parties who may have joined each other  ah said mr oliver its a pity in various ways how did barclay get on at the other end  i cant tell you he didnt expect to make the seizure until night when the dope mens friends would be waiting for the schooner to run in and he sent us off in the afternoon  it was wise of him mr oliver answered in the meanwhile your aunt hasnt cleared breakfast away and as i expect youre ready for it well go in at once  during the meal they gave him an outline of their adventures to which he listened thoughtfully then he said  you had better lie down and get a sleep well have another talk about it later on  i think id rather work said frank we got some sleep in turns last night and i dont feel like lying down the fact is he added hesitatingly weve been doing something or other so hard since we went away that i dont think i could leave off all at once i feel strung up yet and id rather keep busy  mr oliver smiled understandingly thats sensible theres nothing as good as your regular work for cooling you off and helping you to get calm again but if you like you can take a note over to webster and you neednt hurry back if he asks you to have dinner with him then there are two or three stumps you may as well grub out  they set out soon afterward and frank for one was glad of the walk he had been cramped on board the sloop and the excitement of the last few days had told on him he was nervously restless and felt that it would be useless to lie down until he was physically worn out when he mentioned it to harry the latter confessed to a similar sensation and added that they had not yet finished with the dope men  mr webster was at work in his clearing when they reached it but he walked with them to his house dropping mr olivers note into the stove as soon as he read it  youll have dinner before you go back and tell your father ill come along he said would you like to take that single gun with you frank harry still has the other one  frank said that he would be very glad but his companion broke in  what did dad ask you to come over for  he wasnt very precise answered mr webster evasively hell probably tell me more when im at the ranch  as it was evident that he did not mean to be communicative they ate their dinner without asking any further questions but when they were walking home through the bush harry smiled at his companion significantly  what do you make of the whole thing he asked  i dont know said frank your father looked troubled when he heard the dope men had got away  he did assented harry then he sent over for webster who wouldnt tell us what he was wanted for though he made you take that gun along  frank knitted his brows  well he said thoughtfully its only an idea of mine but its possible that the fellows who escaped might make an attack upon the ranch out of revenge now if we allow that the schooner had been driving along before the wind for some time after she was abandonedand several things pointed to itone would fancy that the men who left her must have landed not very far from the spot where barclays men tried to seize them it seems to me the first thing theyd do would be to attempt to join the rest so as to be strong enough to resist a posse sent out to hunt them down it would be clear that somebody had given them away and theyd no doubt blame your father of course they suspected him already  youve hit it said harry whose face grew stern if they come along therell be trouble but well make some of it i dont feel kind to the dope men after that sight in the schooners cabin  frank thought that his companion wore very much the same look as his father had done on the morning when he stood beside the fallen horse with the smoking pistol in his hand  i expect theyll be desperate now he said but harry did not answer and they walked on a little faster  on arriving at the ranch they set about grubbing up the stumps and managed to get one big one out during the few hours daylight that remained but neither of them were sorry when miss oliver called them in to supper frank however stood still a moment or two glancing about him and leaning upon his grubhoe there was not a breath of wind stirring and the firs rose in dense shadowy masses against a soft gray sky the light was fading off the clearing the rows of stumps had grown blurred and dim and it was impressively still the whole surroundings looked very peaceful one could imagine them steeped in continual tranquillity but frank remembered the broken mower and became vaguely uneasy besides he could not get the scene in the schooners cabin where the dead man lay fallen forward across the table out of his mind then miss oliver called him again and making an effort to throw off this exceedingly unpleasant train of thought he strode quickly toward the house  they sat about the stove after supper and frank fancied that mr oliver was listening for something now and then but for a while no sound rose from the clearing he made the boys give him a few more particulars about their adventures  what do you suppose barclay meant when he said that we would not be sorry we had brought the schooner in asked harry  well his father replied when he had considered a moment the vessel was abandoned when you fell in with her if she had been employed in a legitimate trade you could have enforced a claim for your services and you would have had no difficulty in getting a large share of her value the affair however is complicated by the fact that she was engaged in smuggling because while i dont know much about these matters im inclined to believe that would warrant the revenue authorities in either seizing her altogether or holding her as security for a heavy fine still even in this case you should have a claim and ive no doubt that barclay will look after your interests  have you any idea what our share would be frank asked eagerly  i could only make a guess as she seems to be a comparatively new vessel and is probably in good repair except for the damage she received on the night in question i think you could hold out for two thousand dollars its quite possible that she only started a plank or two and a new mainmast wouldnt cost a great deal  two thousand dollars and frank gasped with astonishment  i believe the award depends upon the value of the services rendered and the hazard incurred mr oliver answered with a smile there seems very little doubt that the vessel would have gone to the bottom if you hadnt fallen in with her and i expect any arbitrator would admit that in running alongside and getting on board her in a heavy sea you did a dangerous thing jake of course would take a share though his would be a smaller one than yours but barclay will be able to tell you more about it than i can we must get his advice as soon as possible  shortly afterward mr webster arrived carrying a rifle and frank observed that mr oliver was glad to see him they however only discussed fruit growing and the price of stock and when by and by the boys became drowsy mr oliver told them that they had better go to bed  the boys were about to withdraw to their room when harry had a sudden thought  wheres the dog he asked  in the stable said mr oliver dryly we have kept him there the last few nights  it occurred to frank that this had been done as a precaution since the stable and barn stood close together at some little distance from the house but harry made some careless answer and they turned away toward their room when they reached it harry sat down on his bed and his face looked grave in the lamplight  dads expecting trouble he said you noticed that all the guns were laid handy and there was a lot of shot as well as rifle shells spread out loose on the shelf  do you think the dope men will come tonight  i cant say i wouldnt be astonished if they did anyhow im dead played out and we can go to sleep because dad and webster mean to sit up all night i dont know whether you noticed that the coffee pot was on the stove and dad had his cigar box out  frank had not noticed it but he had already discovered that in some matters his companions eyes were sharper than his own he however made no comment for a heavy weariness had seized him at last and he was glad to get his clothes off and go to bed he was soon asleep and some hours had passed when he felt harrys hand upon his shoulder raising himself suddenly he looked around the room was very dark and he could hear nothing until a door latch clicked below and he fancied that he heard stealthy footsteps outside the building  you had better get up and dress as quick as you can said harry thats webster crossing the clearing dad slipped out a minute or two before him  frank scrambled into his clothes and followed harry to the window where they leaned upon the ledge there was no doubt that somebody was moving away from the house because they could hear the withered grass rustle and now and then the faint crackle of a twig but they could see nothing except the leafless fruit trees and the black wall of bush shutting in the clearing  then a savage growl that sounded dulled and muffled broke out from the stable and frank felt a little quiver run through him the sound died away and he found the heavy silence that followed it hard to bear but a few moments later the dog growled again and then broke into a series of short snapping barks  if he gets loose somebodys going to be sorry said harry with a harsh strained laugh then he gripped franks arm hard look yonder  a yellow blaze suddenly leaped up beside the barn and grew brighter rapidly until frank made out a mans black figure outlined against it he seemed to be throwing an armful of brush or withered twigs upon the spreading fire and frank swung around toward his companion  hadnt we better shout or run down he asked  wait said harry shortly dads already on that fellows trail  he was right for while the figure bent over the fire a thin streak of red sparks flashed out from among the fruit trees and the crash of a rifle filled the clearing the man leaped back from the fire ran a few paces at headlong speed and vanished suddenly into the shadow  hes not hurt frank said hoarsely  then its because dad didnt mean to hit him harry answered that was a warning  he doesnt seem to be going to put out the fire  no said harry with the same strained laugh dad knows too much for that those logs are thick they wont light easy and its only a little pile of small stuff thats burning dad has no use for standing out where those fellows can see him unless its necessary in the meanwhile the dope men dont know where he is and thats going to worry them  frank could understand this it seemed very likely that the small fire would burn out before the logs caught and it was clear that the men who had made it could not run back into the light to throw on more brushwood without incurring the hazard of being shot on the other hand mr oliver would have to face the same peril if he approached to put it out from this it seemed very probable that both he and the dope men would wait to see what the result would be  in the meanwhile the crash of the rifle had had a curious effect on frank it was the first time that he had ever seen a shot fired in anger and he was sufficiently well acquainted with mr olivers character to feel certain that if the warning failed to prove efficacious the next bullet would not go wide he felt his nerves tingle and caught his breath more quickly for it seemed highly probable that he might be shortly called on to watch or perhaps take part in some horrible thing he did not mean to shirk it but at the same time he was conscious that he would have greatly preferred to be standing beside the schooners wheel while she lurched over the big foaming seas  the suspense became almost intolerable as he watched the fire which presently sank until at last only a feeble flickering blaze was left then a figure sprang out of the shadow and ran toward it carrying something in its arms the next moment there was another crash in a different part of the clearing from where they had heard the first shot and the figure dropping its burden vanished suddenly  thats webster said harry dryly im not sure that he meant to miss  in the meanwhile the savage barking of the dog whom they had scarcely noticed during the last few moments once more forced itself upon their attention  why doesnt your father let the dog get after them frank asked  i dont know harry answered its possible hed rather not have them routed out from among the trees if it were only daylight we could stand them off have you your watch  frank took it from his pocket and rubbed a sulphur match in nervous haste it went out and he struck another with quivering fingers a pale glow of light sprang up and he held the watch close against it  only four oclock he announced therell be more than three hours darkness yet  harry made no answer and except for the barking of the dog there was silence for a minute or two it was frank at last who broke it  i cant stand any more of this he said lets go down  his companion seemed to hesitate its not nice but i dont know what to do aunts in the house and though jakes on the lookout somewhere ive a notion that dad would call us if he meant us to come he broke off and added in a very suggestive tone i dontwantto stay in  we could go as far as the door anyway frank persisted  they slipped out of the room and made for the kitchen very quietly but frank was a little astonished when they reached it because though there was no lamp burning the front of the stove was open and the faint glow which shone out fell upon miss oliver who was sitting close by a rifle lay upon the table at her side and jakes shadowy figure showed up near the open window  where are you going harry she asked  harry stopped and leaned upon the table out into the clearing a little way after that i dont know i dont want to spoil dads plans by butting in before its necessary but i wish hed told us what to do you wont mind if we go  ive jakeand this miss oliver answered quietly pointing to the rifle on the whole i think id just as soon you tried to find out what is going on but keep out of sight while youre about it and be cautious  they slipped out and when they stopped at a short distance from the house frank touched his companion  can she shoot he asked  its my opinion that shed beat you at it every time said harry curtly  he raised his hand as though to demand silence and they both stood listening but there was deep silence now for the dog had ceased to bark it was difficult to imagine that somewhere in the shadowy clearing there were a number of men watching with every sense alert  i think the first shot came from the other side of the fruit trees well look in among them said harry  treading very softly they made for the trees which were young and had shed their leaves but their trunks and branches massed in long rows offered concealment they would not entirely cover up the figure of any one standing among them but they would break its outline which is almost as effective since as frank had already learned it is singularly difficult to recognize an object when one can only see a part of it besides the sky was overcast and there was no moon visible  the boys walked a few steps and stopped again to consider it was as still as ever and there was nothing to guide them in deciding where mr oliver or mr webster might be while they recognized that any noise they made would probably be followed by a rifle shot the smugglers and ranchers would naturally be listening for the least sound that might betray each others presence the first incautious movement would therefore lay either party open to attack and frank could understand the smugglers hesitation in making another attempt to burn the barn since apart from any noise they made the figure of the man who started the fire would be forced up clearly by the light indeed he fancied that so long as the two men kept still their opponents must do the same  in the meanwhile he found it singularly difficult to crouch in the grass waiting and listening it would have been much easier to move forward even at the hazard of drawing the smugglers fire upon himself but as this was out of the question he restrained the desire to do so by an effort of his will to hasten an attack would interfere with mr olivers plans and there was no doubt that the odds against the rancher were already heavy frank however could not keep his heart from thumping painfully or his fingers from trembling upon the gun barrel never had time seemed to pass so slowly  several minutes dragged by and still no sound rose from the surrounding fruit trees or shadowy clearing it almost seemed as if mr oliver and his opponents meant to lie motionless until the morning which frank realized was a good deal more than he could force himself to do     chapter xxx  the relief of the ranch   the silence was becoming unendurable when it was suddenly broken by two sharp ringing crashes in quick succession though frank was afterward ashamed of it he fairly jumped and came very nearly dropping his gun while he was struggling with an impulse to fire at random into the darkness there was an answering bang and he felt a tug at his elbow  i think it was webster who fired first said harry in a low tense voice if im wrong it means that the dope men have got in between us and the house but that isnt likely dad would have heard them and made a move if theyd tried it  frank said nothing and when the echoes died away among the woods there was once more a nervetrying silence except for the savage barking of the dog it lasted a few minutes and then harry spoke again  the shots will be quite enough to put dad on to those fellows trail i expect hes crawling in on them now  the boys whisper was hoarse with anxiety but he made no attempt to move and frank wondered at his selfcommand shortly afterward there was an unexpected change in the situation for a faint flicker of light shot up again from where frank supposed the barn to be this was puzzling because while the light was rather high up and there seemed to be a brighter blaze beneath it frank could not see the fire then the explanation flashed upon him as the black shape of the building became dimly visible against the uncertain glow the smugglers had lighted a second fire behind the barn which now stood between them and mr oliver frank gasped with dismay as he realized that it was a simple and effective trick if the rancher moved forward hastily he must betray himself to his enemies by the noise he made while if he proceeded slowly and cautiously the barn would probably take fire before he reached a spot from which he could drive back the men who were no doubt piling up brushwood against the building  it looks as if theyd got us he whispered  no said harry sharply and aloud the thing didnt strike me but dads not to be caught like that now as any row we make will draw them off him well hurry up get up and run  frank did so but although he had been longing to do something of the kind a few minutes earlier he found that he had no great liking for the part harry expected him to play it was decidedly unpleasant to feel that in all probability he was fixing upon himself the attention of several men who could shoot very well he had gone only a few paces however when there was a shot from behind the barn and harry laugheda breathless laugh  thats dad hes headed them off again he said  frank ran on but thrilling as he was with excitement it occurred to him that this battle was a rather intricate one in which he was right these bushmen were accustomed to hunting and trailing and did not rush at each others throats shouting and firing more or less at random instead they seemed to be maneuvering for positions from which they could prevent their opponents from making another move nowadays in any battle large or small in which men are engaged who can handle the terrible modern rifle the position is the one essential thing since it is only the most desperate courage that can drive home an attack upon a wellcovered firing line  soon after the boys had heard the shot a shadowy figure slipped out from among the fruit trees close in front of them and frank called webster  the man swung around but instead of answering he sprang backward and frank realized that he had almost run into the arms of one of the smugglers the boys did not see where he went though he made some noise and they afterward concluded that he had mistaken them for grown men in the meanwhile they went on again more cautiously until at length they were stopped by a low cry and mr oliver rose from the grass a few feet away they were on the other side of the barn now and could see that the fire had got hold of it there was no doubt that some of the logs were burning and a pile of brushwood which had been laid against them was burning fiercely  its spreading said harry cant we put it out  no said his father with grim quietness it would take time and at least a dozen wet grain bags while it wouldnt be safe for any one to approach the light  there was something in his voice that startled frank  you have hit one of them he asked  theres reason for believing it webster and i couldnt watch the four sides of the barn and they chose the one that seemed the most unlikely still as it happened i got around quick enough  then what are we to do now harry inquired  fall back on the house replied mr oliver ive sent webster on and its no use waiting for another of them to come out into the light  the boys turned back with him moving quickly but making no more noise than they could help and on reaching the dwelling they found mr webster standing in the kitchen the room was dark except for the faint glow which shone out from the front of the stove and miss oliver was still sitting where the boys had last seen her with an open box of cartridges at her feet there was however light enough outside for a red glare which grew steadily brighter streamed across the clearing  wheres the dog harry asked  i dont know said mr webster i let him out before i came along i expect youre going to hear him presently  there was silence for the next six or seven minutes during which frank heard the ticking of a clock and the crackle of knotty pinewood in the stove he could see mr oliver standing a little on one side of the open window an indistinct figure with face and hands that showed dimly white his pose indicated that he was holding a rifle level with his breast and presently as the red glow behind the fruit trees grew higher and brighter the barrel twinkled in a ray of light then there was a furious barking and jake laughed at the sound  well he said they dont mean to keep us waiting  mr oliver turned to the boys keep clear of this window and watch the other one youre not to fire a shot unless i tell you  the barking of the dog grew louder and it was evident that the animal was following the smugglers toward the house but frank could see nobody for a while then he made out two or three moving shadows among the fruit trees but they vanished again as the light sank and he almost wished that they would spring out from cover and make a rush upon the building he could imagine them creeping stealthily nearer and nearer and the strain of the forced inaction became nearly unbearable he learned that night that it is often a good deal easier to fight than to wait  at last a harsh voice rose from the gloom  youll have to get out oliver it said clear out in your sloop with the folks you have with you and well let you go youre mighty lucky in getting the option  and what about the ranch mr oliver asked  well tend to it another man answered pointedly pitch your guns through the window and come out right now  youre wasting time replied mr oliver im going to stay  then youll certainly be sorry some one else broke in weve had about enough trouble right along with you and weve come to hand in the bill you headed us off a good trade you brought the revenue folks in and we mean to get even before we leave just now well be satisfied with your homestead but that wont be enough after the next shots fired  it was a grim warning and what made it more impressive to frank was the fact that he could not see the man who uttered it so far the smugglers had only revealed their presence by their voices the next moment there was a cry of pain or alarm and a rifle flashed  kill that blamed dog somebody ordered with an oath  then mr oliver called to harry who had gone to the window across the room  can you see anybody on that side he asked  no was the answer i think theyre all in front  mr oliver turned to jake slip out through the back window with the boys and work around to the stumps from there youll have those fellows clear against the light wait until the shooting startsand then do what you can  sure was the short answer and jake crossed the room  harry had already dropped from the window and frank promptly followed him feeling relieved now that he had something definite to do circling around through the fruit trees they reached the first row of stumps one end of which ran up rather close to the house as frank crouched down among the roots of one he saw the smugglers there were six or seven of them visible along the edge of the trees though he fancied that there were more of them farther back in the shadows which grew thinner and then more dense again as the light rose and fell still before the men could reach the house they would have to cross a clear space where the glow was brighter which they were evidently reluctant to do their hesitation was very natural since they had discovered that their opponent was unusually quicksighted and handy with the rifle  a few moments after the boys reached the stumps a great blaze shot up as part of the barn fell in and frank saw a man who seemed to be the leader of the gang run forward heading toward the back of the house as he did so frank recognized him and harry cried out softly for one of the runners shoulders was higher than the other and he had a rather curious gait then there was a shout from one of those behind  plug the brute look out for the dog  a low and very swift shadow flashed across the open space behind the man harry laughed hoarsely as the man went down and rolled over with an indistinct object apparently on his back he cried out there was a confused shouting and some of his companions came running toward him showing black against the light frank held his breath as he watched he expected to see two flashes from the window since mr webster and mr oliver had now an easy mark but they did not fire the next moment he shrank in sudden horror for the cries grew sharper and suggested pain and an extremity of fear then he felt that regardless of the hazard he could almost have cheered the smugglers on as they ran toward the prostrate man who was struggling vainly with the furious dog they surged about him in a confused group and just then to franks amazement a pistol flashed among the firs on the edge of the bush it was followed by a sudden clamor whereupon the group broke up and running men streamed out across the clearing the smugglers vanished and harry sprang out from among the stumps shouting wildly  its barclay hes brought a posse with him he cried come on we must choke off the dog  when they reached the spot they tried with all their might to drag back the furious animal the man who had flung his arms about his throat and face now lay still with the big and powerful animal still tearing at him it was not until jake arrived and partly stunned it with his rifle butt that it let go and then two or three breathless strangers came running up to them they dragged the smuggler to his feet and frank saw that his jacket was torn to pieces and that the back of his neck from which it fell away was red he did not seem capable of speaking and he drew his breath in gasps but the newcomers hustled him along between them toward the house  stick to him said harry hes the boss of the gang  they thrust the man into the kitchen where he fell into a chair and for the lamp was lighted now gazed at mr oliver stupidly  well he said im corralledmy guns in the clearing he raised his hand to his neck and brought it down smeared red before he added its mighty lucky he didnt get hold in front  mr oliver who made no answer swung around and faced mr barclay standing hot and breathless in the doorway smiling at them  its fortunate i came along he said and striding forward glanced at the man in the chair weve got you at last  sure admitted the other still in a halfdazed manner ill have to face itonly keep off that dog  mr barclay looked around at mr oliver i expect the boys have also got most of his partners before we broke cover i sent a party to head them off  harry suddenly called to frank who sprang toward the door but when they reached the bush they met the rest of the men coming back with several prisoners they reported that two or three had escaped and they would have to wait for daylight before following their trail  half an hour later the boys sat down again in the kitchen where mr oliver and mr barclay who had been out in the meanwhile were talking by the stove  id an idea that these fellows might look you up which was why i came along as fast as i could manage mr barclay was explaining i think i told you we got practically every man who was waiting for the schooner at the inlet and the two or three who escaped tonight wont count in the meanwhile id arranged at two or three different places to seize everybody we suspected of having a hand in the thing and if the boys i left that work to have been as lucky as we are we can take it for granted that we have put an end to the gang theres enough against the fellow the dog mauled to have him sent up for the rest of his life he broke off and turned to the boys the schooner will be sold by auction and if you are inclined to leave the matter in my hands you can give me a written claim for salvage services  how much should we put down harry asked  i would suggest three thousand dollars responded mr barclay with twinkling eyes it doesnt follow that youll be awarded the whole of it but its generally admitted that one shouldnt be too modest in sending in a claim if you two become partners you could buy a ranch  harry turned with a smile to frank well he said if youre willing we might consider it in a year or two  then one of the men came in to report that the prisoners had been secured in the stable mr barclay soon dismissed him with a few brief instructions and sat down again lighting a cigar  i dont know that theres much more to tell he said when we were a mile or two off the cove we saw the blaze of your barn and that gave us an idea of what was going on we sent the steamer along as fast as she could travel but i broke my posse up to surround the clearing as soon as we got ashore then we lay by and waited so as to get as many of the gang as possible they were too busy watching you to notice any little noise the boys made and on the whole i think we can be content with this nights work  have you decided what led up to the shooting of that man in the schooners cabin harry asked  that said mr barclay is a matter for the criminal court but ive made a few investigations and my notion is that the fellows lost their nerve when it became evident that somebody had given them away they suspected one another and that led to trouble while ive no doubt that the chinaman held most of the secrets of the gang hed be a particular object of suspicion but from what i can gather there was a general row during which she jibed and got ashore there was at least one other man badly hurt but they seem to have gone off in the same boat the vessel probably struck on an outlying reef and came off almost immediately on the rising tide  frank went out soon afterward and sat down near the house the fire had almost burned out and a light wind which had sprung up drove the last of the smoke the other way the air that flowed about the boy was sweet and scented with the fragrance of pine and cedar all around him the bush rose in somber masses and a faint elfin sighing fell from the tops of the tall black trees it was the song of the wilderness and the wild and rugged land had steadily tightened its hold on him as he sat and listened he was certain at last that he would never leave it to go back to the cities     chapter xxxi  frank becomes a ranch owner   three or four days had passed since the attack on the ranch when one afternoon the boys stood on the deck of the sloop bright sunshine streamed down on the cove and there was a brisk breeze the boys had gone down to hoist the mainsail so that it would dry as it had been rolled up damp when last used and as frank straightened himself after stooping to coil up the gear he noticed that a man stood at the edge of the water with a small camera in his hand  look harry he exclaimed softly as his companion crawled from behind the sail  hello called harry what do you want  keep still commanded the stranger sharply then he raised his hand thats all right now you may move if you like  so may you harry answered with a chuckle in fact i guess you better had  there was an ominous growl somewhere above the man and then a savage barking as the dogwho had followed the boys to the cove and afterward wandered awaycame scrambling furiously down the steep path the man seemed to watch its approach with anxiety and when it came toward him growling he stooped and picked up a big stone  hold on harry shouted put down that stone he doesnt like strangers and youd better not rile him  the man did as he was bidden but when it looked as if the dog would drive him into the water frank dropped into the canoe to his astonishment the stranger suddenly held the camera in front of him and backed away a few paces pointing it like a pistol at the growling dog who seemed too surprised to follow then frank ran the canoe ashore and told the man to get in while he drove off the dog  hes young explained frank somehow we havent managed to tame him  he headed for the sloop and the man got on board  you seem stuck on taking photographs harry remarked  i make a little out of them now and then the stranger answered with a smile youre harry oliver  thats my name  then your friend is frank whitney  yes replied harry but you havent answered my question yet  i wanted to have a talk with your father but i find that hes out  he wont be back until tonight and while wed be glad to give you supper it really wouldnt be worth while to wait he doesnt want any fruit treesthe last we bought from outsiders had been dug up too long hes full up with implements and were not open to buy anything  the stranger laughed goodhumoredly  hadnt you better wait until youre asked im not drumming up orders then he changed the subject youve had trouble here lately havent you from what i gather your father has done a smart and courageous thing in holding off that opium gang  harry thawed and fell into the trap he was not addicted to saying much about his own exploits but he was proud of his father and the man discovered this from his hesitating answer it was the latters business to draw people out and sitting down in the shelter of the coaming he cleverly led the boy on to talk frank tried to warn his companion once or twice but failed and soon the stranger drew him also into the conversation some time had slipped away when the man finally rose  im sorry i missed your father he said but as i want to catch the steamer that calls at the settlement tonight i must be getting back  harry paddled him ashore and when he returned with the dog frank grinned at him  that fellow hasnt told you his business yet and ive a pretty strong suspicion that hes a newspaper man  harry started and frowned  then if he prints all that stuff ive told him its a sure thing that dad will be jumping mad didnt you know enough to call me off  you wouldnt stop frank answered laughing i kept on winking for the first five minutes and then somehow he gathered me in too hes smart at his business  i guess wed better not say anything about the thing decided harry thoughtfully anyway not until we know whether you are right  they went ashore soon afterward and a few days later mr webster called at the ranch  have you barclays address he asked mr oliver i want to write him  mr oliver gave it to him and mr webster continued  theyre getting up a supper at the settlement and the stewards would like to have you and the boys come theyre asking everybody between here and carthew  what do they want to get up a supper for  mr webster hesitated  well he said among other things the new man is opening his big fruit ranch and weve just heard that theres a steamboat wharf to be built and a new wagon trail made things are looking up and the boys feel that they ought to have a celebration  all right assented mr oliver the boys and i will be on hand  a few minutes later mr webster started home and then frank opened a letter he had brought him he was astonished when he read it  its from mr marston who got me the position with the milling companyhes a relative of ours he informed mr oliver it appears that he is in portland on businessshipping walla wheatand he says that he promised my mother hed look me up if he had time he may be here shortly  wed be glad to see him mr oliver answered cordially it isnt a very long way to portland  frank however had no further word from mr marston and in due time the evening of the supper arrived mr oliver and the boys sailed up to the settlement landing in the darkness they found the little hotel blazing with light the night was mild and a hum of voices and bursts of laughter drifted out from the open windows of the wooden building on entering the veranda they were greeted by the man who had kept the store when frank first visited the settlement  im glad to see that youre better mr oliver remarked  thanks replied the other ive just got down from seattlethe doctors have patched me up its time i was back at businessthings have been getting pretty mixed while i was away then he changed the subject the boys would make me chairman of this affair and theyre waiting youre only just on time  the wind fell light said mr oliver as there seems to be a good many of them they neednt have waited for my party if we hadnt come  oh laughed the storekeeper they couldnt begin withoutyou  mr oliver looked slightly astonished but there was another surprise in store for him and the boys when they entered the largest room in the building it was for once brilliantly lighted and crossed fir branches hung on the rudely matchboarded wall with the azure and silver and crimson of the flag gleaming here and there among them frank could understand the attempt to decorate the place because as a matter of fact it needed it but he did not see why the double row of men standing about the long table should break out into an applauding murmur as mr oliver walked in most of them had lean brown faces and toilhardened hands and were dressed in duck with a cloth jacket over it and with boots that reached to the knees but there were two or three in white shirts and neat cloth suits  boys said the storekeeper our guest has now arrived though he tells me the wind fell light hes here on time which is what weve always found him to be in all his doings he waved mr oliver to the head of the table thats your place its my duty to welcome you on behalf of the assembled company  there was an outbreak of applause and mr oliver looked around with a smile  thank you boys he beamed but i dont quite understand i just came here to talk to you and get my supper  amid the laughter that followed there were many voices answering him  youll get it sure tonight well do the talkingsproats been practicing speeches on the innocent trees all day and bentleys most as good as a gramophone were mighty glad to have you sit right down  the storekeeper raised his hand for silence  youre our guest mr oliver and thats all there is to it he turned to the others and lowered his voice confidentially i guess webster didnt explain the thing to him our friends backward on some occasionshe doesnt like a fussand its quite likely that if hed known what to expect he wouldnt have come  there was another burst of laughter and when mr oliver had taken his place with the boys seated near him frank noticed for the first time that mr barclay occupied a chair close by then he also saw that mr marston who had written to him sat almost opposite across the table  i got here this afternoon and was trying to hire a horse when i heard that you were expected at this feast the latter said your people were in firstrate health when i left them  it was difficult to carry on a conversation across the table and frank turned his attention to the meal which was the best he had sat down to since he reached the bush by and by the storekeeper stood up  now he said as most of you have laid in a solid foundation we can talk over the dessert and i want to remind you that we have several reasons for celebrating this occasion a start at growing fruit on a big scale has just been made were to have a wharf and theres a wagon trail to be bridged and graded all this brings you nearer the market you have held on and put up a good fight with rocks and trees and now when youll have no trouble in turning your produce into money youre going to reap the reward of it but thats not our main business tonight  there was an encouraging murmur and he went on  we had a few bad men round this settlementtoughs who had no use for work folks of their kind are like the fevertheyre infectiousand its a kind of curious thing that for a while the bad man generally comes out on top his trouble is that he cant stay there for something big and heavy is surely going to fall on him sooner or later still those men had a big combine at the back of them and they got hold theyd have kept it longer only that one man had a bigger head than most of us hell tell you that the one straight way to get money is to work for it and that the folks who begin by robbing the government end by robbing everybody else he found the combine up against him but while some of us backed down he stood fast he wouldnt be fooled or bullied and though he didnt go round saying so when the time came that big and wellhandled combine went down now its my pleasant duty to offer your thanks to mr oliver for freeing you from what would have been the ugliest kind of tyranny  he sat down amid applause and another man got up  im glad to second that he announced we were easy with the opium gang when they began it was pleasant to get a roll of bills now and then for just leaving a team handy and saying nothing if we found a case in the stable but we didnt see where that led he stopped and turned to mr barclay who was smiling at him whatd you say sir  it struck me that you were forgetting what my profession is mr barclay answered dryly youre not compelled to give yourself and your friends away  this remark was followed by laughter then the speaker proceeded  anyhow the dope boys began to change their tone at first they paid and asked favors but when they got folks so they couldnt go back on them they ordered and seldom paid at all it was getting what my friend calls tyranny and the small man had to stand in and ask the gang for leave to live wed have been in a mighty tight place now if one rancher hadnt boldly stood out thats why were offering our best thanks to mr oliver who got up and fought the gang  there was a shout that set the shingles rattling overhead and when it died away mr oliver who looked embarrassed said a few simple words which were followed by riotous applause then frank looking around saw that a sheet of newspaper with three pictures on it was pinned to the wall  whats that thing he asked leaning back to touch harry youre nearer it  one of the men took the paper down and handed it to him  well he drawled i guess you ought to know your own likeness  frank gasped as he took the paper for the two portraits at the top of it were of harry and himself and underneath them appeared the dog there was a conspicuous black heading over them  the modest salvors of the opium schooner and their dog it read  beneath this there was about a column dealing with mr olivers exploits and their own frank glanced at parts of it with blank astonishment  you never told him all that stuff he declared passing it to harry  mr oliver intercepted the paper and his expression hinted at halfdisgusted amusement  didnt you know any better than to tell a story of this kind to a newspaper man he asked read a little of it  harrys face flushed as he read  i didnt tell him half of it he protested besides i didnt know what he was  mr oliver laughed at last and just then another man got up and made a speech about mr barclay who rose and looked down the table with a quiet smile  i appreciate what you have said of my doings boys and now ill base my few observations on one of the first speakers remarks he began he stated that the man who began by robbing the government would end by robbing everybody else but he was wrong the man who robs the government is robbing every other citizen each of us is part of a system thats built up we believe on the rock of the constitution otherwise if you were merely individuals doing just as you wished obeying nobody you could live only like the indians holding your ranches and cattleif you had themwith the rifle all commerce and security is founded on the fact that were not separate men but a nation well the nation wants troops and warships judges courts schools and roads it expects you to pay your share since you get the benefit and every man who beats it out of one tax or duty is playing a mean game on and stealing from the rest thats the one point i want to make clear  then to the confusion of harry and frank they were commended and afterward the company broke up into groups to talk and smoke mr oliver and the boys mr marston mr webster and mr barclay still sat together and presently mr barclay turned to the boys  ive some news for you he announced the schooner has been surveyed shes very little damaged and the authorities who have seized her have decided to allow your claim in full as soon as shes sold theyll forward you a treasury order  and well really get all that money frank asked with a gasp  it seems pretty certain  the blood rushed into franks face  it would go a long way toward buying a small halfcleared ranch he exclaimed joyfully  ive one to sell laughed mr webster you can have it cheap  are you serious mr oliver inquired  sure was the answer i never was much good at ranching and the place is too small to feed more than a few head of stock it might pay growing fruit but if i did any planting now id have to wait three or four years before i got any returns worth while and i was always kind of smart at carpentering i could get contracts for building log bridges and cutting wharf piles now and id let the ranch go at a very moderate price  how much do you want  when mr webster told him mr oliver considered the matter for a few moments  ill have to start harry in another three or four years and if we put in a lot of young trees theyd be in good bearing by that time he said thoughtfully we could work the place from our own ranch in the meanwhile but im afraid i cant raise the price you ask would you let part stand over on a mortgage  i cant do that was the reply though id like to oblige you you see if im to handle those contracts properly i must have the money to buy tools and to pay wages but suppose we appoint two valuers to fix a figure  the boys had been listening intently and frank broke in  harry and i have decided to go partners in a ranch some day and theres the salvage money  it wouldnt be enough said mr oliver regretfully  mr marston touched mr olivers shoulder  id like a few words with you privately  they crossed the room and after talking for a while in low tones mr marston beckoned frank who had been waiting in tense excitement mr marston was a middleaged business man with keen eyes and a thoughtful face and he looked at frank steadily  sit down and listen to me he said because im a relative of yours and also because i had a great respect for your father i meant from the beginning to help you along on the other hand ive seen young men spoiled by knowing that they had friends ready to give them a lift and i decided to let you make the best fight you could for a year or two thats why i sent you to the flour mill instead of putting you into something easier and i may say that i wasnt altogether pleased when you left it  i was turned out sir frank corrected him with some color in his face  mr marston smiled  well let it go at that the main thing is that you didnt come back for help instead you made another start for yourself and you seem to have done well here according to a newspaper which ive read you have even distinguished yourself lately he laughed before he proceeded anyway you have shown that one could have some confidence in you  thank you sir  mr marston raised his hand  let me finish before i left boston i went over your mothers business affairs and by and by i think she could give youwell say a thousand dollars you have your share of the salvage payment and mr oliver is willing to lay out some money on his sons account well ill find the balanceon a mortgagebut youll have to make the ranch pay orand he smiledill certainly foreclose and turn you out  frank tried to thank him but he could find very little to say in his excitement then mr marston called harry  i understand that you are anxious to take mr websters ranch with frank and would be willing to work it under your fathers direction until the youngest of you is twentyone is that correct  harrys face was glowing  yes sir he answered eagerly well do what we can  then if your father and mr webster will go down to seattle with me well get the transfer made and a deed drawn up to fix the thing  frank could never remember what he said or did during the next few minutes but it was the proudest and happiest time he had spent in his life then he turned to mr marston and mr oliver who were standing near  ill have very little time to spare after this he said and i should like to spend a little of the salvage money going back to boston to see my mother and the others before i begin  of course ejaculated mr marston a very proper thing you neednt wait until mr barclay sends you his order ill arrange your ticket  he moved away and shortly afterward the company dispersed  a week later frank and harry and jake sailed out in the sloop to intercept the southbound steamer she came up with sidewheels churning a broad track of foam and her smoke trail streaming astern when her engines stopped frank and harry dropped into the canoe and in a few minutes they were alongside frank swung himself up on board and then looked back at the canoe  have a good time cried harry the best you can youll have to work when you come back  youll see me in six weeks frank answered with a wave of his hand and the canoe dropped astern as the engines started and the steamer forged ahead   the end
