63638013	the papers and writings of abraham lincoln  volume seven  constitutional edition  by abraham lincoln   edited by arthur brooks lapsley      the writings of a lincoln volume seven 18631865     1863   opinion on the loss of general r h milroys division  october 27 1863  in june last a division was substantially lost at or near winchester va at the time it was under general milroy as immediate commander in the field general schenck as department commander at baltimore and general halleck as generalinchief at washington  general milroy as immediate commander was put in arrest and subsequently a court of inquiry examined chiefly with reference to disobedience of orders and reported the evidence  the foregoing is a synoptical statement of the evidence together with the judgeadvocategenerals conclusions the disaster when it came was a surprise to all it was very well known to generals shenck and milroy for some time before that general halleck thought the division was in great danger of a surprise at winchester that it was of no service commensurate with the risk it incurred and that it ought to be withdrawn but although he more than once advised its withdrawal he never positively ordered it general schenck on the contrary believed the service of the force at winchester was worth the hazard and so did not positively order its withdrawal until it was so late that the enemy cut the wire and prevented the order reaching general milroy  general milroy seems to have concurred with general schenck in the opinion that the force should be kept at winchester at least until the approach of danger but he disobeyed no order upon the subject  some question can be made whether some of general hallecks dispatches to general schenk should not have been construed to be orders to withdraw the force and obeyed accordingly but no such question can be made against general milroy in fact the last order he received was to be prepared to withdraw but not to actually withdraw until further order which further order never reached him  serious blame is not necessarily due to any serious disaster and i cannot say that in this case any of the officers are deserving of serious blame no courtmartial is deemed necessary or proper in the case   a lincoln     to general schofield  private and confidential  executive mansion washington october 28 1863  general john m schofield  there have recently reached the war department and thence been laid before me from missouri three communications all similar in import and identical in object one of them addressed to nobody and without place or date but having the signature of apparently the writer is a letter of eight closely written foolscap pages the other two are written by a different person at st joseph mo and of the dates respectively october 12 and 13 1863 and each inclosing a large number of affidavits the general statements of the whole are that the federal and state authorities are arming the disloyal and disarming the loyal and that the latter will all be killed or driven out of the state unless there shall be a change in particular no loyal man who has been disarmed is named but the affidavits show by name fortytwo persons as disloyal who have been armed they are as follows the names are omitted  a majority of these are shown to have been in the rebel service i believe it could be shown that the government here has deliberately armed more than ten times as many captured at gettysburg to say nothing of similar operations in east tennessee these papers contain altogether thirtyone manuscript pages and one newspaper in extenso and yet i do not find it anywhere charged in them that any loyal man has been harmed by reason of being disarmed or that any disloyal one has harmed anybody by reason of being armed by the federal or state government of course i have not had time to carefully examine all but i have had most of them examined and briefed by others and the result is as stated the remarkable fact that the actual evil is yet only anticipatedinferredinduces me to suppose i understand the case but i do not state my impression because i might be mistaken and because your duty and mine is plain in any event the locality of nearly all this seems to be st joseph and buchanan county i wish you to give special attention to this region particularly on election day prevent violence from whatever quarter and see that the soldiers themselves do no wrong  yours truly   a lincoln     telegram to governor johnson  cipher  executive mansion washington d c october

of the clerk of the house of representatives in preparing for the organization of the house  be it enacted by the senate and house of representatives of the united states of america in congress assembled that before the first meeting of the next congress and of every subsequent congress the clerk of the next preceding house of representatives shall make a roll of the representatives elect and place thereon the names of all persons and of such persons only whose credentials show that they were regularly elected in accordance with the laws of their states respectively or the laws of the united states  approved march 3 1863     to j w grimes  executive mansion  washington dc october 29 1863  hon james w grimes  my dear sirthe above act of congress was passed as i suppose for the purpose of shutting out improper applicants for seats in the house of representatives and i fear there is some danger that it will be used to shut out proper ones iowa having an entire union delegation will be one of the states the attempt will be made if upon any the governor doubtless has made out the certificates and they are already in the hands of the members i suggest that they come on with them but that for greater caution you and perhaps mr harlan with you consult with the governor and have an additional set made out according to the form on the other half of this sheet and still another set if you can by studying the law think of a form that in your judgment promises additional security and quietly bring the whole on with you to be used in case of necessity let what you do be kept still  yours truly   a lincoln     telegram to p f lowe  cipher  executive mansion washington d c october 30 1863  hon f f lowe san francisco cal  below is an act of congress passed last session intended to exclude applicants not entitled to seats but which there is reason to fear will be used to exclude some who are entitled please get with the governor and one or two other discreet friends study the act carefully and make certificates in two or three forms according to your best judgement and have them sent to me so as to multiply the chances of the delegation getting their seats let it be done without publicity below is a form which may answer for one if you could procure the same to be done for the oregon member it might be well   a lincoln      telegram to general meade  executive mansion washington d c october 30 1863  majorgeneral meade army of potomac  much obliged for the information about deserters contained in your dispatch of yesterday while i have to beg your pardon for troubling you in regard to some of them when as it appears by yours i had the means of answering my own questions   a lincoln     memorandum  executive mansion washington october 31 1863  the provostmarshalgeneral has issued no proclamation at all he has in no form announced anything recently in regard to troops in new york except in his letter to governor seymour of october 21 which has been published in the newspapers of that state it has not been announced or decided in any form by the provostmarshalgeneral or any one else in authority of the government that every citizen who has paid his three hundred dollars commutation is liable to be immediately drafted again or that towns that have just raised the money to pay their quotas will have again to be subject to similar taxation or suffer the operations of the new conscription nor it is probable that the like of them ever will be announced or decided     telegram to w h seward  war department washington d c

discredit on any   a lincoln     to postmastergeneral blair  executive mansion  washington november 2 1863  hon montgomery blair  my dear sirsome days ago i understood you to say that your brother general frank blair desires to be guided by my wishes as to whether he will occupy his seat in congress or remain in the field my wish then is compounded of what i believe will be best for the country and it is that he will come here put his military commission in my hands take his seat go into caucus with our friends abide the nominations help elect the nominees and thus aid to organize a house of representatives which will really support the government in the war if the result shall be the election of himself as speaker let him serve in that position if not let him retake his commission and return to the army for the benefit of the country  this will heal a dangerous schism for him it will relieve him from a dangerous position or a misunderstanding as i think he is in danger of being permanently separated from those with whom only he can ever have a real sympathythe sincere opponents of slavery  it will be a mistake if he shall allow the provocations offered him by insincere timeservers to drive him from the house of his own building he is young yet he has abundant talentsquite enough to occupy all his time without devoting any to temper  he is rising in military skill and usefulness his recent appointment to the command of a corps by one so competent to judge as general sherman proves this in that line he can serve both the country and himself more profitably than he could as a member of congress upon the floor  the foregoing is what i would say if frank blair was my brother instead of yours  yours truly   a lincoln     to governor bradford  executive mansion washington november 2 1863  his excellency a w bradford governor of maryland  siryours of the 31st ult was received yesterday about noon and since then i have been giving most earnest attention to the subjectmatter of it at my call general schenck has attended and he assures me it is almost certain that violence will be used at some of the voting places on election day unless prevented by his provostguards he says that at some of those places union voters will not attend at all or run a ticket unless they have some assurance of protection this makes the missouri case of my action in regard to which you express your approval  the remaining point of your letter is a protest against any person offering to vote being put to any test not found in the laws of maryland this brings us to a difference between missouri and maryland with the same reason in both states missouri has by law provided a test for the voter with reference to the present rebellion while maryland has not for example general trimble captured fighting us at gettysburg is without recanting his treason a legal voter by the laws of maryland even general schencks order admits him to vote if he recants upon oath i think that is cheap enough my order in missouri which you approve and general schericks order here reach precisely the same end bach assures the right of voting to all loyal men and whether a man is loyal each allows that man to fix by his own oath your suggestion that nearly all the candidates are loyal i do not think quite meets the case in this struggle for the nations life i cannot so confidently rely on those whose elections may have depended upon disloyal votes such men when elected may prove true but such votes are given them in the expectation that they will prove false  nor do i think that to keep the peace at the polls and to prevent the persistently disloyal from voting constitutes just cause of offense to maryland i think she has her own example for it if i mistake not it is precisely what general dix did when your excellency was elected governor  i revoke the first of the three propositions in general scheneks general order no 53 not that it is wrong in principle but because the military being of necessity exclusive judges as to who shall be arrested the provision is too liable to abuse for the revoked part i substitute the following  that all provostmarshals and other military officers do prevent all disturbance and violence at or about the polls whether offered by such persons as above described or by any other person or persons whomsoever  the other two propositions of the order i allow to stand general schenek is fully determined and has my strict orders besides that all loyal men may vote and vote for whom they please  your obedient servant   a

my note to you i certainly did not expect to see in print yet i have not been much shocked by the newspaper comments upon it  those comments constitute a fair specimen of what has occurred to me

dispatch here from saint louis which is a little difficult for me to understand it says general schofield has refused leave of absence to members in military service to attend the legislature all such are radical and administration men the election of two senators from this place on thursday will probably turn upon this thing what does this mean of course members of the legislation must be allowed to attend its sessions but how is there a session before the recent election returns are in and how is it to be at this placeand that is saint louis please inform me   a lincoln     telegram to

time for starting is not yet fixed but when it shall be i will notify you  yours truly   a lincoln     address at gettysburg  november 19 1863  four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on this continent a new nation conceived in liberty and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal  now we are engaged in a great civil war testing whether that nation or any nation so conceived and so dedicated can long endure we are met on a great battlefield of that war we have come to dedicate a portion of that field as a final resting place for those who here gave their lives that that nation might live it is altogether fitting and proper that we should do this  but in a larger sense we can not dedicatewe can not consecratewe can not hallowthis ground the brave men living and dead who struggled here have consecrated it far above our poor power to add or detract the world will little note nor long remember what we say here but it can never forget what they did here it is for us the living rather to be dedicated here to the unfinished work which they who fought here have thus far so nobly advanced it is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task remaining before usthat from these honored dead we take increased devotion to that cause for which they gave the last full measure of devotion that we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vainthat this nation under god shall have a new birth of freedomand that government of the people by the people for the people shall not perish from the earth     telegram to general

union success in east tennessee  executive mansion washington d c december 7 1863  reliable information being received that the insurgent force is retreating from east tennessee under circumstances rendering it probable that the union forces cannot hereafter be dislodged from that important position and esteeming this to be of high national consequence i recommend that all loyal people do on receipt of this information assemble at their places of worship and render special homage and gratitude to almighty god for this great advancement of the national cause   a lincoln     proclamation of amnesty and reconstruction december 8 1863  by the president of the united states of america  a proclamation  whereas in and by the constitution of the united states it is provided that the president shall have power to grant reprieves and pardons for offenses against the united states except in cases of impeachment and  whereas a rebellion now exists whereby the loyal state governments of several states have for a long time been subverted and many persons have committed and are now guilty of treason against the united states and  whereas with reference to said rebellion and treason laws have been enacted by congress declaring forfeitures and confiscation of property and liberation of slaves all upon terms and conditions therein stated and also declaring that the president was thereby authorized at any time thereafter by proclamation to extend to persons who may have participated in the existing rebellion in any state or part thereof pardon and amnesty with such exceptions and at such times and on such conditions as he may deem expedient for the public welfare and  whereas the congressional declaration for limited and conditional pardon accords with wellestablished judicial exposition of the pardoning power and  whereas with reference to said rebellion the president of the united states has issued several proclamations with provisions in regard to the liberation of slaves and  whereas it is now desired by some persons heretofore engaged in said rebellion to resume their allegiance to the united states and to reinaugurate loyal state governments within and for their respective states  therefore i abraham lincoln president of the united states do proclaim declare and make known to all persons who have directly or by implication participated in the existing rebellion except as hereinafter excepted that a full pardon is hereby granted to them and each of them with restoration of all rights of property except as to slaves and in property cases where rights of third parties shall have intervened and upon the condition that every such person shall take and subscribe an oath and thenceforward keep and maintain said oath inviolate and which oath shall be registered for permanent preservation and shall be of the tenor and effect following to wit  i  do solemnly swear in presence of almighty god that i will henceforth faithfully support protect and defend the constitution of the united states and the union of the states thereunder and that i will in like manner abide by and faithfully support all acts of congress passed during the existing rebellion with reference to slaves so long and so far as not repealed modified or held void by congress or by decision of the supreme court and that i will in like manner abide by and faithfully support all proclamations of the president made during the existing rebellion having reference to slaves so long and so far as not modified or declared void by decision of the supreme court so help me god  the persons excepted from the benefits of the foregoing provisions are all who are or shall have been civil or diplomatic officers or agents of the socalled confederate government all who have left judicial stations under the united states to aid the rebellion all who are or shall have been military or naval officers of said socalled confederate government above the rank of colonel in the army or of lieutenant in the navy all who left seats in the united states congress to aid the rebellion all who resigned commissions in the army or navy of the united states and afterwards aided the rebellion and all who have engaged in any way in treating colored persons or white persons in charge of such otherwise than lawfully as prisoners of war and which persons may have been found in the united states service as soldiers seamen or in any other capacity  and i do further proclaim declare and make known that whenever in any of the states of arkansas texas louisiana mississippi tennessee alabama georgia florida south carolina and north carolina a number of persons not less than onetenth in number of the votes cast in such state at the presidential election of the year ad 1860 each having taken oath aforesaid and not having since violated it and being a qualified voter by the election law of the state existing immediately before the socalled act of secession and excluding all others shall reestablish a state government which shall be republican and in nowise contravening said oath such shall be recognized as the true government of the state and the state shall receive thereunder the benefits of the constitutional provision which declares that the united states shall guarantee to every state in this union a republican form of government and shall protect each of them against invasion and on application of the legislature or the executive when the legislature can not be convened against domestic violence  and i do further proclaim declare and make known that any provision which may be adopted by such state government in relation to the freed people of such state which shall recognize and declare their permanent freedom provide for their education and which may yet be consistent as a temporary arrangement with their present condition as a laboring landless and homeless class will not be objected to by the national executive  and it is suggested as not improper that in constructing a loyal state government in any state the name of the state the boundary the subdivisions the constitution and the general code of laws as before the rebellion be maintained subject only to the modifications made necessary by the conditions hereinbefore stated and such others if any not contravening said co and which may be deemed expedient by those framing the new state government  to avoid misunderstanding it may be proper to say that this proclamation so far as it relates to state governments has no reference to states wherein loyal state governments have all the while been maintained and for the same reason it may be proper to further say that whether members sent to congress from any state shall be admitted to seats constitutionally rests exclusively with the respective houses and not to any extent with the executive and still further that this proclamation is intended to present the people of the states wherein the national authority has been suspended and loyal state governments have been subverted a mode in and by which the national authority and loyal state governments may be reestablished within said states or in any of them and while the mode presented is the best the executive can suggest with his present impressions it must not be understood that no other possible mode would be acceptable  given under my hand at the city of washington the 8th day of december a d 1863 and of the independence of the united states of america the eightyeighth   a lincoln  by the president  william h seward secretary of state     annual message to congress december 8 1863   fellowcitizens of the senate and house of representatives  another year of health and of sufficiently abundant harvests has passed for these and especially for the improved condition cf our national affairs our renewed and profoundest gratitude to god is due  we remain in peace and friendship with foreign powers  the efforts of disloyal citizens of the united states to involve us in foreign wars to aid an inexcusable insurrection have been unavailing her britannic majestys government as was justly expected have exercised their authority to prevent the departure of new hostile expeditions from british ports the emperor of france has by a like proceeding promptly vindicated the neutrality which he proclaimed at the beginning of the contest questions of great intricacy and importance have arisen out of the blockade and other belligerent operations between the government and several of the maritime powers but they have been discussed and as far as was possible accommodated in a spirit of frankness justice and mutual goodwill it is especially gratifying that our prize courts by the impartiality of their adjudications have commanded the respect and confidence of maritime powers  the supplemental treaty between the united states and great britain for the suppression of the african slavetrade made on the 17th day of february last has been duly ratified and carried into execution it is believed that so far as american ports and american citizens are concerned that inhuman and odious traffic has been brought to an end  i shall submit for the consideration of the senate a convention for the adjustment of possessory claims in washington territory arising out of the treaty of the 15th of june 1846 between the united states and great britain and which have been the source of some disquiet among the citizens of that now rapidly improving part of the country  a novel and important question involving the extent of the maritime jurisdiction of spain in the waters which surround the island of cuba has been debated without reaching an agreement and it is proposed in an amicable spirit to refer it to the arbitrament of a friendly power a convention for that purpose will be submitted to the senate  i have thought it proper subject to the approval of the senate to concur with the interested commercial powers in an arrangement for the liquidation of the scheldt dues upon the principles which have been heretofore adopted in regard to the imposts upon navigation in the waters of denmark  the longpending controversy between this government and that of chile touching the seizure at sitana in peru by chilean officers of a large amount in treasure belonging to citizens of the united states has been brought to a close by the award of his majesty the king of the belgians to whose arbitration the question was referred by the parties the subject was thoroughly and patiently examined by that justly respected magistrate and although the sum awarded to the claimants may not have been as large as they expected there is no reason to distrust the wisdom of his majestys decision that decision was promptly complied with by chile when intelligence in regard to it reached that country  the joint commission under the act of the last session of carrying into effect the convention with peru on the subject of claims has been organized at lima and is engaged in the business intrusted to it  difficulties concerning interoceanic transit through nicaragua are in course of amicable adjustment  in conformity with principles set forth in my last annual message i have received a representative from the united states of colombia and have accredited a minister to that republic  incidents occurring in the progress of our civil war have forced upon my attention the uncertain state of international questions touching the rights of foreigners in this country and of united states citizens abroad in regard to some governments these rights are at least partially defined by treaties in no instance however is it expressly stipulated that in the event of civil war a foreigner residing in this country within the lines of the insurgents is to be exempted from the rule which classes him as a belligerent in whose behalf the government of his country can not expect any privileges or immunities distinct from that character i regret to say however that such claims have been put forward and in some instances in behalf of foreigners who have lived in the united states the greater part of their lives  there is reason to believe that many persons born in foreign countries who have declared their intention to become citizens or who have been fully naturalized have evaded the military duty required of them by denying the fact and thereby throwing upon the government the burden of proof it has been found difficult or impracticable to obtain this proof from the want of guides to the proper sources of information these might be supplied by requiring clerks of courts where declarations of intention may be made or naturalizations effected to send periodically lists of the names of the persons naturalized or declaring their intention to become citizens to the secretary of the interior in whose department those names might be arranged and printed for general information  there is also reason to believe that foreigners frequently become citizens of the united states for the sole purpose of evading duties imposed by the laws of their native countries to which on becoming naturalized here they at once repair and though never returning to the united states they still claim the interposition of this government as citizens many altercations and great prejudices have heretofore arisen out of this abuse it is therefore submitted to your serious consideration it might be advisable to fix a limit beyond which no citizen of the united states residing abroad may claim the interposition of his government  the right of suffrage has often been assumed and exercised by aliens under pretenses of naturalization which they have disavowed when drafted into the military service i submit the expediency of such an amendment of the law as will make the fact of voting an estoppe against any plea of exemption from military service or other civil obligation on the ground of alienage  in common with other western powers our relations with japan have been brought into serious jeopardy through the perverse opposition of the hereditary aristocracy of the empire to the enlightened and liberal policy of the tycoon designed to bring the country into the society of nations it is hoped although not with entire confidence that these difficulties may be peacefully overcome i ask your attention to the claim of the minister residing there for the damages he sustained in the destruction by fire of the residence of the legation at yedo  satisfactory arrangements have been made with the emperor of russia which it is believed will result in effecting a continuous line of telegraph through that empire from our pacific coast  i recommend to your favorable consideration the subject of an international telegraph across the atlantic ocean and also of a telegraph between this capital and the national forts along the atlantic seaboard and the gulf of mexico such communications established with any reasonable outlay would be economical as well as effective aids to the diplomatic military and naval service  the consular system of the united states under the enactments of the last congress begins to be selfsustaining and there is reason to hope that it may become entirely so with the increase of trade which will ensue whenever peace is restored our ministers abroad have been faithful in defending american rights in protecting commercial interests our consuls have necessarily had to encounter increased labors and responsibilities growing out of the war these they have for the most part met and discharged with zeal and efficiency this acknowledgment justly includes those consuls who residing in morocco egypt turkey japan china and other oriental countries are charged with complex functions and extraordinary powers  the condition of the several organized territories is generally satisfactory although indian disturbances in new mexico have not been entirely suppressed the mineral resources of colorado nevada idaho new mexico and arizona are proving far richer than has been heretofore understood i lay before you a communication on this subject from the governor of new mexico i again submit to your consideration the expediency of establishing a system for the encouragement of immigration although this source of national wealth and strength is again flowing with greater freedom than for several years before the insurrection occurred there is still a great deficiency of laborers in every field of industry especially in agriculture and in our mines as well of iron and coal as of the precious metals while the demand for labor is much increased here tens of thousands of persons destitute of remunerative occupation are thronging our foreign consulates and offering to emigrate to the united states if essential but very cheap assistance can be afforded them it is easy to see that under the sharp discipline of civil war the nation is beginning a new life this noble effort demands the aid and ought to receive the attention and support of the government  injuries unforeseen by the government and unintended may in some cases have been inflicted on the subjects or citizens of foreign countries both at sea and on land by persons in the service of the united states as this government expects redress from other powers when similar injuries are inflicted by persons in their service upon citizens of the united states we must be prepared to do justice to foreigners if the existing judicial tribunals are inadequate to this purpose a special court may be authorized with power to hear and decide such claims of the character referred to as may have arisen under treaties and the public law conventions for adjusting the claims by joint commission have been proposed to some governments but no definitive answer to the proposition has yet been received from any  in the course of the session i shall probably have occasion to request you to provide indemnification to claimants where decrees of restitution have been rendered and damages awarded by admiralty courts and in other cases where this government may be acknowledged to be liable in principle and where the amount of that liability has been ascertained by an informal arbitration  the proper officers of the treasury have deemed themselves required by the law of the united states upon the subject to demand a tax upon the incomes of foreign consuls in this country while such a demand may not in strictness be in derogation of public law or perhaps of any existing treaty between the united states and a foreign country the expediency of so far modifying the act as to exempt from tax the income of such consuls as are not citizens of the united states derived from the emoluments of their office or from property not situated in the united states is submitted to your serious consideration i make this suggestion upon the ground that a comity which ought to be reciprocated exempts our consuls in all other countries from taxation to the extent thus indicated the united states i think ought not to be exceptionally illiberal to international trade and commerce  the operations of the treasury during the last year have been successfully conducted the enactment by congress of a national banking law has proved a valuable support of the public credit and the general legislation in relation to loans has fully answered the expectations of its favorers some amendments may be required to perfect existing laws but no change in their principles or general scope is believed to be needed  since these measures have been in operation all demands on the treasury including the pay of the army and navy have been promptly met and fully satisfied no considerable body of troops it is believed were ever more amply provided and more liberally and punctually paid and it may be added that by no people were the burdens incident to a great war ever more cheerfully borne  the receipts during the year from all sources including loans and balance in the treasury at its commencement were 90112567486 and the aggregate disbursements 89579663065 leaving a balance on the 1st of july 1863 of 532904421 of the receipts there were derived from customs 6905964240 from internal revenue 3764078795 from direct tax 148510361 from lands 16761717 from miscellaneous sources 304661535 and from loans 77668236157 making the aggregate 90112567486 of the disbursements there were for the civil service 2325392208 for pensions and indians 421652079 for interest on public debt 2472984651 for the war department 59929860083 for the navy department 6321110527 for payment of funded and temporary debt 18108663507 making the aggregate 89579663065 and leaving the balance of 532904421 but the payment of funded and temporary debt having been made from moneys borrowed during the year must be regarded as merely nominal payments and the moneys borrowed to make them as merely nominal receipts and their amount 18108663507 should therefore be deducted both from receipts and disbursements this being done there remains as actual receipts 72003903979 and the actual disbursements 71470999558 leaving the balance as already stated  the actual receipts and disbursements for the first quarter and the estimated receipts and disbursements for the remaining threequarters of the current fiscal year 1864 will be shown in detail by the report of the secretary of the treasury to which i invite your attention it is sufficient to say here that it is not believed that actual results will exhibit a state of the finances less favorable to the country than the estimates of that officer heretofore submitted while it is confidently expected that at the close of the year both disbursements and debt will be found very considerably less than has been anticipated  the report of the secretary of war is a document of great interest it consists of  1 the military operations of the year detailed in the report of the general in chief  2 the organization of colored persons into the war service  3 the exchange of prisoners fully set forth in the letter of general hitchcock  4 the operations under the act for enrolling and calling out the national forces detailed in the report of the provost marshal general  5 the organization of the invalid corps and  6 the operation of the several departments of the quartermastergeneral commissarygeneral paymastergeneral chief of engineers chief of ordnance and surgeongeneral  it has appeared impossible to make a valuable summary of this report except such as would be too extended for this place and hence i content myself by asking your careful attention to the report itself  the duties devolving on the naval branch of the service during the year and throughout the whole of this unhappy contest have been discharged with fidelity and eminent success the extensive blockade has been constantly increasing in efficiency as the navy has expanded yet on so long a line it has so far been impossible to entirely suppress illicit trade from returns received at the navy department it appears that more than 1000 vessels have been captured since the blockade was instituted and that the value of prizes already sent in for adjudication amounts to over 13000000  the naval force of the united states consists at this time of five hundred and eightyeight vessels completed and in the course of completion and of these seventyfive are ironclad or armored steamers the events of the war give an increased interest and importance to the navy which will probably extend beyond the war itself  the armored vessels in our navy completed and in service or which are under contract and approaching completion are believed to exceed in number those of any other power but while these may be relied upon for harbor defense and coast service others of greater strength and capacity will be necessary for cruising purposes and to maintain our rightful position on the ocean  the change that has taken place in naval vessels and naval warfare since the introduction of steam as a motive power for ships of war demands either a corresponding change in some of our existing navy yards or the establishment of new ones for the construction and necessary repair of modern naval vessels no inconsiderable embarrassment delay and public injury have been experienced from the want of such governmental establishments the necessity of such a navyyard so furnished at some suitable place upon the atlantic seaboard has on repeated occasions been brought to the attention of congress by the navy department and is again presented in the report of the secretary which accompanies this communication i think it my duty to invite your special attention to this subject and also to that of establishing a yard and depot for naval purposes upon one of the western rivers a naval force has been created on those interior waters and under many disadvantages within little more than two years exceeding in numbers the whole naval force of the country at the commencement of the present administration satisfactory and important as have been the performances of the heroic men of the navy at this interesting period they are scarcely more wonderful than the success of our mechanics and artisans in the production of war vessels which has created a new form of naval power  our country has advantages superior to any other nation in our resources of iron and timber with inexhaustible quantities of fuel in the immediate vicinity of both and all available and in close proximity to navigable waters without the advantage of public works the resources of the nation have been developed and its power displayed in the construction of a navy of such magnitude which has at the very period of its creation rendered signal service to the union  the increase of the number of seamen in the public service from 7500 men in the spring of 1861 to about 34000 at the present time has been accomplished without special legislation or extraordinary bounties to promote that increase it has been found however that the operation of the draft with the high bounties paid for army recruits is beginning to affect injuriously the naval service and will if not corrected be likely to impair its efficiency by detaching seamen from their proper vocation and inducing them to enter the army i therefore respectfully suggest that congress might aid both the army and naval services by a definite provision on this subject which would at the same time be equitable to the communities more especially interested  i commend to your consideration the suggestions of the secretary of the navy in regard to the policy of fostering and training seamen and also the education of officers and engineers for the naval service the naval academy is rendering signal service in preparing midshipmen for the highly responsible duties which in after life they will be required to perform in order that the country should not be deprived of the proper quota of educated officers for which legal provision has been made at the naval school the vacancies caused by the neglect or omission to make nominations from the states in insurrection have been filled by the secretary of the navy the school is now more full and complete than at any former period and in every respect entitled to the favorable consideration of congress  during the past fiscal year the financial condition of the postoffice department has been one of increasing prosperity and i am gratified in being able to state that the actual postal revenue has nearly equaled the entire expenditures the latter amounting to 1131420684 and the former to 1116378959 leaving a deficiency of but 15041725 in 1860 the year immediately preceding the rebellion the deficiency amounted to 565670549 the postal receipts of that year being 264572219 less that those of 1863 the decrease since 1860 in the annual amount of transportation has been only about twentyfive per cent but the annual expenditure on account of the same has been reduced thirtyfive per cent it is manifest therefore that the postoffice department may become selfsustaining in a few years even with the restoration of the whole service  the international conference of postal delegates from the principal countries of europe and america which was called at the suggestion of the postmastergeneral met at paris on the 11th of may last and concluded its deliberations on the 8th of june the principles established by the conference as best adapted to facilitate postal intercourse between nations and as the basis of future postal conventions inaugurate a general system of uniform international charges at reduced rates of postage and can not fail to produce beneficial results  i refer you to the report of the secretary of the interior which is herewith laid before you for useful and varied information in relation to the public lands indian affairs patents pensions and other matters of public concern pertaining to his department  the quantity of land disposed of during the last and the first quarter of the present fiscal years was 3841549 acres of which 161911 acres were sold for cash 1456514 acres were taken up under the homestead law and the residue disposed of under laws granting lands for military bounties for railroad and other purposes it also appears that the sale of the public lands is largely on the increase  it has long been a cherished opinion of some of our wisest statesmen that the people of the united states had a higher and more enduring interest in the early settlement and substantial cultivation of the public lands than in the amount of direct revenue to be derived from the sale of them this opinion has had a controlling influence in shaping legislation upon the subject of our national domain i may cite as evidence of this the liberal measures adopted in reference to actual settlers the grant to the states of the overflowed lands within their limits in order to their being reclaimed and rendered fit for cultivation the grants to railway companies of alternate sections of land upon the contemplated lines of their roads which when completed will so largely multiply the facilities for reaching our distant possessions this policy has received its most signal and beneficent illustration in the recent enactment granting homesteads to actual settlers since the 1st day of january last the beforementioned quantity of 1456514 acres of land have been taken up under its provisions this fact and the amount of sales furnish gratifying evidence of increasing settlement upon the public lands notwithstanding the great struggle in which the energies of the nation have been engaged and which has required so large a withdrawal of our citizens from their accustomed pursuits i cordially concur in the recommendation of the secretary of the interior suggesting a modification of the act in favor of those engaged in the military and naval service of the united states i doubt not that congress will cheerfully adopt such measures as will without essentially changing the general features of the system secure to the greatest practicable extent its benefits to those who have left their homes in the defense of the country in this arduous crisis  i invite your attention to the views of the secretary as to the propriety of raising by appropriate legislation a revenue from the mineral lands of the united states  the measures provided at your last session for the removal of certain indian tribes have been carried into effect sundry treaties have been negotiated which will in due time be submitted for the constitutional action of the senate they contain stipulations for extinguishing the possessory rights of the indians to large and valuable tracts of lands it is hoped that the effect of these treaties will result in the establishment of permanent friendly relations with such of these tribes as have been brought into frequent and bloody collision with our outlying settlements and emigrants sound policy and our imperative duty to these wards of the government demand our anxious and constant attention to their material wellbeing to their progress in the arts of civilization and above all to that moral training which under the blessing of divine providence will confer upon them the elevated and sanctifying influences the hopes and consolations of the christian faith  i suggested in my last annual message the propriety of remodeling our indian system subsequent events have satisfied me of its necessity the details set forth in the report of the secretary evince the urgent need for immediate legislative action  i commend the benevolent institutions established or patronized by the government in this district to your generous and fostering care  the attention of congress during the last session was engaged to some extent with a proposition for enlarging the water communication between the mississippi river and the northeastern seaboard which proposition however failed for the time since then upon a call of the greatest respectability a convention has been held at chicago upon the same subject a summary of whose views is contained in a memorial addressed to the president and congress and which i now have the honor to lay before you that this interest is one which ere long will force its own way i do not entertain a doubt while it is submitted entirely to your wisdom as to what can be done now augmented interest is given to this subject by the actual commencement of work upon the pacific railroad under auspices so favorable to rapid progress and completion the enlarged navigation becomes a palpable need to the great road  i transmit the second annual report of the commissioner of the department of agriculture asking your attention to the developments in that vital interest of the nation  when congress assembled a year ago the war had already lasted nearly twenty months and there had been many conflicts on both land and sea with varying results the rebellion had been pressed back into reduced limits yet the tone of public feeling and opinion at home and abroad was not satisfactory with other signs the popular elections then just past indicated uneasiness among ourselves while amid much that was cold and menacing the kindest words coming from europe were uttered in accents of pity that we are too blind to surrender a hopeless cause our commerce was suffering greatly by a few armed vessels built upon and furnished from foreign shores and we were threatened with such additions from the same quarter as would sweep our trade from the sea and raise our blockade we had failed to elicit from european governments anything hopeful upon this subject the preliminary emancipation proclamation issued in september was running its assigned period to the beginning of the new year a month later the final proclamation came including the announcement that colored men of suitable condition would be received into the war service the policy of emancipation and of employing black soldiers gave to the future a new aspect about which hope and fear and doubt contended in uncertain conflict according to our political system as a matter of civil administration the general government had no lawful power to effect emancipation in any state and for a long time it had been hoped that the rebellion could be suppressed without resorting to it as a military measure it was all the while deemed possible that the necessity for it might come and that if it should the crisis of the contest would then be presented it came and as was anticipated it was followed by dark and doubtful days eleven months having now passed we are permitted to take another review the rebel borders are pressed still farther back and by the complete opening of the mississippi the country dominated by the rebellion is divided into distinct parts with no practical communication between them tennessee and arkansas have been substantially cleared of insurgent control and influential citizens in each owners of slaves and advocates of slavery at the beginning of the rebellion now declare openly for emancipation in their respective states of those states not included in the emancipation proclamation maryland and missouri neither of which three years ago would tolerate any restraint upon the extension of slavery into new territories dispute now only as to the best mode of removing it within their own limits  of those who were slaves at the beginning of the rebellion full 100000 are now in the united states military service about onehalf of which number actually bear arms in the ranks thus giving the double advantage of taking so much labor from the insurgent cause and supplying the places which otherwise must be filled with so many white men so far as tested it is difficult to say they are not as good soldiers as any no servile insurrection or tendency to violence or cruelty has marked the measures of emancipation and arming the blacks these measures have been much discussed in foreign countries and contemporary with such discussion the tone of public sentiment there is much improved at home the same measures have been fully discussed supported criticized and denounced and the annual elections following are highly encouraging to those whose official duty it is to bear the country through this great trial thus we have the new reckoning the crisis which threatened to divide the friends of the union is past  looking now to the present and future and with reference to a resumption of the national authority within the states wherein that authority has been suspended i have thought fit to issue a proclamation a copy of which is herewith transmitted on examination of this proclamation it will appear as is believed that nothing will be attempted beyond what is amply justified by the constitution true the form of an oath is given but no man is coerced to take it the man is promised a pardon only in case he voluntarily takes the oath the constitution authorizes the executive to grant or withhold the pardon at his own absolute discretion and this includes the power to grant on terms as is fully established by judicial and other authorities  it is also proffered that if in any of the states named a state government shall be in the mode prescribed set up such government shall be recognized and guaranteed by the united states and that under it the state shall on the constitutional conditions be protected against invasion and domestic violence the constitutional obligation of the united states to guarantee to every state in the union a republican form of government and to protect the state in the cases stated is explicit and full but why tender the benefits of this provision only to a state government set up in this particular way this section of the constitution contemplates a case wherein the element within a state favorable to republican government in the union may be too feeble for an opposite and hostile element external to or even within the state and such are precisely the cases with which we are now dealing  an attempt to guarantee and protect a revived state government constructed in whole or in preponderating part from the very element against whose hostility and violence it is to be protected is simply absurd there must be a test by which to separate the opposing elements so as to build only from the sound and that test is a sufficiently liberal one which accepts as sound whoever will make a sworn recantation of his former unsoundness  but if it be proper to require as a test of admission to the political body an oath of allegiance to the constitution of the united states and to the union under it why also to the laws and proclamations in regard to slavery those laws and proclamations were enacted and put forth for the purpose of aiding in the suppression of the rebellion to give them their fullest effect there had to be a pledge for their maintenance in my judgment they have aided and will further aid the cause for which they were intended to now abandon them would be not only to relinquish a lever of power but would also be a cruel and an astounding breach of faith i may add at this point that while i remain in my present position i shall not attempt to retract or modify the emancipation proclamation nor shall i return to slavery any person who is free by the terms of that proclamation or by any of the acts of congress for these and other reasons it is thought best that support of these measures shall be included in the oath and it is believed the executive may lawfully claim it in return for pardon and restoration of forfeited rights which he has clear constitutional power to withhold altogether or grant upon the terms which he shall deem wisest for the public interest it should be observed also that this part of the oath is subject to the modifying and abrogating power of legislation and supreme judicial decision  the proposed acquiescence of the national executive in any reasonable temporary state arrangement for the freed people is made with the view of possibly modifying the confusion and destitution which must at best attend all classes by a total revolution of labor throughout whole states it is hoped that the already deeply afflicted people in those states may be somewhat more ready to give up the cause of their affliction if to this extent this vital matter be left to themselves while no power of the national executive to prevent an abuse is abridged by the proposition  the suggestion in the proclamation as to maintaining the political framework of the states on what is called reconstruction is made in the hope that it may do good without danger of harm it will save labor and avoid great confusion  but why any proclamation now upon this subject this question is beset with the conflicting views that the step might be delayed too long or be taken too soon in some states the elements for resumption seem ready for action but remain inactive apparently for want of a rallying pointa plan of action why shall a adopt the plan of b rather than b that of a and if a and b should agree how can they know but that the general government here will reject their plan by the proclamation a plan is presented which may be accepted by them as a rallying point and which they are assured in advance will not be rejected here this may bring them to act sooner than they otherwise would  the objections to a premature presentation of a plan by the national executive consist in the danger of committals on points which could be more safely left to further developments care has been taken to so shape the document as to avoid embarrassments from this source saying that on certain terms certain classes will be pardoned with rights restored it is not said that other classes or other terms will never be included saying that reconstruction will be accepted if presented in a specified way it is not said it will never be accepted in any other way  the movements by state action for emancipation in several of the states not included in the emancipation proclamation are matters of profound gratulation and while i do not repeat in detail what i have heretofore so earnestly urged upon this subject my general views and feelings remain unchanged and i trust that congress will omit no fair opportunity of aiding these important steps to a great consummation  in the midst of other cares however important we must not lose sight of the fact that the war power is still our main reliance to that power alone we look yet for a time to give confidence to the people in the contested regions that the insurgent power will not again overrun them until that confidence shall be established little can be done anywhere what is called reconstruction hence our chiefest care must still be directed to the army and navy who have thus far borne their harder part so nobly and well and it may be esteemed fortunate that giving the greatest efficiency to these indispensable arms we do also honorably recognize the gallant men from commander to sentinel who compose them and to whom more than to others the world must stand indebted for the home of freedom disenthralled regenerated enlarged and perpetuated   a lincoln     message to congress washington d c december 8 1863  to the senate and house of representatives  in conformity to the law of july 16 1862 i most cordially recommend that captain john rogers united states navy receive a vote of thanks from congress for the eminent skill and gallantry exhibited by him in the engagement with the rebel armed ironclad steamer fingal alias atlanta whilst in command of the united states ironclad steamer weehawken which led to her capture on the 17th june 1863 and also for the zeal bravery and general good conduct shown by this officer on many occasions  this recommendation is specially made in order to comply with the requirements of the ninth section of the aforesaid act which is in the following words viz  that any line officer of the navy or marine corps may be advanced one grade if upon recommendation of the president by name he receives the thanks of congress for highly distinguished conduct in conflict with the enemy or for extraordinary heroism in the line of his profession   a lincoln     message to the senate washington d c december 8 1863  to the senate of the

the mississippi and its tributaries and the important part rendered by the squadron under his command which led to the surrender of vicksburg  i do therefore in conformity to the seventh section of

concerning discriminating duties december 16 1863  by the president of the united states of america  a proclamation  whereas by an act of the congress of the united states of the 24th of may 1828 entitled an act in addition to an act entitled an act concerning discriminating duties of tonnage and impost and to equalize the duties on prussian vessels and their cargoes it is provided that upon satisfactory evidence being given to the president of the united states by the government of any foreign nation that no discriminating duties of tonnage or impost are imposed or levied in the ports of the said nation upon vessels wholly belonging to citizens of the united states or upon the produce manufactures or merchandise imported in the same from the united states or from any foreign country the president is thereby authorized to issue his proclamation declaring that the foreign discriminating duties of tonnage and impost within the united states are and shall be suspended and discontinued so far as respects the vessels of the said foreign nation and the produce manufactures or merchandise imported into the united states in the same from the said foreign nation or from any other foreign country the said suspension to take effect from the time of such notification being given to the president of the united states and to continue so long as the reciprocal exemption of vessels belonging to citizens of the united states and their cargoes as aforesaid shall be continued and no longer and  whereas satisfactory evidence has lately been received by me through an official communication of senor don luis molina envoy extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary of the republic of nicaragua under date of the 28th of november 1863 that no other or higher duties of tonnage and impost have been imposed or levied since the second day of august 1838 in the ports of nicaragua upon vessels wholly belonging to citizens of the united states and upon the produce manufactures or merchandise imported in the same from the united states and from any foreign country whatever than are levied on nicaraguan ships and their cargoes in the same ports under like circumstances  now therefore i abraham lincoln president of the united states of america do hereby declare and proclaim that so much of the several acts imposing discriminating duties of tonnage and impost within the united states are and shall be suspended and discontinued so far as respects the vessels of nicaragua and the produce manufactures and the merchandise imported into the united states in the same from the dominions of nicaragua and from any other foreign country whatever the said suspension to take effect from the day above mentioned and to continue thenceforward so long as the reciprocal exemption of the vessels of the united states and the produce manufactures and merchandise imported into the dominions of nicaragua in the same as aforesaid shall be continued on the part of the government of

lay before you a letter addressed to myself by a committee of gentlemen representing the freedmens aid societies in boston new york philadelphia and cincinnati the subject of the letter as indicated above is one of great magnitude and importance and one which these gentlemen of known ability and high character seem to have considered with great attention and care not having the time to form a mature judgment of my own as to whether the plan they suggest is the best i submit the whole subject to congress deeming that their attention thereto is almost imperatively demanded   a lincoln

anxious that general milroy shall enter active service again and i share in this feeling he is not a difficult man to satisfy sincerity and courage being his strong traits believing in our cause and

washington d c december 21 1863  hon secretary of war  my dear sirsending a note to the secretary of the navy as i promised he called over and said that the strikes in the shipyards had thrown the completion of vessels back so much that he thought general gilimores proposition entirely proper he only wishes and in which i concur that general gillmore will courteously confer with and explain to admiral dahlgren  in regard to the western matter i believe the program will have to stand substantially as i first put it henderson and especially brown believe that the social influence of st louis would inevitably tell injuriously upon general pope in the particular difficulty existing there and i think there is some force in that view  as to retaining general schofield temporarily if this should be done i believe i should scarcely be able to get his nomination through the senate send me over his nomination which however i am not quite ready to send to the senate  yours as ever   a lincoln     to o d filley  executive mansion washington december 22 1863  o d filley st louis missouri  i have just looked over a petition signed by some three dozen citizens of st louis and three accompanying letters one by yourself one by a mr nathan ranney and one by a mr john d coalter the whole relating to the rev dr mcpheeters the petition prays in the name of justice and mercy that i will restore dr mcpheeters to all his ecclesiastical rights this gives no intimation as to what ecclesiastical rights are withheld  your letter states that provostmarshal dick about a year ago ordered the arrest of dr mcpheeters pastor of the vine street church prohibited him from officiating and placed the management of the affairs of the church out of the control of its chosen trustees and near the close you state that a certain course would insure his release mr ranneys letter says dr samuel s mcpheeters is enjoying all the rights of a civilian but cannot preach the gospel mr coalter in his letter asks is it not a strange illustration of the condition of things that the question of who shall be allowed to preach in a church in st louis shall be decided by the president of the united states  now all this sounds very strangely and withal a little as if you gentlemen making the application do not understand the case alike one affirming that the doctor is enjoying all the rights of a civilian and another pointing out to me what will secure his release on the second day of january last i wrote to general curtis in relation to mr dicks order upon dr mcpheeters and as i suppose the doctor is enjoying all the rights of a civilian i only quote that part of my letter which relates to the church it is as follows but i must add that the united states government must not as by this order undertake to run the churches when an individual in a church or out of it becomes dangerous to the public interest he must be checked but the churches as such must take care of themselves it will not do for the united states to appoint trustees supervisors or other agents for the churches  this letter going to general curtis then in command there i supposed of course it was obeyed

church nor have i knowingly or believingly tolerated any one else to so interfere by my authority if any one is so interfering by color of my authority i would like to have it specifically made known to me if after all what is now sought is to have me put dr mcpheeters back over the heads of a majority of his own congregation that too will be declined i will not have control of any church on any

secretary of war accompanied by one from the provostmarshal general to him both relating to the subject above mentioned i earnestly recommend that the law be so modified as to allow bounties to be paid as they now are at least until the ensuing 1st day of february  i am not without anxiety lest i appear to be importunate in thus recalling your attention to a subject upon which you have so recently acted and nothing but a deep conviction that the public interest demands it could induce me to incur the hazard of being misunderstood on this point the executive approval was given by me to the resolution mentioned and it is now by a closer attention and a fuller knowledge of facts that i feel constrained to recommend a reconsideration of the subject   a lincoln     telegram to governor

beyond the fair presumption that it comes from general grant and that it has an object which if you understood you would be loath to frustrate true these troops are in strict law only to be removed by my order but general grants judgment would be the highest incentive to me to make such order nor can i understand how doing so is bad faith and dishonor nor yet how it so exposes kentucky to ruin

the blanks and also my general views on the subject it is desirable for all to cooperate but if irreconcilable differences of opinion shall arise you are master i wish the thing done in the most speedy way so that when done it be within the range of the late proclamation on the subject the detail labor will of course have to be done by others but i will be greatly obliged if you will give it

the country i fear i am not worthy of all which is therein kindly said of me personally  the sentence of twelve lines commencing at the top of page 252 i could wish to be not exactly what it is in what is there expressed the writer has not correctly understood me i have never had a theory that secession could absolve states or people from their obligations precisely the contrary is asserted in the inaugural address and it was because of my belief in the continuation of those obligations that i was puzzled for a time as to denying the legal rights of those citizens who remained individually

the story of the emancipation proclamation  told by the president to the artist f b carpenter  february 6 1864  it had got to be said mr lincoln midsummer 1862 things had gone on from bad to worse until i felt that we had reached the end of our rope on the plan of operations we had been pursuing that we had about played our last card and must change our tactics or lose the game i now determined upon the adoption of the emancipation policy and without consultation with or the knowledge of the cabinet i prepared the original draft of the proclamation and after much anxious thought called a cabinet meeting upon the subject this was the last of july or the first part of the month of august 1862 the exact date was july 22 1862 all were present excepting mr blair the postmastergeneral who was absent at the opening of the discussion but came in subsequently i said to the cabinet that i had resolved upon this step and had not called them together to ask their advice but to lay the subjectmatter of a proclamation before them suggestions as to which would be in order after they had heard it read mr lovejoy was in error when he informed you that it excited no comment excepting on the part of secretary seward various suggestions were offered secretary chase wished the language stronger in reference to the arming of the blacks  mr blair after he came in deprecated the policy on the ground that it would cost the administration the fall elections nothing however was offered that i had not already fully anticipated and settled in my mind until secretary seward spoke he said in substance mr president i approve of the proclamation but i question the expediency of its issue at this juncture the depression of the public mind consequent upon our repeated reverses is so great that i fear the effect of so important a step it may be viewed as the last measure of an exhausted government a cry for help the government stretching forth its hands to ethiopia instead of ethiopia stretching forth her hands to the government his idea said the president was that it would be considered our last shriek on the retreat this was his precise expression now continued mr seward while i approve the measure i suggest sir that you postpone its issue until you can give it to the country supported by military success instead of issuing it as would be the case now upon the greatest disasters of the war mr lincoln continued the wisdom of the view of the secretary of state struck me with very great force it was an aspect of the case that in all my thought upon the subject i had entirely overlooked the result was that i put the draft of the proclamation aside as you do your sketch for a picture waiting for a victory  from time to time i added or changed a line touching it up here and there anxiously watching the process of events well the next news we had was of popes disaster at bull run things looked darker than ever finally came the week of the battle of antietam i determined to wait no longer the news came i think on wednesday that the advantage was on our side i was then staying at the soldiers home three miles out of washington here i finished writing the

arkansas i did it in ignorance that your convention was doing the same work since i learned the latter fact i have been constantly trying to yield my plan to them i have sent two letters to general steele and three or four despatches to you and others saying that he general steele must be master but that it will probably be best for him to merely help the convention on its own plan some single mind must be master else there will be no agreement in anything and general steele commanding the military and being on the ground is the best man to be that master even now citizens are telegraphing

of the customs according to law showing no violation of the conditions of the license any violations of said conditions will involve the forfeiture and condemnation of the vessel and cargo and the exclusion of all parties concerned from any further privilege of entering the united states during the war for any purpose whatever  in all respects except as herein specified the existing blockade

for a copy of my despatch to warren jordan esq at nashville press office has just been referred to me by governor johnson in my reply to mr jordan which was brief and hurried i intended to say that in the county and state elections of tennessee the oath prescribed in the proclamation of governor johnson on the twentysixth of january 1864 ordering an election in tennessee on the first saturday in march next is entirely satisfactory to me as a test of loyalty of all persons proposing or offering to vote in said elections and coming from him would better be observed and followed there is no conflict between the oath of amnesty in my proclamation of eighth december 1863 and that prescribed by governor johnson in his proclamation of the twentysixth ultimo  no person who has taken the oath of amnesty of eighth december 1863 and obtained a pardon thereby and who intends to observe the same in good faith should have any objection to taking that prescribed by governor johnson as a test of loyalty  i have seen and examined governor johnsons proclamation and am entirely satisfied with his plan which is to restore the state government and place it under the control of citizens truly loyal to the government of the united states   a lincoln  please send above to governor johnson a l     to secretary stanton  executive mansion washington february 27 1864  hon secretary of war  siryou ask some instructions from me in relation to the report of special commission constituted by an order of the war department dated december 5 1863 to revise the enrolment and quotas of the city and state of new york and report whether there be any and what errors or irregularities therein and what corrections if any should be made  in the correspondence between the governor of new york and myself last summer i understood him to complain that the enrolments in several of the districts of that state had been neither accurately nor honestly made and in view of this i for the draft then immediately ensuing ordered an arbitrary reduction of the quotas in several of the districts wherein they seemed too large and said after this drawing these four districts and also the seventeenth and twentyninth shall be carefully reenrolled and if you please agents of yours may witness every step of the process in a subsequent letter i believe some additional districts were put into the list of those to be reenrolled my idea was to do the work over according to the law in presence of the complaining party and thereby to correct anything which might be found amiss the commission whose work i am considering seem to have proceeded upon a totally different idea not going forth to find men at all they have proceeded altogether upon paper examinations and mental processes one of their conclusions as i understand is that as the law stands and attempting to follow it the enrolling officers could not have made the enrolments much more accurately than they did the report on this point might be useful to congress the commission conclude that the quotas for the draft should be based upon entire population and they proceed upon this basis to give a table for the state of new york in which some districts are reduced and some increased for the now ensuing draft let the quotas stand as made by the enrolling officers in the districts wherein this table requires them to be increased and let them be reduced according to the table in the others this to be no precedent for subsequent action but as i think this report may on full consideration be shown to have much that is valuable in it i suggest that such consideration be given it and that it be especially considered whether its suggestions can be conformed to without an alteration of the law  yours truly   a lincoln    telegram to

that if persisted in it would fall dead within its own entangling details go there and be the judge a mr lewis will probably follow you with something from me on this subject but do not wait for him

acknowledged the receipt of yours and promised a fuller answer now on consideration i find there is really very little to say my knowledge of mr pomeroys letter having been made public came to me only the day you wrote but i had in spite of myself known of its existence several days before i have not yet read it and i think i shall not i was not shocked or surprised by the appearance of the letter because i had had knowledge of mr pomeroys committee and of secret issues which i supposed came from it and of secret agents who i supposed were sent out by it for several weeks i have known just as little a these things as my friends have allowed me to know they bring the documents to me but i do not read them they tell me what they think fit to tell me but i do not inquire for more  i fully concur with you that neither of us can justly be held responsible for what our respective friends may do without our instigation or countenance and i assure you as you have assured me that no assault has been made upon you by my instigation or with my countenance  whether you shall remain at the head of the treasury department is a question which i will not allow myself to consider from any standpoint other than my judgment of the public service and in that view i do not perceive occasion for a change  yours truly   a lincoln     to general thomas  executive mansion washington march

acquainted with and has access to many of the planters who wish to adopt the system he will show you two letters of mine on this subject one somewhat general and the other relating to named persons they are not different in principle he will also show you some suggestions coming from some of the planters themselves i desire that all i promise in these letters so far as practicable may be in good faith carried out and that suggestions from the planters may be heard and adopted so far as they may not contravene the principles stated nor justice nor fairness to laborers i do not herein intend to

tobacco belonging to the french government from insurgent territory which tobacco was supposed to have been purchased and paid for prior to the 4th day of march 1861 but whereas it was subsequently

pursuant to mutual explanations a satisfactory understanding upon the subject has now been reached it is directed that the order aforesaid may be carried into effect it being understood that the

and of the branch road from the western boundary of iowa to the said one hundredth degree of longitude i transmit the accompanying report from the secretary of the interior containing the information called for  i deem it proper to add that on the 17th day of november last an executive order was made upon this subject and delivered to the vicepresident of the union pacific railroad company which fixed the point on the western boundary of the state of iowa from which the company should construct their branch road to the one hundredth degree of west longitude and declared it to be within the limits of the township in iowa opposite the town of omaha in nebraska since then the company has represented to me that upon actual surveys made it has determined upon the precise point of departure of their said branch road from the missouri river and located the same as described in the accompanying report of the secretary of the interior which point is within the limits designated in the order of november last and inasmuch as that order is not of record in any of the executive departments and the company having desired a more definite one i have made the order of which a copy is herewith

with the powers exercised hitherto by the military governor of louisiana  yours truly   a lincoln     remarks at a fair in the patent office  washington march 16 1864  ladies and gentlemen  i appear to say but a word this extraordinary war in which we are engaged falls heavily upon all classes of people but the most heavily upon the soldier for it has been said all that a man hath will he give for his life and while all contribute of their substance the soldier puts his life at stake and often yields it up in his countrys cause the highest merit then is due to the soldier  in this extraordinary war extraordinary developments have manifested themselves such as have not been seen in former wars and among these manifestations nothing has been more remarkable than these fairs for the relief of suffering soldiers and their families and the chief agents of these fairs are the women of america  i am not accustomed to the use of language of eulogy i have never studied the art of paying compliments to women but i must say that if all that has been said by orators and poets since the creation of the world in praise of women were applied to the women of america it would not do them justice for their conduct during this war i will close by saying god bless the women of america     reply to a committee from the workingmens association of new york  march 21 1864  gentlemen of the committee  the honorary membership in your association as generously tendered is gratefully accepted  you comprehend as your address shows that the existing rebellion means more and tends to do more than the perpetuation of african slaverythat it is in fact a war upon the rights of all working people partly to show that this view has not escaped my attention and partly that i cannot better express myself i read a passage from the message to congress in december 1861  it continues to develop that the insurrection is largely if not exclusively a war upon the first principle of popular government the rights of the people conclusive evidence of this is found in the most grave and maturely considered public documents as well as in the general tone of the insurgents in those documents we find the abridgment of the existing right of suffrage and the denial to the people of all right to participate in the selection of public officers except the legislature boldly advocated with labored argument to prove that large control of the people in government is the source of all political evil monarchy itself is sometimes hinted at as a possible refuge from the power of the people in my present position i could scarcely be justified were i to omit raising a warning voice against this approach of returning despotism  it is not needed nor fitting here that a general argument should be made in favor of popular institutions but there is one point with its connections not so hackneyed as most others to which i ask a brief attention it is the effort to place capital on an equal footing if not above labor in the structure of government it is assumed that labor is available only in connection with capital that nobody labors unless somebody else owning capital somehow by the use of it induces him to labor this assumed it is next considered whether it is best that capital shall hire laborers and thus induce them to work by their own consent or buy them and drive them to it without their consent having proceeded so it is naturally concluded that all laborers are either hired laborers or what we call slaves and further it is assumed that whoever is once a hired laborer is fixed in that condition for life now there is no such relation between capital and labor as assumed nor is there any such thing as a free man being fixed for life in the condition of a hired laborer both these assumptions are false and all inferences from them are groundless  labor is prior to and independent of capital capital is only the fruit of labor and could never have existed if labor had not first existed labor is the superior of capital and deserves much the higher consideration capital has its rights which are as worthy of protection as any other rights nor is it denied that there is and probably always will be a relation between capital and labor producing mutual benefits the error is in assuming that the whole labor of a community exists within that relation a few men own capital and that few avoid labor themselves and with their capital hire or buy another few to labor for them a large majority belong to neither classneither work for others nor have others working for them in most of the southern states a majority of the whole people of all colors are neither slaves nor masters while in the northern a large majority are neither hirers nor hired men with their families wives sons and daughterswork for themselves on their farms in their houses and in their shops taking the whole product to themselves and asking no favors of capital on the one hand nor of hired laborers or slaves on the other it is not forgotten that a considerable number of persons mingle their own labor with capital that is they labor with their own hands and also buy or hire others to labor for them but this is only a mixed and not a distinct class no principle stated is disturbed by the existence of this mixed class  again as has already been said there is not of necessity any such thing as the free hired laborer being fixed to that condition for life many independent men everywhere in these states a few years back in their lives were hired laborers the prudent penniless beginner in the world labors for wages a while saves a surplus with which to buy tools or land for himself then labors on his own account another while and at length hires another new beginner to help him this is the just and generous and prosperous system which opens the way to allgives hope to all and consequent energy and progress and improvement of condition to all no men living are more worthy to be trusted than those who toil up from povertynone less inclined to touch or take aught which they have not honestly earned let them beware of surrendering a political power they already possess and which if surrendered will surely be used to close the door of advancement against such as they and to fix new disabilities and burdens upon them till all of liberty shall be lost  the views then expressed remain unchanged nor have i much to add none are so deeply interested to resist the present rebellion as the working people let them beware of prejudices working division and hostility among themselves the most notable feature of a disturbance in your city last summer was the hanging of some working people by other working people it should never be so the strongest bond of human sympathy outside of the family relation should be one uniting all working people of all nations and tongues and kindreds nor should this lead to a war upon property or the owners of property property is the fruit of labor property is desirable is a positive good in the world that some should be rich shows that others may become rich and hence is just encouragement to industry and enterprise let not him who is houseless pull down the house of another but let him labor diligently and build one for himself thus by example assuring that his own shall be safe from violence when built     telegram to

majorgeneral schurz  my dear siryours of february 29 reached me only four days ago but the delay was of little consequence because i found on feeling around i could not invite you here without a difficulty which at least would be unpleasant and perhaps would be detrimental to the public service allow me to suggest that if you wish to remain in the military service it is very dangerous for you to get temporarily out of it because with a majorgeneral once out it is next to impossible for even the president to get him in again with my appreciation of your ability and correct principle of course i would be very glad to have your service for the country in the approaching political canvass but i fear we cannot properly have it without separating you from the military  yours truly   a lincoln     proclamation about amnesty  march 26 1864  by the president of the united states of america  a proclamation  whereas it has become necessary to define the cases in which insurgent enemies are entitled to the benefits of the proclamation of the president of the united states which was made on the 8th day of december 1863 and the manner in which they shall proceed to avail themselves of these benefits and whereas the objects of that proclamation were to suppress the insurrection and to restore the authority of the united states and whereas the amnesty therein proposed by the president was offered with reference to these objects alone  now therefore i abraham lincoln president of the united states do hereby proclaim and declare that the said proclamation does not apply to the cases of persons who at the time when they seek to obtain the benefits thereof by taking the oath thereby prescribed are in military naval or civil confinement or custody or under bonds or on parole of the civil military or naval authorities or agents of the united states as prisoners of war or persons detained for offences of any kind either before or after conviction and that on the contrary it does apply only to those persons who being yet at large and free from any arrest confinement or duress shall voluntarily come forward and take the said oath with the purpose of restoring peace and establishing the national authority  persons excluded from the amnesty offered in the said proclamation may apply to the president for clemency like all other offenders and their application will receive due consideration  i do further declare and proclaim that the oath presented in the aforesaid proclamation of the 8th of december 1863 may be taken and subscribed before any commissioned officer civil military or naval in the service of the united states or any civil or military officer of a state or territory not in insurrection who by the laws thereof may be qualified for administering oaths  all officers who receive such oaths are hereby authorized to give certificates thereof to the persons respectively by whom they are made and such officers are hereby required to transmit the original records of such oaths at as early a day as may be convenient to the department of state where they will be deposited and remain in the archives of the government  the secretary of state will keep a registry thereof and will on application in proper cases issue certificates of such records in the customary form of official certificates  in testimony whereof i have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the united states to be affixed   a lincoln  by the president william h seward secretary of state     to secretary stanton  executive mansion washington march 28 1864  hon secretary of war  my dear sirthe governor of kentucky is here and desires to have the following points definitely fixed  first that the quotas of troops furnished and to be furnished by kentucky may be adjusted upon the basis as actually reduced by ablebodied men of hers having gone into the rebel service and that she be required to furnish no more than her just quotas upon fair adjustment upon such basis  second to whatever extent the enlistment and drafting one or both of colored troops may be found necessary within the state it may be conducted within the law of congress and so far as practicable free from collateral embarrassments disorders and provocations  i think these requests of the governor are reasonable and i shall be obliged if you will give him a full hearing and do the best you can to effect these objects  yours very truly   a lincoln     to general g g meade  executive mansion washington march 29 1864  majorgeneral meade  my dear siryour letter to colonel townsend inclosing a slip from the herald and asking a court of inquiry has been laid before me by the secretary of war with the request that i would consider it it is quite natural that you should feel some sensibility on the subject yet i am not impressed nor do i think the country is impressed with the belief that your honor demands or the public interest demands such an inquiry the country knows that at all events you have done good service and i believe it agrees with me that it is much better for you to be engaged in trying to do more than to be diverted as you necessarily would be by a court of inquiry  yours truly  a lincoln     telegram to general u s grant  executive mansion washington march 291864  lieutenantgeneral grant army of the potomac  captain kinney of whom i spoke to you as desiring to go on your staff is now in your camp in company with mrs senator dixon mrs grant and i and some others agreed last night that i should by this despatch kindly call your attention to captain kinney   a lincoln     to a g hodges  executive mansion washington april 4 1864  a g hodges esq frankfort kentucky  my dear siryou ask me to put in writing the substance of what i verbally said the other day in your presence to governor bramlette and senator dixon it was about as follows  i am naturally antislavery if slavery is not wrong nothing is wrong i cannot remember when i did not so think and feel and yet i have never understood that the presidency conferred upon me an unrestricted right to act officially upon this judgment and feeling it was in the oath i took that i would to the best of my ability preserve protect and defend the constitution of the united states i could not take the office without taking the oath nor was it my view that i might take an oath to get power and break the oath in using the power i understood too that in ordinary civil administration this oath even forbade me to practically indulge my primary abstract judgment on the moral question of slavery i had publicly declared this many times and in many ways and i aver that to this day i have done no official act in mere deference to my abstract judgment and feeling on slavery i did understand however that my oath to preserve the constitution to the best of my ability imposed upon me the duty of preserving by every indispensable means that government that nation of which that constitution was the organic law was it possible to lose the nation and yet preserve the constitution by general law life and limb must be protected yet often a limb must be amputated to save a life but a life is never wisely given to save a limb i felt that measures otherwise unconstitutional might become lawful by becoming indispensable to the preservation of the constitution through the preservation of the nation right or wrong i assumed this ground and now avow it i could not feel that to the best of my ability i had even tried to preserve the constitution if to save slavery or any minor matter i should permit the wreck of government country and constitution altogether when early in the war general fremont attempted military emancipation i forbade it because i did not then think it an indispensable necessity when a little later general cameron then secretary of war suggested the arming of the blacks i objected because i did not yet think it an indispensable necessity when still later general hunter attempted military emancipation i again forbade it because i did not yet think the indispensable necessity had come when in march and may and july 1862 i made earnest and successive appeals to the border states to favor compensated emancipation i believed the indispensable necessity for military emancipation and arming the blacks would come unless averted by that measure they declined the proposition and i was in my best judgment driven to the alternative of either surrendering the union and with it the constitution or of laying strong hand upon the colored element i chose the latter in choosing it i hoped for greater gain than loss but of this i was not entirely confident more than a year of trial now shows no loss by it in our foreign relations none in our home popular sentiment none in our white military force no loss by it any how or anywhere on the contrary it shows a gain of quite one hundred and thirty thousand soldiers seamen and laborers these are palpable facts about which as facts there can be no caviling we have the men and we could not have had them without the measure  and now let any union man who complains of the measure test himself by writing down in one line that he is for subduing the rebellion by force of arms and in the next that he is for taking these hundred and thirty thousand men from the union side and placing them where they would be but for the measure he condemns if he cannot face his case so stated it is only because he cannot face the truth  i add a word which was not in the verbal conversation in telling this tale i attempt no compliment to my own sagacity i claim not to have controlled events but confess plainly that events have controlled me now at the end of three years struggle the nations condition is not what either party or any man devised or expected god alone can claim it whither it is tending seems plain if god now wills the removal of a great wrong and wills also that we of the north as well as you of the south shall pay fairly for our complicity in that wrong impartial history will find therein new cause to attest and revere the justice and goodness of god  yours truly   a

fair in baltimore  april 18 1864  ladies and gentlemencalling to mind that we are in baltimore we cannot fail to note that the world moves looking upon these many people assembled here to serve as they best may the soldiers of the union it occurs at once that three years ago the same soldiers could not so much as pass through baltimore the change from then till now is both great and gratifying blessings on the brave men who have wrought the change and the fair women who strive to reward them for it  but baltimore suggests more than could happen within baltimore the change within baltimore is part only of a far wider change when the war began three years ago neither party nor any man expected it would last till now each looked for the end in some way long ere today neither did any anticipate that domestic slavery would be much affected by the war but here we are the war has not ended and slavery has been much affected how much needs not now to be recounted so true is it that man proposes and god disposes  but we can see the past though we may not claim to have directed it and seeing it in this case we feel more hopeful and confident for the future  the world has never had a good definition of the word liberty and the american people just now are much in want of one we all declare for liberty but in using the same word we do not all mean the same thing with some the word liberty may mean for each man to do as he pleases with himself and the product of his labor while with others the same word may mean for some men to do as they please with other men and the product of other mens labor here are two not only different but incompatible things called by the same name liberty and it follows that each of the things is by the respective parties called by two different and incompatible namesliberty and tyranny  the shepherd drives the wolf from the sheeps throat for which the sheep thanks the shepherd as his liberator while the wolf denounces him for the same act as the destroyer of liberty especially as the sheep was a black one plainly the sheep and the wolf are not agreed upon a definition of the word liberty and precisely the same difference prevails today among us human creatures even in the north and all professing to love liberty hence we behold the process by which thousands are daily passing from under the yoke of bondage hailed by some as the advance of liberty and bewailed by others as the destruction of all liberty recently as it seems the people of maryland have been doing something to define liberty and thanks to them that in what they have done the wolfs dictionary has been repudiated  it is not very becoming for one in my position to make speeches at length but there is another subject upon which i feel that i ought to say a word a painful rumor true i fear has reached us of the massacre by the rebel forces at fort pillow in the west end of tennessee on the mississippi river of some three hundred colored soldiers and white officers i believe it latter turned out to be 500 who had just been overpowered by their assailants numbering 5000 there seems to be some anxiety in the public mind whether the government is doing its duty to the colored soldier and to the service at this point at the beginning of the war and for some time the use of colored troops was not contemplated and how the change of purpose was wrought i will not now take time to explain upon a clear conviction of duty i resolved to turn that element of strength to account and i am responsible for it to the american people to the christian world to history and in my final account to god having determined to use the negro as a soldier there is no way but to give him all the protection given to any other soldier the difficulty is not in stating the principle but in practically applying it it is a mistake to suppose the government is indifferent to this matter or is not doing the best it can in regard to it we do not today know that a colored soldier or white officer commanding colored soldiers has been massacred by the rebels when made a prisoner we fear it we believe it i may saybut we do not know it to take the life of one of their prisoners on the assumption that they murder ours when it is short of certainty that they do murder ours might be too serious too cruel a mistake we are having the fort pillow affair thoroughly investigated and such investigation will probably show conclusively how the truth is if after all that has been said it shall turn out that there has been no massacre at fort pillow it will be almost safe to say there has been none and will be none elsewhere if there has been the massacre of three hundred there or even the tenth part of three hundred it will be conclusively proved and being so proved the retribution shall as surely come it will be matter of grave consideration in what exact course to apply the retribution but in the supposed case it must come  there was a massacre of a black company and their officers at fort pillowthey were prisoners who later on the day of their capture were ordered executed the black soldiers were tied alive to individual planksthen man and plank were cobbled up like cord wood and burned the white officers were shot dw     to calvin truesdale  executive mansion washington april 20 1864  calvin truesdale esq postmaster rock island ill  thomas j

so that your state government including the legislature is organized and in good working order whatever i can i will do to protect you meanwhile you must do your utmost to protect yourselves present my greeting to all   a lincoln     message to congress april 28 1864  to the honorable the senate and house of representatives  i have the honor to transmit herewith an address to the president of the united states and through him to both houses of congress on the condition and wants of the people of east tennessee and asking their attention to the necessity of some action on the part of the government for their relief and which address is presented by a committee of an organization called the east tennessee relief association  deeply commiserating the condition of these most loyal and suffering people i am unprepared to make any specific recommendation for their relief the military is doing and will continue to do the best for them within its power their address represents that the construction of direct railroad communication between knoxville and cincinnati by way of central kentucky would be of great consequence in the present emergency it may be remembered that in the annual message of december 1861 such railroad construction was recommended i now add that with the hearty concurrence of congress i would yet be pleased to construct a road both for the relief of these people and for its continuing military importance   a lincoln     message to the house of representatives  april 28 1864  to the house of representatives  in obedience to the resolution of your honorable body a copy of which is herewith returned i have the honor to make the following brief statement which is believed to contain the information sought  prior to and at the meeting of the present congress robert c schenck of ohio and frank p blair jr of missouri members elect thereto by and with the consent of the senate held commissions from the executive as majorgenerals in the volunteer army general schenck tendered the resignation of his said commission and took his seat in the house of representatives at the assembling thereof upon the distinct verbal understanding with the secretary of war and the executive that he might at any time during the session at his own pleasure withdraw said resignation and return to the field  general blair was by temporary assignment of general sherman in command of a corps through the battles in front of chattanooga and in the march to the relief of knoxville which occurred in the latter days of november and early days of december last and of course was not present at the assembling of congress when he subsequently arrived here he sought and was allowed by the secretary of war and the executive the same conditions and promise as allowed and made to general schenck  general schenck has not applied to withdraw his resignation but when general grant was made lieutenantgeneral producing some change of commanders general blair sought to be assigned to the command of a corps this was made known to generals grant and sherman and assented to by them and the particular corps for him designated  this was all arranged and understood as now remembered so much as a month ago but the formal withdrawal of general blairs resignation and making the order assigning him to the command of the corps were not consummated at the war department until last week perhaps on the 23d of april instant as a summary of the whole it may be stated that general blair holds no military commission or appointment other than as herein stated and that it is believed he is now acting as majorgeneral upon the assumed validity of the commission herein stated in connection with the facts herein stated and not otherwise there are some letters notes telegrams orders entries and perhaps other documents in connection with this subject which it is believed would throw no additional light upon it but which will be cheerfully furnished if desired   a lincoln     to general u s grant  executive mansion washington april 30 1864  lieutenantgeneral grant  not expecting to see you before the spring campaign opens i wish to express in this

with this i wish not to obtrude any restraints or constraints upon you while i am very anxious that any great disaster or capture of our men in great number shall be avoided i know that these points are less likely to escape your attention than they would be mine if there be anything wanting which is within my power to give do not fail to let me know it  and now with a brave army and a just cause may god sustain you  yours very truly   a lincoln      message to the house of representatives  may 2 1864  to the honorable the house of representatives  in compliance with the request contained in your resolution of the 29th ultimo a copy of which resolution is herewith returned i have the honor to transmit the following  correspondence and orders relating to the resignation and reinstatement of majorgeneral frank p blair jr of missouri  the foregoing constitutes all sought by the resolution so far as is remembered or has been found upon diligent search   a lincoln     telegram to general w t sherman  washington d c may 4 1864  majorgeneral sherman chattanooga tenn  i have an imploring appeal in behalf of the citizens who say your order no8 will compel them to go north of nashville

operations for those suffering people i shall be glad of   a lincoln     telegram to general rosecrans  executive mansion washington may 5 1864  majorgeneral rosecrans commanding saint louis mo  the

thanksgiving  executive mansion washington may 9 1864  to the friends of union and liberty  enough is known of army operations within the last five days to claim our special gratitude to god while what remains undone demands our most sincere prayers to and reliance upon him without whom all effort is vain i recommend that all patriots at their homes in their places of public worship and wherever they may be unite in common thanksgiving and prayer to almighty god   a lincoln     response to a serenade  may 9 1864  fellowcitizensi am very much obliged to you for the compliment of this call though i apprehend it is owing more to the good news received today from the army than to a desire to see me i am indeed very grateful to the brave men who have been struggling with the enemy in the field to their noble commanders who have directed them and especially to our maker our commanders are following up their victories resolutely and successfully i think without knowing the particulars of the plans of general grant that what has been accomplished is of more importance than at first appears i believe i know and am especially grateful to know that general grant has not been jostled in his purposes that he has made all his points and today he is on his line as he purposed before he moved his armies i will volunteer to say that i am very glad at what has happened but there is a great deal still to be done while we are grateful to all the brave men and officers for the events of the past few days we should above all be very grateful to almighty god who gives us victory  there is enough yet before us requiring all loyal men and patriots to perform their share of the labor and follow the example of the modest general at the head of our armies and sink all personal consideration for the sake of the country i commend you to keep yourselves in the same tranquil mood that is characteristic of that brave and loyal man i have said more than i expected when i came before you repeating my thanks for this call i bid you goodbye     telegram to general lew wallace  war department washington d c may 10 1864  majorgeneral wallace baltimore  please tell me what

to replace the present garrison at port trumbull with volunteers which you propose to raise at your own expense while it seems inexpedient at this time to accept this proposition on account of the special duties now devolving upon the garrison mentioned i cannot pass unnoticed such a meritorious instance of individual patriotism permit me for the government to express my cordial thanks to you for this generous and publicspirited offer which is worthy of note among the many called forth in these times of national trial  i am very truly your obedient servant   a lincoln     response to a

name for the sure promise it gives nobly sustained as the government has been by all the churches i would utter nothing which might in the least appear invidious against any yet without this it may fairly be said that the methodist episcopal church not less devoted than the best is by its greatest numbers the most important of all it is no fault in others that the methodist church sends more soldiers to the field more nurses to the hospitals and more prayers to heaven thanany other god bless the methodist church bless all the churches and blessed be god who in this our great trial giveth

    arrest and imprisonment of irresponsible newspaper reporters and editors  order to general j a dix  executive mansion washington may 18 1864  majorgeneral john a dix commanding at new york  whereas there has been wickedly and traitorously printed and published this morning in the new york world and new york journal of commerce newspapers printed and published in the city of new york a false and spurious proclamation purporting to be signed by the president and to be countersigned by the secretary of state which publication is of a treasonable nature designed to give aid and comfort to the enemies of the united states and to the rebels now at war against the government and their aiders and abettors you are therefore hereby commanded forthwith to arrest and imprison in any fort or military prison in your command the editors proprietors and publishers of the aforesaid newspapers and all such persons as after public notice has been given of the falsehood of said publication print and publish the same with intent to give aid and comfort to the enemy and you will hold the persons so arrested in close custody until they can be brought to trial before a military commission for their offense you will also take possession by military force of the printing establishments of the new york world and journal of commerce and hold the same until further orders and prohibit any further publication therefrom   a lincoln  on the morning of may 18 3864 a forged proclamation was published in the world and journal of commerce of new york the proclamation named a day for fasting

not occurred to me i think no trouble will come of it and at all events i shall take care of it so far as in me lies as to the majorgeneralships in the regular army i think i shall not dispose of another at least until the combined operations now in progress under direction of general grant and within which yourself and command are included shall be terminated  meanwhile on behalf of yourself officers and men please accept my hearty thanks for what you and they have so far done   a lincoln     order concerning the exemption of american consuls from military service  may 19 1864  it is officially announced by the state department that citizens of the united states holding commissions and recognized as consuls of foreign powers are not by law exempt from military service if drafted  therefore the mere enrolment of a citizen holding a foreign consulate will not be held to vacate his commission but if he shall be drafted his exequatur will be revoked unless he shall have previously resigned in order that another consul may be received  an exequatur bearing date the 3d day of may 1858 having been issued to charles hunt a citizen of the united states recognizing him as a consul of belgium for st louis missouri and declaring him free to exercise and enjoy such functions powers and privileges as are allowed to the consuls of the most favored nations in the united states and the said hunt having sought to screen himself from his military duty to his country in consequence of thus being invested with the consular functions of a foreign power in the united states it is deemed advisable that the said charles hunt should no longer be permitted to continue in the exercise of said functions powers and privileges  these are therefore to declare that i no longer recognize the said hunt as consul of belgium for st louis missouri and will not permit him to exercise or enjoy any of the functions powers or privileges allowed to consuls of that nation and that i do hereby wholly revoke and annul the said exequatur heretofore given and do declare the same to be absolutely null and void from this day forward  in testimony whereof i have caused these letters to be made

transportation of the new york naval brigade  executive mansion washington may 26 1864  whom it may concern  i am again pressed with the claim of mr marshall o roberts for transportation of what was called the naval brigade from new york to fortress monroe this force was a special organization got up by one bartlett in pretended pursuance of written authority from me but in fact pursuing the authority in scarcely anything whatever the credit given him by mr roberts was given in the teeth of the express declaration that the government would not be responsible for the class of expenses to which it belonged after all some part of the transportation became useful to the government and equitably should be paid for but i have neither time nor means to ascertain this equitable amount or any appropriation to pay it with if ascertained if the quartermaster at new york can ascertain what would compensate for so much of the transportation as did result usefully to the government it might be a step towards reaching justice i write this from memory but i believe it is substantially correct   a lincoln     to p a conkling and others  executive mansion  washington june 3 1864  hon f a

lieutenantgeneral grant for his signal services was received yesterday it is impossible for me to attend i approve nevertheless of whatever may tend to strengthen and sustain general grant and the noble armies now under his direction my previous high estimate of general grant has been maintained and heightened by what has occurred in the remarkable campaign he is now conducting while the magnitude and difficulty of the task before him does not prove less than i expected he and his brave soldiers are now in the midst of their great trial and i trust that at your meeting you will so shape your good words that they may turn to men and guns moving to his and their support  yours truly   a lincoln     indorsement on a letter touching the republican national convention  june 5 1864

his renomination  june 9 1864  mr chairman and gentlemen of the committee  i will neither conceal my gratification nor restrain the expression of my gratitude that the union people through their convention in their continued effort to save and advance the nation have deemed me not unworthy to remain in my present position i know no reason to doubt that i shall accept the nomination tendered and yet perhaps i should not declare definitely before reading and considering what is called the platform i will say now however i approve the declaration in favor of so amending the constitution as to prohibit slavery throughout the nation when the people in revolt with a hundred days of explicit notice that they could within those days resume their allegiance without the overthrow of their institution and that they could not so resume it afterward elected to stand out such amendment of the constitution as now proposed became a fitting and necessary conclusion to the final success of the union cause such alone can meet and cover all cavils now the unconditional union men north and south perceive its importance and embrace it in the joint names of liberty and union let us labor to give it legal form and practical effect     platform of the union national convention held in baltimore md june 7 and 8 1864  1 resolved that it is the highest duty of every american citizen to maintain against all their enemies the integrity of the union and the paramount authority of the constitution and laws of the united states and that laying aside all differences of political opinion we pledge ourselves as union men animated by a common sentiment and aiming at a common object to do everything in our power to aid the government in quelling by force of arms the rebellion now raging against its authority and in bringing to the punishment due to their crimes the rebels and traitors arrayed against it  2 resolved that we approve the determination of the government of the united states not to compromise with rebels or to offer them any terms of peace except such as may be based upon an unconditional surrender of their hostility and a return to their just allegiance to the constitution and laws of the united states and that we call upon the government to maintain this position and to prosecute the war with the utmost possible vigor to the complete suppression of the rebellion in full reliance upon the selfsacrificing patriotism the heroic valor and the undying devotion of the american people to their country and its free institutions  3 resolved that as slavery was the cause and now constitutes the strength of this rebellion and as it must be always and everywhere hostile to the principles of republican government justice and the national safety demand its utter and complete extirpation from the soil of the republic and that while we uphold and maintain the acts and proclamations by which the government in its own defense has aimed a deathblow at this gigantic evil we are in favor furthermore of such an amendment to the constitution to be made by the people in conformity with its provisions as shall terminate and forever prohibit the existence of slavery within the limits or the jurisdiction of the united states  4 resolved that the thanks of the american people are due to the soldiers and sailors of the army and navy who have periled their lives in defense of their country and in vindication of the honor of its flag that the nation owes to them some permanent recognition of their patriotism and their valor and ample and permanent provision for those of their survivors who have received disabling and honorable wounds in the service of the country and that the memories of those who have fallen in its defense shall be held in grateful and everlasting remembrance  5 resolved that we approve and applaud the practical wisdom the unselfish patriotism and the unswerving fidelity to the constitution and the principles of american liberty with which abraham lincoln has discharged under circumstances of unparalleled difficulty the great duties and responsibilities of the presidential office that we approve and indorse as demanded by the emergency and essential to the preservation of the nation and as within the provisions of the constitution the measures and acts which he has adopted to defend the nation against its open and secret foes that we approve especially the proclamation of emancipation and the employment as union soldiers of men heretofore held in slavery and that we have full confidence in his determination to carry these and all other constitutional measures essential to the salvation of the country into full and complete effect  6 resolved that we deem it essential to the general welfare that harmony should prevail in the national councils and we regard as worthy of public confidence and official trust those only who cordially indorse the principles proclaimed in these resolutions and which should characterize the administration of the government  7 resolved that the government owes to all men employed in its armies without regard to distinction of color the full protection of the laws of war and that any violation of these laws or of the usages of civilized nations in time of war by the rebels now in arms should be made the subject of prompt and full redress  8 resolved that foreign immigration which in the past has added so much to the wealth development of resources and increase of power to this nation the asylum of the oppressed of all nations should be fostered and encouraged by a liberal and just policy  9 resolved that we are in favor of the speedy construction of the railroad to the pacific coast  10 resolved that the national faith pledged for the redemption of the public debt must be kept inviolate and that for this purpose we recommend economy and rigid responsibility in the public expenditures and a vigorous and just system of taxation and that it is the duty of every loyal state to sustain the credit and promote the use of the national currency  11 resolved that we approve the position taken by the government that the people of the united states can never regard with indifference the attempt of any european power to overthrow by force or to supplant by fraud the institutions of any republican government on the western continent and that they will view with extreme jealousy as menacing to the peace and independence of their own country the efforts of any such power to obtain new footholds for monarchical governments sustained by foreign military force in near proximity to the united states     reply to a delegation from the national union league  june 9 1864  gentlemeni can only say in response to the remarks of your chairman that i am very grateful for the renewed confidence which has been accorded to me both by the convention and by the national league i am not insensible at all to the personal compliment there is in this yet i do not allow myself to believe that any but a small portion of it is to be appropriated as a personal compliment to me the convention and the nation i am assured are alike animated by a higher view of the interests of the country for the present and the great future and the part i am entitled to appropriate as a compliment is only that part which i may lay hold of as being the opinion of the convention and of the league that i am not entirely unworthy to be intrusted with the place i have occupied for the last three years i have not permitted myself gentlemen to conclude that i am the best man in the country but i am reminded in this connection of a story of an old dutch farmer who remarked to a companion once that it was not best to swap horses when crossing a stream     reply to a delegation from ohio  june 9 1864  gentlemeni am very much obliged to you for this compliment i have just been saying and will repeat it that the hardest of all speeches i have to answer is a serenade i never know what to say on these occasions i suppose that you have done me this kindness in connection with the action of the baltimore convention which has recently taken place and with which of course i am very well satisfied what we want still more than baltimore conventions or presidential elections is success under general grant i propose that you constantly bear in mind that the support you owe to the brave officers and soldiers in the field is of the very first importance and we should therefore bend all our energies to that point now without detaining you any longer i propose that you help me to close up what i am now saying with three rousing cheers for general grant and the officers and soldiers under his command     address to the envoy from the hawaiian islands  june 11 1864  sirin every light in which the state of the hawaiian islands can be contemplated it is an object of profound interest for the united states virtually it was once a colony it is now a near and intimate neighbor it is a haven of shelter and refreshment for our merchants fishermen seamen and other citizens when on their lawful occasions they are navigating the eastern seas and oceans its people are free and its laws language and religion are largely the fruit of our own teaching and example the distinguished part which you mr minister have acted in the history of that interesting country is well known here it gives me pleasure to assure you of my sincere desire to do what i can to render now your sojourn in the united states agreeable to yourself satisfactory to your sovereign and beneficial to the hawaiian people     remarks to an ohio regiment  june 11 1864  soldiers i understand you have just come from ohio come to help us in this the nations day of trial and also of its hopes i thank you for your promptness in responding to the call for troops your services were never needed more than now i know not where you are going you may stay here and take the places of those who will be sent to the front or you may go there yourselves wherever you go i know you will do your best again i thank you goodby     telegram to general l thomas executive mansion washington june 13 1864

that this toast is intended to open the way for me to say something war at the best is terrible and this of ours in its magnitude and duration is one of the most terrible the world has ever known it has deranged business totally in many places and perhaps in all it has destroyed property destroyed life and ruined homes it has produced a national debt and a degree of taxation unprecedented in the history of this country it has caused mourning among us until the heavens may almost be said to be hung in black and yet it continues it has had accompaniments not before known in the history of the world i mean the sanitary and christian commissions with their labors for the relief of the soldiers and the volunteer refreshment saloons understood better by those who hear me than by myself and these fairs first begun at chicago and next held in boston cincinnati and other cities the motive and object that lie at the bottom of them are worthy of the most that we can do for the soldier who goes to fight the battles of his country from the fair and tender hand of women is much very much done for the soldier continually reminding him of the care and thought for him at home the knowledge that he is not forgotten is grateful to his heart another view of these institutions is worthy of thought they are voluntary contributions giving proof that the national resources are not at all exhausted and that the national patriotism will sustain us through all it is a pertinent question when is this war to end i do not wish to name the day when it will end lest the end should not come at the given time we accepted this war and did not begin it we accepted it for an object and when that object is accomplished the war will end and i hope to god that it will never end until that object is accomplished we are going through with our task so far as i am concerned if it takes us three years longer i have not been in the habit of making predictions but i am almost tempted now to hazard one i will it is that grant is this evening in a position with meade and hancock of pennsylvania whence he can never be dislodged by the enemy until richmond is taken if i shall discover that general grant may be greatly facilitated in the capture of richmond by rapidly pouring to him a large number of armed men at the briefest notice will you go will you march on with him cries of yes yes then i

gratefully accepted as the resolutions of the convention called the platform are heartily approved  while the resolution in regard to the supplanting of republican government upon the western continent is fully concurred in there might be misunderstanding were i not to say that the position of the government in relation to the action of france in mexico as assumed through the state department and indorsed by the convention among the measures and acts of the executive will be faithfully maintained so long as the state of facts shall leave that position pertinent and applicable  i

me to inform you that a rebel force variously estimated at from fifteen to twenty thousand men have invaded the state of maryland and have taken martinsburg and harpers ferry and are threatening other points that the public safety requires him to call upon the state executives for a militia force to repel this invasion he therefore directs me to call on you for a militia force of twelve thousand men from your state to serve not more than one hundred days and to request that you will with the utmost despatch forward the troops to washington by rail or steamboat as may be most expeditious  please favor me with an answer at your earliest convenience  edwin m stanton  secretary of war     proclamation suspending the writ of habeas corpus  july 5 1864  by the president of the united states  a proclamation  whereas by a proclamation which was issued on the 15th day of april 1861 the president of the united states announced and declared that the laws of the united states had been for some time past and then were opposed and the execution thereof obstructed in certain states therein mentioned by combinations too powerful to be suppressed by the ordinary course of judicial proceedings or by the power vested in the marshals by law and  whereas immediately after the issuing of the said proclamation the land and naval forces of the united states were put into activity to suppress the said insurrections and rebellion and  whereas the congress of the united states by an act approved on the third day of march 1863 did enact that during the said rebellion the president of the united states whenever in his judgment the public safety may require it is authorized to suspend the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus in any case throughout the united states or any part thereof and  whereas the said insurrection and rebellion still continue endangering the existence of the constitution and government of the united states and  whereas the military forces of the united states are now actively engaged in suppressing the said insurrection and rebellion in various parts of the states where the said rebellion has been successful in obstructing the laws and public authorities especially in the states of virginia and georgia and  whereas on the fifteenth day of september last the president of the united states duly issued his proclamation wherein he declared that the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus should be suspended throughout the united states in cases whereby the authority of the president of the united states the military naval and civil officers of the united states or any of them hold persons under their command or in their custody either as prisoners of war spies or aiders or abettors of the enemy or officers soldiers or seamen enrolled or drafted or mustered or enlisted in or belonging to the land or naval forces of the united states or as deserters therefrom or otherwise amenable to military law or the rules and articles of war or the rules and regulations prescribed for the military and naval service by authority of the president of the united states or for resisting a draft or for any other offence against the military or naval service and  whereas many citizens of the state of kentucky have joined the forces of the insurgents who have on several occasions entered the said state of kentucky in large force and not without aid and comfort furnished by disaffected and disloyal citizens of the united states residing therein have not only greatly disturbed the public peace but have overborne the civil authorities and made flagrant civil war destroying property and life in various parts of the state and  whereas it has been made known to the president of the united states by the officers commanding the national armies that combinations have been formed in the said state of kentucky with a purpose of inciting the rebel forces to renew the said operations of civil war within the said state and thereby to embarrass the united states armies now operating in the said states of virginia and georgia and even to endanger their safety  now therefore i abraham lincoln president of the united states by virtue of the authority vested in me by the constitution and laws do hereby declare that in my judgment the public safety especially requires that the suspension of the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus so proclaimed in the said proclamation of the 15th of september 1863 be made effectual and be duly enforced in and throughout the said state of kentucky and that martial law be for the present declared therein i do therefore hereby require of the military officers of the said state that the privilege of the habeas corpus be effectually suspended within the said state according to the aforesaid proclamation and that martial law be established therein to take effect from the date of this proclamation the said suspension and establishment of martial law to continue until this proclamation shall be revoked or modified but not beyond the period when the said rebellion shall have been suppressed or come to an end and i do hereby require and command as well as military officers all civil officers and authorities existing or found within the said state of kentucky to take notice of this proclamation and to give full effect to the same the martial laws herein proclaimed and the things in that respect herein ordered will not be deemed or taken to interfere with the holding of lawful elections or with the proceedings of the constitutional legislature of kentucky or with the administration of justice in the courts of law existing therein between citizens of the united states in suits or proceedings which do not affect the military operations or the constituted authorities of the government of the united states  in testimony whereof i have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the united states to be affixed  done at the city of washington this 5th day of july in the year of our lord 1864 and of the independence of the united states the eightyeighth   a lincoln by the president william h seward secretary of state     proclamation for a day of prayer july 7 1864  by the president of the united states of america  a proclamation  whereas the senate and house of representatives at their last session adopted a concurrent resolution which was approved on the second day of july instant and which was in the words following namely  that the president of the united states be requested to appoint a day of humiliation and prayer by the people of the united states that he request his constitutional advisers at the head of the executive departments to unite with him as chief magistrate of the nation at the city of washington and the members of congress and all magistrates all civil military and naval officers all soldiers sailors and marines with all loyal and lawabiding people to convene at their usual places of worship or wherever they may be to confess and to repent of their manifold sins to implore the compassion and forgiveness of the almighty that if consistent with his will the existing rebellion may be speedily suppressed and the supremacy of the constitution and laws of the united states may be established throughout all the states to implore him as the supreme ruler of the world not to destroy us as a people nor suffer us to be destroyed by the hostility or connivance of other nations or by obstinate adhesion to our own counsels which may be in conflict with his eternal purposes and to implore him to enlighten the mind of the nation to know and do his will humbly believing that it is in accordance with his will that our place should be maintained as a united people among the family of nations to implore him to grant to our armed defenders and the masses of the people that courage power of resistance and endurance necessary to secure that result to implore him in his infinite goodness to soften the hearts enlighten the minds and quicken the conscience of those in rebellion that they may lay down their arms and speedily return to their allegiance to the united states that they may not be utterly destroyed that the effusion of blood may be stayed and that unity and fraternity may be restored and peace established throughout all our borders  now therefore i abraham lincoln president of the united states cordially concurring with the congress of the united states in the penitential and pious sentiments expressed in the aforesaid resolutions and heartily approving of the devotional design and purpose thereof do hereby appoint the first thursday of august next to be observed by the people of the united states as a day of national humiliation and prayer  i do hereby further invite and request the heads of the executive departments of this government together with all legislators all judges and magistrates and all other persons exercising authority in the land whether civil military or naval and all soldiers seamen and marines in the national service and all other loyal and lawabiding people of the united states to assemble in their preferred places of public worship on that day and there to render to the almighty and merciful ruler of the universe such homage and such confessions and to offer to him such supplications as the congress of the united states have in their aforesaid resolution so solemnly so earnestly and so reverently recommended  in testimony whereof i have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the united states to be affixed done at the city of washington this seventh day of july in the year of our lord one thousand eight hundred and sixtyfour and of the independence of the united states the eightyninth   a lincoln  by the president william h seward secretary of state     proclamation concerning a bill to guarantee to certain states  whose governments have been usurped or overthrown a republican form of government and concerning reconstruction  july 8 1864  by the president of the united states  a proclamation  whereas at the late session congress passed a bill to guarantee to certain states whose governments have been usurped or overthrown a republican form of government a copy of which is hereunto annexed and  whereas the said bill was presented to the president of the united states for his approval less than one hour before the sine die adjournment of said session and was not signed by him and  whereas the said bill contains among other things a plan for restoring the states in rebellion to their proper practical relation in the union which plan expresses the sense of congress upon that subject and which plan it is now thought fit to lay before the people for their consideration  now therefore i abraham lincoln president of the united states do proclaim declare and make known that while i am as i was in december last when by proclamation i propounded a plan for restoration unprepared by a formal approval of this bill to be inflexibly committed to any single plan of restoration and while i am also unprepared to declare that the free state constitutions and governments already adopted and installed in arkansas and louisiana shall be set aside and held for naught thereby repelling and discouraging the loyal citizens who have set up the same as to further effort or to declare a constitutional competency in congress to abolish slavery in states but am at the same time sincerely hoping and expecting that a constitutional amendment abolishing slavery throughout the nation may be adopted nevertheless i am fully satisfied with the system for restoration contained in the bill as one very proper plan for the loyal people of any state choosing to adopt it and that i am and at all times shall be prepared to give the executive aid and assistance to any such people so soon as the military resistance to the united states shall have been suppressed in any such states and the people thereof shall have sufficiently returned to their obedience to the constitution and the laws of the united states in which cases militiagovernors will be appointed with directions to proceed according to the bill  in testimony whereof i have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the united states to be affixed   a lincoln  by the president william h seward secretary of state     to

about eight thousand not very reliable under howe at harpers ferry with hunter approaching that point very slowly with what number i suppose you know better than i wallace with some odds and ends and part of what came up with ricketts was so badly beaten yesterday at monocacy that what is left can attempt no more than to defend baltimore what we shall get in from pennsylvania and new york will scarcely be worth counting i fear now what i think is that you should provide to retain your hold where you are certainly and bring the rest with you personally and make a vigorous effort to destroy the enemys forces in this vicinity i think there is really a fair chance to do this if the movement is prompt this is what i think upon your suggestion and is not an order   a lincoln     telegram to

to general d hunter washington july 17 1864  majorgeneral hunter harpers ferry west va  yours of this morning received you misconceive the order you complain of was only nominally mine and was framed by those who really made it with no thought of making you a scapegoat it seemed to be general grants wish that the forces under general wright and those under you should join and drive at the enemy under general wright wright had the larger part of the force but you had the rank it was thought that you would prefer crooks commanding your part to your serving in person under wright that is all of it general grant wishes you to remain in command of the department and i do not wish to order otherwise   a lincoln     telegram to general w t sherman  executive mansion washington july 18 1864 1125 am  majorgeneral sherman chattahoochee river georgia  i have seen your despatches objecting to agents of northern states opening recruiting stations near your camps an act of congress authorizes this giving the appointment of agents to the states and not to the executive government it is not for the war department or myself to restrain or modify the law in its execution further than actual necessity may require to be candid i was for the passage of the law not apprehending at the time that it would produce such inconvenience to the armies in the field as you now cause me to fear many of the states were very anxious for it and i hoped that with their state bounties and active exertions they would get out substantial additions to our colored forces which unlike white recruits help us where they come from as well as where they go to i still hope advantage from the law and being a law it must be treated as such by all of us we here will do what we consistently can to save you from difficulties arising out of it may i ask therefore that you will give your hearty cooperation   a lincoln     announcement concerning terms of peace  executive mansion  washington july 18 1864  to

points and the bearer or bearers thereof shall have safe conduct both ways   a lincoln     proclamation calling for five hundred thousand volunteers  july 18 1864  by the president of the united states of america  a proclamation  whereas by the act approved july 4 1864 entitled an act further to regulate and provide for the enrolling and calling out the national forces and for other purposes it is provided that the president of the united states may at his discretion at any time hereafter call for any number of men as volunteers for the respective terms of one two and three years for military service and that in case the quota or any part thereof of any town township ward of a city precinct or election district or of a county not so subdivided shall not be filled within the space of fifty days after such call then the president shall immediately order a draft for one year to fill such quota or any part thereof which may be unfilled and  whereas the new enrolment heretofore ordered is so far completed as that the aforementioned act of congress may now be put in operation for recruiting and keeping up the strength of the armies in the field for garrisons and such military operations as may be required for the purpose of suppressing the rebellion and restoring the authority of the united states government in the insurgent states  now therefore i abraham lincoln president of the united states do issue this my last call for five hundred thousand volunteers for the military service provided nevertheless that this call shall be reduced by all credits which may be established under section eight of the aforesaid act on account of persons who have entered the naval service during the present rebellion and by credits for men furnished to the military service in excess of calls heretofore made volunteers will be accepted under this call for one two or three years as they may elect and will be entitled to the bounty provided by the law for the period of services for which they enlist  and i hereby proclaim order and direct that immediately after the 5th day of september 1864 being fifty days from the date of this call a draft for troops to serve for one year shall be had in every town township ward of a city precinct or election district or county not so subdivided to fill the quota which shall be assigned to it under this call or any part thereof which may be unfilled by volunteers on the said 5th day of september 1864  in testimony whereof i have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the united states to be affixed  done at the

as he will be glad to do with any other which may be tendered as this is for the purpose of taking an attitude of hostility against him  he says he was not aware that he was so much indebted to mr gibson for having accepted the office at first not remembering that he ever pressed him to do so or that he gave it otherwise than as was usual upon request made on behalf of mr gibson  he thanks mr gibson for his acknowledgment that he has been treated with personal kindness and consideration and says he knows of but two small drawbacks upon mr gibsons right to still receive such treatment one of which is that he never could learn of his giving much attention to the duties of his office and the other is this studied attempt of mr gibsons to stab him  i am very truly  your obedient servant

and yet please hear a word from us my recollection is that both general grant and yourself recommended both h ovey and o sterhaus for promotion and these with other strong recommendations drew committals from us which we could neither honorably or safely disregard we blamed h ovey for coming away in the manner in which he did but he knew he had apparent reason to feel disappointed and mortified and we felt it was not best to crush one who certainly had been a good soldier as to osterhaus we did not know of his leaving at the time we made the appointment and do not now know the terms on which he left not to have appointed him as the case appeared to us at the time would have been almost if not quite a violation of our word the word was given on what we thought was high merit and somewhat on his nationality i beg you to believe we do not act in a spirit of disregarding merit we expect to await your programme for further changes and promotions in your army my profoundest

i repeat to you it will neither be done nor attempted unless you watch it every day and hour and force it   a lincoln       here the president was mistaken in thinking that sherman      sheridan and

interview with john t mills  august 15 1864   mr president said governor randall why cant you seek seclusion and play hermit for a fortnight it would reinvigorate you  ah said the president two or three weeks would do me no good i cannot fly from my thoughtsmy solicitude for this great country follows me wherever i go i do not think it is personal vanity or ambition though i am not free from these infirmities but i cannot but feel that the weal or woe of this great nation will be decided in november there is no program offered by any wing of the democratic party but that must result in the permanent destruction of the union  but mr president general mcclellan is in favor of crushing out this rebellion by force he will be the chicago candidate  sir the slightest knowledge of arithmetic will prove to any man that the rebel armies cannot be destroyed by democratic strategy it would sacrifice all the white men of the north to do it there are now in the service of the united states nearly one hundred and fifty thousand ablebodied colored men most of them under arms defending and acquiring union territory the democratic strategy demands that these forces be disbanded and that the masters be conciliated by restoring them to slavery the black men who now assist union prisoners to escape are to be converted into our enemies in the vain hope of gaining the goodwill of their masters we shall have to fight two nations instead of one  you cannot conciliate the south if you guarantee to them ultimate success and the experience of the present war proves their success is inevitable if you fling the compulsory labor of millions of black men into their side of the scale will you give our enemies such military advantages as insure success and then depend on coaxing flattery and concession to get them back into the union abandon all the posts now garrisoned by black men take one hundred and fifty thousand men from our side and put them in the battlefield or cornfield against us and we would be compelled to abandon the war in three weeks  we have to hold territory in inclement and sickly places where are the democrats to do this it was a free fight and the field was open to the war democrats to put down this rebellion by fighting against both master and slave long before the present policy was inaugurated  there have been men base enough to propose to me to return to slavery the black warriors of port hudson and olustee and thus win the respect of the masters they fought should i do so i should deserve to be damned in time and eternity come what will i will keep my faith with friend and foe my enemies pretend i am now carrying on this war for the sole purpose of abolition so long as i am president it shall be carried on for the sole purpose of restoring the union but no human power can subdue this rebellion without the use of the emancipation policy and every other policy calculated to weaken the moral and physical forces of the rebellion  freedom has given us one hundred and fifty thousand men raised on southern soil it will give us more yet just so much it has subtracted from the enemy and instead of alienating the south there are now evidences of a fraternal feeling growing up between our men and the rank and file of the rebel soldiers let my enemies prove to the country that the destruction of slavery is not necessary to a restoration of the union i will abide the issue     endorsement of application for employment august 15 1864  i am always for the man who wishes to work and i shall be glad for this man

ohio regiment  august 18 1864  soldiersyou are about to return to your homes and your friends after having as i learn performed in camp a comparatively short term of duty in this great contest i am greatly obliged to you and to all who have come forward at the call of their country i wish it might be more generally and universally understood what the country is now engaged in we have as all will agree a free government where every man has a right to be equal with every other man in this great struggle this form of government and every form of human right is endangered if our enemies succeed there is more involved in this contest than is realized by every one there is involved in this struggle the question whether your children and my children shall enjoy the privileges we have enjoyed i say this in order to impress upon you if you are not already so impressed that no small matter should divert us from our great purpose  there may be some inequalities in the practical application of our system it is fair that each man shall pay taxes in exact proportion to the value of his property but if we should wait before collecting a tax to adjust the taxes upon each man in exact proportion with every other man we should never collect any tax at all there may be mistakes made sometimes and things may be done wrong while the officers of the government do all they can to prevent mistakes but i beg of you as citizens of this great republic not to let your minds be carried off from the great work we have before us this struggle is too large for you to be diverted from it by any small matter when you return to your homes rise up to the height of a generation of men worthy of a free government and we will carry out the great work we have commenced i return to you my sincere thanks

soldiers to impress upon them in a few brief remarks the importance of success in this contest it is not merely for the day but for all time to come that we should perpetuate for our childrens children that great and free government which we have enjoyed all our lives i beg you to remember this not merely for my sake but for yours i happen temporarily to occupy this big white house i am a living witness that any one of your children may look to come here as my fathers child has it is in order that each one of you may have through this free government which we have enjoyed an open field and a fair chance for your industry enterprise and intelligence that you may all have equal privileges in the race of life with all its desirable human aspirationsit is for this that the struggle should be maintained that we may not lose our birthrightsnot only for one but for two or three years if necessary the nation is worth fighting for to secure such an inestimable jewel     memorandum

correspondence in regard to a contemplated exchange of naval prisoners through your lines and not very distant from your headquarters it only came to the knowledge of the war department and of myself yesterday and it gives us some uneasiness i therefore send it to you with the statement that as the numbers to be exchanged under it are small and so much has already been done to effect the exchange i hope you may find it consistent to let it go forward under the general supervision of general butler and particularly in reference to the points he holds vital in exchanges still you are at liberty to arrest the whole operation if in your judgment the public good requires it  yours truly   a lincoln     indorsement on a memorandum by general mcdowell october 7 1864  i well remember the meetings herein narrated see nothing for me to object to in the narrative as being made by general mcdowell except the phrase attributed to me of the jacobinism of congress       this memorandum describes the private discussions that      preceded the transfer of mcclellans army from the potomac      where it had confronted the confederates at manassas see h      j raymond life of lincoln p 772  which phrase i do not remember using literally or in substance and which i wish not to be published in any event   a lincoln     to h w hoffman  executive mansion washington october 10 1864  hon henry w hoffman  my dear sira convention of maryland has framed a new constitution for the state a public meeting is called for this evening at baltimore to aid in securing its ratification by the people and you ask a word from me for the occasion i presume the only feature of the instrument about which there is serious controversy is that which provides for the extinction of slavery it needs not to be a secret and i presume it is no secret that i wish success to this provision i desire it on every consideration i wish all men to be free i wish the material prosperity of the already free which i feel sure the extinction of slavery would bring i wish to see in process of disappearing that only thing which ever could bring this nation to civil war i attempt no argument argument upon the question is already exhausted by the abler better informed and more immediately interested sons of maryland herself i only add that i shall be gratified exceedingly if the good people of the state shall by their votes ratify the new constitution  yours truly   a lincoln     telegram to governor curtin  war department washington d c october 10 1864 5 pm  governor curtin harrisburg pa  yours of today just this

lieutenantgeneral grant city point va  secretary of war not being in i answer yours about election pennsylvania very close and still in doubt on home vote ohio largely for us with all the members of congress but two or three indiana largely for usgovernor it is said by fifteen thousand and eight of the eleven members of congress send us what you may know of your army vote   a lincoln     response to a serenade  october 19 1864   friends and fellowcitizensi am notified that this is a compliment paid me by the loyal marylanders resident in this district i infer that the adoption of the new constitution for the state furnishes the occasion and that in your view the extirpation of slavery constitutes the chief merit of the new constitution most heartily do i congratulate you and maryland and the nation and the world upon this event i regret that it did not occur two years sooner which i am sure would have saved the nation more money than would have met all the private loss incident to the measure but it has come at last and i sincerely hope its friends may fully realize all their anticipations of good from it and that its opponents may by its effects be agreeably and profitably disappointed  a word upon another subject something said by the secretary of state in his recent speech at auburn has been construed by some into a threat that if i shall be beaten at the election i will between then and the end of my constitutional term do what i may be able to ruin the government  others regard the fact that the chicago convention adjourned not sine die but to meet again if called to do so by a particular individual as the intimation of a purpose that if their nominee shall be elected he will at once seize control of the government i hope the good people will permit themselves to suffer no uneasiness on either point i am struggling to maintain the government not to overthrow it i am struggling especially to prevent others from overthrowing it i therefore say that if i live i shall remain president until the 4th of next march and that whoever shall be constitutionally elected in november shall be duly installed as president on the 4th of march and in the interval i shall do my utmost that whoever is to hold the helm for the next voyage shall start with the best possible chance of saving the ship this is due to the people both on principle and under the constitution their will constitutionally expressed is the ultimate law for all if they should deliberately resolve to have immediate peace even at the loss of their country and their liberties i know not the power or the right to resist them it is their own business and they must do as they please with their own i believe however they are still resolved to preserve their country and their liberties and in this in office or out of it i am resolved to stand by them i may add that in this purpose to save the country and its liberties no classes of people seem so nearly unanimous as the soldiers in the field and the sailors afloat do they not have the hardest of it who should quail while they do not god bless the soldiers and seamen with all their brave commanders     proclamation of thanksgiving october 20 1864  by the president of the united states of america  a proclamation  it has pleased almighty god to prolong our national life another year defending us with his guardian care against unfriendly designs from abroad and vouchsafing to us in his mercy many and signal victories over the enemy who is of our own household it has also pleased our heavenly father to favor as well our citizens in their homes as our soldiers in their camps and our sailors on the rivers and seas with unusual health he has largely augmented our free population by emancipation and by immigration while he has opened to us new sources of wealth and has crowned the labor of our workingmen in every department of industry with abundant rewards moreover he has been pleased to animate and inspire our minds and hearts with fortitude courage and resolution sufficient for the great trial of civil war into which we have been brought by our adherence as a nation to the cause of freedom and humanity and to afford to us reasonable hopes of an ultimate and happy deliverance from all our dangers and afflictions  now therefore i abraham lincoln president of the united states do hereby appoint and set apart the last thursday in november next as a day which i desire to be observed by all my fellowcitizens wherever they may be then as a day of thanksgiving and praise to almighty god the beneficent creator and ruler of the universe and i do further recommend to my fellowcitizens aforesaid that on that occasion they do reverently humble themselves in the dust and from thence offer up penitent and fervent prayers and supplications to the great disposer of events for a return of the inestimable blessings of peace union and harmony throughout the land which it has pleased him to assign as a dwellingplace for ourselves and for our posterity throughout all generations  in testimony whereof i have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the united states to be affixed  done

manuscript with a few manuscript interlineations called a protest with your names appended thereto and accompanied by another printed paper purporting to be a proclamation by andrew johnson military governor of tennessee and also a manuscript paper purporting to be extracts from the code of tennessee were laid before me  the protest proclamation and extracts are respectively as follows  the protest is here recited and also the proclamation of governor johnson dated september 30 to which it refers together with a list of the counties in east middle and west tennessee also extracts from the code of tennessee in relation to electors of president and vicepresident qualifications of voters for members of the general assembly places of holding elections and officers of popular elections  at the time these papers were presented as before stated i had never seen either of them nor heard of the subject to which they related except in a general way one day previously  up to the present moment nothing whatever upon the subject has passed between governor johnson or any one else connected with the proclamation and myself  since receiving the papers as stated i have given the subject such brief consideration as i have been able to do in the midst of so many pressing public duties  my conclusion is that i can have nothing to do with the matter either to sustain the plan as the convention and governor johnson have initiated it or to revoke or modify it as you demand  by the constitution and laws the president is charged with no duty in the presidential election in any state nor do i in this case perceive any military reason for his interference in the matter  the movement set on foot by the convention and governor johnson does not as seems to be assumed by you emanate from the national executive  in no proper sense can it be considered other than an independent movement of at least a portion of the loyal people of tennessee  i do not perceive in the plan any menace or violence or coercion towards any one  governor johnson like any other loyal citizen of tennessee has the right to favor any political plan he chooses and as military governor it is his duty to keep peace among and for the loyal people of the state  i cannot discern that by this plan he purposes any more but you object to the plan  leaving it alone will be your perfect security against it it is not proposed to force you into it do as you please on your own account peaceably and loyally and governor johnson will not molest you but will protect you against violence as far as in his power  i presume that the conducting of a presidential election in tennessee in strict accordance with the old code of the state is not now a possibility  it is scarcely necessary to add that if any election shall be held and any votes shall be cast in the state of tennessee for president and vicepresident of the united states it will belong not to the military agents nor yet to the executive department but exclusively to another department of the government to determine whether they are entitled to be counted in conformity with the constitution and laws of the united states  except it be to give protection against violence i decline to interfere in any way with any presidential election   a lincoln    telegram to general p h sheridan executive mansion washington october 22 1864  majorgeneral

nevada into the union  october 31 1864  by the president of the united states of america  a proclamation  whereas the congress of the united states passed an act which was approved on the 21st day of march last entitled an act to enable the people of nevada to form a constitution and state government and for the admission of such state into the union on an equal footing with the original states and  whereas the said constitution and state government have been formed pursuant to the conditions prescribed by the fifth section of the act of congress aforesaid and the certificate required by the said act and also a copy of the constitution and ordinances have been submitted to the president of the united states  now therefore be it known that i abraham lincoln president of the united states in accordance with the duty imposed upon me by the act of congress aforesaid do hereby declare and proclaim that the said state of nevada is admitted into the union on an equal footing with the original states  in witness whereof i have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the united states to be affixed   a lincoln  by the president william h seward secretary of state     telegram to

before i had been informed by you that this compliment was paid me by loyal citizens of pennsylvania friendly to me i had inferred that you were of that portion of my countrymen who think that the best interests of the nation are to be subserved by the support of the present administration i do not pretend to say that you who think so embrace all the patriotism and loyalty of the country but i do believe and i trust without personal interest that the welfare of the country does require that such support and indorsement should be given  i earnestly believe that the consequences of this days work if it be as you assume and as now seems probable will be to the lasting advantage if not to the very salvation of the country i cannot at this hour say what has been the result of the election but whatever it may be i have no desire to modify this opinion that all who have labored today in behalf of the union have wrought for the best interests of the country and the world not only for the present but for all future ages  i am thankful to god for this approval of the people but while deeply grateful for this mark of their confidence in me if i know my heart my gratitude is free from any taint of personal triumph i do not impugn the motives of any one opposed to me it is no pleasure to me to triumph over any one but i give thanks to the almighty for this evidence of the peoples resolution to stand by free government and the rights of humanity     telegram to h w hoffman war department washington d c november 10 1864  h hoffman baltimore md  the maryland soldiers in the army of the potomac cast a total vote of fourteen hundred and twentyeight out of which we get eleven hundred and sixty majority this is directly from general meade and general grant   a lincoln     on democratic government  response to a serenade november 10 1864  it has long been a grave question whether any government not too strong for the liberties of its people can be strong enough to maintain its existence in great emergencies on this point the present rebellion brought our government to a severe test and a presidential election occurring in regular course during the rebellion added not a little to the strain  if the loyal people united were put to the utmost of their strength by the rebellion must they not fail when divided and partially paralyzed by a political war among themselves but the election was a necessity we cannot have free government without elections and if the election could force us to forego or postpone a national election it might fairly claim to have already conquered and ruined us the strife of the election is but human nature practically applied to the facts of the case what has occurred in this case must ever recur in similar cases human nature will not change in any future great national trial compared with the men of this we will have as weak and as strong as silly and as wise as bad and as good let us therefore study the incidents of this as philosophy to learn wisdom from and none of them as wrongs to be revenged  but the election along with its incidental and undesirable strife has done good too it has demonstrated that a peoples government can sustain a national election in the midst of a great civil war until now it has not been known to the world that this was a possibility it shows also how sound and strong we still are it shows that even among the candidates of the same party he who is most devoted to the union and most opposed to treason can receive most of the peoples votes it shows also to the extent yet known that we have more men now than we had when the war began gold is good in its place but living brave and patriotic men are better than gold  but the rebellion continues and now that the election is over may not all have a common interest to reunite in a common effort to save our common country for my own part i have striven and shall strive to avoid placing any obstacle in the way so long as i have been here i have not willingly planted a thorn in any mans bosom while i am duly sensible to the high compliment of a reelection and duly grateful as i trust to almighty god for having directed my countrymen to a right conclusion as i think for their good it adds nothing to my satisfaction that any other man may be disappointed by the result  may i ask those who have not differed with me to join with me in this same spirit towards those who have and now let me close by asking three hearty cheers for our brave soldiers and seamen and their gallant and skillful commanders     telegram to general s o burbridge washington dc november 10 1864  majorgeneral burbridge lexington ky  i have just received a telegram from governor bramlette saying general john b houston a loyal man and prominent citizen was arrested and yesterday started off by general burbridge to be sent beyond our lines by way of catlettsburg for no other offense than opposition to your reelection and i have answered him as follows below of which please take notice and report to me   a lincoln     washington dc november 10 1864 governor bramlette frankfort ky  yours of yesterday received i can scarcely believe that general john b houston has been arrested for no other offense than opposition to my reelection for if that had been deemed sufficient cause of arrest i should have heard of more than one arrest in kentucky on election day if however general houston has been arrested for no other cause than opposition to my reelection general burbridge will discharge him at once i sending him a copy of this as an order to that effect   a lincoln     to general s a hurlbut  private  executive mansion washington november 14 1864  majorgeneral hurlbut  few things since i have been here have impressed me more painfully than what for four or five months past has appeared a bitter military opposition to the new state government of louisiana i still indulged some hope that i was mistaken in the fact but copies of a correspondence on the subject between general canby and yourself and shown me today dispel that hope a very fair proportion of the people of louisiana have inaugurated a new state government making an excellent new constitutionbetter for the poor black man than we have in illinois this was done under military protection directed by me in the belief still sincerely entertained that with such a nucleus around which to build we could get the state into position again sooner than otherwise in this belief a general promise of protection and support applicable alike to louisiana and other states was given in the last annual message during the formation of the new government and constitution they were supported by nearly every loyal person and opposed by every secessionist and this support and this opposition from the respective standpoints of the parties was perfectly consistent and logical every unionist ought to wish the new government to succeed and every disunionist must desire it to fail its failure would gladden the heart of slidell in europe and of every enemy of the old flag in the world every advocate of slavery naturally desires to see blasted and crushed the liberty promised the black man by the new constitution but why general canby and general hurlbut should join on the same side is to me incomprehensible  of course in the condition of things at new orleans the military must not be thwarted by the civil authority but when the constitutional convention for what it deems a breach of privilege arrests an editor in no way connected with the military the military necessity for insulting the convention and forcibly discharging the editor is difficult to perceive neither is the military necessity for protecting the people against paying large salaries fixed by a legislature of their own choosing very apparent equally difficult to perceive is the military necessity for forcibly interposing to prevent a bank from loaning its own money to the state these things if they have occurred are at the best no better than gratuitous hostility i wish i could hope that they may be shown not to have occurred to make assurance against misunderstanding i repeat that in the existing condition of things in louisiana the military must not be thwarted by the civil authority and i add that on points of difference the commanding general must be judge and master but i also add that in the exercise of this judgment and control a purpose obvious and scarcely unavowed to transcend all military necessity in order to crush out the civil government will not be overlooked  yours truly  a lincoln     reply to maryland union committee november 17 1864  the president in reply said that he had to confess he had been duly notified of the intention to make this friendly call some days ago and in this he had had a fair opportunity afforded to be ready with a set speech but he had not prepared one being too busy for that purpose he would say however that he was gratified with the result of the presidential election he had kept as near as he could to the exercise of his best judgment for the interest of the whole country and to have the seal of approbation stamped on the course he had pursued was exceedingly grateful to his feelings he thought he could say in as large a sense as any other man that his pleasure consisted in belief that the policy he had pursued was the best if not the only one for the safety of the country  he had said before and now repeated that he indulged in no feeling of triumph over any man who thought or acted differently from himself he had no such feeling toward any living man when he thought of maryland in particular he was of the opinion that she had more than double her share in what had occurred in the recent elections the adoption of a freestate constitution was a greater thing than the part taken by the people of the state in the presidential election he would any day have stipulated to lose maryland in the presidential election to save it by the adoption of a freestate constitution because the presidential election comes every four years while that is a thing which being done cannot be undone he therefore thought that in that they had a victory for the right worth a great deal more than their part in the presidential election though of the latter he thought highly he had once before said but would say again that those who have differed with us and opposed us will see that the result of the presidential election is better for their own good than if they had been successful  thanking the committee for their compliment he brought his brief speech to a close     proclamation concerning blockade november 19 1864  by the president of the united states of america  a proclamation  whereas by my proclamation of the 19th of april 1861 it was declared that the ports of certain states including those of norfolk in the state of virginia fernandina and pensacola in the state of florida were for reasons therein set forth intended to be placed under blockade and  whereas the said ports were subsequently blockaded accordingly but having for some time past been in the military possession of the united states it is deeemd advisable that they should be opened to domestic and foreign commerce  now therefore be it known that i abraham lincoln president of the united states pursuant to the authority in me vested by the fifth section of the act of congress approved on the 13th of july 1861 entitled an act further to provide for the collection of duties on imports and for other purposes do hereby declare that the blockade of the said ports of norfolk fernandina and pensacola shall so far cease and determine from and after the first day of december next that commercial intercourse with those ports except as to persons things and information contraband of war may from that time be carried on subject to the laws of the united states to the limitations and in pursuance of the regulations which may be prescribed by the secretary of the treasury and to such military and naval regulations as are now in force or may hereafter be found necessary  in witness whereof i have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the united states to be affixed done at the city of washington this nineteenth day of november in the year of our lord one thousand eight

mother of five sons who have died gloriously on the field of battle i feel how weak and fruitless must be any words of mine which should attempt to beguile you from the grief of a loss so overwhelming but i cannot refrain from tendering to you the consolation that may be found in the thanks of the republic they died to save i pray that our heavenly father may assuage the anguish of your bereavement and leave you only the cherished memory of the loved and lost and the solemn pride that must be yours to have laid so costly a sacrifice upon the altar of freedom  yours very sincerely and

executive mansion washington dc nov 26 1864  majorgeneral rosecrans  please telegraph me briefly on what charge and evidence mrs anna b martin has been sent to the penitentiary at alton   a lincoln     memorandum  december 3 1864  on thursday of last week two ladies from tennessee came before the president asking the release of their husbands held as prisoners of war at johnsons island they were put off until friday when they came again and were again put off until saturday at each of the interviews one of the ladies urged that her husband was a religious man and on saturday the president ordered the release of the prisoners when he said to this lady you say your husband is a religious man tell him when you meet him that i say i am not much of a judge of religion but that in my opinion the religion that sets men to rebel and fight against their own government because as they think that government does not sufficiently help some men to eat their bread in the sweat of other mens faces is not the sort of religion upon which people can get to heaven   a lincoln     order concerning the steamer funayma solace  executive mansion washington december 3 1864  a war steamer called the funayma solace having been built in this country for the japanese government and at the instance of that government it is deemed to comport with the public interest in view of the unsettled condition of the relations of the united states with that empire that the steamer should not be allowed to proceed to japan if however the secretary of the navy should ascertain that the steamer is adapted to our service he is authorized to purchase her but the purchase money will be held in trust toward satisfying any valid claims which may be presented by the japanese on account of the construction of the steamer and the failure to deliver the same as above set forth   a lincoln    message to congress  washington city december 5 1864  to the senate and house of representatives  in conformity to the law of july 16 1862 i most cordially recommend that captain john a winslow united states navy receive a vote of thanks from congress for the skill and gallantry exhibited by him in the brilliant action whilst in command of the united states steamer keaysarge which led to the total destruction of the piratical craft alabama on the 19th of june 1864 a vessel superior in tonnage superior in number of guns and superior in number of crew  this recommendation is specially made in order to comply with the requirements of the ninth section of the aforesaid act which is in the following words viz  that any line officer of the navy or marine corps may be advanced one grade if upon recommendation by the president by name he receives the thanks of congress for highly distinguished conduct in conflict with the enemy or far extraordinary heroism in the line of his profession   a lincoln     message to congress  washington city december 5 1864  to the senate and house of representatives  in conformity to the law of july 16 1862 i most cordially recommend that lieutenant william b gushing united states navy receive a vote of thanks from congress for his important gallant and perilous achievement in destroying the rebel ironclad steamer albemarle on the night of the 27th of october 1864 at plymouth n c  the destruction of so formidable a vessel which had resisted the continued attacks of a number of our vessels on former occasions is an important event touching our future naval and military operations and would reflect honor on any officer and redounds to the credit of this young officer and the few brave comrades who assisted in this successful and daring undertaking  this recommendation is specially made in order to comply with the requirements of the ninth section of the aforesaid act which is in the following words namely  that any line officer of the navy or marine corps may be advanced one grade if upon recommendation of the president by name he receives the thanks of congress for highly distinguished conduct in conflict with the enemy or for extraordinary heroism in the line of his profession   a lincoln     annual message to congress  december 6 1864  fellowcitizens of the senate and house of representatives  again the blessings of health and abundant harvests claim our profoundest gratitude to almighty god  the condition of our foreign affairs is reasonably satisfactory  mexico continues to be a theater of civil war while our political relations with that country have undergone no change we have at the same time strictly maintained neutrality between the belligerents  at the request of the states of costa rica and nicaragua a competent engineer has been authorized to make a survey of the river san juan and the port of san juan it is a source of much satisfaction that the difficulties which for a moment excited some political apprehensions and caused a closing of the interoceanic transit route have been amicably adjusted and that there is a good prospect that the route will soon be reopened with an increase of capacity and adaptation we could not exaggerate either the commercial or the political importance of that great improvement  it would be doing injustice to an important south american state not to acknowledge the directness frankness and cordiality with which the united states of colombia have entered into intimate relations with this government a claims convention has been constituted to complete the unfinished work of the one which closed its session in 1861  the new liberal constitution of venezuela having gone into effect with the universal acquiescence of the people the government under it has been recognized and diplomatic intercourse with it has opened in a cordial and friendly spirit the longdeferred aves island claim has been satisfactorily paid and discharged  mutual payments have been made of the claims awarded by the late joint commission for the settlement of claims between the united states and peru an earnest and cordial friendship continues to exist between the two countries and such efforts as were in my power have been used to remove misunderstanding and avert a threatened war between peru and spain  our relations are of the most friendly nature with chile the argentine republic bolivia costa rica paraguay san salvador and haiti  during the past year no differences of any kind have arisen with any of these republics and on the other hand their sympathies with the united states are constantly expressed with cordiality and earnestness  the claim arising from the seizure of the cargo of the brig macedonian in 1821 has been paid in full by the government of chile  civil war continues in the spanish part of san domingo apparently without prospect of an early close  official correspondence has been freely opened with liberia and it gives us a pleasing view of social and political progress in that republic it may be expected to derive new vigor from american influence improved by the rapid disappearance of slavery in the united states  i solicit your authority to furnish to the republic a gunboat at moderate cost to be reimbursed to the united states by instalments such a vessel is needed for the safety of that state against the native african races and in liberian hands it would be more effective in arresting the african slavetrade than a squadron in our own hands the possession of the least organized naval force would stimulate a generous ambition in the republic and the confidence which we should manifest by furnishing it would win forbearance and favor toward the colony from all civilized nations  the proposed overland telegraph between america and europe by the way of bering straits and asiatic russia which was sanctioned by congress at the last session has been undertaken under very favorable circumstances by an association of american citizens with the cordial goodwill and support as well of this government as of those of great britain and russia assurances have been received from most of the south american states of their high appreciation of the enterprise and their readiness to cooperate in constructing lines tributary to that worldencircling communication i learn with much satisfaction that the noble design of a telegraphic communication between the eastern coast of america and great britain has been renewed with full expectation of its early accomplishment  thus it is hoped that with the return of domestic peace the country will be able to resume with energy and advantage its former high career of commerce and civilization  our very popular and estimable representative in egypt died in april last an unpleasant altercation which arose between the temporary incumbent of the office and the government of the pasha resulted in a suspension of intercourse the evil was promptly corrected on the arrival of the successor in the consulate and our relations with egypt as well as our relations with the barbary powers are entirely satisfactory  the rebellion which has so long been flagrant in china has at last been suppressed with the cooperating good offices of this government and of the other western commercial states the judicial consular establishment there has become very difficult and onerous and it will need legislative revision to adapt it to the extension of our commerce and to the more intimate intercourse which has been instituted with the government and people of that vast empire china seems to be accepting with hearty goodwill the conventional laws which regulate commercial and social intercourse among the western nations  owing to the peculiar situation of japan and the anomalous form of its government the action of that empire in performing treaty stipulations is inconstant and capricious nevertheless good progress has been effected by the western powers moving with enlightened concert our own pecuniary claims have been allowed or put in course of settlement and the inland sea has been reopened to commerce there is reason also to believe that these proceedings have increased rather than diminished the friendship of japan toward the united states  the ports of norfolk fernandina and pensacola have been opened by proclamation it is hoped that foreign merchants will now consider whether it is not safer and more profitable to themselves as well as just to the united states to resort to these and other open ports than it is to pursue through many hazards and at vast cost a contraband trade with other ports which are closed if not by actual military occupation at least by a lawful and effective blockade  for myself i have no doubt of the power and duty of the executive under the law of nations to exclude enemies of the human race from an asylum in the united states if congress should think that proceedings in such cases lack the authority of law or ought to be further regulated by it i recommend that provision be made for effectually preventing foreign slave traders from acquiring domicile and facilities for their criminal occupation in our country  it is possible that if it were a new and open question the maritime powers with the lights they now enjoy would not concede the privileges of a naval belligerent to the insurgents of the united states destitute as they are and always have been equally of ships of war and of ports and harbors disloyal emissaries have been neither assiduous nor more successful during the last year than they were before that time in their efforts under favor of that privilege to embroil our country in foreign wars the desire and determination of the governments of the maritime states to defeat that design are believed to be as sincere as and can not be more earnest than our own nevertheless unforeseen political difficulties have arisen especially in brazilian and british ports and on the northern boundary of the united states which have required and are likely to continue to require the practice of constant vigilance and a just and conciliatory spirit on the part of the united states as well as of the nations concerned and their governments  commissioners have been appointed under the treaty with great britain on the adjustment of the claims of the hudson bay and puget sound agricultural companies in oregon and are now proceeding to the execution of the trust assigned to them  in view of the insecurity of life and property in the region adjacent to the canadian border by reason of recent assaults and depredations committed by inimical and desperate persons who are harbored there it has been thought proper to give notice that after the expiration of six months the period conditionally stipulated in the existing arrangement with great britain the united states must hold themselves at liberty to increase their naval armament upon the lakes if they shall find that proceeding necessary the condition of the border will necessarily come into consideration in connection with the question of continuing or modifying the rights of transit from canada through the united states as well as the regulation of imposts which were temporarily established by the reciprocity treaty of the 5th june 1854  i desire however to be understood while making this statement that the colonial authorities of canada are not deemed to be intentionally unjust or unfriendly toward the united states but on the contrary there is every reason to expect that with the approval of the imperial government they will take the necessary measures to prevent new incursions across the border  the act passed at the last session for the encouragement of immigration has so far as was possible been put into operation it seems to need amendment which will enable the officers of the government to prevent the practice of frauds against the immigrants while on their way and on their arrival in the ports so as to secure them here a free choice of avocations and places of settlement a liberal disposition toward this great national policy is manifested by most of the european states and ought to be reciprocated on our part by giving the immigrants effective national protection i regard our immigrants as one of the principal replenishing streams which are appointed by providence to repair the ravages of internal war and its wastes of national strength and health all that is necessary is to secure the flow of that stream in its present fullness and to that end the government must in every way make it manifest that it neither needs nor designs to impose involuntary military service upon those who come from other lands to cast their lot in our country the financial affairs of the government have been successfully administered during the last year the legislation of the last session of congress has beneficially affected the revenues although sufficient time has not yet elapsed to experience the full effect of several of the provisions of the acts of congress imposing increased taxation  the receipts during the year from all sources upon the basis of warrants signed by the secretary of the treasury including loans and the balance in the treasury on the 1st day of july 1863 were 139419600762 and the aggregate disbursements upon the same basis were 129805610189 leaving a balance in the treasury as shown by warrants of 9673990573  deduct from these amounts the amount of the principal of the public debt redeemed and the amount of issues in substitution therefor and the actual cash operations of the treasury were receipts 88407664657 disbursements 86523408786 which leaves a cash balance in the treasury of 1884255871  of the receipts there were derived from customs 10231615299 from lands 58833329 from direct taxes 47564896 from internal revenue 10974113410 from miscellaneous sources 4751144810 and from loans applied to actual expenditures including former balance 62344392913  there were disbursed for the civil service 2750559946 for pensions and indians 751793097 for the war department 69079184297 for the navy department 8573329277 for interest on the public debt 5368542169 making an aggregate of 86523408786 and leaving a balance in the treasury of 1884255871 as before stated  for the actual receipts and disbursements for the first quarter and the estimated receipts and disbursements for the three remaining quarters of the current fiscal year and the general operations of the treasury in detail i refer you to the report of the secretary of the treasury i concur with him in the opinion that the proportion of moneys required to meet the expenses consequent upon the war derived from taxation should be still further increased and i earnestly invite your attention to this subject to the end that there be such additional legislation as shall be required to meet the just expectations of the secretary  the public debt on the first day of july last as appears by the books of the treasury amounted to 174069048949 probably should the war continue for another year that amount may be increased by not far from 500000000 held as it is for the most part by our own people it has become a substantial branch of national though private property for obvious reasons the more nearly this property can be distributed among all the people the better to favor such general distribution greater inducements to become owners might perhaps with good effect and without injury be presented to persons of limited means with this view i suggest whether it might not be both competent and expedient for congress to provide that a limited amount of some future issue of public securities might be held by any bona fide purchaser exempt from taxation and from seizure for debt under such restrictions and limitations as might be necessary to guard against abuse of so important a privilege this would enable every prudent person to set aside a small annuity against a possible day of want  privileges like these would render the possession of such securities to the amount limited most desirable to every person of small means who might be able to save enough for the purpose the great advantage of citizens being creditors as well as debtors with relation to the public debt is obvious men readily perceive that they can not be much oppressed by a debt which they owe to themselves  the public debt on the first day of july last although somewhat exceeding the estimate of the secretary of the treasury made to congress at the commencement of the last session falls short of the estimate of that officer made in the preceding december as to its probable amount at the beginning of this year by the sum of 399509731 this fact exhibits a satisfactory condition and conduct of the operations of the treasury  the national banking system is proving to be acceptable to capitalists and to the people on the twentyfifth day of november five hundred and eightyfour national banks had been organized a considerable number of which were conversions from state banks changes from state systems to the national system are rapidly taking place and it is hoped that very soon there will be in the united states no banks of issue not authorized by congress and no banknote circulation not secured by the government that the government and the people will derive great benefit from this change in the banking systems of the country can hardly be questioned the national system will create a reliable and permanent influence in support of the national credit and protect the people against losses in the use of paper money whether or not any further legislation is advisable for the suppression of statebank issues it will be for congress to determine it seems quite clear that the treasury can not be satisfactorily conducted unless the government can exercise a restraining power over the banknote circulation of the country  the report of the secretary of war and the accompanying documents will detail the campaigns of the armies in the field since the date of the last annual message and also the operations of the several administrative bureaus of the war department during the last year it will also specify the measures deemed essential for the national defense and to keep up and supply the requisite military force  the report of the secretary of the navy presents a comprehensive and satisfactory exhibit of the affairs of that department and of the naval service it is a subject of congratulation and laudable pride to our countrymen that a navy of such vast proportions has been organized in so brief a period and conducted with so much efficiency and success  the general exhibit of the navy including vessels under construction on the first of december 1864 shows a total of 671 vessels carrying 4610 guns and of 510396 tons being an actual increase during the year over and above all losses by shipwreck or in battle of 83 vessels 167 guns and 42427 tons  the total number of men at this time in the naval service including officers is about 51000  there have been captured by the navy during the year 324 vessels and the whole number of naval captures since hostilities commenced is 1379 of which 267 are steamers  the gross proceeds arising from the sale of condemned prize property thus far reported amount to 1436925051 a large amount of such proceeds is still under adjudication and yet to be reported  the total expenditure of the navy department of every description including the cost of the immense squadrons that have been called into existence from the fourth of march 1861 to the first of november 1864 is 23864726235  your favorable consideration is invited to the various recommendations of the secretary of the navy especially in regard to a navyyard and suitable establishment for the construction and repair of iron vessels and the machinery and armature for our ships to which reference was made in my last annual message  your attention is also invited to the views expressed in the report in relation to the legislation of congress at its last session in respect to prize on our inland waters  i cordially concur in the recommendation of the secretary as to the propriety of creating the new rank of viceadmiral in our naval service  your attention is invited to the report of the postmastergeneral for a detailed account of the operations and financial condition of the postoffice department  the postal revenues for the year ending june 30 1864 amounted to 1243825378 and the expenditures to 1264478620 the excess of expenditures over receipts being 20653242  the views presented by the postmastergeneral on the subject of special grants by the government in aid of the establishment of new lines of ocean mail steamships and the policy he recommends for the development of increased commercial intercourse with adjacent and neighboring countries should receive the careful consideration of congress  it is of noteworthy interest that the steady expansion of population improvement and governmental institutions over the new and unoccupied portions of our country have scarcely been checked much less impeded or destroyed by our great civil war which at first glance would seem to have absorbed almost the entire energies of the nation  the organization and admission of the state of nevada has been completed in conformity with law and thus our excellent system is firmly established in the mountains which once seemed a barren and uninhabitable waste between the atlantic states and those which have grown up on the coast of the pacific ocean  the territories of the union are generally in a condition of prosperity and rapid growth idaho and montana by reason of their great distance and the interruption of communication with them by indian hostilities have been only partially organized but it is understood that these difficulties are about to disappear which will permit their governments like those of the others to go into speedy and full operation  as intimately connected with and promotive of this material growth of the nation i ask the attention of congress to the valuable information and important recommendations relating to the public lands indian affairs the pacific railroad and mineral discoveries contained in the report of the secretary of the interior which is herewith transmitted and which report also embraces the subjects of patents pensions and other topics of public interest pertaining to his department  the quantity of public land disposed of during the five quarters ending on the thirtieth of september last was 4221342 acres of which 1538614 acres were entered under the homestead law the remainder was located with military land warrants agricultural scrip certified to states for railroads and sold for cash the cash received from sales and location fees was 1019446  the income from sales during the fiscal year ending june 30 1864 was 67800721 against 13607795 received during the preceding year the aggregate number of acres surveyed during the year has been equal to the quantity disposed of and there is open to settlement about 133000000 acres of surveyed land  the great enterprise of connecting the atlantic with the pacific states by railways and telegraph lines has been entered upon with a vigor that gives assurance of success notwithstanding the embarrassments arising from the prevailing high prices of materials and labor the route of the main line of the road has been definitely located for one hundred miles westward from the initial point at omaha city nebraska and a preliminary location of the pacific railroad of california has been made from sacramento eastward to the great bend of the truckee river in nevada  numerous discoveries of gold silver and cinnabar mines have been added to the many heretofore known and the country occupied by the sierra nevada and rocky mountains and the subordinate ranges now teems with enterprising labor which is richly remunerative it is believed that the produce of the mines of precious metals in that region has during the year reached if not exceeded 100000000 in value  it was recommended in my last annual message that our indian system be remodeled congress at its last session acting upon the recommendation did provide for reorganizing the system in california and it is believed that under the present organization the management of the indians there will be attended with reasonable success much yet remains to be done to provide for the proper government of the indians in other parts of the country to render it secure for the advancing settler and to provide for the welfare of the indian the secretary reiterates his recommendations and to them the attention of congress is invited   the liberal provisions made by congress for paying pensions to invalid soldiers and sailors of the republic and to the widows orphans and dependent mothers of those who have fallen in battle or died of disease contracted or of wounds received in the service of their country have been diligently administered there have been added to the pension rolls during the year ending the 30th day of june last the names of 16770 invalid soldiers and of 271 disabled seamen making the present number of army invalid pensioners 22767 and of navy invalid pensioners 712  of widows orphans and mothers 22198 have been placed on the army pension rolls and 248 on the navy rolls the present number of army pensioners of this class is 25433 and of navy pensioners 793 at the beginning of the year the number of revolutionary pensioners was 1430 only twelve of them were soldiers of whom seven have since died the remainder are those who under the law receive pensions because of relationship to revolutionary soldiers during the year ending the thirtieth of june 1864 450461692 have been paid to pensioners of all classes  i cheerfully commend to your continued patronage the benevolent institutions of the district of columbia which have hitherto been established or fostered by congress and respectfully refer for information concerning them and in relation to the washington aqueduct the capitol and other matters of local interest to the report of the secretary  the agricultural department under the supervision of its present energetic and faithful head is rapidly commending itself to the great and vital interest it was created to advance it is peculiarly the peoples department in which they feel more directly concerned than in any other i commend it to the continued attention and fostering care of congress  the war continues since the last annual message all the important lines and positions then occupied by our forces have been maintained and our arms have steadily advanced thus liberating the regions left in rear so that missouri kentucky tennessee and parts of other states have again produced reasonably fair crops  the most remarkable feature in the military operations of the year is general shermans attempted march of three hundred miles directly through the insurgent region it tends to show a great increase of our relative strength that our generalinchief should feel able to confront and hold in check every active force of the enemy and yet to detach a wellappointed large army to move on such an expedition the result not yet being known conjecture in regard to it is not here indulged  important movements have also occurred during the year to the effect of molding society for durability in the union although short of complete success it is much in the right direction that twelve thousand citizens in each of the states of arkansas and louisiana have organized loyal state governments with free constitutions and are earnestly struggling to maintain and administer them the movements in the same direction more extensive though less definite in missouri kentucky and tennessee should not be overlooked but maryland presents the example of complete success maryland is secure to liberty and union for all the future the genius of rebellion will no more claim maryland like another foul spirit being driven out it may seek to tear her but it will woo her no more  at the last session of congress a proposed amendment of the constitution abolishing slavery throughout the united states passed the senate but failed for lack of the requisite twothirds vote in the house of representatives although the present is the same congress and nearly the same members and without questioning the wisdom or patriotism of those who stood in opposition i venture to recommend the reconsideration and passage of the measure at the present session of course the abstract question is not changed but an intervening election shows almost certainly that the next congress will pass the measure if this does not hence there is only a question of time as to when the proposed amendment will go to the states for their action and as it is to so go at all events may we not agree that the sooner the better it is not claimed that the election has imposed a duty on members to change their views or their votes any further than as an additional element to be considered their judgment may be affected by it it is the voice of the people now for the first time heard upon the question in a great national crisis like ours unanimity of action among those seeking a common end is very desirable almost indispensable and yet no approach to such unanimity is attainable unless some deference shall be paid to the will of the majority simply because it is the will of the majority in this case the common end is the maintenance of the union and among the means to secure that end such will through the election is most clearly declared in favor of such constitutional amendment  the most reliable indication of public purpose in this country is derived through our popular elections judging by the recent canvass and its result the purpose of the people within the loyal states to maintain the integrity of the union was never more firm nor more nearly unanimous than now the extraordinary calmness and good order with which the millions of voters met and mingled at the polls give strong assurance of this not only all those who supported the union ticket so called but a great majority of the opposing party also may be fairly claimed to entertain and to be actuated by the same purpose it is an unanswerable argument to this effect that no candidate for any office whatever high or low has ventured to seek votes on the avowal that he was for giving up the union there have been much impugning of motives and much heated controversy as to the proper means and best mode of advancing the union cause but on the distinct issue of union or no union the politicians have shown their instinctive knowledge that there is no diversity among the people in affording the people the fair opportunity of showing one to another and to the world this firmness and unanimity of purpose the election has been of vast value to the national cause  the election has exhibited another fact not less valuable to be knownthe fact that we do not approach exhaustion in the most important branch of national resources that of living men while it is melancholy to reflect that the war has filled so many graves and carried mourning to so many hearts it is some relief to know that compared with the surviving the fallen have been so few while corps and divisions and brigades and regiments have formed and fought and dwindled and gone out of existence a great majority of the men who composed them are still living the same is true of the naval service the election returns prove this so many voters could not else be found the states regularly holding elections both now and four years ago to wit california connecticut delaware illinois indiana iowa kentucky maine maryland massachusetts michigan minnesota missouri new hampshire new jersey new york ohio oregon pennsylvania rhode island vermont west virginia and wisconsin cast 3982011 votes now against 3870222 cast then showing an aggregate now of 3982011 to this is to be added 33762 cast now in the new states of kansas and nevada which states did not vote in 1860 thus swelling the aggregate to 4015773 and the net increase during the three years and a half of war to 145551 a table is appended showing particulars to this again should be added the number of all soldiers in the field from massachusetts rhode island new jersey delaware indiana illinois and california who by the laws of those states could not vote away from their homes and which number can not be less than 90000 nor yet is this all the number in organized territories is triple now what it was four years agowhile thousands white and black join us as the national arms press back the insurgent lines so much is shown affirmatively and negatively by the election it is not material to inquire how the increase has been produced or to show that it would have been greater but for the war which is probably true the important fact remains demonstrated that we have more men now than we had when the war began that we are not exhausted nor in process of exhaustion that we are gaining strength and may if need be maintain the contest indefinitely this sentence recognizes the concern of a guerilla war after the main war finishedthis as to men material resources are now more complete and abundant than ever  the national resources then are unexhausted and as we believe inexhaustible the public purpose to reestablish and maintain the national authority is unchanged and as we believe unchangeable the manner of continuing the effort remains to choose on careful consideration of all the evidence accessible it seems to me that no attempt at negotiation with the insurgent leader could result in any good he would accept nothing short of severance of the union precisely what we will not and can not give his declarations to this effect are explicit and oft repeated he does not attempt to deceive us he affords us no excuse to deceive ourselves he can not voluntarily reaccept the union we can not voluntarily yield it between him and us the issue is distinct simple and inflexible it is an issue which can only be tried by war and decided by victory if we yield we are beaten if the southern people fail him he is beaten either way it would be the victory and defeat following war what is true however of him who heads the insurgent cause is not necessarily true of those who follow although he can not reaccept the union they can some of them we know already desire peace and reunion the number of such may increase they can at any moment have peace simply by laying down their arms and submitting to the national authority under the constitution after so much the government could not if it would maintain war against them the loyal people would not sustain or allow it if questions should remain we would adjust them by the peaceful means of legislation conference courts and votes operating only in constitutional and lawful channels some certain and other possible questions are and would be beyond the executive power to adjust as for instance the admission of members into congress and whatever might require the appropriation of money the executive power itself would be greatly diminished by the cessation of actual war pardons and remissions of forfeitures however would still be within executive control in what spirit and temper this control would be exercised can be fairly judged of by the past  a year ago general pardon and amnesty upon specified terms were offered to all except certain designated classes and it was at the same time made known that the excepted classes were still within contemplation of special clemency during the year many availed themselves of the general provision and many more would only that the signs of bad faith in some led to such precautionary measures as rendered the practical process less easy and certain during the same time also special pardons have been granted to individuals of the excepted classes and no voluntary application has been denied thus practically the door has been for a full year open to all except such as were not in condition to make free choice that is such as were in custody or under constraint it is still so open to all but the time may come probably will come when public duty shall demand that it be closed and that in lieu more rigorous measures than heretofore shall be adopted  in presenting the abandonment of armed resistance to the national authority on the part of the insurgents as the only indispensable condition to ending the war on the part of the government i retract nothing heretofore said as to slavery i repeat the declaration made a year ago that while i remain in my present position i shall not attempt to retract or modify the emancipation proclamation nor shall i return to slavery any person who is free by the terms of that proclamation or by any of the acts of congress if the people should by whatever mode or means make it an executive duty to reenslave such persons another and not i must be their instrument to perform it  in stating a single condition of peace i mean simply to say that the war will cease on the part of the government whenever it shall have ceased on the part of those who began it   a lincoln     response to a serenade december 6 1864  friends and fellowcitizensi believe i shall never be old enough to speak without

may at his discretion at any time hereafter call for any number of men as volunteers for the respective terms of one two and three years for military service and that in case the quota or any part thereof of any town township ward of a city precinct or election district or of any country not so subdivided shall not be filled within the space of fifty days after such call then the president shall immediately order a draft for one year to fill such quota or any part thereof which may be unfilled and  whereas by the credits allowed in accordance with the act of congress on the call for 500000 men made july 18 1864 the number of men to be obtained under that call was reduced to 280000 and  whereas the operations of the enemy in certain states have rendered it impracticable to procure from them their full quotas of troops under said call and  whereas from the foregoing causes but 240000 men have been put into the army navy and marine corps under the said call of july 18 1864

not assume to definitely consummate anything  yours etc   a lincoln     constitutional amendment for the abolishing of slavery  passage through congress of the constitutional amendment for the abolishing of slavery  response to a serenade january 31 1865  he supposed the passage through congress of the constitutional amendment for the abolishing of slavery throughout the united states was the occasion to which he was indebted for the honor of this call  the occasion was one of congratulation to the country and to the whole world but there is a task yet before usto go forward and consummate by the votes of the states that which congress so nobly began yesterday he had the honor to inform those present that illinois had already done the work maryland was about half through but he felt proud that illinois was a little ahead  he thought this measure was a very fitting if not an indispensable adjunct to the winding up of the great difficulty he wished the reunion of all the states perfected and so effected as to remove all causes of disturbance in the future and to attain this end it was necessary that the original disturbing cause should if possible be rooted out he thought all would bear him witness that he had never shirked from doing all that he could to eradicate slavery by issuing an emancipation proclamation but that proclamation falls short of what the amendment will be when fully consummated a question might be raised whether the proclamation was legally valid it might be added that it only aided those who came into our lines and that it was inoperative as to those who did not give themselves up or that it would have no effect upon the children of the slaves born hereafter in fact it would be urged that it did not meet the evil but this amendment is a kings cure for all evils it winds the whole thing up he would repeat that it was the fitting if not the indispensable adjunct to the consummation of the great game we are playing he could not but congratulate all presenthimself the country and the whole world upon this great moral victory     telegram to general u s grant washington february 1 1865  lieutenantgeneral grant city

armies now in order to determine all controversies in respect thereto and to avoid any delay in filling up the armies it is ordered  1 that the attorneygeneral brigadiergeneral richard delafield and colonel c w foster be and they are hereby constituted a board to examine into the proper quotas and credits of the respective states and districts under the call of december 19 1864 with directions if any errors be found therein to make such corrections as the law and facts may require and report their determination to the provostmarshalgeneral the determination of said board to be final and conclusive and the draft to be made in conformity therewith  2 the provostmarshalgeneral is ordered to make the draft in the respective districts as speedily as the same can be done after the fifteenth of this month   a lincoln     to provostmarshalgeneral  executive mansion washington february 6 1865  provostmarshalgeneral  these gentlemen distinctly say to me this morning that what they want is the means from your office of showing their people that the quota assigned to them is right they think it will take but little timetwo hours they say please give there double the time and every facility you can  yours truly   a lincoln    february 6 1865  the provostmarshal brings this letter back to me and says he cannot give the facility required without detriment to the service and thereupon he is excused from doing it   a lincoln     telegram to lieutenantcolonel glenn  executive mansion washington february 7 1865  lieutenantcolonel glenn commanding post at henderson ky  complaint is made to me that you are forcing negroes into the military service and even torturing themriding them on rails and the like to extort their consent i hope this may be a mistake the like must not be done by you or any one under you you must not force negroes any more than white men answer me on this   a lincoln     to governor smith  executive mansion washington february 8 1865  his excellency governor smith of vermont  complaint is made to me by vermont that the assignment of her quota for the draft on the pending call is intrinsically unjust and also in bad faith of the governments promise to fairly allow credits for men previously furnished to illustrate a supposed case is stated as follows  vermont and new hampshire must between them furnish six thousand men on the pending call and being equal each must furnish as many as the other in the long run but the government finds that on former calls vermont furnished a surplus of five hundred and new hampshire a surplus of fifteen hundred these two surpluses making two thousand and added to the six thousand making eight thousand to be furnished by the two states or four thousand each less by fair credits then subtract vermonts surplus of five hundred from her four thousand leaves three thousand five hundred as her quota on the pending call and likewise subtract new hampshires surplus of fifteen hundred from her four thousand leaves two thousand five hundred as her quota on the pending call these three thousand five hundred and two thousand five hundred make precisely six thousand which the supposed case requires from the two states and it is just equal for vermont to furnish one thousand more now than new hampshire because new hampshire has heretofore furnished one thousand more than vermont which equalizes the burdens of the two in the long run and this result so far from being bad faith to vermont is indispensable to keeping good faith with new hampshire by no other result can the six thousand men be obtained from the two states and at the same time deal justly and keep faith with both and we do but confuse ourselves in questioning the process by which the right result is reached the supposed case is perfect as an illustration  the pending call is not for three hundred thousand men subject to fair credits but is for three hundred thousand remaining after all fair credits have been deducted and it is impossible to concede what vermont asks without coming out short of three hundred thousand men or making other localities pay for the partiality shown her  this upon the case stated if there be different reasons for making an allowance to vermont let them be presented and considered  yours truly   a lincoln     message to congress  executive mansion february 8 1865  to the honorable the senate and house of representatives  the joint resolution entitled joint resolution declaring certain states not entitled to representation in the electoral college has been signed by the executive in deference to the view of congress implied in its passage and presentation to him in his own view however the two houses of congress convened under the twelfth article of the constitution have complete power to exclude from counting all electoral votes deemed by them to be illegal and it is not competent for the executive to defeat or obstruct that power by a veto as would be the case if his action were at all essential in the matter he disclaims all right of the executive to interfere in any way in the matter of canvassing or counting electoral votes and he also disclaims that by signing said resolution he has expressed any opinion on the recitals of the preamble or any judgment of his own upon the subject of the resolution   a lincoln     telegram to general

agreed upon and we are prepared to receive or to submit propositions which may possibly lead to the attainment of that end  very respectfully yours       alexander h stephens      r m t hunter      john a campbell   a note of these gentlemen subsequently addressed to general grant has already been given in major eckerts despatch of the 1st instant  i also here saw for the first time the following note addressed by the richmond gentlemen to major eckert  city point va february 2 1865 thomas t eckert major and aiddecamp majorin reply to your verbal statement that your instructions did not allow you to alter the conditions upon which a passport could be given to us we say that we are willing to proceed to fortress monroe and there to have an informal conference with any person or persons that president lincoln may appoint on the basis of his letter to francis p blair of the 18th of january ultimo or upon any other terms or conditions that he may hereafter propose not inconsistent with the essential principles of selfgovernment and popular rights upon which our institutions are founded  it is our earnest wish to ascertain after a free interchange of ideas and information upon what principles and terms if any a just and honorable peace can be established without the further effusion of blood and to contribute our utmost efforts to accomplish such a result  we think it better to add that in accepting your passport we are not to be understood as committing ourselves to anything but to carry to this informal conference the views and feelings above expressed  very respectfully yours etc  alexander h stephens j a campbell r m t hunter   notethe above communication was delivered to me at fort monroe at 430 pm february 2 by lieutenantcolonel babcock of general grants staff  thomas t eckert major and aiddecamp   on the morning of the third the three gentlemen messrs stephens hunter and campbell came aboard of our steamer and had an interview with the secretary of state and myself of several hours duration no question of preliminaries to the meeting was then and there made or mentioned no other person was present no papers were exchanged or produced and it was in advance agreed that the conversation was to be informal and verbal merely on our part the whole substance of the instructions to the secretary of state hereinbefore recited was stated and insisted upon and nothing was said inconsistent therewith while by the other party it was not said that in any event or on any condition they ever would consent to reunion and yet they equally omitted to declare that they never would consent they seemed to desire a postponement of that question and the adoption of some other course first which as some of them seemed to argue might or might not lead to reunion but which course we thought would amount to an indefinite postponement the conference ended without result  the foregoing containing as is believed all the information sought is respectfully submitted   a lincoln     message to the senate washington february 10 1865  to the senate of the united states  in answer to the resolution of the senate of the eighth instant requesting information concerning recent conversations or communications with insurgents under executive sanction i transmit a report from the secretary of state to whom the resolution was referred   a lincoln   to the president  the secretary of state to whom was referred a resolution of the senate of the 8th instant requesting the president of the united states if in his opinion not incompatible with the public interests to furnish to the senate any information in his possession concerning recent conversations or communications with certain rebels said to have taken place under executive sanction including communications with the rebel jefferson davis and any correspondence relating thereto has the honor to report that the senate may properly be referred to a special message of the president bearing upon the subject of the resolution and transmitted to the house this day appended to this report is a copy of an instruction which has been addressed to charles francis adams esq envoy extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary of the united states at london and which is the only correspondence found in this department touching the subject referred to in the resolution  respectfully submitted  william h seward  department of state washington february 10 1865     mr seward to mr adams  extract no 1258  department of state washington february 71865  on the morning of the 3d the president attended by the secretary received messrs stephens hunter and campbell on board the united states steam transport river queen in hampton roads the conference was altogether informal there was no attendance of secretaries clerks or other witnesses nothing was written or read the conversation although earnest and free was calm and courteous and kind on both sides the richmond party approached the discussion rather indirectly and at no time did they either make categorical demands or tender formal stipulations or absolute refusals nevertheless during the conference which lasted four hours the several points at issue between the government and the insurgents were distinctly raised and discussed fully intelligently and in an amicable spirit what the insurgent party seemed chiefly to favor was a postponement of the question of separation upon which the war is waged and a mutual direction of efforts of the government as well as those of the insurgents to some extrinsic policy or scheme for a season during which passions might be expected to subside and the armies be reduced and trade and intercourse between the people of both sections resumed it was suggested by them that through such postponement we might now have immediate peace with some not very certain prospect of an ultimate satisfactory adjustment of political relations between this government and the states section or people now engaged in conflict with it  this suggestion though deliberately considered was nevertheless regarded by the president as one of armistice or truce and he announced that we can agree to no cessation or suspension of hostilities except on the basis of the disbandment of the insurgent forces and the restoration of the national authority throughout all the states in the union collaterally and in subordination to the proposition which was thus announced the antislavery policy of the united states was reviewed in all its bearings and the president announced that he must not be expected to depart from the positions he had heretofore assumed in his proclamation of emancipation and other documents as these positions were reiterated in his last annual message it was further declared by the president that the complete restoration of the national authority was an indispensable condition of any assent on our part to whatever form of peace might be proposed the president assured the other party that while he must adhere to these positions he would be prepared so far as power is lodged with the executive to exercise liberality his power however is limited by the constitution and when peace should be made congress must necessarily act in regard to appropriations of money and to the admission of representatives from the insurrectionary states the richmond party were then informed that congress had on the 31st ultimo adopted by a constitutional majority a joint resolution submitting to the several states the proposition to abolish slavery throughout the union and that there is every reason to expect that it will be soon accepted by three fourths of the states so as to become a part of the national organic law  the conference came to an end by mutual acquiescence without producing an agreement of views upon the several matters discussed or any of them nevertheless it is perhaps of some importance that we have been able to submit our opinions and views directly to prominent insurgents and to hear them in answer in a courteous and not unfriendly manner  i am sir your obedient servant  william h

this second appearing to take the oath of the presidential office there is less occasion for an extended address than there was at the first then a statement somewhat in detail of a course to be pursued seemed fitting and proper now at the expiration of four years during which public declarations have been constantly called forth on every point and phase of the great contest which still absorbs the attention and engrosses the energies of the nation little that is new could be presented the progress of our arms upon which all else chiefly depends is as well known to the public as to myself and it is i trust reasonably satisfactory and encouraging to all with high hope for the future no prediction in regard to it is ventured  on the occasion corresponding to this four years ago all thoughts were anxiously directed to an impending civil war all dreaded it all sought to avert it while the inaugural address was being delivered from this place devoted altogether to saving the union without war insurgent agents were in the city seeking to destroy it without war seeking to dissolve the union and divide effects by negotiation both parties deprecated war but one of them would make war rather than let the nation survive and the other would accept war rather than let it perish and the war came  one eighth of the whole population was colored slaves not distributed generally over the union but localized in the southern part of it these slaves constituted a peculiar and powerful interest all knew that this interest was somehow the cause of the war to strengthen perpetuate and extend this interest was the object for which the insurgents would rend the union even by war while the government claimed no right to do more than to restrict the territorial enlargement of it neither party expected for the war the magnitude or the duration which it has already attained neither anticipated that the cause of the conflict might cease with or even before the conflict itself should cease each looked for an easier triumph and a result less fundamental and astounding both read the same bible and pray to the same god and each invokes his aid against the other it may seem strange that any men should dare to ask a just gods assistance in wringing their bread from the sweat of other mens faces but let us judge not that we be not judged the prayers of both could not be answered that of neither has been answered fully the almighty has his own purposes woe unto the world because of offenses for it must needs be that offenses come but woe to that man by whom the offense cometh if we shall suppose that american slavery is one of those offenses which in the providence of god must needs come but which having continued through his appointed time he now wills to remove and that he gives to both north and south this terrible war as the woe due to those by whom the offense came shall we discern therein any departure from those divine attributes which the believers in a living god always ascribe to him fondly do we hope fervently do we pray that this mighty scourge of war may speedily pass away yet if god wills that it continue until all the wealth piled by the bondsmans two hundred and fifty years of unrequited toil shall be sunk and until every drop of blood drawn with the lash shall be paid by another drawn with the sword as was said three thousand years ago so still it must be said the judgments of the lord are true and righteous altogether  with malice toward none with charity for all with firmness in the right as god gives us to see the right let us strive on to finish the work we are in to bind up the nations wounds to care for him who shall have borne the battle and for his widow and his orphan to do all which may achieve and cherish a just and lasting peace among ourselves and with all nations     telegram to general john pope  executive mansion washington march 7 1865  majorgeneral pope st louis missouri  please state

anything what can be done in the premises yours truly  a lincoln  i believe i gave hughes a card putting him with singleton on the same letter however this may be i now authorize you to get singleton

the president of the united states of america  a proclamation  whereas the twentyfirst section of the act of congress approved on the 3d instant entitled an act to amend the several acts heretofore passed to provide for the enrolling and calling out the national forces and for other purposes requires that in addition to the other lawful penalties of the crime of desertion from the military or naval service all persons who have deserted the military or naval service of the united states who shall not return to said service or report themselves to a provostmarshal within sixty days after the proclamation hereinafter mentioned shall be deemed and taken to have voluntarily relinquished and forfeited their citizenship and their right to become citizens and such deserters shall be forever incapable of holding any office of trust or profit under the united states or of exercising any rights of citizens thereof and all persons who shall hereafter desert the military or naval service and all persons who being duly enrolled shall depart the jurisdiction of the district in which they are enrolled or go beyond the limits of the united states with intent to avoid any draft into the military or naval service duly ordered shall be liable to the penalties of this section and the president is hereby authorized and required forthwith on the passage of this act to issue his proclamation setting forth the provisions of this section in which proclamation the president is requested to notify all deserters returning within sixty days as aforesaid that they shall be pardoned on condition of returning to their regiments and companies or to such other organizations as they may be assigned to until they shall have served for a period of time equal to their original term of enlistment  now therefore be it known that i abraham lincoln president of the united states do issue this my proclamation as required by said act ordering and requiring all deserters to return to their proper posts and i do hereby notify them that all deserters who shall within sixty days from the date of this proclamation viz on or before the 10th day of may 1865 return to service or report themselves to a provostmarshal shall be pardoned on condition that they return to their regiments or companies or to such other organization as they may be assigned to and serve the remainder of their original terms of enlistment and in addition thereto a period equal to the time lost by desertion  in testimony whereof i have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the united states to be

compliment thank you for yours on my little notification speech and on the recent inaugural address i expect the latter to wear as well as perhaps better thananything i have produced but i believe it is not immediately popular men are not flattered by being shown that there has been a difference of purpose between the almighty and them to deny it however in this case is to deny that there is a god governing the world it is a truth which i thought needed to be told and as whatever of humiliation there is in it falls most directly on myself i thought others might afford for me to tell it  truly yours   a lincoln     telegram to colonel rough and others  war department washington d c march 17 1865  col r m rough and others chicago ill  yours received the best i can do with it is to refer it

to an indiana regiment  march 17 1865  fellowcitizensit will be but a very few words that i shall undertake to say i was born in kentucky raised in indiana and lived in illinois and now i am here where it is my business to care equally for the good people of all the states i am glad to see an indiana regiment on this day able to present the captured flag to the governor of indiana i am not disposed in saying this to make a distinction between the states for all have done equally well  there are but few views or aspects of this great war upon which i have not said or written something whereby my own opinions might be known but there is onethe recent attempt of our erring brethren as they are sometimes called to employ the negro to fight for them i have neither written nor made a speech on that subject because that was their business not mine and if i had a wish on the subject i had not the power to introduce it or make it effective the great question with them was whether the negro being put into the army will fight for them i do not know and therefore cannot decide they ought to know better than me i have in my lifetime heard many arguments why the negroes ought to be slaves but if they fight for those who would keep them in slavery it will be a better argument than any i have yet heard he who will fight for that ought to be a slave they have concluded at last to take one out of four of the slaves and put them in the army and that one out of the four who will fight to keep the others in slavery ought to be a slave himself unless he is killed in a fight while i have often said that all men ought to be free yet would i allow those colored persons to be slaves who want to be and next to them those white people who argue in favor of making other people slaves i am in favor of giving an appointment to such white men to try it on for these slaves i will say one thing in regard to the negroes being employed to fight for them i do know he cannot fight and stay at home and make bread too and as one is about as important as the other to them i dont care which they do i am rather in favor of having them try them as soldiers they lack one vote of doing that and i wish i could send my vote over the river so that i might cast it in favor of allowing the negro to fight but they cannot fight and work both we must now see the bottom of the enemys resources they will stand out as long as they can and if the negro will fight for them they must allow him to fight they have drawn upon their last branch of resources and we can now see the bottom i am glad to see the end so near at hand i have said now more than i intended and will therefore bid you goodby     proclamation concerning indians  march 17 1865  by the president of the united states of america  a proclamation  whereas reliable information has been received that hostile indians within the limits of the united states have been furnished with arms and munitions of war by persons dwelling in conterminous foreign territory and are thereby enabled to prosecute their savage warfare upon the exposed and sparse settlements of the frontier  now therefore be it known that i abraham lincoln president of the united states of america do hereby proclaim and direct that all persons detected in that nefarious traffic shall be arrested and tried by courtmartial at the nearest military post and if convicted shall receive the punishment due to their deserts  in witness whereof i have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the united states to be affixed   a lincoln  by the president william h seward secretary of state     order annulling the sentence  against benjamin g smith and franklin w smith  march 18 1865   i am unwilling for the sentence to stand and be executed to any extent in this case in the absence of a more adequate motive than the evidence discloses i am wholly unable to believe in the existence of criminal or fraudulent intent on the part of men of such well established good character if the evidence went as far to establish a guilty profit of one or two hundred thousand dollars as it does of one or two hundred dollars the case would on the question of guilt bear a far different aspect that on this contract involving some twelve hundred thousand dollars the contractors would plan and attempt to execute a fraud which at the most could profit them only one or two hundred or even one thousand dollars is to my mind beyond the power of rational belief that they did not in such a case make far greater gains proves that they did not with guilty or fraudulent intent make at all the judgment and sentence are disapproved and declared null and the defendants are fully discharged   a lincoln march 18 1865     telegram to general j pope  executive

and although he has not been diverted from his programme no considerable effort has yet been produced so far as we know here last night at 1015 p m when it was dark as a rainy night without a moon could be a furious cannonade soon joined in by a heavy musketry fire opened near petersburg and lasted about two hours the sound was very distinct here as also were the flashes of the guns up the clouds it seemed to me a great battle but the older hands here scarcely noticed it and sure enough this morning it was found that very little had been done   a lincoln     telegram to secretary

follows  our troops after being driven back to the boydton plank road turned and drove the enemy in turn and took the white oak road which we now have this gives us the ground occupied by the enemy this morning i will send you a rebel flag captured by our troops in driving the enemy back there have been four flags captured today  judging by the two points from which general grant telegraphs i

telegram to general u s grant  headquarters armies of the united states city point april 6 1865  lieutenantgeneral grant in the field  secretary seward was thrown from his carriage yesterday and seriously injured this with other matters will take me to washington soon i was at richmond yesterday and the day before when and where judge campbell who was with messrs hunter and stephens in february called on me and made such representations as induced me to put in his hands an informal paper repeating the propositions in my letter of instructions to mr seward which you remember and adding that if the war be now further persisted in by the rebels confiscated property shall at the least bear the additional cost and that confiscation shall be remitted to the people of any state which will now promptly and in good faith withdraw its troops and other support from resistance to the government  judge campbell thought it not impossible that the rebel legislature of virginia would do the latter if permitted and accordingly i addressed a private letter to general weitzel with permission to judge campbell to see it telling him general weitzel that if they attempt this to permit and protect them unless they attempt something hostile to the united states in which case to give them notice and time to leave and to arrest any remaining after such time  i do not think it very probable that anything win come of this but i have thought best to notify you so that if you should see signs you may understand them  from your recent despatches it seems that you are pretty effectually withdrawing the virginia troops from opposition to the government nothing that i have done or probably shall do is to delay hinder or interfere with your work  yours truly   a lincoln

then said namely he supposed owing to the great good news there would be some demonstration he would prefer tomorrow evening when he should be quite willing and he hoped ready to say something he desired to be particular because every thing he said got into print occupying the position he did a mistake would produce harm and therefore he wanted to be careful not to make a mistake     telegram

tribunal george w lane charles whitlock ezra baler j m renshaw and others are restrained of their liberty do this promptly and fully   a lincoln     proclamation closing certain ports april 11 1865  by the president of the united states of america  a proclamation  whereas by my proclamations of the 19th and 27th days of april ad 1861 the ports of the united states in the states of virginia north carolina south carolina georgia florida alabama mississippi louisiana and texas were declared to be subject to blockade but  whereas the said blockade has in consequence of actual military occupation by this government since been conditionally set aside or relaxed in respect to the ports of norfolk and alexandria in the state of virginia beaufort in the state of north carolina port royal in the state of south carolina pensacola and fernandina in the state of florida and new orleans in the state of louisiana and  whereas by the fourth section of the act of congress approved on the 13th of july 1861 entitled an act further to provide for the collection of duties on imports and for other purposes the president for the reasons therein set forth is authorized to close certain ports of entry  now therefore be it known that i abraham lincoln president of the united states do hereby proclaim that the ports of richmond tappahannock cherrystone yorktown and petersburg in virginia of camden elizabeth city edenton plymouth washington newbern ocracoke and wilmington in north carolina of charleston georgetown and beaufort in south carolina of savannah st marys and brunswick darien in georgia of mobile in alabama of pearl river shieldsboro natchez and vicksburg in mississippi of st augustine key west st marks port leon st johns jacksonville and apalachicola in florida of teche franklin in louisiana of galveston la salle brazos de santiago point isabel and brownsville in texas are hereby closed and all right of importation warehousing and other privileges shall in respect to the ports aforesaid cease until they shall have again been opened by order of the president and if while said parts are so closed any ship or vessel from beyond the united states or having on board any articles subject to duties shall attempt to enter any such port the same together with its tackle apparel furniture and cargo shall be forfeited to the united states  in witness whereof i have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the united states to be affixed  done at the city of washington this eleventh day of april ad 1865 and of the independence of the united states of america the eightyninth   a lincoln  by the president william h seward secretary of state     proclamation opening the port of key west  april 11 1865  by the president of the united states of america  a proclamation  whereas by my proclamation of this date the port of key west in the state of florida was inadvertently included among those which are not open to commerce  now therefore be it known that i abraham lincoln president of the united states do hereby declare and make known that the said port of key west is and shall remain open to foreign and domestic commerce upon the same conditions by which that commerce has there hitherto been governed  in testimony whereof i have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the united states to be affixed  done at the city of washington this eleventh day of april ad 1865 and of the independence of the united states of america the eightyninth   a lincoln  by the president william h seward secretary of state     proclamation claiming equality of rights with all maritime nations  april 11 1865  by the president of the united states of america  a proclamation  whereas for some time past vessels of war of the united states have been refused in certain foreign ports privileges and immunities to which they were entitled by treaty public law or the community of nations at the same time that vessels of war of the country wherein the said privileges and immunities have been withheld have enjoyed them fully and uninterruptedly in ports of the united states which condition of things has not always been forcibly resisted by the united states although on the other hand they have not at any time failed to protest against and declare their dissatisfaction with the same in the view of the united states no condition any longer exists which can be claimed to justify the denial to them by any one of such nations of customary naval rights as has heretofore been so unnecessarily persisted in  now therefore i abraham lincoln president of the united states do hereby make known that if after a reasonable time shall have elapsed for intelligence of this proclamation to have reached any foreign country in whose ports the said privileges and immunities shall have been refused as aforesaid they shall continue to be so refused then and thenceforth the same privileges and immunities shall be refused to the vessels of war of that country in the ports of the united states and this refusal shall continue until war vessels of the united states shall have been placed upon an entire equality in the foreign ports aforesaid with similar vessels of other countries the united states whatever claim or pretense may have existed heretofore are now at least entitled to claim and concede an entire and friendly equality of rights and hospitalities with all maritime nations  in witness whereof i have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the united states to be affixed   a lincoln  by the president william h seward secretary of state     last public address  april 11 1865  fellowcitizenswe meet this evening not in sorrow but in gladness of heart the evacuation of petersburg and richmond and the surrender of the principal insurgent army give hope of a righteous and speedy peace whose joyous expression cannot be restrained in the midst of this however he from whom blessings flow must not be forgotten  a call for a national thanksgiving is being prepared and will be duly promulgated nor must those whose harder part gives us the cause of rejoicing be overlooked their honors must not be parceled out with others i myself was near the front and had the pleasure of transmitting much of the good news to you but no part of the honor for plan or execution is mine to general grant his skillful officers and brave men all belongs the gallant navy stood ready but was not in reach to take active part by these recent successes the reinauguration of the national authorityreconstruction which has had a large share of thought from the first is pressed much more closely upon our attention it is fraught with great difficulty unlike a case of war between independent nations there is no authorized organ for us to treat withno one man has authority to give up the rebellion for any other man we simply must begin with and mould from disorganized and discordant elements nor is it a small additional embarrassment that we the loyal people differ among ourselves as to the mode manner and measure of reconstruction as a general rule i abstain from reading the reports of attacks upon myself wishing not to be provoked by that to which i cannot properly offer an answer in spite of this precaution however it comes to my knowledge that i am much censured for some supposed agency in setting up and seeking to sustain the new state government of louisiana in this i have done just so much and no more than the public knows in the annual message of december 1863 and the accompanying proclamation i presented a plan of reconstruction as the phrase goes which i promised if adopted by any state would be acceptable to and sustained by the executive government of the nation i distinctly stated that this was not the only plan that might possibly be acceptable and i also distinctly protested that the executive claimed no right to say when or whether members should be admitted to seats in congress from such states this plan was in advance submitted to the then cabinet and approved by every member of it one of them suggested that i should then and in that connection apply the emancipation proclamation to the theretofore excepted parts of virginia and louisiana that i should drop the suggestion about apprenticeship for freed people and that i should omit the protest against my own power in regard to the admission of members of congress but even he approved every part and parcel of the plan which has since been employed or touched by the action of louisiana the new constitution of louisiana declaring emancipation for the whole state practically applies the proclamation to the part previously excepted it does not adopt apprenticeship for freed people and is silent as it could not well be otherwise about the admission of members to congress so that as it applied to louisiana every member of the cabinet fully approved the plan the message went to congress and i received many commendations of the plan written and verbal and not a single objection to it from any professed emancipationist came to my knowledge until after the news reached washington that the people of louisiana had begun to move in accordance with it from about july 1862 i had corresponded with different persons supposed to be interested in seeking a reconstruction of a state government for louisiana when the message of 1863 with the plan before mentioned reached new orleans general banks wrote me that he was confident that the people with his military cooperation would reconstruct substantially on that plan i wrote to him and some of them to try it they tried it and the result is known such has been my only agency in getting up the louisiana government as to sustaining it my promise is out as before stated but as bad promises are better broken than kept i shall treat this as a bad promise and break it whenever i shall be convinced that keeping it is adverse to the public interest but i have not yet been so convinced i have been shown a letter on this subject supposed to be an able one in which the writer expresses regret that my mind has not seemed to be definitely fixed upon the question whether the seceded states so called are in the union or out of it it would perhaps add astonishment to his regret were he to learn that since i have found professed union men endeavoring to answer that question i have purposely forborne any public expression upon it as appears to me that question has not been nor yet is a practically material one and that any discussion of it while it thus remains practically immaterial could have no effect other than the mischievous one of dividing our friends as yet whatever it may become that question is bad as the basis of a controversy and good for nothing at alla merely pernicious abstraction we all agree that the seceded states so called are out of their proper practical relation with the union and that the sole object of the government civil and military in regard to those states is to again get them into their proper practical relation i believe that it is not only possible but in fact easier to do this without deciding or even considering whether those states have ever been out of the union than with it finding themselves safely at home it would be utterly immaterial whether they had been abroad let us all join in doing the acts necessary to restore the proper practical relations between these states and the union and each forever after innocently indulge his own opinion whether in doing the acts he brought the states from without into the union or only gave them proper assistance they never having been out of it the amount of constituency so to speak on which the louisiana government rests would be more satisfactory to all if it contained fifty thousand or thirty thousand or even twenty thousand instead of twelve thousand as it does it is also unsatisfactory to some that the elective franchise is not given to the colored man i would myself prefer that it were now conferred on the very intelligent and on those who serve our cause as soldiers still the question is not whether the louisiana government as it stands is quite all that is desirable the question is will it be wiser to take it as it is and help to improve it or to reject and disperse can louisiana be brought into proper practical relation with the union sooner by sustaining or by discarding her new state government some twelve thousand voters in the heretofore slave state of louisiana have sworn allegiance to the union assumed to be the rightful political power of the state held elections organized a state government adopted a free state constitution giving the benefit of public schools equally to black and white and empowering the legislature to confer the elective franchise upon the colored man this legislature has already voted to ratify the constitutional amendment recently passed by congress abolishing slavery throughout the nation these twelve thousand persons are thus fully committed to the union and to perpetuate freedom in the statecommitted to the very things and nearly all things the nation wantsand they ask the nations recognition and its assistance to make good this committal now if we reject and spurn them we do our utmost to disorganize and disperse them we in fact say to the white man you are worthless or worse we will neither help you nor be helped by you to the blacks we say this cup of liberty which these your old masters held to your lips we will dash from you and leave you to the chances of gathering the spilled and scattered contents in some vague and undefined when where and how if this course discouraging and paralyzing both white and black has any tendency to bring louisiana into proper practical relations with the union i have so far been unable to perceive it if on the contrary we recognize and sustain the new government of louisiana the converse of all this is made true we encourage the hearts and nerve the arms of twelve thousand to adhere to their work and argue for it and proselyte for it and fight for it and feed it and grow it and ripen it to a complete success the colored man too in seeing all united for him is inspired with vigilance and energy and daring to the same end grant that he desires the elective franchise will he not attain it sooner by saving the already advanced steps towards it than by running backward over them concede that the new government of louisiana is only to what it should be as the egg is to the fowl we shall sooner have the fowl by hatching the egg than by smashing it again if we reject louisiana we also reject one vote in favor of the proposed amendment to the national constitution to meet this proposition it has been argued that no more than three fourths of those states which have not attempted secession are necessary to validly ratify the amendment i do not commit myself against this further than to say that such a ratification would be questionable and sure to be persistently questioned while a ratification by three fourths of all the states would be unquestioned and unquestionable i repeat the question can louisiana be brought into proper practical relation with the union sooner by sustaining or by discarding her new state government what has been said of louisiana will apply to other states and yet so great peculiarities pertain to each state and such important and sudden changes occur in the same state and withal so new and unprecedented is the whole case that no exclusive and inflexible plan can safely be prescribed as to details and collaterals such exclusive and inflexible plan would surely become a new entanglement important principles may and must be inflexible in the present situation as the phrase goes it may be my duty to make some new announcement to the people of the south i am considering and shall not fail to act when satisfied that action will be proper     telegram to general g weitzel  washington d c april 12 1865 majorgeneral weitzel richmond va  i have seen your despatch to colonel hardie about the matter of prayers i do not remember hearing prayers spoken of while i was in richmond but i have no doubt you have acted in what appeared to you to be the spirit and temper manifested by me while there is there any sign of the rebel legislature coming together on the understanding of my letter to you if there is any such sign inform me what it is if there is no such sign you may withdraw the offer   a lincoln     telegram to general g weitzel washington dc april 12 1865  majorgeneral weitzel richmond va  i have just seen judge campbells letter to you of the 7th he assumes as appears to me that i have called the insurgent legislature of virginia together as the rightful legislature of the state to settle all differences with the united states i have done no such thing i spoke of them not as a legislature but as the gentlemen who have acted as the legislature of virginia in support of the rebellion i did this on purpose to exclude the assumption that i was recognizing them as a rightful body i deal with them as men having power de facto to do a specific thing to wit to withdraw the virginia troops and other support from resistance to the general government for which in the paper handed judge campbell i promised a specific equivalent to wit a remission to the people of the state except in certain cases of the confiscation of their property i meant this and no more inasmuch however as judge campbell misconstrues this and is still pressing for an armistice contrary to the explicit statement of the paper i gave him and particularly as general grant has since captured the virginia troops so that giving a consideration for their withdrawal is no longer applicable let my letter to you and the paper to judge campbell both be withdrawn or countermanded and he be notified of it do not now allow them to assemble but if any have come allow them safe return to their homes   a lincoln     interview with schuyler colfax on the morning of april 14 1865  mr colfax i want you to take a message from me to the miners whom you visit i have very large ideas of the mineral wealth of our nation i believe it practically inexhaustible it abounds all over the western country from the rocky mountains to the pacific and its development has scarcely commenced during the war when we were adding a couple of millions of dollars every day to our national debt i did not care about encouraging the increase in the volume of our precious metals we had the country to save first but now that the rebellion is overthrown and we know pretty nearly the amount of our national debt the more gold and silver we mine we make the payment of that debt so much the easier now said he speaking with more emphasis i am going to encourage that in every possible way we shall have hundreds of thousands of disbanded soldiers and many have feared that their return home in such great numbers might paralyze industry by furnishing suddenly a greater supply of labor than there will be demand for i am going to try to attract them to the hidden wealth of our mountain ranges where there is room enough for all immigration which even the war has not stopped will land upon our shores hundreds of thousands more per year from overcrowded europe i intend to point them to the gold and silver that wait for them in the west tell the miners for me that i shall promote their interests to the utmost of my ability because their prosperity is the prosperity of the nation and said he his eye kindling with enthusiasm we shall prove in a very few years that we are indeed the treasury of the world     to general van allen  executive mansion washington april 14 1865  general van allen  i intend to adopt the advice of my friends and use due precaution i thank you for the assurance you give me that i shall be supported by conservative men like yourself in the efforts i may
