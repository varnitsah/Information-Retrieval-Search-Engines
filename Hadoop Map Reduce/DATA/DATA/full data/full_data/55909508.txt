55909508	the author of beltraffio  by henry james  1885      part i  much as i wished to see him i had kept my letter of introduction for three weeks in my pocketbook i was nervous and timid about meeting himconscious of youth and ignorance convinced that he was tormented by strangers and especially by my countrypeople and not exempt from the suspicion that he had the irritability as well as the brilliancy of genius moreover the pleasure if it should occur for i could scarcely believe it was near at hand would be so great that i wished to think of it in advance to feel that it was in my pocket not to mix it with satisfactions more superficial and usual in the little game of new sensations that i was playing with my ingenuous mind i wished to keep my visit to the author of beltraffio as a trump card it was three years after the publication of that fascinating work which i had read over five times and which now with my riper judgment i admire on the whole as much as ever this will give you about the date of my first visit of any duration to england for you will not have forgotten the commotioni may even say the scandalproduced by mark ambients masterpiece it was the most complete presentation that had yet been made of the gospel of art it was a kind of aesthetic warcry people had endeavored to sail nearer to truth in the cut of their sleeves and the shape of their sideboards but there had not as yet been among english novels such an example of beauty of execution and genuineness of substance nothing had been done in that line from the point of view of art for art this was my own point of view i may mention when i was twentyfive whether it is altered now i wont take upon myself to sayespecially as the discerning reader will be able to judge for himself i had been in england briefly a twelvemonth before the time to which i began by alluding and had learned then that mr ambient was in distant landswas making a considerable tour in the east so there was nothing to do but to keep my letter till i should be in london again it was of little use to me to hear that his wife had not left england and with her little boy their only child was spending the period of her husbands absencea good many monthsat a small place they had down in surrey they had a house in london which was let all this i learned and also that mrs ambient was charming my friend the american poet from whom i had my introduction had never seen her his relations with the great man being only epistolary but she was not after all though she had lived so near the rose the author of beltraffio and i did not go down into surrey to call on her i went to the continent spent the following winter in italy and returned to london in may my visit to italy opened my eyes to a good many things but to nothing more than the beauty of certain pages in the works of mark ambient i had every one of his productions in my portmanteauthey are not as you know very numerous but he had preluded to beltraffio by some exquisite thingsand i used to read them over in the evening at the inn i used to say to myself that the man who drew those characters and wrote that style understood what he saw and knew what he was doing this is my only reason for mentioning my winter in italy he had been there much in former years and he was saturated with what painters call the feeling of that classic land he expressed the charm of the old hillcities of tuscany the look of certain lonely grassgrown places which in the past had echoed with life he understood the great artists he understood the spirit of the renaissance he understood everything the scene of one of his earlier novels was laid in borne the scene of another in florence and i moved through these cities in company with the figures whom mark ambient had set so vividly upon their feet this is why i was now so much happier even than before in the prospect of making his acquaintance  at last when i had dallied with this privilege long enough i despatched to him the missive of the american poet he had already gone out of town he shrank from the rigor of the london season and it was his habit to migrate on the first of june moreover i had heard that this year he was hard at work on a new book into which some of his impressions of the east were to be wrought so that he desired nothing so much as quiet days this knowledge however did not prevent mecet âge est sans pitiéfrom sending with my friends letter a note of my own in which i asked mr ambients leave to come down and see him for an hour or two on a day to be designated by himself my proposal was accompanied with a very frank expression of my sentiments and the effect of the whole projectile was to elicit from the great man the kindest possible invitation he would be delighted to see me especially if i should turn up on the following saturday and would remain till the monday morning we would take a walk over the surrey commons and i could tell him all about the other great man the one in america he indicated to me the best train and it may be imagined whether on the saturday afternoon i was punctual at waterloo he carried his benevolence to the point of coming to meet me at the little station at which i was to alight and my heart beat very fast as i saw his handsome face surmounted with a soft wideawake and which i knew by a photograph long since enshrined upon my mantelshelf scanning the carriage windows as the train rolled up he recognized me as infallibly as i had recognized him he appeared to know by instinct how a young american of an æsthetic turn would look when much divided between eagerness and modesty he took me by the hand and smiled at me and said you must beayou i think and asked if i should mind going on foot to his house which would take but a few minutes i remember thinking it a piece of extraordinary affability that he should give directions about the conveyance of my bag and feeling altogether very happy and rosy in fact quite transported when he laid his hand on my shoulder as we came out of the station  i surveyed him askance as we walked together i had alreadyi had indeed instantlyseen that he was a delightful creature his face is so well known that i need nt describe it he looked to me at once an english gentleman and a man of genius and i thought that a happy combination there was just a little of the bohemian in his appearance you would easily have guessed that he belonged to the guild of artists and men of letters he was addicted to velvet jackets to cigarettes to loose shirtcollars to looking a little dishevelled his features which were fine but not perfectly regular are fairly enough represented in his portraits but no portrait that i have seen gives any idea of his expression there were so many things in it and they chased each other in and out of his face i have seen people who were grave and gay in quick alternation but mark ambient was grave and gay at one and the same moment there were other strange oppositions and contradictions in his slightly faded and fatigued countenance he seemed both young and old both anxious and indifferent he had evidently had an active past which inspired one with curiosity and yet it was impossible not to be more curious still about his future he was just enough above middle height to be spoken of as tall and rather lean and long in the flank he had the friendliest frankest manner possible and yet i could see that he was shy he was thirtyeight years old at the time beltraffio was published he asked me about his friend in america about the length of my stay in england about the last news in london and the people i had seen there and i remember looking for the signs of genius in the very form of his questions and thinking i found it i liked his voice  there was genius in his house too i thought when we got there there was imagination in the carpets and curtains in the pictures and books in the garden behind it where certain old brown walls were muffled in creepers that appeared to me to have been copied from a masterpiece of one of the preraphaelites that was the way many things struck me at that time in england as if they were reproductions of something that existed primarily in art or literature it was not the picture the poem the fictive page that seemed to me a copy these things were the originals and the life of happy and distinguished people was fashioned in their image mark ambient called his house a cottage and i perceived afterwards that he was right for if it had not been a cottage it must have been a villa and a villa in england at least was not a place in which one could fancy him at home but it was to my vision a cottage glorified and translated it was a palace of art on a slightly reduced scaleit was an old english demesne it nestled under a cluster of magnificent beeches it had little creaking lattices that opened out of or into pendent mats of ivy and gables and old red tiles as well as a general aspect of being painted in watercolors and inhabited by people whose lives would go on in chapters and volumes the lawn seemed to me of extraordinary extent the gardenwalls of incalculable height the whole air of the place delightfully still private proper to itself my wife must be somewhere about mark ambient said as we went in we shall find her perhaps we have got about an hour before dinner she may be in the garden i will show you my little place  we passed through the house and into the grounds as i should have called them which extended into the rear they covered but three or four acres but like the house they were very old and crooked and full of traces of long habitation with inequalities of level and little stepsmossy and cracked were thesewhich connected the different parts with each other the limits of the place cleverly dissimulated were muffled in the deepest verdure they made as i remember a kind of curtain at the further end in one of the folds of which as it were we presently perceived from afar a little group ah there she is said mark ambient and she has got the boy he made this last remark in a slightly different tone from any in which he yet had spoken i was not fully aware of it at the time but it lingered in my ear and i afterwards understood it  is it your son i inquired feeling the question not to be brilliant  yes my only child hes always in his mothers pocket she coddles him too much it came back to me afterwards toothe manner in which he spoke these words they were not petulant they expressed rather a sudden coldness a kind of mechanical submission we went a few steps further and then he stopped short and called the boy beckoning to him repeatedly  dolcino come and see your daddy there was something in the way he stood still and waited that made me think he did it for a purpose mrs ambient had her arm round the childs waist and he was leaning against her knee but though he looked up at the sound of his fathers voice she gave no sign of releasing him a lady apparently a neighbor was seated near her and before them was a gardentable on which a teaservice had been placed  mark ambient called again and dolcino struggled in the maternal embrace but he was too tightly held and after two or three fruitless efforts he suddenly turned round and buried his head deep in his mothers lap there was a certain awkwardness in the scene i thought it rather odd that mrs ambient should pay so little attention to her husband but i would not for the world have betrayed my thought and to conceal it i observed that it must be such a pleasant thing to have tea in the garden ah she wont let him come said mark ambient with a sigh and we went our way till we reached the two ladies he mentioned my name to his wife and i noticed that he addressed her as my dear very genially without any trace of resentment at her detention of the child the quickness of the transition made me vaguely ask myself whether he were henpeckeda shocking conjecture which i instantly dismissed mrs ambient was quite such a wife as i should have expected him to have slim and fair with a long neck and pretty eyes and an air of great refinement she was a little cold and a little shy but she was very sweet and she had a certain look of race justified by my afterwards learning that she was connected with two or three great families i have seen poets married to women of whom it was difficult to conceive that they should gratify the poetic fancywomen with dull faces and glutinous minds who were none the less however excellent wives but there was no obvious incongruity in mark ambients union mrs ambient delicate and quiet in a white dress with her beautiful child at her side was worthy of the author of a work so distinguished as beltraffio bound her neck she wore a black velvet ribbon of which the long ends tied behind hung down her back and to which in front was attached a miniature portrait of her little boy her smooth shining hair was confined in a net she gave me a very pleasant greeting and dolcinoi thought this little name of endearment delightfultook advantage of her getting up to slip away from her and go to his father who said nothing to him but simply seized him and held him high in his arms for a moment kissing him several times  i had lost no time in observing that the child who was not more than seven years old was extraordinarily beautiful he had the face of an angelthe eyes the hair the more than mortal bloom the smile of innocence there was something touching almost alarming in his beauty which seemed to be composed of elements too fine and pure for the breath of this world when i spoke to him and he came and held out his hand and smiled at me i felt a sudden pity for him as if he had been an orphan or a changeling or stamped with some social stigma it was impossible to be in fact more exempt from these misfortunes and yet as one kissed him it was hard to keep from murmuring poor little devil though why one should have applied this epithet to a living cherub is more than i can say afterwards indeed i knew a little better i simply discovered that he was too charming to live wondering at the same time that his parents should not have perceived it and should not be in proportionate grief and despair for myself i had no doubt of his evanescence having already noticed that there is a kind of charm which is like a deathwarrant  the lady who had been sitting with mrs ambient was a jolly ruddy personage dressed in velveteen and rather limp feathers whom i guessed to be the vicars wifeour hostess did not introduce meand who immediately began to talk to ambient about chrysanthemums this was a safe subject and yet there was a certain surprise for me in seeing the author of beltraffio even in such superficial communion with the church of england his writings implied so much detachment from that institution expressed a view of life so profane as it were so independent and so little likely in general to be thought edifying that i should have expected to find him an object of horror to vicars and their ladiesof horror repaid on his own part by goodnatured but brilliant mockery this proves how little i knew as yet of the english people and their extraordinary talent for keeping up their forms as well as of some of the mysteries of mark ambients hearth and home i found afterwards that he had in his study between smiles and cigarsmoke some wonderful comparisons for his clerical neighbors but meanwhile the chrysanthemums were a source of harmony for he and the vicaress were equally fond of them and i was surprised at the knowledge they exhibited of this interesting plant the ladys visit however had presumably already been long and she presently got up saying she must go and kissed mrs ambient mark started to walk with her to the gate of the grounds holding dolcino by the hand  stay with me my darling mrs ambient said to the boy who was wandering away with his father  mark ambient paid no attention to the summons but dolcino turned round and looked with eyes of shy entreaty at his mother cant i go with papa  not when i ask you to stay with me  but please dont ask me mamma said the child in his little clear new voice  i must ask you when i want you come to me my darling and mrs ambient who had seated herself again held out her long slender hands  her husband stopped with his back turned to her but without releasing the child he was still talking to the vicaress but this good lady i think had lost the thread of her attention she looked at mrs ambient and at dolcino and then she looked at me smiling very hard in an extremely fixed cheerful manner  papa said the child mamma wants me not to go with you  hes very tiredhe has run about all day he ought to be quiet till he goes to bed otherwise he wont sleep these declarations fell successively and gravely from mrs ambients lips  her husband still without turning round bent over the boy and looked at him in silence the vicaress gave a genial irrelevant laugh and observed that he was a precious little pet let him choose said mark ambient my dear little boy will you go with me or will you stay with your mother  oh its a shame cried the vicars lady with increased hilarity  papa i dont think i can choose the child answered making his voice very low and confidential but i have been a great deal with mamma today he added in a moment  and very little with papa my dear fellow i think you have chosen and mark ambient walked off with his son accompanied by reechoing but inarticulate comments from my fellowvisitor  his wife had seated herself again and her fixed eyes bent upon the ground expressed for a few moments so much mute agitation that i felt as if almost any remark from my own lips would be a false note but mrs ambient quickly recovered herself and said to me civilly enough that she hoped i did nt mind having had to walk from the station i reassured her on this point and she went on we have got a thing that might have gone for you but my husband wouldnt order it  that gave me the pleasure of a walk with him i rejoined  she was silent a minute and then she said i believe the americans walk very little  yes we always run i answered laughingly  she looked at me seriously and i began to perceive a certain coldness in her pretty eyes i suppose your distances are so great  yes but we break our marches i i cant tell you what a pleasure it is for me to find myself here i added i have the greatest admiration for mr ambient  he will like that he likes being admired  he must have a very happy life then he has many worshippers  oh yes i have seen some of them said mrs ambient looking away very far from me rather as if such a vision were before her at the moment something in her tone seemed to indicate that the vision was scarcely edifying and i guessed very quickly that she was not in sympathy with the author of beltraffio i thought the fact strange but somehow in the glow of my own enthusiasm i did nt think it important it only made me wish to be rather explicit about that enthusiasm  for me you know i remarked he is quite the greatest of living writers  of course i cant judge of course hes very clever said mrs ambient smiling a little  hes magnificent mrs ambient there are pages in each of his books that have a perfection that classes them with the greatest things therefore for me to see him in this familiar wayin his habit as he livesand to find apparently the man as delightful as the artist i cant tell you how much too good to be true it seems and how great a privilege i think it i knew that i was gushing but i could nt help it and what i said was a good deal less than what i felt i was by no means sure that i should dare to say even so much as this to ambient himself and there was a kind of rapture in speaking it out to his wife which was not affected by the fact that as a wife she appeared peculiar she listened to me with her face grave again and with her lips a little compressed as if there were no doubt of course that her husband was remarkable but at the same time she had heard all this before and couldnt be expected to be particularly interested in it there was even in her manner an intimation that i was rather young and that people usually got over that sort of thing i assure you that for me this is a redletter day i added  she made no response until after a pause looking round her she said abruptly though gently we are very much afraid about the fruit this year  my eyes wandered to the mossy mottled garden walls where plumtrees and peartrees flattened and fastened upon the rusty bricks looked like crucified figures with many arms does nt it promise well i inquired  no the trees look very dull we had such late frosts  then there was another pause mrs ambient kept her eyes fixed on the opposite end of the grounds as if she were watching for her husbands return with the child is mr ambient fond of gardening it occurred to me to inquire irresistibly impelled as i felt myself moreover to bring the conversation constantly back to him  hes very fond of plums said his wife  ah well then i hope your crop will be better than you fear its a lovely old place i continued the whole character of it is that of certain places that he describes your house is like one of his pictures  its a pleasant little place there are hundreds like it  oh it has got his tone i said laughing and insisting on my point the more that mrs ambient appeared to see in my appreciation of her simple establishment a sign of limited experience  it was evident that i insisted too much his tone she repeated with a quick look at me and a slightly heightened color  surely he has a tone mrs ambient  oh yes he has indeed but i dont in the least consider that i am living in one of his books i should nt care for that at all she went on with a smile which had in some degree the effect of converting her slightly sharp protest into a joke deficient in point i am afraid i am not very literary said mrs ambient and i am not artistic  i am very sure you are not ignorant not stupid i ventured to reply with the accompaniment of feeling immediately afterwards that i had been both familiar and patronizing my only consolation was in the reflection that it was she and not i who had begun it she had brought her idiosyncrasies into the discussion  well whatever i am i am very different from my husband if you like him you wont like me you need nt say anything your liking me is nt in the least necessary  dont defy me i exclaimed  she looked as if she had not heard me which was the best thing she could do and we sat some time without further speech mrs ambient had evidently the enviable english quality of being able to be silent without being restless but at last she spoke she asked me if there seemed to be many people in town i gave her what satisfaction i could on this point and we talked a little about london and of some pictures it presented at that time of the year at the end of this i came back irrepressibly to mark ambient  does nt he like to be there now i suppose he does nt find the proper quiet for his work i should think his things had been written for the most part in a very still place they suggest a great stillness following on a kind of tumult dont you think so i suppose london is a tremendous place to collect impressions but a refuge like this in the country must be much better for working them up does he get many of his impressions in london do you think i proceeded from point to point in this malign inquiry simply because my hostess who probably thought me a very pushing and talkative young man gave me time for when i pausedi have not represented my pausesshe simply continued to let her eyes wander and with her long fair fingers played with the medallion on her neck when i stopped altogether however she was obliged to say something and what she said was that she had not the least idea where her husband got his impressions this made me think her for a moment positively disagreeable delicate and proper and rather aristocratically dry as she sat there but i must either have lost the impression a moment later or been goaded by it to further aggression for i remember asking her whether mr ambient were in a good vein of work and when we might look for the appearance of the book on which he was engaged i have every reason now to know that she thought me an odious person  she gave a strange small laugh as she said i am afraid you think i know a great deal more about my husbands work than i do i havent the least idea what he is doing she added presently in a slightly different that is a more explanatory tone as if she recognized in some degree the enormity of her confession i dont read what he writes  she did not succeed and would not even had she tried much harder in making it seem to me anything less than monstrous i stared at her and i think i blushed dont you admire his genius dont you admire beltraffio  she hesitated a moment and i wondered what she could possibly say she did not speaki could seethe first words that rose to her lips she repeated what she had said a few minutes before oh of course he s very clever and with this she got up her husband and little boy had reappeared mrs ambient left me and went to meet them she stopped and had a few words with her husband which i did not hear and which ended in her taking the child by the hand and returning to the house with him her husband joined me in a moment looking i thought the least bit conscious and constrained and said that if i would come in with him he would show me my room in looking back upon these first moments of my visit to him i find it important to avoid the error of appearing to have understood his situation from the first and to have seen in him the signs of things which i learnt only afterwards this later knowledge throws a backward light and makes me forget that at least on the occasion of which i am speaking now i mean that first afternoon mark ambient struck me as a fortunate man allowing for this i think he was rather silent and irresponsive as we walked back to the house though i remember well the answer he made to a remark of mine in relation to his child  thats an extraordinary little boy of yours i said i have never seen such a child  why do you call him extraordinary  hes so beautiful so fascinating hes like a little work of art  he turned quickly grasping my arm an instant oh dont call him that or you llyou ll  and in his hesitation he broke off suddenly laughing at my surprise but immediately afterwards he added you will make his little future very difficult  i declared that i wouldnt for the world take any liberties with his little futureit seemed to me to hang by threads of such delicacy i should only be highly interested in watching it  you americans are very sharp said ambient you notice more things than we do  ah if you want visitors who are not struck with you you should nt ask me down here  he showed me my room a little bower of chintz with open windows where the light was green and before he left me he said irrelevantly as for my little boy you know we shall probably kill him between us before wo have done with him and he made this assertion as if he really believed it without any appearance of jest with his fine nearsighted expressive eyes looking straight into mine  do you mean by spoiling him  no by fighting for him  you had better give him to me to keep for you i said let me remove the apple of discord  i laughed of course but he had the air of being perfectly serious it would be quite the best thing we could do i should be quite ready to do it  i am greatly obliged to you for your confidence  mark ambient lingered there with his hands in his pockets i felt within a few moments as if i had morally speaking taken several steps nearer to him he looked weary just as he faced me then looked preoccupied and as if there were something one might do for him i was terribly conscious of the limits of my own ability but i wondered what such a service might be feeling at bottom however that the only thing i could do for him was to like him i suppose he guessed this and was grateful for what was in my mind for he went on presently i have nt the advantage of being an american but i also notice a little and i have an idea thata here he smiled and laid his hand on my shoulder that even apart from your nationality you are not destitute of intelligence i have only known you half an hour buta and here he hesitated again you are very young after all  but you may treat me as if i could understand you i said and before he left me to dress for dinner he had virtually given me a promise that he would  when i went down into the drawingroomi was very punctuali found that neither my hostess nor my host had appeared a lady rose from a sofa however and inclined her head as i rather surprisedly gazed at her i dare say you dont know me she said with the modern laugh i am mark ambients sister whereupon i shook hands with her saluting her very low her laugh was modernby which i mean that it consisted of the vocal agitation which between people who meet in drawingrooms serves as the solvent of social mysteries the medium of transitions but her appearance waswhat shall i call itmediaeval she was pale and angular with a long thin face inhabited by sad dark eyes and black hair intertwined with golden fillets and curious chains she wore a faded velvet robe which clung to her when she moved fashioned as to the neck and sleeves like the garments of old venetians and florentines she looked pictorial and melancholy and was so perfect an image of a type which i in my ignorance supposed to be extinct that while she rose before me i was almost as much startled as if i had seen a ghost i afterwards perceived that miss ambient was not incapable of deriving pleasure from the effect she produced and i think this sentiment had something to do with her sinking again into her seat with her long lean but not ungraceful arms locked together in an archaic manner on her knees and her mournful eyes addressing themselves to me with an intentness which was a menace of what they were destined subsequently to inflict upon me she was a singular selfconscious artificial creature and i never subsequently more than half penetrated her motives and mysteries of one thing i am sure however that they were considerably less extraordinary than her appearance announced miss ambient was a restless disappointed imaginative spinster consumed with the love of michaelangelesque attitudes and mystical robes but i am pretty sure she had not in her nature those depths of unutterable thought which when you first knew her seemed to look out from her eyes and to prompt her complicated gestures those features in especial had a misleading eloquence they rested upon you with a faroff dimness an air of obstructed sympathy which was certainly not always a key to the spirit of their owner and i suspect that a young lady could not really have been so dejected and disillusioned as miss ambient looked without having committed a crime for which she was consumed with remorse or parted with a hope which she could not sanely have entertained she had i believe the usual allowance of vulgar impulses she wished to be looked at she wished to be married she wished to be thought original it costs me something to speak in this irreverent manner of mark ambients sister but i shall have still more disagreeable things to say before i have finished my little anecdote and moreoveri confess iti owe the young lady a sort of grudge putting aside the curious cast of her face she had no natural aptitude for an artistic developmentshe had little real intelligence but her affectations rubbed off on her brothers renown and as there were plenty of people who disapproved of him totally they could easily point to his sister as a person formed by his influence it was quite possible to regard her as a warning and she had done him but little good with the world at large he was the original and she was the inevitable imitation i think he was scarcely aware of the impression she produced beyond having a general idea that she made up very well as a rossetti he was used to her and he was sorry for herwishing she would marry and observing that she did nt doubtless i take her too seriously for she did me no harm though i am bound to add that i feel i can only half account for her she was not so mystical as she looked but she was a strange indirect uncomfortable embarrassing woman my story will give the reader at best so very small a knot to untie that i need not hope to excite his curiosity by delaying to remark that mrs ambient hated her sisterinlaw this i only found out afterwards when i found out some other things but i mention it at once for i shall perhaps not seem to count too much on having enlisted the imagination of the reader if i say that he will already have guessed it mrs ambient was a person of conscience and she endeavored to behave properly to her kinswoman who spent a month with her twice a year but it required no great insight to discover that the two ladies were made of a very different paste and that the usual feminine hypocrisies must have cost them on either side much more than the usual effort mrs ambient smoothhaired thinlipped perpetually fresh must have regarded her crumpled and dishevelled visitor as a very stale joke she herself was not a rossetti but a gainsborough or a lawrence and she had in her appearance no elements more romantic than a cold ladylike candor and a wellstarched muslin dress  it was in a garment and with an expression of this kind that she made her entrance after i had exchanged a few words with miss ambient her husband presently followed her and there being no other company we went to dinner the impression i received from that repast is present to me still there were elements of oddity in my companions but they were vague and latent and did nt interfere with my delight it came mainly of course from ambients talk which was the most brilliant and interesting i had ever heard i know not whether he laid himself out to dazzle a rather juvenile pilgrim from over the sea but it matters little for it was very easy for him to shine he was almost better as a talker than as a writer that is if the extraordinary finish of his written prose be really as some people have maintained a fault there was such a kindness in him however that i have no doubt it gave him ideas to see me sit openmouthed as i suppose i did not so the two ladies who not only were very nearly dumb from beginning to the end of the meal but who had not the air of being struck with such an exhibition of wit and knowledge mrs ambient placid and detached met neither my eye nor her husbands she attended to her dinner watched the servants arranged the puckers in her dress exchanged at wide intervals a remark with her sisterinlaw and while she slowly rubbed her white hands between the courses looked out of the window at the first signs of twilightthe long june day allowing us to dine without candles miss ambient appeared to give little direct heed to her brothers discourse but on the other hand she was much engaged in watching its effect upon me her lustreless pupils continued to attach themselves to my countenance and it was only her air of belonging to another century that kept them from being importunate she seemed to look at me across the ages and the interval of time diminished the vividness of the performance it was as if she knew in a general way that her brother must be talking very well but she herself was so rich in ideas that she had no need to pick them up and was at liberty to see what would become of a young american when subjected to a high aesthetic temperature  the temperature was æsthetic certainly but it was less so than i could have desired for i was unsuccessful in certain little attempts to make mark ambient talk about himself i tried to put him on the ground of his own writings but he slipped through my fingers every time and shifted the saddle to one of his contemporaries he talked about balzac and browning and what was being done in foreign countries and about his recent tour in the east and the extraordinary forms of life that one saw in that part of the world i perceived that he had reasons for not wishing to descant upon literature and suffered him without protest to deliver himself on certain social topics which he treated with extraordinary humor and with constant revelations of that power of ironical portraiture of which his books are full he had a great deal to say about london as london appears to the observer who does nt fear the accusation of cynicism during the highpressure timefrom april to julyof its peculiarities he flashed his faculty of making the fanciful real and the real fanciful over the perfunctory pleasures and desperate exertions of so many of his compatriots among whom there were evidently not a few types for which he had little love london bored him and he made capital sport of it his only allusion that i can remember to his own work was his saying that he meant some day to write an immense grotesque epic of london society miss ambients perpetual gaze seemed to say to me do you perceive how artistic we are frankly now is it possible to be more artistic than this you surely wont deny that we are remarkable i was irritated by her use of the plural pronoun for she had no right to pair herself with her brother and moreover of course i could not see my way to include mrs ambient but there was no doubt that for that matter they were all remarkable and with all allowances i had never heard anything so artistic mark ambients conversation seemed to play over the whole field of knowledge and taste and to flood it with light and color  after the ladies had left us he took me into his study to smoke and here i led him on to talk freely enough about himself i was bent upon proving to him that i was worthy to listen to him upon repaying him for what he had said to me before dinner by showing him how perfectly i understood he liked to talk he liked to defend his ideas not that i attacked them he liked a little perhapsit was a pardonable weaknessto astonish the youthful mind and to feel its admiration and sympathy i confess that my own youthful mind was considerably astonished at some of his speeches he startled me and he made me wince he could not help forgetting or rather he could nt know how little personal contact i had had with the school in which he was master and he promoted me at a jump as it were to the study of its innermost mysteries my trepidations however were delightful they were just what i had hoped for and their only fault was that they passed away too quickly for i found that as regards most things i very soon seized mark ambients point of view it was the point of view of the artist to whom every manifestation of human energy was a thrilling spectacle and who felt forever the desire to resolve his experience of life into a literary form on this matter of the passion for formthe attempt at perfection the quest for which was to his mind the real search for the holy grailhe said the most interesting the most inspiring things he mixed with them a thousand illustrations from his own life from other lives that he had known from history and fiction and above all from the annals of the time that was dear to him beyond all periodsthe italian cinquecento i saw that in his books he had only said half of his thought and what he had kept backfrom motives that i deplored when i learnt them laterwas the richer part it was his fortune to shock a great many people but there was not a grain of bravado in his pages i have always maintained it though often contradicted and at bottom the poor fellow an artist to his fingertips and regarding a failure of completeness as a crime had an extreme dread of scandal there are people who regret that having gone so far he did not go further but i regret nothing putting aside two or three of the motives i just mentioned for he arrived at perfection and i dont see how you can go beyond that the hours i spent in his studythis first one and the few that followed it they were not after all so numerousseem to glow as i look back on them with a tone which is partly that of the brown old room rich under the shaded candlelight where we sat and smoked with the dusky delicate bindings of valuable books partly that of his voice of which i still catch the echo charged with the images that came at his command when we went back to the drawingroom we found miss ambient alone in possession of it and she informed us that her sisterinlaw had a quarter of an hour before been called by the nurse to see dolcino who appeared to be a little feverish  feverish how in the world does he come to be feverish ambient asked he was perfectly well this afternoon  beatrice says you walked him about too muchyou almost killed him  beatrice must be very happyshe has an opportunity to triumph mark ambient said with a laugh of which the bitterness was just perceptible  surely not if the child is ill i ventured to remark by way of pleading for mrs ambient  my dear fellow you are not marriedyou dont know the nature of wives my host exclaimed  possibly not but i know the nature of mothers  beatrice is perfect as a mother said miss ambient with a tremendous sigh and her fingers interlaced on her embroidered knees  i shall go up and see the child her brother went on do you suppose hes asleep  beatrice wont let you see him mark said the young lady looking at me though she addressed our companion  do you call that being perfect as a mother ambient inquired  yes from her point of view  damn her point of view cried the author of beltraffio and he left the room after which we heard him ascend the stairs  i sat there for some ten minutes with miss ambient and we naturally had some conversation which was begun i think by my asking her what the point of view of her sisterinlaw could be  oh its so very odd she said but we are so very odd altogether dont you find us so we have lived so much abroad have you people like us in america  you are not all alike surely so that i dont think i understand your question we have no one like your brotheri may go so far as that  you have probably more persons like his wife said miss ambient smiling  i can tell you that better when you have told me about her point of view  oh yesoh yes well she does nt like his ideas she doesnt like them for the child she thinks them undesirable  being quite fresh from the contemplation of some of mark ambients arcana i was particularly in a position to appreciate this announcement but the effect of it was to make me after staring a moment burst into laughter which i instantly checked when i remembered that there was a sick child above  what has that infant to do with ideas i asked surely he cant tell one from another has he read his fathers novels  hes very precocious and very sensitive and his mother thinks she cant begin to guard him too early miss ambients head drooped a little to one side and her eyes fixed themselves on futurity then suddenly there was a strange alteration in her face she gave a smile that was more joyless than her gravitya conscious insincere smile and added when one has children its a great responsibilitywhat one writes  children are terrible critics i answered i am rather glad i have nt got any  do you also write then and in the same style as my brother and do you like that style and do people appreciate it in america i dont write but i think i feel to these and various other inquiries and remarks the young lady treated me till we heard her brothers step in the hall again and mark ambient reappeared he looked flushed and serious and i supposed that he had seen something to alarm him in the condition of his child his sister apparently had another idea she gazed at him a moment as if he were a burning ship on the horizon and simply murmured poor old mark  i hope you are not anxious i said  no but i m disappointed she wont let me in she has locked the door and i m afraid to make a noise i suppose there might have been something ridiculous in a confession of this kind but i liked my new friend so much that for me it did nt detract from his dignity she tells mefrom behind the doorthat she will let me know if he is worse  its very good of her said miss ambient  i had exchanged a glance with mark in which it is possible that he read that my pity for him was untinged with contempt though i know not why he should have cared and as presently his sister got up and took her bedroom candlestick he proposed that we should go back to his study we sat there till after midnight he put himself into his slippers into an old velvet jacket lighted an ancient pipe and talked considerably less than he had done before  there were longish pauses in our communion but they only made me feel that we had advanced in intimacy they helped me too to understand my friends personal situation and to perceive that it was by no means the happiest possible when his face was quiet it was vaguely troubled it seemed to me to show that for him too life was a struggle as it has been for many another man of genius at last i prepared to leave him and then to my ineffable joy he gave me some of the sheets of his forthcoming bookit was not finished but he had indulged in the luxury so dear to writers of deliberation of having it set up from chapter to chapter as he advancedhe gave me i say the early pages the prémices as the french have it of this new fruit of his imagination to take to my room and look over at my leisure i was just quitting him when the door of his study was noiselessly pushed open and mrs ambient stood before us she looked at us a moment with her candle in her hand and then she said to her husband that as she supposed he had not gone to bed she had come down to tell him that dolcino was more quiet and would probably be better in the morning mark ambient made no reply he simply slipped past her in the doorway as if he were afraid she would seize him in his passage and bounded upstairs to judge for himself of his childs condition mrs ambient looked slightly discomfited and for a moment i thought she was going to give chase to her husband but she resigned herself with a sigh while her eyes wandered over the lamplit room where various books at which i had been looking were pulled out of their places on the shelves and the fumes of tobacco seemed to hang in midair i bade her goodnight and then without intention by a kind of fatality the perversity which had already made me insist unduly on talking with her about her husbands achievements i alluded to the precious proofsheets with which ambient had intrusted me and which i was nursing there under my arm it is the opening chapters of his new book i said fancy my satisfaction at being allowed to carry them to my room  she turned away leaving me to take my candlestick from the table in the hall but before we separated thinking it apparently a good occasion to let me know once for allsince i was beginning it would seem to be quite thick with my hostthat there was no fitness in my appealing to her for sympathy in such a case before we separated i say she remarked to me with her quick round wellbred utterance i dare say you attribute to me ideas that i have nt got i dont take that sort of interest in my husbands proofsheets i consider his writings most objectionable     part ii  i had some curious conversation the next morning with miss ambient whom i found strolling in the garden before breakfast the whole place looked as fresh and trim amid the twitter of the birds as if an hour before the housemaids had been turned into it with their dustpans and featherbrushes i almost hesitated to light a cigarette and was doubly startled when in the act of doing so i suddenly perceived the sister of my host who had in any case something of the oddity of an apparition standing before me she might have been posing for her photograph her sadcolored robe arranged itself in serpentine folds at her feet her hands locked themselves listlessly together in front and her chin rested upon a cinquecento ruff the first thing i did after bidding her goodmorning was to ask her for news of her little nephewto express the hope that she had heard he was better she was able to gratify this hope and spoke as if we might expect to see him during the day we walked through the shrubberies together and she gave me a great deal of information about her brothers ménage which offered me an opportunity to mention to her that his wife had told me the night before that she thought his productions objectionable  she does nt usually come out with that so soon miss ambient exclaimed in answer to this piece of gossip poor lady she saw that i am a fanatic yes she wont like you for that but you must nt mind if the rest of us like you beatrice thinks a work of art ought to have a purpose but shes a charming womandont you think her charmingshes such a type of the lady  shes very beautiful i answered while i reflected that though it was true apparently that mark ambient was mismated it was also perceptible that his sister was perfidious she told me that her brother and his wife had no other difference but this one that she thought his writings immoral and his influence pernicious it was a fixed idea she was afraid of these things for the child i answered that it was not a triflea womans regarding her husbands mind as a well of corruption and she looked quite struck with the novelty of my remark but there has nt been any of the sort of trouble that there so often is among married people she said i suppose you can judge for yourself that beatrice isnt at allwell whatever they call it when a woman misbehaves herself and mark does nt make love to other people either i assure you he does nt all the same of course from her point of view you know she has a dread of my brothers influence on the childon the formation of his character of his principles it is as if it were a subtle poison or a contagion or something that would rub off on dolcino when his father kisses him or holds him on his knee if she could she would prevent mark from ever touching him every one knows it visitors see it for themselves so there is no harm in my telling you isnt it excessively odd it comes from beatrices being so religious and so tremendously moral and all that and then of course we must nt forget my companion added unexpectedly that some of marks ideas arewell reallyrather queer  i reflected as we went into the house where we found ambient unfolding the observer at the breakfasttable that none of them were probably quite so queer as his sister mrs ambient did not appear at breakfast being rather tired with her ministrations during the night to dolcino her husband mentioned however that she was hoping to go to church i afterwards learned that she did go but i may as well announce without delay that he and i did not accompany her it was while the churchbell was murmuring in the distance that the author of beltraffio led me forth for the ramble he had spoken of in his note i will not attempt to say where we went or to describe what we saw we kept to the fields and copses and commons and breathed the same sweet air as the nibbling donkeys and the browsing sheep whose woolliness seemed to me in those early days of my acquaintance with english objects but a part of the general texture of the small dense landscape which looked as if the harvest were gathered by the shears everything was full of expression for mark ambients visitorfrom the big bandylegged geese whose whiteness was a note amid all the tones of green as they wandered beside a neat little oval pool the foreground of a thatched and whitewashed inn with a grassy approach and a pictorial signfrom these humble wayside animals to the crests of high woods which let a gable or a pinnacle peep here and there and looked even at a distance like trees of good company conscious of an individual profile i admired the hedgerows i plucked the fainthued heather and i was forever stopping to say how charming i thought the threadlike footpaths across the fields which wandered in a diagonal of finer grain from one smooth stile to another mark ambient was abundantly goodnatured and was as much entertained with my observations as i was with the literary allusions of the landscape we sat and smoked upon stiles broaching paradoxes in the decent english air we took short cuts across a park or two where the bracken was deep and my companion nodded to the old woman at the gate we skirted rank covers which rustled here and there as wo passed and we stretched ourselves at last on a heathery hillside where if the sun was not too hot neither was the earth too cold and where the country lay beneath us in a rich blue mist of course i had already told ambient what i thought of his new novel having the previous night read every word of the opening chapters before i went to bed  i am not without hope of being able to make it my best he said as i went back to the subject while we turned up our heels to the sky at least the people who dislike my proseand there are a great many of them i believewill dislike this work most this was the first time i had heard him allude to the people who couldnt read hima class which is supposed always to sit heavy upon the consciousness of the man of letters a man organized for literature as mark ambient was must certainly have had the normal proportion of sensitiveness of irritability the artistic ego capable in some cases of such monstrous development must have been in his composition sufficiently erect and definite i will not therefore go so far as to say that he never thought of his detractors or that he had any illusions with regard to the number of his admirers he could never so far have deceived himself as to believe he was popular but i may at least affirm that adverse criticism as i had occasion to perceive later ruffled him visibly but little that he had an air of thinking it quite natural he should be offensive to many minds and that he very seldom talked about the newspapers which by the way were always very stupid in regard to the author of beltraffio of course he may have thought about themthe newspapersnight and day the only point i wish to make is that he did nt show it while at the same time he did nt strike one as a man who was on his guard i may add that as regards his hope of making the work on which he was then engaged the best of his books it was only partly carried out that place belongs incontestably to beltraffio in spite of the beauty of certain parts of its successor i am pretty sure however that he had at the moment of which i speak no sense of failure he was in love with his idea which was indeed magnificent and though for him as i suppose for every artist the act of execution had in it as much torment as joy he saw his work growing a little every day and fillingout the largest plan he had yet conceived i want to be truer than i have ever been he said settling himself on his back with his hands clasped behind his head i want to give an impression of life itself no you may say what you will i have always arranged things too much always smoothed them down and rounded them off and tucked them indone everything to them that life does nt do i have been a slave to the old superstitions  you a slave my dear mark ambient you have the freest imagination of our day  all the more shame to me to have done some of the things i have the reconciliation of the two women in ginistrella for instance which could never really have taken place that sort of thing is ignoble i blush when i think of it this new affair must be a golden vessel filled with the purest distillation of the actual and oh how it bothers me the shaping of the vasethe hammering of the metal i have to hammer it so fine so smooth i dont do more than an inch or two a day and all the while i have to be so careful not to let a drop of the liquor escape when i see the kind of things that life does i despair of ever catching her peculiar trick she has an impudence life if one risked a fiftieth part of the effects she risks it takes ever so long to believe it you dont know yet my dear fellow it is nt till one has been watching life for forty years that one finds out half of what shes up to therefore ones earlier things must inevitably contain a mass of rot and with what one sees on one side with its tongue in its cheek defying one to be real enough and on the other the bonnes gens rolling up their eyes at ones cynicism the situation has elements of the ludicrous which the artist himself is doubtless in a position to appreciate better than any one else of course one mustnt bother about the bonnes gens mark ambient went on while my thoughts reverted to his ladylike wife as interpreted by his remarkable sister  to sink your shaft deep and polish the plate through which people look into itthats what your work consists of i remember remarking  ah polishing ones platethat is the torment of execution he exclaimed jerking himself up and sitting forward the effort to arrive at a surfaceif you think a surface necessarysome people dont happily for them my dear fellow if you could see the surface i dream of as compared with the one with which i have to content myself life is really too short for artone hasnt time to make ones shell ideally hard firm and brightfirm and brightthe devilish thing has a way sometimes of being bright without being firm when i rap it with my knuckles it doesnt give the right sound there are horrible little flabby spots where i have taken the secondbest word because i could nt for the life of me think of the best if you knew how stupid i am sometimes they look to me now like pimples and ulcers on the brow of beauty  thats very badvery bad i said as gravely as i could  very bad its the highest social offence i know it oughtit absolutely oughtim quite seriousto be capital if i knew i should be hanged else i should manage to find the best word the people who could ntsome of them dont know it when they see itwould shut their inkstands and we should nt be deluged by this flood of rubbish  i will not attempt to repeat everything that passed between us or to explain just how it was that every moment i spent in his company mark ambient revealed to me more and more that he looked at all things from the standpoint of the artist felt all life as literary material there are people who will tell me that this is a poor way of feeling it and i am not concerned to defend my statement having space merely to remark that there is something to be said for any interest which makes a man feel so much if mark ambient did really as i suggested above have imaginative contact with all life i for my part envy him his arrierepensée at any rate it was through the receipt of this impression of him that by the time we returned i had acquired the feeling of intimacy i have noted before we got up for the homeward stretch he alluded to his wifes having onceor perhaps more than onceasked him whether he should like dolcino to read beltraffio i think he was unconscious at the moment of all that this conveyed to meas well doubtless of my extreme curiosity to hear what he had replied he had said that he hoped very much dolcino would read all his workswhen he was twenty he should like him to know what his father had done before twenty it would be useless he would nt understand them  and meanwhile do you propose to hide themto lock them up in a drawer mrs ambient had inquired  oh no we must simply tell him that they are not intended for small boys if you bring him up properly after that he won t touch them  to this mrs ambient had made answer that it would be very awkward when he was about fifteen and i asked her husband if it was his opinion in general then that young people should not read novels  good onescertainly not said my companion i suppose i had had other views for i remember saying that for myself i was not sure it was bad for them if the novels were good enough bad for them i dont say so much ambient exclaimed but very bad i am afraid for the novel that oblique accidental allusion to his wifes attitude was followed by a franker style of reference as we walked home the difference between us is simply the opposition between two distinct ways of looking at the world which have never succeeded in getting on together or making any kind of common ménage since the beginning of time they have borne all sorts of names and my wife would tell you its the difference between christian and pagan i may be a pagan but i dont like the name it sounds sectarian she thinks me at any rate no better than an ancient greek its the difference between making the most of life and making the least so that you ll get another better one in some other time and place will it be a sin to make the most of that one too i wonder and shall we have to be bribed off in the future state as well as in the present perhaps i care too much for beautyi dont know i delight in it i adore it i think of it continually i try to produce it to reproduce it my wife holds that we shouldnt think too much about it shes always afraid of that always on her guard i dont know what she has got on her back and shes so pretty too herself dont you think shes lovely she was at any rate when i married her at that time i was nt aware of that difference i speak ofi thought it all came to the same thing in the end as they say well perhaps it will in the end i dont know what the end will be moreover i care for seeing things as they are thats the way i try to show them in my novels but you must nt talk to mrs ambient about things as they are she has a mortal dread of things as they are  shes afraid of them for dolcino i said surprised a moment afterwards at being in a positionthanks to miss ambientto be so explanatory and surprised even now that mark should nt have shown visibly that he wondered what the deuce i knew about it but he did nt he simply exclaimed with a tenderness that touched me  ah nothing shall ever hurt him he told me more about his wife before we arrived at the gate of his house and if it be thought that he was querulous i am afraid i must admit that he had some of the foibles as well as the gifts of the artistic temperament adding however instantly that hitherto to the best of my belief he had very rarely complained she thinks me immoralthats the long and short of it he said as we paused outside a moment and his hand rested on one of the bars of his gate while his conscious demonstrative expressive perceptive eyesthe eyes of a foreigner i had begun to account them much more than of the usual englishmanviewing me now evidently as quite a familiar friend took part in the declaration its very strange when one thinks it all over and theres a grand comicality in it which i should like to bring out she is a very nice woman extraordinarily well behaved upright and clever and with a tremendous lot of good sense about a good many matters yet her conception of a novelshe has explained it to me once or twice and she does nt do it badly as expositionis a thing so false that it makes me blush it is a thing so hollow so dishonest so lying in which life is so blinked and blinded so dodged and disfigured that it makes my ears burn its two different ways of looking at the whole affair he repeated pushing open the gate and they are irreconcilable he added with a sigh we went forward to the house but on the walk half way to the door he stopped and said to me if you are going into this kind of thing theres a fact you should know beforehand it may save you some disappointment theres a hatred of art theres a hatred of literature i looked up at the charming house with its genial color and crookedness and i answered with a smile that those evil passions might exist but that i should never have expected to find them there oh it doesnt matter after all he said laughing which i was glad to hear for i was reproaching myself with having excited him  if i had his excitement soon passed off for at lunch he was delightful strangely delightful considering that the difference between himself and his wife was as he had said irreconcilable he had the art by his manner by his smile by his natural kindliness of reducing the importance of it in the common concerns of life and mrs ambient i must add lent herself to this transaction with a very good grace i watched her at table for further illustrations of that fixed idea of which miss ambient had spoken to me for in the light of the united revelations of her sisterinlaw and her husband she had come to seem to me a very singular personage i am obliged to say that the signs of a fanatical temperament were not more striking in my hostess than before it was only after a while that her air of incorruptible conformity her tapering monosyllabic correctness began to appear to be themselves a cold thin flame certainly at first she looked like a woman with as few passions as possible but if she had a passion at all it would be that of philistinism she might have beenfor there are guardianspirits i suppose of all great principlesthe angel of propriety mark ambient apparently ten years before had simply perceived that she was an angel without asking himself of what he had been quite right in calling my attention to her beauty in looking for the reason why he should have married her i saw more than before that she was physically speaking a wonderfully cultivated human plantthat she must have given him many ideas and images it was impossible to be more pencilled more gardenlike more delicately tinted and petalled  if i had had it in my heart to think ambient a little of a hypocrite for appearing to forget at table everything he had said to me during our walk i should instantly have cancelled such a judgment on reflecting that the good news his wife was able to give him about their little boy was reason enough for his sudden air of happiness it may have come partly too from a certain remorse at having complained to me of the fair lady who sat therea desire to show me that he was after all not so miserable dolcino continued to be much better and he had been promised he should come downstairs after he had had his dinner as soon as we had risen from our own meal ambient slipped away evidently for the purpose of going to his child and no sooner had i observed this than i became aware that his wife had simultaneously vanished it happened that miss ambient and i both at the same moment saw the tail of her dress whisk out of a doorway which led the young lady to smile at me as if i now knew all the secrets of the ambients i passed with her into the garden and we sat down on a dear old bench which rested against the west wall of the house it was a perfect spot for the middle period of a sunday in june and its felicity seemed to come partly from an antique sundial which rising in front of us and forming the centre of a small intricate parterre measured the moments ever so slowly and made them safe for leisure and talk the garden bloomed in the suffused afternoon the tall beeches stood still for an example and behind and above us a rosetree of many seasons clinging to the faded grain of the brick expressed the whole character of the place in a familiar exquisite smell it seemed to me a place for genius to have every sanction and not to encounter challenges and checks miss ambient asked me if i had enjoyed my walk with her brother and whether we had talked of many things  well of most things i said smiling though i remembered that we had not talked of miss ambient  and dont you think some of his theories are very peculiar  oh i guess i agree with them all i was very particular for miss ambients entertainment to guess  do you think art is everything she inquired in a moment  in art of course i do  and do you think beauty is everything  i dont know about its being everything but its very delightful  of course it is difficult for a woman to know how far to go said my companion i adore everything that gives a charm to life i am intensely sensitive to form but sometimes i draw backdont you see what i meani dont quite see where i shall be landed i only want to be quiet after all miss ambient continued in a tone of stifled yearning which seemed to indicate that she had not yet arrived at her desire and one must be good at any rate must not one she inquired with a cadence apparently intended for an assurance that my answer would settle this recondite question for her it was difficult for me to make it very original and i am afraid i repaid her confidence with an unblushing platitude i remember moreover appending to it an inquiry equally destitute of freshness and still more wanting perhaps in tact as to whether she did not mean to go to church as that was an obvious way of being good she replied that she had performed this duty in the morning and that for her on sunday afternoon supreme virtue consisted in answering the weeks letters then suddenly without transition she said to me its quite a mistake about dolcino being better i have seen him and hes not at all right  surely his mother would know would nt she i suggested  she appeared for a moment to be counting the leaves on one of the great beeches as regards most matters one can easily say what in a given situation my sisterinlaw would do but as regards this one there are strange elements at work  strange elements do you mean in the constitution of the child  no i mean in my sisterinlaws feelings  elements of affection of course elements of anxiety why do you call them strange  she repeated my words elements of affection elements of anxiety she is very anxious  miss ambient made me vaguely uneasy she almost frightened me and i wished she would go and write her letters his father will have seen him now i said and if he is not satisfied he will send for the doctor  the doctor ought to have been here this morning he lives only two miles away  i reflected that all this was very possibly only a part of the general tragedy of miss ambients view of things but i asked her why she had nt urged such a necessity upon her sisterinlaw she answered me with a smile of extraordinary significance and told me that i must have very little idea of what her relations with beatrice were but i must do her the justice to add that she went on to make herself a little more comprehensible by saying that it was quite reason enough for her sister not to be alarmed that mark would be sure to be he was always nervous about the child and as they were predestined by nature to take opposite views the only thing for beatrice was to cultivate a false optimism if mark were not there she would not be at all easy i remembered what he had said to me about their dealings with dolcinothat between them they would put an end to him but i did not repeat this to miss ambient the less so that just then her brother emerged from the house carrying his child in his arms close behind him moved his wife grave and pale the boys face was turned over ambients shoulder towards his mother we got up to receive the group and as they came near us dolcino turned round i caught on his enchanting little countenance a smile of recognition and for the moment would have been quite content with it miss ambient however received another impression and i make haste to say that her quick sensibility in which there was something maternal argues that in spite of her affectations there was a strain of kindness in her it wont do at allit wont do at all she said to me under her breath i shall speak to mark about the doctor  the child was rather white but the main difference i saw in him was that he was even more beautiful than the day before he had been dressed in his festal garmentsa velvet suit and a crimson sashand he looked like a little invalid prince too young to know condescension and smiling familiarly on his subjects  put him down mark hes not comfortable mrs ambient said  should you like to stand on your feet my boy his father asked  oh yes i m remarkably well said the child  mark placed him on the ground he had shining pointed slippers with enormous bows are you happy now mr ambient  oh yes i am particularly happy dolcino replied the words were scarcely out of his mouth when his mother caught him up and in a moment holding him on her knees she took her place on the bench where miss ambient and i had been sitting this young lady said something to her brother in consequence of which the two wandered away into the garden together i remained with mrs ambient but as a servant had brought out a couple of chairs i was not obliged to seat myself beside her our conversation was not animated and i for my part felt there would be a kind of hypocrisy in my trying to make myself agreeable to mrs ambient i didnt dislike heri rather admired her but i was aware that i differed from her inexpressibly then i suspected what i afterwards definitely knew and have already intimated that the poor lady had taken a dislike to me and this of course was not encouraging she thought me an obtrusive and even depraved young man whom a perverse providence had dropped upon their quiet lawn to flatter her husbands worst tendencies she did me the honor to say to miss ambient who repeated the speech that she didnt know when she had seen her husband take such a fancy to a visitor and she measured apparently my evil influence by marks appreciation of my society i had a consciousness not yet acute but quite sufficient of all this but i must say that if it chilled my flow of smalltalk it did nt prevent me from thinking that the beautiful mother and beautiful child interlaced there against their background of roses made a picture such as i perhaps should not soon see again i was free i supposed to go into the house and write letters to sit in the drawingroom to repair to my own apartment and take a nap but the only use i made of my freedom was to linger still in my chair and say to myself that the light hand of sir joshua might have painted mark ambients wife and son i found myself looking perpetually at dolcino and dolcino looked back at me and that was enough to detain me when he looked at me he smiled and i felt it was an absolute impossibility to abandon a child who was smiling at one like that his eyes never wandered they attached themselves to mine as if among all the small incipient things of his nature there was a desire to say something to me if i could have taken him upon my own knee he perhaps would have managed to say it but it would have been far too delicate a matter to ask his mother to give him up and it has remained a constant regret for me that on that sunday afternoon i did not even for a moment hold dolcino in my arms he had said that he felt remarkably well and that he was especially happy but though he may have been happy with his charming head pillowed on his mothers breast and his little crimson silk legs depending from her lap i did not think he looked well he made no attempt to walk about he was content to swing his legs softly and strike one as languid and angelic  mark came back to us with his sister and miss ambient making some remark about having to attend to her correspondence passed into the house mark came and stood in front of his wife looking down at the child who immediately took hold of his hand keeping it while he remained i think ailingham ought to see him ambient said i think i will walk over and fetch him  that s gwendolens idea i suppose mrs ambient replied very sweetly  its not such an outoftheway idea when ones child is ill  i m not ill papa i m much better now dolcino remarked  is that the truth or are you only saying it to be agreeable you have a great idea of being agreeable you know  the boy seemed to meditate on this distinction this imputation for a moment then his exaggerated eyes which had wandered caught my own as i watched him do you think me agreeable he inquired with the candor of his age and with a smile that made his father turn round to me laughing and ask mutely with a glance is nt he adorable  then why dont you hop about if you feel so lusty ambient went on while the boy swung his hand  because mamma is holding me close  oh yes i know how mamma holds you when i come near ambient exclaimed looking at his wife  she turned her charming eyes up to him without deprecation or concession and after a moment she said you can go for allingham if you like i think myself it would be better you ought to drive  she says that to get me away ambient remarked to me laughing after which he started for the doctors  i remained there with mrs ambient though our conversation had more pauses than speeches the boys little fixed white face seemed as before to plead with me to stay and after a while it produced still another effect a very curious one which i shall find it difficult to express of course i expose myself to the charge of attempting to give fantastic reasons for an act which may have been simply the fruit of a native want of discretion and indeed the traceable consequences of that perversity were too lamentable to leave me any desire to trifle with the question all i can say is that i acted in perfect good faith and that dolcinos friendly little gaze gradually kindled the spark of my inspiration what helped it to glow were the other influencesthe silent suggestive gardennook the perfect opportunity if it was not an opportunity for that it was an opportunity for nothing and the plea that i speak of which issued from the childs eyes and seemed to make him say the mother that bore me and that presses me here to her bosomsympathetic little organism that i amhas really the kind of sensibility which she has been represented to you as lacking if you only look for it patiently and respectfully how is it possible that she should nt have it how is it possible that i should have so much of it for i am quite full of it dear strange gentleman if it were not also in some degree in her i am my fathers child but i am also my mothers and i am sorry for the difference between them so it shaped itself before me the vision of reconciling mrs ambient with her husband of putting an end to their great disagreement the project was absurd of course for had i not had his word for itspoken with all the bitterness of experiencethat the gulf that divided them was wellnigh bottomless nevertheless a quarter of an hour after mark had left us i said to his wife that i could nt get over what she told me the night before about her thinking her husbands writings objectionable i had been so very sorry to hear it had thought of it constantly and wondered whether it were not possible to make her change her mind mrs ambient gave me rather a cold stare she seemed to be recommending me to mind my own business i wish i had taken this mute counsel but i did not i went on to remark that it seemed an immense pity so much that was beautiful should be lost upon her  nothing is lost upon me said mrs ambient i know they are very beautiful  dont you like papas books dolcino asked addressing his mother but still looking at me then he added to me wont you read them to me american gentleman  i would rather tell you some stories of my own i said i know some that are very interesting when will you tell them tomorrow tomorrow with pleasure if that suits you mrs ambient was silent at this her husband during our walk had asked me to remain another day my promise to her son was an implication that i had consented and it is not probable that the prospect was agreeable to her this ought doubtless to have made me more careful as to what i said next but all i can say is that it did nt i presently observed that just after leaving her the evening before and after hearing her apply to her husbands writings the epithet i had already quoted i had on going up to my room sat down to the perusal of those sheets of his new book which he had been so good as to lend me i had sat entranced till nearly three in the morning i had read them twice over you say you have nt looked at them i think it s such a pity you should nt do let me beg you to take them up they are so very remarkable i m sure they will convert you they place him inreallysuch a dazzling light all that is best in him is there i have no doubt its a great liberty my saying all this but excuse me and do read them  do read them mamma dolcino repeated do read them  she bent her head and closed his lips with a kiss of course i know he has worked immensely over them she said and after this she made no remark but sat there looking thoughtful with her eyes on the ground the tone of these last words was such as to leave me no spirit for further pressure and after expressing a fear that her husband had not found the doctor at home i got up and took a turn about the grounds when i came back ten minutes later she was still in her place watching her boy who had fallen asleep in her lap as i drew near she put her finger to her lips and a moment afterwards she rose holding the child and murmured something about its being better that he should go upstairs i offered to carry him and held out my hands to take him but she thanked me and turned away with the child seated on her arm his head on her shoulder i am very strong she said as she passed into the house and her slim flexible figure bent backwards with the filial weight so i never touched dolcino  i betook myself to ambients study delighted to have a quiet hour to look over his books by myself the windows were open into the garden the sunny stillness the mild light of the english summer filled the room without quite chasing away the rich dusky tone which was a part of its charm and which abode in the serried shelves where old morocco exhaled the fragrance of curious learning and in the brighter intervals where medals and prints and miniatures were suspended upon a surface of faded stuff the place had both color and quiet i thought it a perfect room for work and went so far as to say to myself that if it were mine to sit and scribble in there was no knowing but that i might learn to write as well as the author of beltraffio this distinguished man did not turn up and i rummaged freely among his treasures at last i took down a book that detained me awhile and seated myself in a fine old leather chair by the window to turn it over i had been occupied in this way for halfanhoura good part of the afternoon had wanedwhen i became conscious of another presence in the room and looking up from my quarto saw that mrs ambient having pushed open the door in the same noiseless way that marked or disguised her entrance the night before had advanced across the threshold on seeing me she stopped she had not i think expected to find me but her hesitation was only of a moment she came straight to her husbands writingtable as if she were looking for something i got up and asked her if i could help her she glanced about an instant and then put her hand upon a roll of papers which i recognized as i had placed it in that spot in the morning on coming down from my room  is this the new book she asked holding it up the very sheets with precious annotations i mean to take your advice and she tucked the little bundle under her arm i congratulated her cordially and ventured to make of my triumph as i presumed to call it a subject of pleasantry but she was perfectly grave and turned away from me as she had presented herself without a smile after which i settled down to my quarto again with the reflection that mrs ambient was a queer woman my triumph too suddenly seemed to me rather vain a woman who could nt smile in the right place would never understand mark ambient he came in at last in person having brought the doctor back with him he was away from home mark said and i went after him to where he was supposed to be he had left the place and i followed him to two or three others which accounts for my delay he was now with mrs ambient looking at the child and was to see mark again before leaving the house my host noticed at the end of ten minutes that the proofsheets of his new book had been removed from the table and when i told him in reply to his question as to what i knew about them that mrs ambient had carried them off to read he turned almost pale for an instant with surprise what has suddenly made her so curious he exclaimed and i was obliged to tell him that i was at the bottom of the mystery i had had it on my conscience to assure her that she really ought to know of what her husband was capable of what i am capable elle ne sen dottie que trop said ambient with a laugh but he took my meddling very goodnaturedly and contented himself with adding that he was very much afraid she would burn up the sheets with his emendations of which he had no duplicate the doctor paid a long visit in the nursery and before he came down i retired to my own quarters where i remained till dinnertime on entering the drawingroom at this hour i found miss ambient in possession as she had been the evening before  i was right about dolcino she said as soon as she saw me with a strange little air of triumph he is really very ill  very ill why when i last saw him at four oclock he was in fairly good form  there has been a change for the worse very sudden and rapid and when the doctor got here he found diphtheritic symptoms he ought to have been called as i knew in the morning and the child ought nt to have been brought into the garden  my dear lady he was very happy there i answered much appalled  he would be happy anywhere i have no doubt he is happy now with his poor little throat in a state she dropped her voice as her brother came in and mark let us know that as a matter of course mrs ambient would not appear it was true that dolcino had developed diphtheritic symptoms but he was quiet for the present and his mother was earnestly watching him she was a perfect nurse mark said and the doctor was coming back at ten oclock our dinner was not very gay ambient was anxious and alarmed and his sister irritated me by her constant tacit assumption conveyed in the very way she nibbled her bread and sipped her wine of having told me so i had had no disposition to deny anything she told me and i could not see that her satisfaction in being justified by the event made poor dolcinos throat any better the truth is that as the sequel proved miss ambient had some of the qualities of the sibyl and had therefore perhaps a right to the sibylline contortions her brother was so preoccupied that i felt my presence to be an indiscretion and was sorry i had promised to remain over the morrow i said to mark that evidently i had better leave them in the morning to which he replied that on the contrary if he was to pass the next days in the fidgets my company would be an extreme relief to him the fidgets had already begun for him poor fellow and as we sat in his study with our cigars after dinner he wandered to the door whenever he heard the sound of the doctors wheels miss ambient who shared this apartment with us gave me at such moments significant glances she had gone upstairs before rejoining us to ask after the child his mother and his nurse gave a tolerable account of him but miss ambient found his fever high and his symptoms very grave the doctor came at ten oclock and i went to bed after hearing from mark that he saw no present cause for alarm he had made every provision for the night and was to return early in the morning  i quitted my room at eight oclock the next day and as i came downstairs saw through the open door of the house mrs ambient standing at the front gate of the grounds in colloquy with the physician she wore a white dressinggown but her shining hair was carefully tucked away in its net and in the freshness of the morning after a night of watching she looked as much the type of the lady as her sisterinlaw had described her her appearance i suppose ought to have reassured me but i was still nervous and uneasy so that i shrank from meeting her with the necessary question about dolcino none the less however was i impatient to learn how the morning found him and as mrs ambient had not seen me i passed into the grounds by a roundabout way and stopping at a further gate hailed the doctor just as he was driving away mrs ambient had returned to the house before he got into his gig  excuse me but as a friend of the family i should like very much to hear about the little boy  the doctor who was a stout sharp man looked at me from head to foot and then he said im sorry to say i have nt seen him  have nt seen him  mrs ambient came down to meet me as i alighted and told me that he was sleeping so soundly after a restless night that she did nt wish him disturbed i assured her i would nt disturb him but she said he was quite safe now and she could look after him herself  thank you very much are you coming back  no sir i ll be hanged if i come back exclaimed dr allingham who was evidently very angry and he started his horse again with the whip  i wandered back into the garden and five minutes later miss ambient came forth from the house to greet me she explained that breakfast would not be served for some time and that she wished to catch the doctor before he went away i informed her that this functionary had come and departed and i repeated to her what he had told me about his dismissal this made miss ambient very serious very serious indeed and she sank into a bench with dilated eyes hugging her elbows with crossed arms she indulged in many ejaculations she confessed that she was infinitely perplexed and she finally told me what her own last news of her nephew had been she had sat up very lateafter me after markand before going to bed had knocked at the door of the childs room which was opened to her by the nurse this good woman had admitted her and she had found dolcino quiet but flushed and unnatural with his mother sitting beside his bed she held his hand in one of hers said miss ambient and in the otherwhat do you thinkthe proofsheets of marks new book she was reading them there intently did you ever hear of anything so extraordinary such a very odd time to be reading an author whom she never could abide in her agitation miss ambient was guilty of this vulgarism of speech and i was so impressed by her narrative that it was only in recalling her words later that i noticed the lapse mrs ambient had looked up from her reading with her finger on her lipsi recognized the gesture she had addressed to me in the afternoonand though the nurse was about to go to rest had not encouraged her sisterinlaw to relieve her of any part of her vigil but certainly then dolcinos condition was far from reassuringhis poor little breathing was most painful and what change could have taken place in him in those few hours that would justify beatrice in denying the physician access to him this was the moral of miss ambients anecdote the moral for herself at least the moral for me rather was that it was a very singular time for mrs ambient to be going into a novelist she had never appreciated and who had simply happened to be recommended to her by a young american she disliked i thought of her sitting there in the sickchamber in the still hours of the night after the nurse had left her turning over those pages of genius and wrestling with their magical influence  i must relate very briefly the circumstances of the rest of my visit to mark ambientit lasted but a few hours longerand devote but three words to my later acquaintance with him that lasted five yearstill his deathand was full of interest of satisfaction and i may add of sadness the main thing to be said with regard to it is that i had a secret from him i believe he never suspected it though of this i am not absolutely sure if he did the line he had taken the line of absolute negation of the matter to himself shows an immense effort of the will i may tell my secret now giving it for what it is worth now that mark ambient has gone that he has begun to be alluded to as one of the famous early dead and that his wife does not survive him now too that miss ambient whom i also saw at intervals during the years that followed has with her embroideries and her attitudes her necromantic glances and strange intuitions retired to a sisterhood where as i am told she is deeply immured and quite lost to the world  mark came in to breakfast after his sister and i had for some time been seated there he shook hands with me in silence kissed his sister opened his letters and newspapers and pretended to drink his coffee but i could see that these movements were mechanical and i was little surprised when suddenly he pushed away everything that was before him and with his head in his hands and his elbows on the table sat staring strangely at the cloth  what is the matter fratello mio miss ambient inquired peeping from behind the urn  he answered nothing but got up with a certain violence and strode to the window we rose to our feet his sister and i by a common impulse exchanging a glance of some alarm while he stared for a moment into the garden in heavens name what has got possession of beatrice he cried at last turning round with an almost haggard face and he looked from one of us to the other the appeal was addressed to me as well as to his sister  miss ambient gave a shrug my poor mark beatrice is alwaysbeatrice  she has locked herself up with the boybolted and barred the door she refuses to let me come near him ambient went on  she refused to let the doctor see him an hour ago miss ambient remarked with intention as they say on the stage  refused to let the doctor see him by heaven i ll smash in the door and mark brought his fist down upon the table so that all the breakfastservice rang  i begged miss ambient to go up and try to have speech of her sisterinlaw and i drew mark out into the garden you re exceedingly nervous and mrs ambient is probably right i said to him women know women should be supreme in such a situation trust a mothera devoted mother my dear friend with such words as these i tried to soothe and comfort him and marvellous to relate i succeeded with the help of many cigarettes in making him walk about the garden and talk or listen at least to my own ingenious chatter for nearly an hour at the end of this time miss ambient returned to us with a very rapid step holding her hand to her heart  go for the doctor mark go for the doctor this moment  is he dying has she killed him poor ambient cried flinging away his cigarette  i dont know what she has done but shes frightened and now she wants the doctor  he told me he would be hanged if he came back i felt myself obliged to announce  preciselytherefore mark himself must go for him and not a messenger you must see him and tell him it s to save your child the trap has been orderedits ready  to save him i ll save him please god ambient cried bounding with his great strides across the lawn  as soon as he had gone i felt that i ought to have volunteered in his place and i said as much to miss ambient but she checked me by grasping my arm quickly while we heard the wheels of the dogcart rattle away from the gate hes offhes offand now i can think to get him awaywhile i thinkwhile i think  while you think of what miss ambient  of the unspeakable thing that has happened under this roof  her manner was habitually that of such a prophetess of ill that my first impulse was to believe i must allow here for a great exaggeration but in a moment i saw that her emotion was real dolcino is dying thenhe is dead  its too late to save him his mother has let him die i tell you that because you are sympathetic because you have imagination miss ambient was good enough to add interrupting my expression of horror thats why you had the idea of making her read marks new book  what has that to do with it i dont understand you your accusation is monstrous  i see it all im not stupid miss ambient went on heedless of the harshness of my tone it was the book that finished her it was that decided her  decided her do you mean she has murdered her child i demanded trembling at my own words  she sacrificed him she determined to do nothing to make him live why else did she lock herself up why else did she turn away the doctor the book gave her a horror she determined to rescue himto prevent him from ever being touched he had a crisis at two oclock in the morning i know that from the nurse who had left her then but whom for a short time she called back dolcino got much worse but she insisted on the nurses going back to bed and after that she was alone with him for hours  do you pretend that she has no pity that shes insane  she held him in her arms she pressed him to her breast not to see him but she gave him no remedies she did nothing the doctor ordered everything is there untouched she has had the honesty not even to throw the drugs away  i dropped upon the nearest bench overcome with wonder and agitation quite as much at miss armbients terrible lucidity as at the charge she made against her sisterinlaw there was an amazing coherency in her story and it was dreadful to me to see myself figuring in it as so proximate a cause  you are a very strange woman and you say strange things  you think it necessary to protest but you are quite ready to believe me you have received an impression of my sisterinlaw you have guessed of what she is capable  i do not feel bound to say what concession on this point i made to miss ambient who went on to relate to me that within the last halfhour beatrice had had a revulsion that she was tremendously frightened at what she had done that her fright itself betrayed her and that she would now give heaven and earth to save the child let us hope she will i said looking at my watch and trying to time poor ambient whereupon my companion repeated in a singular tone let us hope so when i asked her if she herself could do nothing and whether she ought not to be with her sisterinlaw she replied you had better go and judge she is like a wounded tigress  i never saw mrs ambient till six months after this and therefore cannot pretend to have verified the comparison at the latter period she was again the type of the lady shell treat him better after this i remember miss ambient saying in response to some quick outburst on my part of compassion for her brother although i had been in the house but thirtysix hours this young lady had treated me with extraordinary confidence and there was therefore a certain demand which as an intimate i might make of her i extracted from her a pledge that she would never say to her brother what she had just said to me she would leave him to form his own theory of his wifes conduct she agreed with me that there was misery enough in the house without her contributing a new anguish and that mrs ambients proceedings might be explained to her husbands mind by the extravagance of a jealous devotion poor mark came back with the doctor much sooner than we could have hoped but we knew five minutes afterwards that they arrived too late poor little dolcino was more exquisitely beautiful in death than he had been in life mrs ambients grief was frantic she lost her head and said strange things as for marksbut i will not speak of that basta as he used to say miss ambient kept her secreti have already had occasion to say that she had her good pointsbut it rankled in her conscience like a guilty participation and i imagine had something to do with her retiring ultimately to a sisterhood and à propos of consciences the reader is now in a position to judge of my compunction for my effort to convert mrs ambient i ought to mention that the death of her child in some degree converted her when the new book came outit was long delayedshe read it over as a whole and her husband told me that a few months before her deathshe failed rapidly after losing her son sank into a consumption and faded away at mentoneduring those few supreme weeks she even dipped into beltraffio
