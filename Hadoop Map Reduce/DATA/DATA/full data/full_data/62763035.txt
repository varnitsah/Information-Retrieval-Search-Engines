candidacy of mr smith      xii  lenvoi the train to mariposa      preface  i know no way in which a writer may more fittingly introduce his work to the public than by giving a brief account of who and what he is by this means some of the blame for what he has done is very properly shifted to the extenuating circumstances of his life  i was born at swanmoor hants england on december 30 1869 i am not aware that there was any particular conjunction of the planets at the time but should think it extremely likely my parents migrated to canada in 1876 and i decided to go with them my father took up a farm near lake simcoe in ontario this was during the hard times of canadian farming and my father was just able by great diligence to pay the hired men and in years of plenty to raise enough grain to have seed for the next years crop without buying any by this process my brothers and i were inevitably driven off the land and have become professors business men and engineers instead of being able to grow up as farm labourers yet i saw enough of farming to speak exuberantly in political addresses of the joy of early rising and the deep sleep both of body and intellect that is induced by honest manual toil  i was educated at upper canada college toronto of which i was head boy in 1887 from there i went to the university of toronto where i graduated in 1891 at the university i spent my entire time in the acquisition of languages living dead and halfdead and knew nothing of the outside world in this diligent pursuit of words i spent about sixteen hours of each day very soon after graduation i had forgotten the languages and found myself intellectually bankrupt in other words i was what is called a distinguished graduate and as such i took to school teaching as the only trade i could find that need neither experience nor intellect i spent my time from 1891 to 1899 on the staff of upper canada college an experience which has left me with a profound sympathy for the many gifted and brilliant men who are compelled to spend their lives in the most dreary the most thankless and the worst paid profession in the world i have noted that of my pupils those who seemed the laziest and the least enamoured of books are now rising to eminence at the bar in business and in public life the really promising boys who took all the prizes are now able with difficulty to earn the wages of a clerk in a summer hotel or a deck hand on a canal boat  in 1899 i gave up school teaching in disgust borrowing enough money to live upon for a few months and went to the university of chicago to study economics and political science i was soon appointed to a fellowship in political economy and by means of this and some temporary employment by mcgill university i survived until i took the degree of doctor of philosophy in 1903 the meaning of this degree is that the recipient of instruction is examined for the last time in his life and is pronounced completely full after this no new ideas can be imparted to him  from this time and since my marriage which had occurred at this period i have belonged to the staff of mcgill university first as lecturer in political science and later as head of the department of economics and political science as this position is one of the prizes of my profession i am able to regard myself as singularly fortunate the emolument is so high as to place me distinctly above the policemen postmen streetcar conductors and other salaried officials of the neighbourhood while i am able to mix with the poorer of the business men of the city on terms of something like equality in point of leisure i enjoy more in the four corners of a single year than a business man knows in his whole life i thus have what the business man can never enjoy an ability to think and what is still better to stop thinking altogether for months at a time  i have written a number of things in connection with my college lifea book on political science and many essays magazine articles and so on i belong to the political science association of america to the royal colonial institute and to the church of england these things surely are a proof of respectability i have had some small connection with politics and public life a few years ago i went all round the british empire delivering addresses on imperial organization when i state that these lectures were followed almost immediately by the union of south africa the banana riots in trinidad and the turcoitalian war i think the reader can form some idea of their importance in canada i belong to the conservative party but as yet i have failed entirely in canadian politics never having received a contract to build a bridge or make a wharf nor to construct even the smallest section of the transcontinental railway this however is a form of national ingratitude to which one becomes accustomed in this dominion  apart from my college work i have written two books one called literary lapses and the other nonsense novels each of these is published by john lane london and new york and either of them can be obtained absurd though it sounds for the mere sum of three shillings and sixpence any reader of this preface for example ridiculous though it appears could walk into a bookstore and buy both of these books for seven shillings yet these works are of so humorous a character that for many years it was found impossible to print them the compositors fell back from their task suffocated with laughter and gasping for air nothing but the intervention of the linotype machineor rather of the kind of men who operate itmade it possible to print these books even now people have to be very careful in circulating them and the books should never be put into the hands of persons not in robust health  many of my friends are under the impression that i write these humorous nothings in idle moments when the wearied brain is unable to perform the serious labours of the economist my own experience is exactly the other way the writing of solid instructive stuff fortified by facts and figures is easy enough there is no trouble in writing a scientific treatise on the folklore of central china or a statistical enquiry into the declining population of prince edward island but to write something out of ones own mind worth reading for its own sake is an arduous contrivance only to be achieved in fortunate moments few and far between personally i would sooner have written alice in wonderland than the whole encyclopaedia britannica  in regard to the present work i must disclaim at once all intentions of trying to do anything so ridiculously easy as writing about a real place and real people mariposa is not a real town on the contrary it is about seventy or eighty of them you may find them all the way from lake superior to the sea with the same square streets and the same maple trees and the same churches and hotels and everywhere the sunshine of the land of hope  similarly the reverend mr drone is not one person but about eight or ten to make him i clapped the gaiters of one ecclesiastic round the legs of another added the sermons of a third and the character of a fourth and so let him start on his way in the book to pick up such individual attributes as he might find for himself mullins and bagshaw and judge pepperleigh and the rest are it is true personal friends of mine but i have known them in such a variety of forms with such alternations of tall and short dark and fair that individually i should have much ado to know them mr pupkin is found whenever a canadian bank opens a branch in a county town and needs a teller as for mr smith with his two hundred and eighty pounds his hoarse voice his loud check suit his diamonds the roughness of his address and the goodness of his heartall of this is known by everybody to be a necessary and universal adjunct of the hotel business  the inspiration of the booka land of hope and sunshine where little towns spread their square streets and their trim maple trees beside placid lakes almost within echo of the primeval forestis large enough if it fails in its portrayal of the scenes and the country that it depicts the fault lies rather with an art that is deficient than in an affection that is wanting  stephen leacock mcgill university june 1912     one the hostelry of mr smith  i dont know whether you know mariposa if not it is of no consequence for if you know canada at all you are probably well acquainted with a dozen towns just like it  there it lies in the sunlight sloping up from the little lake that spreads out at the foot of the hillside on which the town is built there is a wharf beside the lake and lying alongside of it a steamer that is tied to the wharf with two ropes of about the same size as they use on the lusitania the steamer goes nowhere in particular for the lake is landlocked and there is no navigation for the mariposa belle except to run trips on the first of july and the queens birthday and to take excursions of the knights of pythias and the sons of temperance to and from the local option townships  in point of geography the lake is called lake wissanotti and the river running out of it the ossawippi just as the main street of mariposa is called missinaba street and the county missinaba county but these names do not really matter nobody uses them people simply speak of the lake and the river and the main street much in the same way as they always call the continental hotel pete robinsons and the pharmaceutical hall eliots drug store but i suppose this is just the same in every one elses town as in mine so i need lay no stress on it  the town i say has one broad street that runs up from the lake commonly called the main street there is no doubt about its width when mariposa was laid out there was none of that shortsightedness which is seen in the cramped dimensions of wall street and piccadilly missinaba street is so wide that if you were to roll jeff thorpes barber shop over on its face it wouldnt reach half way across up and down the main street are telegraph poles of cedar of colossal thickness standing at a variety of angles and carrying rather more wires than are commonly seen at a transatlantic cable station  on the main street itself are a number of buildings of extraordinary importancesmiths hotel and the continental and the mariposa house and the two banks the commercial and the exchange to say nothing of mccarthys block erected in 1878 and glovers hardware store with the oddfellows hall above it then on the cross street that intersects missinaba street at the main corner there is the post office and the fire hall and the young mens christian association and the office of the mariposa newspacketin fact to the eye of discernment a perfect jostle of public institutions comparable only to threadneedle street or lower broadway on all the side streets there are maple trees and broad sidewalks trim gardens with upright calla lilies houses with verandahs which are here and there being replaced by residences with piazzas  to the careless eye the scene on the main street of a summer afternoon is one of deep and unbroken peace the empty street sleeps in the sunshine there is a horse and buggy tied to the hitching post in front of glovers hardware store there is usually and commonly the burly figure of mr smith proprietor of smiths hotel standing in his chequered waistcoat on the steps of his hostelry and perhaps further up the street lawyer macartney going for his afternoon mail or the rev mr drone the rural dean of the church of england church going home to get his fishing rod after a mothers auxiliary meeting  but this quiet is mere appearance in reality and to those who know it the place is a perfect hive of activity why at netleys butcher shop established in 1882 there are no less than four men working on the sausage machines in the basement at the newspacket office there are as many more jobprinting there is a long distance telephone with four distracting girls on high stools wearing steel caps and talking incessantly in the offices in mccarthys block are dentists and lawyers with their coats off ready to work at any moment and from the big planing factory down beside the lake where the railroad siding is you may hear all through the hours of the summer afternoon the longdrawn music of the running saw  busywell i should think so ask any of its inhabitants if mariposa isnt a busy hustling thriving town ask mullins the manager of the exchange bank who comes hustling over to his office from the mariposa house every day at 1030 and has scarcely time all morning to go out and take a drink with the manager of the commercial or askwell for the matter of that ask any of them if they ever knew a more rushing goahead town than mariposa  of course if you come to the place fresh from new york you are deceived your standard of vision is all astray you do think the place is quiet you do imagine that mr smith is asleep merely because he closes his eyes as he stands but live in mariposa for six months or a year and then you will begin to understand it better the buildings get higher and higher the mariposa house grows more and more luxurious mccarthys block towers to the sky the buses roar and hum to the station the trains shriek the traffic multiplies the people move faster and faster a dense crowd swirls to and fro in the postoffice and the five and ten cent storeand amusements well now lacrosse baseball excursions dances the firemans ball every winter and the catholic picnic every summer and musicthe town band in the park every wednesday evening and the oddfellows brass band on the street every other friday the mariposa quartette the salvation armywhy after a few months residence you begin to realize that the place is a mere mad round of gaiety  in point of population if one must come down to figures the canadian census puts the numbers every time at something round five thousand but it is very generally understood in mariposa that the census is largely the outcome of malicious jealousy it is usual that after the census the editor of the mariposa newspacket makes a careful reestimate based on the data of relative nonpayment of subscriptions and brings the population up to 6000 after that the mariposa timesherald makes an estimate that runs the figures up to 6500 then mr gingham the undertaker who collects the vital statistics for the provincial government makes an estimate from the number of what he calls the demised as compared with the less interesting persons who are still alive and brings the population to 7000 after that somebody else works it out that its 7500 then the man behind the bar of the mariposa house offers to bet the whole room that there are 9000 people in mariposa that settles it and the population is well on the way to 10000 when down swoops the federal census taker on his next round and the town has to begin all over again  still it is a thriving town and there is no doubt of it even the transcontinental railways as any townsman will tell you run through mariposa it is true that the trains mostly go through at night and dont stop but in the wakeful silence of the summer night you may hear the long whistle of the through train for the west as it tears through mariposa rattling over the switches and past the semaphores and ending in a long sullen roar as it takes the trestle bridge over the ossawippi or better still on a winter evening about eight oclock you will see the long row of the pullmans and diners of the night express going north to the mining country the windows flashing with brilliant light and within them a vista of cut glass and snowwhite table linen smiling negroes and millionaires with napkins at their chins whirling past in the driving snowstorm  i can tell you the people of mariposa are proud of the trains even if they dont stop the joy of being on the main line lifts the mariposa people above the level of their neighbours in such places as tecumseh and nichols corners into the cosmopolitan atmosphere of through traffic and the larger life of course they have their own train toothe mariposa local made up right there in the station yard and running south to the city a hundred miles away that of course is a real train with a box stove on end in the passenger car fed with cordwood upside down and with seventeen flat cars of pine lumber set between the passenger car and the locomotive so as to give the train its full impact when shunting  outside of mariposa there are farms that begin well but get thinner and meaner as you go on and end sooner or later in bush and swamp and the rock of the north country and beyond that again as the background of it all though its far away you are somehow aware of the great pine woods of the lumber country reaching endlessly into the north  not that the little town is always gay or always bright in the sunshine there never was such a place for changing its character with the season dark enough and dull it seems of a winter night the wooden sidewalks creaking with the frost and the lights burning dim behind the shop windows in olden times the lights were coal oil lamps now of course they are or are supposed to be electricity brought from the power house on the lower ossawippi nineteen miles away but somehow though it starts off as electricity from the ossawippi rapids by the time it gets to mariposa and filters into the little bulbs behind the frosty windows of the shops it has turned into coal oil again as yellow and bleared as ever  after the winter the snow melts and the ice goes out of the lake the sun shines high and the shantymen come down from the lumber woods and lie round drunk on the sidewalk outside of smiths hoteland thats spring time mariposa is then a fierce dangerous lumber town calculated to terrorize the soul of a newcomer who does not understand that this also is only an appearance and that presently the roughlooking shantymen will change their clothes and turn back again into farmers  then the sun shines warmer and the maple trees come out and lawyer macartney puts on his tennis trousers and thats summer time the little town changes to a sort of summer resort there are visitors up from the city every one of the seven cottages along the lake is full the mariposa belle churns the waters of the wissanotti into foam as she sails out from the wharf in a cloud of flags the band playing and the daughters and sisters of the knights of pythias dancing gaily on the deck  that changes too the days shorten the visitors disappear the golden rod beside the meadow droops and withers on its stem the maples blaze in glory and die the evening closes dark and chill and in the gloom of the main corner of mariposa the salvation army around a naphtha lamp lift up the confession of their sinsand that is autumn thus the year runs its round moving and changing in mariposa much as it does in other places  if then you feel that you know the town well enough to be admitted into the inner life and movement of it walk down this june afternoon half way down the main streetor if you like half way up from the wharfto where mr smith is standing at the door of his hostelry you will feel as you draw near that it is no ordinary man that you approach it is not alone the huge bulk of mr smith two hundred and eighty pounds as tested on netleys scales it is not merely his costume though the chequered waistcoat of dark blue with a flowered pattern forms with his shepherds plaid trousers his grey spats and patentleather boots a colour scheme of no mean order nor is it merely mr smiths finely mottled face the face no doubt is a notable onesolemn inexpressible unreadable the face of the heavenborn hotel keeper it is more than that it is the strange dominating personality of the man that somehow holds you captive i know nothing in history to compare with the position of mr smith among those who drink over his bar except though in a lesser degree the relation of the emperor napoleon to the imperial guard  when you meet mr smith first you think he looks like an overdressed pirate then you begin to think him a character you wonder at his enormous bulk then the utter hopelessness of knowing what smith is thinking by merely looking at his features gets on your mind and makes the mona lisa seem an open book and the ordinary human countenance as superficial as a puddle in the sunlight after you have had a drink in mr smiths bar and he has called you by your christian name you realize that you are dealing with one of the greatest minds in the hotel business  take for instance the big sign that sticks out into the street above mr smiths head as he stands what is on it jos smith prop nothing more and yet the thing was a flash of genius other men who had had the hotel before mr smith had called it by such feeble names as the royal hotel and the queens and the alexandria every one of them failed when mr smith took over the hotel he simply put up the sign with jos smith prop and then stood underneath in the sunshine as a living proof that a man who weighs nearly three hundred pounds is the natural king of the hotel business  but on this particular afternoon in spite of the sunshine and deep peace there was something as near to profound concern and anxiety as the features of mr smith were ever known to express  the moment was indeed an anxious one mr smith was awaiting a telegram from his legal adviser who had that day journeyed to the county town to represent the proprietors interest before the assembled license commissioners if you know anything of the hotel business at all you will understand that as beside the decisions of the license commissioners of missinaba county the opinions of the lords of the privy council are mere trifles  the matter in question was very grave the mariposa court had just fined mr smith for the second time for selling liquors after hours the commissioners therefore were entitled to cancel the license  mr smith knew his fault and acknowledged it he had broken the law how he had come to do so it passed his imagination to recall crime always seems impossible in retrospect by what sheer madness of the moment could he have shut up the bar on the night in question and shut judge pepperleigh the district judge in missinaba county outside of it the more so inasmuch as the closing up of the bar under the rigid license law of the province was a matter that the proprietor never trusted to any hands but his own punctually every night at 11 oclock mr smith strolled from the desk of the rotunda to the door of the bar if it seemed properly full of people and all was bright and cheerful then he closed it if not he kept it open a few minutes longer till he had enough people inside to warrant closing but never never unless he was assured that pepperleigh the judge of the court and macartney the prosecuting attorney were both safely in the bar or the bar parlour did the proprietor venture to close up yet on this fatal night pepperleigh and macartney had been shut outactually left on the street without a drink and compelled to hammer and beat at the street door of the bar to gain admittance  this was the kind of thing not to be tolerated either a hotel must be run decently or quit an information was laid next day and mr smith convicted in four minuteshis lawyers practically refusing to plead the mariposa court when the presiding judge was cold sober and it had the force of public opinion behind it was a terrible engine of retributive justice  so no wonder that mr smith awaited with anxiety the message of his legal adviser  he looked alternately up the street and down it again hauled out his watch from the depths of his embroidered pocket and examined the hour hand and the minute hand and the second hand with frowning scrutiny  then wearily and as one mindful that a hotel man is ever the servant of the public he turned back into the hotel  billy he said to the desk clerk if a wire comes bring it into the bar parlour  the voice of mr smith is of a deep guttural such as plancon or edouard de reske might have obtained had they had the advantages of the hotel business and with that mr smith as was his custom in off moments joined his guests in the back room his appearance to the untrained eye was merely that of an extremely stout hotelkeeper walking from the rotunda to the back bar in reality mr smith was on the eve of one of the most brilliant and daring strokes ever effected in the history of licensed liquor when i say that it was out of the agitation of this situation that smiths ladies and gents cafe originated anybody who knows mariposa will understand the magnitude of the moment  mr smith then moved slowly from the doorway of the hotel through the rotunda or more simply the front room with the desk and the cigar case in it and so to the bar and thence to the little room or back bar behind it in this room as i have said the brightest minds of mariposa might commonly be found in the quieter part of a summer afternoon  today there was a group of four who looked up as mr smith entered somewhat sympathetically and evidently aware of the perplexities of the moment  henry mullins and george duff the two bank managers were both present mullins is a rather short rather round smoothshaven man of less than forty wearing one of those round banking suits of pepper and salt with a round banking hat of hard straw and with the kind of gold tiepin and heavy watchchain and seals necessary to inspire confidence in matters of foreign exchange duff is just as round and just as short and equally smoothly shaven while his seals and straw hat are calculated to prove that the commercial is just as sound a bank as the exchange from the technical point of view of the banking business neither of them had any objection to being in smiths hotel or to taking a drink as long as the other was present this of course was one of the cardinal principles of mariposa banking  then there was mr diston the high school teacher commonly known as the one who drank none of the other teachers ever entered a hotel unless accompanied by a lady or protected by a child but as mr diston was known to drink beer on occasions and to go in and out of the mariposa house and smiths hotel he was looked upon as a man whose life was a mere wreck whenever the school board raised the salaries of the other teachers fifty or sixty dollars per annum at one lift it was well understood that public morality wouldnt permit of an increase for mr diston  still more noticeable perhaps was the quiet sallow looking man dressed in black with black gloves and with black silk hat heavily craped and placed hollowsideup on a chair this was mr golgotha gingham the undertaker of mariposa and his dress was due to the fact that he had just come from what he called an interment mr gingham had the true spirit of his profession and such words as funeral or coffin or hearse never passed his lips he spoke always of interments of caskets and coaches using terms that were calculated rather to bring out the majesty and sublimity of death than to parade its horrors  to be present at the hotel was in accord with mr ginghams general conception of his business no man had ever grasped the true principles of undertaking more thoroughly than mr gingham i have often heard him explain that to associate with the living uninteresting though they appear is the only way to secure the custom of the dead  get to know people really well while they are alive said mr gingham be friends with them close friends and then when they die you dont need to worry youll get the order every time  so naturally as the moment was one of sympathy it was mr gingham who spoke first  whatll you do josh he said if the commissioners go against you  boys said mr smith i dont rightly know if i have to quit the next move is to the city but i dont reckon that i will have to quit ive got an idee that i thinks good every time  could you run a hotel in the city asked mullins  i could said mr smith ill tell you theres big things doin in the hotel business right now big chances if you go into it right hotels in the city is branching out why you take the diningroom side of it continued mr smith looking round at the group theres thousands in it the old plans all gone folks wont eat now in an ordinary diningroom with a high ceiling and windows you have to get em down underground in a room with no windows and lots of sawdust round and waiters that cant speak english i seen them places last time i was in the city they call em rats coolers and for light meals they want a caff a real french caff and for folks that come in late another place that they call a girl room that dont shut up at all if i go to the city thats the kind of place i mean to run whats yours gol its on the house  and it was just at the moment when mr smith said this that billy the deskclerk entered the room with the telegram in his hand  but stopit is impossible for you to understand the anxiety with which mr smith and his associates awaited the news from the commissioners without first realizing the astounding progress of mr smith in the three past years and the pinnacle of public eminence to which he had attained  mr smith had come down from the lumber country of the spanish river where the divide is toward the hudson bayback north as they called it in mariposa  he had been it was said a cook in the lumber shanties to this day mr smith can fry an egg on both sides with a lightness of touch that is the despair of his own help  after that he had run a river drivers boardinghouse  after that he had taken a food contract for a gang of railroad navvies on the transcontinental  after that of course the whole world was open to him  he came down to mariposa and bought out the inside of what had been the royal hotel  those who are educated understand that by the inside of a hotel is meant everything except the four outer walls of itthe fittings the furniture the bar billy the deskclerk the three diningroom girls and above all the license granted by king edward vii and ratified further by king george for the sale of intoxicating liquors  till then the royal had been a mere nothing as smiths hotel it broke into a blaze of effulgence  from the first mr smith as a proprietor was a wild rapturous success  he had all the qualifications  he weighed two hundred and eighty pounds  he could haul two drunken men out of the bar each by the scruff of the neck without the faintest anger or excitement  he carried money enough in his trousers pockets to start a bank and spent it on anything bet it on anything and gave it away in handfuls  he was never drunk and as a point of chivalry to his customers never quite sober anybody was free of the hotel who cared to come in anybody who didnt like it could go out drinks of all kinds cost five cents or six for a quarter meals and beds were practically free any persons foolish enough to go to the desk and pay for them mr smith charged according to the expression of their faces  at first the loafers and the shanty men settled down on the place in a shower but that was not the trade that mr smith wanted he knew how to get rid of them an army of charwomen turned into the hotel scrubbed it from top to bottom a vacuum cleaner the first seen in mariposa hissed and screamed in the corridors forty brass beds were imported from the city not of course for the guests to sleep in but to keep them out a bartender with a starched coat and wicker sleeves was put behind the bar  the loafers were put out of business the place had become too high toned for them  to get the high class trade mr smith set himself to dress the part he wore wide cut coats of filmy serge light as gossamer chequered waistcoats with a pattern for every day in the week fedora hats light as autumn leaves fourinhand ties of saffron and myrtle green with a diamond pin the size of a hazel nut on his fingers there were as many gems as would grace a native prince of india across his waistcoat lay a gold watchchain in huge square links and in his pocket a gold watch that weighed a pound and a half and marked minutes seconds and quarter seconds just to look at josh smiths watch brought at least ten men to the bar every evening  every morning mr smith was shaved by jefferson thorpe across the way all that art could do all that florida water could effect was lavished on his person  mr smith became a local character mariposa was at his feet all the reputable businessmen drank at mr smiths bar and in the little parlour behind it you might find at any time a group of the brightest intellects in the town  not but what there was opposition at first the clergy for example who accepted the mariposa house and the continental as a necessary and useful evil looked askance at the blazing lights and the surging crowd of mr smiths saloon they preached against him when the rev dean drone led off with a sermon on the text lord be merciful even unto this publican matthew six it was generally understood as an invitation to strike mr smith dead in the same way the sermon at the presbyterian church the week after was on the text lo what now doeth abiram in the land of melchisideck kings eight and nine and it was perfectly plain that what was meant was lo what is josh smith doing in mariposa  but this opposition had been countered by a wide and sagacious philanthropy i think mr smith first got the idea of that on the night when the steam merrygoround came to mariposa just below the hostelry on an empty lot it whirled and whistled steaming forth its tunes on the summer evening while the children crowded round it in hundreds down the street strolled mr smith wearing a soft fedora to indicate that it was evening  what dyou charge for a ride boss said mr smith  two for a nickel said the man  take that said mr smith handing out a tendollar bill from a roll of money and ride the little folks free all evening  that night the merrygoround whirled madly till after midnight freighted to capacity with mariposa children while up in smiths hotel parents friends and admirers as the news spread were standing four deep along the bar they sold forty dollars worth of lager alone that night and mr smith learned if he had not already suspected it the blessedness of giving  the uses of philanthropy went further mr smith subscribed to everything joined everything gave to everything he became an oddfellow a forester a knight of pythias and a workman he gave a hundred dollars to the mariposa hospital and a hundred dollars to the young mens christian association  he subscribed to the ball club the lacrosse club the curling club to anything in fact and especially to all those things which needed premises to meet in and grew thirsty in their discussions  as a consequence the oddfellows held their annual banquet at smiths hotel and the oyster supper of the knights of pythias was celebrated in mr smiths diningroom  even more effective perhaps were mr smiths secret benefactions the kind of giving done by stealth of which not a soul in town knew anything often for a week after it was done it was in this way that mr smith put the new font in dean drones church and handed over a hundred dollars to judge pepperleigh for the unrestrained use of the conservative party  so it came about that little by little the antagonism had died down smiths hotel became an accepted institution in mariposa even the temperance people were proud of mr smith as a sort of character who added distinction to the town there were moments in the earlier quiet of the morning when dean drone would go so far as to step in to the rotunda and collect a subscription as for the salvation army they ran in and out all the time unreproved  on only one point difficulty still remained that was the closing of the bar mr smith could never bring his mind to itnot as a matter of profit but as a point of honour it was too much for him to feel that judge pepperleigh might be out on the sidewalk thirsty at midnight that the night hands of the timesherald on wednesday might be compelled to go home dry on this point mr smiths moral code was simplicity itselfdo what is right and take the consequences so the bar stayed open  every town i suppose has its meaner spirits in every genial bosom some snake is warmedor as mr smith put it to golgotha ginghamthere are some fellers even in this town skunks enough to inform  at first the mariposa court quashed all indictments the presiding judge with his spectacles on and a pile of books in front of him threatened the informer with the penitentiary the whole bar of mariposa was with mr smith but by sheer iteration the informations had proved successful judge pepperleigh learned that mr smith had subscribed a hundred dollars for the liberal party and at once fined him for keeping open after hours that made one conviction on the top of this had come the untoward incident just mentioned and that made two beyond that was the deluge this then was the exact situation when billy the desk clerk entered the back bar with the telegram in his hand  heres your wire sir he said  what does it say said mr smith  he always dealt with written documents with a fine air of detachment i dont suppose there were ten people in mariposa who knew that mr smith couldnt read  billy opened the message and read commissioners give you three months to close down  let me read it said mr smith thats right three months to close down  there was dead silence when the message was read everybody waited for mr smith to speak mr gingham instinctively assumed the professional air of hopeless melancholy  as it was afterwards recorded mr smith stood and studied with the tray in his hand for at least four minutes then he spoke  boys he said ill be darned if i close down till im ready to close down ive got an idee you wait and ill show you  and beyond that not another word did mr smith say on the subject  but within fortyeight hours the whole town knew that something was doing the hotel swarmed with carpenters bricklayers and painters there was an architect up from the city with a bundle of blue prints in his hand there was an engineer taking the street level with a theodolite and a gang of navvies with shovels digging like fury as if to dig out the back foundations of the hotel  thatll fool em said mr smith  half the town was gathered round the hotel crazy with excitement but not a word would the proprietor say great dray loads of square timber and twobyeight pine joists kept arriving from the planing mill there was a pile of matched spruce sixteen feet high lying by the sidewalk  then the excavation deepened and the dirt flew and the beams went up and the joists across and all the day from dawn till dusk the hammers of the carpenters clattered away working overtime at time and a half  it dont matter what it costs said mr smith get it done  rapidly the structure took form it extended down the side street joining the hotel at a right angle spacious and graceful it looked as it reared its uprights into the air  already you could see the place where the row of windows was to come a veritable palace of glass it must be so wide and commodious were they below it you could see the basement shaping itself with a low ceiling like a vault and big beams running across dressed smoothed and ready for staining already in the street there were seven crates of red and white awning  and even then nobody knew what it was and it was not till the seventeenth day that mr smith in the privacy of the back bar broke the silence and explained  i tell you boys he says its a cafflike what they have in the citya ladies and gents caff and that underneath whats yours mr mullins is a rats cooler and when i get her started ill hire a french chief to do the cooking and for the winter i will put in a girl room like what they have in the city hotels and id like to see whos going to close her up then  within two more weeks the plan was in operation not only was the caff built but the very hotel was transformed awnings had broken out in a red and white cloud upon its face its every window carried a box of hanging plants and above in glory floated the union jack the very stationery was changed the place was now smiths summer pavilion it was advertised in the city as smiths tourists emporium and smiths northern health resort mr smith got the editor of the timesherald to write up a circular all about ozone and the mariposa pine woods with illustrations of the maskinonge piscis mariposis of lake wissanotti  the saturday after that circular hit the city in july there were men with fishing rods and landing nets pouring in on every train almost too fast to register and if in the face of that a few little drops of whiskey were sold over the bar who thought of it  but the caff that of course was the crowning glory of the thing that and the rats cooler below  light and cool with swinging windows open to the air tables with marble tops palms waiters in white coatsit was the standing marvel of mariposa not a soul in the town except mr smith who knew it by instinct ever guessed that waiters and palms and marble tables can be rented over the long distance telephone  mr smith was as good as his word he got a french chief with an aristocratic saturnine countenance and a moustache and imperial that recalled the late napoleon iii no one knew where mr smith got him some people in the town said he was a french marquis others said he was a count and explained the difference  no one in mariposa had ever seen anything like the caff all down the side of it were the grill fires with great pewter dish covers that went up and down on a chain and you could walk along the row and actually pick out your own cutlet and then see the french marquis throw it on to the broiling iron you could watch a buckwheat pancake whirled into existence under your eyes and see fowls legs devilled peppered grilled and tormented till they lost all semblance of the original mariposa chicken  mr smith of course was in his glory  what have you got today alf he would say as he strolled over to the marquis the name of the chief was i believe alphonse but alf was near enough for mr smith  the marquis would extend to the proprietor the menu voila msieu la carte du jour  mr smith by the way encouraged the use of the french language in the caff he viewed it of course solely in its relation to the hotel business and i think regarded it as a recent invention  its comin in all the time in the city he said and yaint expected to understand it  mr smith would take the carte between his finger and thumb and stare at it it was all covered with such devices as potage la mariposafilet mignon a la proprietairecotellete a la smith and so on  but the greatest thing about the caff were the prices therein lay as everybody saw at once the hopeless simplicity of mr smith  the prices stood fast at 25 cents a meal you could come in and eat all they had in the caff for a quarter  no sir mr smith said stoutly i aint going to try to raise no prices on the public the hotels always been a quarter and the caffs a quarter  full full of people  well i should think so from the time the caff opened at 11 till it closed at 830 you could hardly find a table tourists visitors travellers and half the people of mariposa crowded at the little tables crockery rattling glasses tinkling on trays corks popping the waiters in their white coats flying to and fro alphonse whirling the cutlets and pancakes into the air and in and through it all mr smith in a white flannel suit and a broad crimson sash about his waist crowded and gay from morning to night and even noisy in its hilarity  noisy yes but if you wanted deep quiet and cool if you wanted to step from the glare of a canadian august to the deep shadow of an enchanted gladewalk down below into the rats cooler there you had it dark old beams who could believe they were put there a month ago great casks set on end with legends such as amontillado fino done in gilt on a black ground tall steins filled with german beer soft as moss and a german waiter noiseless as moving foam he who entered the rats cooler at three of a summer afternoon was buried there for the day mr golgotha gingham spent anything from four to seven hours there of every day in his mind the place had all the quiet charm of an interment with none of its sorrows  but at night when mr smith and billy the desk clerk opened up the cash register and figured out the combined losses of the caff and the rats cooler mr smith would say  billy just wait till i get the license renood and ill close up this damn caff so tight theyll never know what hit her what did that lamb cost fifty cents a pound was it i figure it billy that every one of them hogs eats about a dollars worth a grub for every twentyfive cents they pay on it as for alfby gosh im through with him  but that of course was only a confidential matter as between mr smith and billy  i dont know at what precise period it was that the idea of a petition to the license commissioners first got about the town no one seemed to know just who suggested it but certain it was that public opinion began to swing strongly towards the support of mr smith i think it was perhaps on the day after the big fish dinner that alphonse cooked for the mariposa canoe club at twenty cents a head that the feeling began to find open expression people said it was a shame that a man like josh smith should be run out of mariposa by three license commissioners who were the license commissioners anyway why look at the license system they had in sweden yes and in finland and in south america or for the matter of that look at the french and italians who drink all day and all night arent they all right arent they a musical people take napoleon and victor hugo drunk half the time and yet look what they did  i quote these arguments not for their own sake but merely to indicate the changing temper of public opinion in mariposa men would sit in the caff at lunch perhaps for an hour and a half and talk about the license question in general and then go down into the rats cooler and talk about it for two hours more  it was amazing the way the light broke in in the case of particular individuals often the most unlikely and quelled their opposition  take for example the editor of the newspacket i suppose there wasnt a greater temperance advocate in town yet alphonse queered him with an omelette a la license in one meal  or take pepperleigh himself the judge of the mariposa court he was put to the bad with a game piepate normand aux fines herbesthe real thing as good as a trip to paris in itself after eating it pepperleigh had the common sense to realize that it was sheer madness to destroy a hotel that could cook a thing like that  in the same way the secretary of the school board was silenced with a stuffed duck a la ossawippi  three members of the town council were converted with a dindon farci a la josh smith  and then finally mr diston persuaded dean drone to come and as soon as mr smith and alphonse saw him they landed him with a fried flounder that even the apostles would have appreciated  after that every one knew that the license question was practically settled the petition was all over the town it was printed in duplicate at the newspacket and you could see it lying on the counter of every shop in mariposa some of the people signed it twenty or thirty times  it was the right kind of document too it beganwhereas in the bounty of providence the earth putteth forth her luscious fruits and her vineyards for the delight and enjoyment of mankind it made you thirsty just to read it any man who read that petition over was wild to get to the rats cooler  when it was all signed up they had nearly three thousand names on it  then nivens the lawyer and mr gingham as a provincial official took it down to the county town and by three oclock that afternoon the news had gone out from the long distance telephone office that smiths license was renewed for three years  rejoicings well i should think so everybody was down wanting to shake hands with mr smith they told him that he had done more to boom mariposa than any ten men in town some of them said he ought to run for the town council and others wanted to make him the conservative candidate for the next dominion election the caff was a mere babel of voices and even the rats cooler was almost floated away from its moorings  and in the middle of it all mr smith found time to say to billy the desk clerk take the cash registers out of the caff and the rats cooler and start counting up the books  and billy said will i write the letters for the palms and the tables and the stuff to go back  and mr smith said get em written right away  so all evening the laughter and the chatter and the congratulations went on and it wasnt till long after midnight that mr smith was able to join billy in the private room behind the rotunda even when he did there was a quiet and a dignity about his manner that had never been there before i think it must have been the new halo of the conservative candidacy that already radiated from his brow it was i imagine at this very moment that mr smith first realised that the hotel business formed the natural and proper threshold of the national legislature  heres the account of the cash registers said billy  let me see it said mr smith and he studied the figures without a word  and heres the letters about the palms and heres alphonse up to yesterday  and then an amazing thing happened  billy said mr smith tearem up i aint going to do it it aint right and i wont do it they got me the license for to keep the caff and im going to keep the caff i dont need to close her the bars good for anything from forty to a hundred a day now with the rats cooler going good and that caff will stay right here  and stay it did  there it stands mind you to this day youve only to step round the corner of smiths hotel on the side street and read the sign ladies and gents cafe just as large and as imposing as ever  mr smith said that hed keep the caff and when he saida thing he meant it  of course there were changes small changes  i dont say mind you that the fillet de beef that you get there now is perhaps quite up to the level of the filet de boeufs aux champignons of the days of glory  no doubt the lamb chops in smiths caff are often very much the same nowadays as the lamb chops of the mariposa house or the continental  of course things like omelette aux trufles practically died out when alphonse went and naturally the leaving of alphonse was inevitable no one knew just when he went or why but one morning he was gone mr smith said that alf had to go back to his folks in the old country  so too when alf left the use of the french language as such fell off tremendously in the caff even now they use it to some extent you can still get fillet de beef and saucisson au juice but billy the desk clerk has considerable trouble with the spelling  the rats cooler of course closed down or rather mr smith closed it for repairs and there is every likelihood that it will hardly open for three years but the caff is there they dont use the grills because theres no need to with the hotel kitchen so handy  the girl room i may say was never opened mr smith promised it it is true for the winter and still talks of it but somehow theres been a sort of feeling against it every one in town admits that every big hotel in the city has a girl room and that it must be all right still theres a certainwell you know how sensitive opinion is in a place like mariposa     two the speculations of jefferson thorpe  it was not until the mining boom at the time when everybody went simply crazy over the cobalt and porcupine mines of the new silver country near the hudson bay that jefferson thorpe reached what you might call public importance in mariposa  of course everybody knew jeff and his little barber shop that stood just across the street from smiths hotel everybody knew him and everybody got shaved there from early morning when the commercial travellers off the 630 express got shaved into the resemblance of human beings there were always people going in and out of the barber shop  mullins the manager of the exchange bank took his morning shave from jeff as a form of resuscitation with enough wet towels laid on his face to stew him and with jeff moving about in the steam razor in hand as grave as an operating surgeon  then as i think i said mr smith came in every morning and there was a tremendous outpouring of florida water and rums essences and revivers and renovators regardless of expense what with jeffs white coat and mr smiths flowered waistcoat and the red geranium in the window and the florida water and the double extract of hyacinth the little shop seemed multicoloured and luxurious enough for the annex of a sultans harem  but what i mean is that till the mining boom jefferson thorpe never occupied a position of real prominence in mariposa you couldnt for example have compared him with a man like golgotha gingham who as undertaker stood in a direct relation to life and death or to trelawney the postmaster who drew money from the federal government of canada and was regarded as virtually a member of the dominion cabinet  everybody knew jeff and liked him but the odd thing was that till he made money nobody took any stock in his ideas at all it was only after he made the clean up that they came to see what a splendid fellow he was levelheaded i think was the term indeed in the speech of mariposa the highest form of endowment was to have the head set on horizontally as with a theodolite  as i say it was when jeff made money that they saw how gifted he was and when he lost itbut still theres no need to go into that i believe its something the same in other places too  the barber shop you will remember stands across the street from smiths hotel and stares at it face to face  it is one of those wooden structuresi dont know whether you know themwith a false front that sticks up above its real height and gives it an air at once rectangular and imposing it is a form of architecture much used in mariposa and understood to be in keeping with the pretentious and artificial character of modern business there is a red white and blue post in front of the shop and the shop itself has a large square window out of proportion to its little flat face  painted on the panes of the window is the remains of a legend that once spelt barber shop executed with the flourishes that prevailed in the golden age of sign painting in mariposa through the window you can see the geraniums in the window shelf and behind them jeff thorpe with his little black scull cap on and his spectacles drooped upon his nose as he bends forward in the absorption of shaving  as you open the door it sets in violent agitation a coiled spring up above and a bell that almost rings inside there are two shaving chairs of the heavier or electrocution pattern with mirrors in front of them and pigeon holes with individual shaving mugs there must be ever so many of them fifteen or sixteen it is the current supposition of each of jeffs customers that everyone else but himself uses a separate mug one corner of the shop is partitioned off and bears the sign hot and cold baths 50 cents there has been no bath inside the partition for twenty yearsonly old newspapers and a mop still it lends distinction somehow just as do the faded cardboard signs that hang against the mirror with the legends turkish shampoo 75 cents and roman massage 100  they said commonly in mariposa that jeff made money out of the barber shop he may have and it may have been that that turned his mind to investment but its hard to see how he could a shave cost five cents and a haircut fifteen or the two if you liked for a quarter and at that it is hard to see how he could make money even when he had both chairs going and shaved first in one and then in the other  you see in mariposa shaving isnt the hurried perfunctory thing that it is in the city a shave is looked upon as a form of physical pleasure and lasts anywhere from twentyfive minutes to threequarters of an hour  in the morning hours perhaps there was a semblance of haste about it but in the long quiet of the afternoon as jeff leaned forward towards the customer and talked to him in a soft confidential monotone like a portrait painter the razor would go slower and slower and pause and stop move and pause again till the shave died away into the mere drowse of conversation  at such hours the mariposa barber shop would become a very palace of slumber and as you waited your turn in one of the wooden armchairs beside the wall what with the quiet of the hour and the low drone of jeffs conversation the buzzing of the flies against the window pane and the measured tick of the clock above the mirror your head sank dreaming on your breast and the mariposa newspacket rustled unheeded on the floor it makes one drowsy just to think of it  the conversation of course was the real charm of the place you see jeffersons forte or specialty was information he could tell you more things within the compass of a halfhours shave than you get in days of laborious research in an encyclopaedia where he got it all i dont know but i am inclined to think it came more or less out of the newspapers  in the city people never read the newspapers not really only little bits and scraps of them but in mariposa its different there they read the whole thing from cover to cover and they build up on it in the course of years a range of acquirement that would put a college president to the blush anybody who has ever heard henry mullins and peter glover talk about the future of china will know just what i mean  and of course the peculiarity of jeffs conversation was that he could suit it to his man every time he had a kind of divination about it there was a certain kind of man that jeff would size up sideways as he stropped the razor and in whose ear he would whisper i see where saint louis has took four straight games off chicagoand so hold him fascinated to the end  in the same way he would say to mr smith i see where it says that this flying squirl run a dead heat for the kings plate  to a humble intellect like mine he would explain in full the relations of the keesar to the german rich dog  but first and foremost jeffs specialty in the way of conversation was finance and the money market the huge fortunes that a man with the right kind of head could make  ive known jefferson to pause in his shaving with the razor suspended in the air as long as five minutes while he described with his eye half closed exactly the kind of a head a man needed in order to make a haul or a clean up it was evidently simply a matter of the head and as far as one could judge jeffs own was the very type required i dont know just at what time or how jefferson first began his speculative enterprises it was probably in him from the start there is no doubt that the very idea of such things as traction stock and amalgamated asbestos went to his head and whenever he spoke of mr carnegie and mr rockefeller the yearning tone of his voice made it as soft as lathered soap  i suppose the most rudimentary form of his speculation was the hens that was years ago he kept them out at the back of his housewhich itself stood up a grass plot behind and beyond the barber shopand in the old days jeff would say with a certain note of pride in his voice that the woman had sold as many as two dozen eggs in a day to the summer visitors  but what with reading about amalgamated asbestos and consolidated copper and all that the hens began to seem pretty small business and in any case the idea of two dozen eggs at a cent apiece almost makes one blush i suppose a good many of us have felt just as jeff did about our poor little earnings anyway i remember jeff telling me one day that he could take the whole lot of the hens and sell them off and crack the money into chicago wheat on margin and turn it over in twentyfour hours he did it too only somehow when it was turned over it came upside down on top of the hens  after that the hen house stood empty and the woman had to throw away chicken feed every day at a dead loss of perhaps a shave and a half but it made no difference to jeff for his mind had floated away already on the possibilities of what he called displacement mining on the yukon  so you can understand that when the mining boom struck mariposa jefferson thorpe was in it right from the very start why no wonder it seemed like the finger of providence here was this great silver country spread out to north of us where people had thought there was only a wilderness and right at our very doors you could see as i saw the night express going north every evening for all one knew rockefeller or carnegie or anyone might be on it here was the wealth of calcutta as the mariposa newspacket put it poured out at our very feet  so no wonder the town went wild all day in the street you could hear men talking of veins and smelters and dips and deposits and faultsthe town hummed with it like a geology class on examination day and there were men about the hotels with mining outfits and theodolites and dunnage bags and at smiths bar they would hand chunks of rock up and down some of which would run as high as ten drinks to the pound  the fever just caught the town and ran through it within a fortnight they put a partition down robertsons coal and wood office and opened the mariposa mining exchange and just about every man on the main street started buying scrip then presently young fizzlechip who had been teller in mullinss bank and that everybody had thought a worthless jackass before came back from the cobalt country with a fortune and loafed round in the mariposa house in english khaki and a horizontal hat drunk all the time and everybody holding him up as an example of what it was possible to do if you tried  they all went in jim eliot mortgaged the inside of the drug store and jammed it into twin tamagami pete glover at the hardware store bought nippewa stock at thirteen cents and sold it to his brother at seventeen and bought it back in less than a week at nineteen they didnt care they took a chance judge pepperleigh put the rest of his wifes money into temiskaming common and lawyer macartney got the fever too and put every cent that his sister possessed into tulip preferred  and even when young fizzlechip shot himself in the back room of the mariposa house mr gingham buried him in a casket with silver handles and it was felt that there was a monte carlo touch about the whole thing  they all went inor all except mr smith you see mr smith had come down from there and he knew all about rocks and mining and canoes and the north country he knew what it was to eat flourbaked dampers under the lee side of a canoe propped among the underbrush and to drink the last drop of whiskey within fifty miles mr smith had mighty little use for the north but what he did do was to buy up enough early potatoes to send fifteen carload lots into cobalt at a profit of five dollars a bag  mr smith i say hung back but jeff thorpe was in the mining boom right from the start he bought in on the nippewa mine even before the interim prospectus was out he took a block of 100 shares of abbitibbi development at fourteen cents and he and johnson the livery stablekeeper next door formed a syndicate and got a thousand shares of metagami lake at 3 14 cents and then unloaded them on one of the sausage men at netleys butcher shop at a clear cent per cent advance  jeff would open the little drawer below the mirror in the barber shop and show you all kinds and sorts of cobalt country mining certificatesblue ones pink ones green ones with outlandish and fascinating names on them that ran clear from the mattawa to the hudson bay  and right from the start he was confident of winning there aint no difficulty to it he said theres lots of silver up there in that country and if you buy some here and some there you cant fail to come out somewhere i dont say he used to continue with the scissors open and ready to cut that some of the greenhorns wont get bit but if a feller knows the country and keeps his head level he cant lose  jefferson had looked at so many prospectuses and so many pictures of mines and pine trees and smelters that i think hed forgotten that hed never been in the country anyway whats two hundred miles  to an onlooker it certainly didnt seem so simple i never knew the meanness the trickery of the mining business the sheer obstinate determination of the bigger capitalists not to make money when they might till i heard the accounts of jeffs different mines take the case of corona jewel there was a good mine simply going to ruin for lack of common sense  she aint been developed jeff would say theres silver enough in her so you could dig it out with a shovel shes full of it but they wont get at her and work her  then hed take a look at the pink and blue certificates of the corona jewel and slam the drawer on them in disgust worse than that was the silent pinea clear case of stupid incompetence utter lack of engineering skill was all that was keeping the silent pine from making a fortune for its holders  the only trouble with that mine said jeff is they wont go deep enough they followed the vein down to where it kind o thinned out and then they quit if theyd just go right into her good theyd get it again shes down there all right  but perhaps the meanest case of all was the northern star that always seemed to me every time i heard of it a straight case for the criminal law the thing was so evidently a conspiracy  i bought her said jeff at thirtytwo and she stayed right there tight like she was stuck then a bunch of these fellers in the city started to drive her down and they got her pushed down to twentyfour and i held on to her and they shoved her down to twentyone this morning theyve got her down to sixteen but i dont mean to let go no sir  in another fortnight they shoved her the same unscrupulous crowd down to nine cents and jefferson still held on theyre working her down he admitted but im holding her  no conflict between vice and virtue was ever grimmer  shes at six said jeff but ive got her they cant squeeze me  a few days after that the same criminal gang had her down further than ever  theyve got her down to three cents said jeff but im with her yes sir they think they can shove her clean off the market but they cant do it ive boughten in johnsons shares and the whole of netleys and ill stay with her till she breaks  so they shoved and pushed and clawed her downthat unseen nefarious crowd in the cityand jeff held on to her and they writhed and twisted at his grip and then  and thenwell thats just the queer thing about the mining business why sudden as a flash of lightning it seemed the news came over the wire to the mariposa newspacket that they had struck a vein of silver in the northern star as thick as a sidewalk and that the stock had jumped to seventeen dollars a share and even at that you couldnt get it and jeff stood there flushed and halfstaggered against the mirror of the little shop with a bunch of mining scrip in his hand that was worth forty thousand dollars  excitement it was all over the town in a minutes they ran off a news extra at the mariposa newspacket and in less than no time there wasnt standing room in the barber shop and over in smiths hotel they had three extra barkeepers working on the lager beer pumps  they were selling mining shares on the main street in mariposa that afternoon and people were just clutching for them then at night there was a big oyster supper in smiths caff with speeches and the mariposa band outside  and the queer thing was that the very next afternoon was the funeral of young fizzlechip and dean drone had to change the whole text of his sunday sermon at two days notice for fear of offending public sentiment  but i think what jeff liked best of it all was the sort of public recognition that it meant hed stand there in the shop hardly bothering to shave and explain to the men in the armchairs how he held her and they shoved her and he clung to her and what hed said to himselfa perfect iliadwhile he was clinging to her  the whole thing was in the city papers a few days after with a photograph of jeff taken specially at ed moores studio upstairs over netleys it showed jeff sitting among palm trees as all mining men do with one hand on his knee and a dog one of those regular mining dogs at his feet and a look of piercing intelligence in his face that would easily account for forty thousand dollars  i say that the recognition meant a lot to jeff for its own sake but no doubt the fortune meant quite a bit to him too on account of myra  did i mention myra jeffs daughter perhaps not thats the trouble with the people in mariposa theyre all so separate and so differentnot a bit like the people in the citiesthat unless you hear about them separately and one by one you cant for a moment understand what theyre like  myra had golden hair and a greek face and would come bursting through the barber shop in a hat at least six inches wider than what they wear in paris as you saw her swinging up the street to the telephone exchange in a suit that was straight out of the delineator and brown american boots there was style written all over herthe kind of thing that mariposa recognised and did homage to and to see her in the exchangeshe was one of the four girls that i spoke ofon her high stool with a steel cap onjabbing the connecting plugs in and out as if electricity cost nothingwell all i mean is that you could understand why it was that the commercial travellers would stand round in the exchange calling up all sorts of impossible villages and waiting about so pleasant and genialit made one realize how naturally goodtempered men are and then when myra would go off duty and miss cleghorn who was sallow would come on the commercial men would be off again like autumn leaves  it just shows the difference between people there was myra who treated lovers like dogs and would slap them across the face with a banana skin to show her utter independence and there was miss cleghorn who was sallow and who bought a forty cent ancient history to improve herself and yet if shed hit any man in mariposa with a banana skin hed have had her arrested for assault  mind you i dont mean that myra was merely flippant and worthless not at all she was a girl with any amount of talent you should have heard her recite the raven at the methodist social simply genius and when she acted portia in the trial scene of the merchant of venice at the high school concert everybody in mariposa admitted that you couldnt have told it from the original  so of course as soon as jeff made the fortune myra had her resignation in next morning and everybody knew that she was to go to a dramatic school for three months in the fall and become a leading actress  but as i said the public recognition counted a lot for jeff the moment you begin to get that sort of thing it comes in quickly enough brains you know are recognized right away that was why of course within a week from this jeff received the first big packet of stuff from the cuban land development company with coloured pictures of cuba and fields of bananas and haciendas and insurrectos with machetes and heaven knows what they heard of him somehowit wasnt for a modest man like jefferson to say how after all the capitalists of the world are just one and the same crowd if youre in it youre in it thats all jeff realized why it is that of course men like carnegie or rockefeller and morgan all know one another they have to  for all i know this cuban stuff may have been sent from morgan himself some of the people in mariposa said yes others said no there was no certainty  anyway they were fair and straight this cuban crowd that wrote to jeff they offered him to come right in and be one of themselves if a mans got the brains you may as well recognize it straight away just as well write him to be a director now as wait and hesitate till he forces his way into it  anyhow they didnt hesitate these cuban people that wrote to jeff from cubaor from a postoffice box in new yorkits all the same thing because cuba being so near to new york the mail is all distributed from there i suppose in some financial circles they might have been slower wanted guarantees of some sort and so on but these cubans you know have got a sort of spanish warmth of heart that you dont see in business men in america and that touches you no they asked no guarantee just send the money whether by express order or by bank draft or cheque they left that entirely to oneself as a matter between cuban gentlemen  and they were quite frank about their enterprisebananas and tobacco in the plantation district reclaimed from the insurrectos you could see it all there in the picturestobacco plants and the insurrectoseverything they made no rash promises just admitted straight out that the enterprise might realise 400 per cent or might conceivably make less there was no hint of more  so within a month everybody in mariposa knew that jeff thorpe was in cuban lands and would probably clean up half a million by new years you couldnt have failed to know it all round the little shop there were pictures of banana groves and the harbour of habana and cubans in white suits and scarlet sashes smoking cigarettes in the sun and too ignorant to know that you can make four hundred per cent by planting a banana tree  i liked it about jeff that he didnt stop shaving he went on just the same even when johnson the livery stable man came in with five hundred dollars and asked him to see if the cuban board of directors would let him put it in jeff laid it in the drawer and then shaved him for five cents in the same old way of course he must have felt proud when a few days later he got a letter from the cuban people from new york accepting the money straight off without a single question and without knowing anything more of johnson except that he was a friend of jeffs they wrote most handsomely any friends of jeffs were friends of cuba all money they might send would be treated just as jeffs would be treated  one reason perhaps why jeff didnt give up shaving was because it allowed him to talk about cuba you see everybody knew in mariposa that jeff thorpe had sold out of cobalts and had gone into cuban renovated landsand that spread round him a kind of halo of wealth and mystery and outlandishnessoh something spanish perhaps youve felt it about people that you know anyhow they asked him about the climate and yellow fever and what the negroes were like and all that sort of thing  this cubey it appears is an island jeff would explain of course everybody knows how easily islands lend themselves to making moneyand for fruit they say it comes up so fast you cant stop it and then he would pass into details about the hashenders and the resurrectos and technical things like that till it was thought a wonder how he could know it still it was realized that a man with money has got to know these things look at morgan and rockefeller and all the men that make a pile they know just as much as jeff did about the countries where they make it it stands to reason  did i say that jeff shaved in the same old way not quite there was something even dreamier about it now and a sort of new element in the way jeff fell out of his monotone into lapses of thought that i for one misunderstood i thought that perhaps getting so much moneywell you know the way it acts on people in the larger cities it seemed to spoil ones idea of jeff that copper and asbestos and banana lands should form the goal of his thought when if he knew it the little shop and the sunlight of mariposa was so much better  in fact i had perhaps borne him a grudge for what seemed to me his perpetual interest in the great capitalists he always had some item out of the paper about them  i see where this here carnegie has give fifty thousand dollars for one of them observatories he would say  and another day he would pause in the course of shaving and almost whisper did you ever see this rockefeller  it was only by a sort of accident that i came to know that there was another side to jeffersons speculation that no one in mariposa ever knew or will ever know now  i knew it because i went in to see jeff in his house one night the housei think i said itstood out behind the barber shop you went out of the back door of the shop and through a grass plot with petunias beside it and the house stood at the end you could see the light of the lamp behind the blind and through the screen door as you came along and it was here that jefferson used to sit in the evenings when the shop got empty  there was a round table that the woman used to lay for supper and after supper there used to be a chequered cloth on it and a lamp with a shade and beside it jeff would sit with his spectacles on and the paper spread out reading about carnegie and rockefeller near him but away from the table was the woman doing needlework and myra when she wasnt working in the telephone exchange was there too with her elbows on the table reading marie corellionly now of course after the fortune she was reading the prospectuses of dramatic schools  so this nighti dont know just what it was in the paper that caused itjeff laid down what he was reading and started to talk about carnegie  this carnegie i bet you would be worth said jeff closing up his eyes in calculation as much as perhaps two million dollars if you was to sell him up and this rockefeller and this morgan either of them to sell them up clean would be worth another couple of million  i may say in parentheses that it was a favourite method in mariposa if you wanted to get at the real worth of a man to imagine him clean sold up put up for auction as it were it was the only way to test him  and now look at em jeff went on they make their money and what do they do with it they give it away and who do they give it to why to those as dont want it every time they give it to these professors and to this research and that and do the poor get any of it not a cent and never will  i tell you boys continued jeff there were no boys present but in mariposa all really important speeches are addressed to an imaginary audience of boysi tell you if i was to make a million out of this cubey id give it straight to the poor yes sirdivide it up into a hundred lots of a thousand dollars each and give it to the people that hadnt nothing  so always after that i knew just what those bananas were being grown for  indeed after that though jefferson never spoke of his intentions directly he said a number of things that seemed to bear on them he asked me for instance one day how many blind people it would take to fill one of these blind homes and how a feller could get ahold of them and at another time he asked whether if a feller advertised for some of these incurables a feller could get enough of them to make a showing i know for a fact that he got nivens the lawyer to draw up a document that was to give an acre of banana land in cuba to every idiot in missinaba county  but stillwhats the use of talking of what jeff meant to do nobody knows or cares about it now  the end of it was bound to come even in mariposa some of the people must have thought so else how was it that henry mullins made such a fuss about selling a draft for forty thousand on new york and why was it that mr smith wouldnt pay billy the desk clerk his back wages when he wanted to put it into cuba  oh yes some of them must have seen it and yet when it came it seemed so quietever so quietnot a bit like the northern star mine and the oyster supper and the mariposa band it is strange how quiet these things look the other way round  you remember the cuban land frauds in new york and porforio gomez shooting the detective and him and maximo morez getting clear away with two hundred thousand no of course you dont why even in the city papers it only filled an inch or two of type and anyway the names were hard to remember that was jeffs moneypart of it mullins got the telegram from a broker or someone and he showed it to jeff just as he was going up the street with an estate agent to look at a big empty lot on the hill behind the townthe very place for these incurables  and jeff went back to the shop so quiethave you ever seen an animal that is stricken through how quiet it seems to move  well thats how he walked  and since that though its quite a little while ago the shops open till eleven every night now and jeff is shaving away to pay back that five hundred that johnson the livery man sent to the cubans and  pathetic tut tut you dont know mariposa jeff has to work pretty late but thats nothingnothing at all if youve worked hard all your lifetime and myra is back at the telephone exchangethey were glad enough to get her and she says now that if theres one thing she hates its the stage and she cant see how the actresses put up with it  anyway things are not so bad you see it was just at this time that mr smiths caff opened and mr smith came to jeffs woman and said he wanted seven dozen eggs a day and wanted them handy and so the hens are back and more of them and they exult so every morning over the eggs they lay that if you wanted to talk of rockefeller in the barber shop you couldnt hear his name for the cackling     three the marine excursions of the knights of pythias  halfpast six on a july morning the mariposa belle is at the wharf decked in flags with steam up ready to start  excursion day  half past six on a july morning and lake wissanotti lying in the sun as calm as glass the opal colours of the morning light are shot from the surface of the water  out on the lake the last thin threads of the mist are clearing away like flecks of cotton wool  the long call of the loon echoes over the lake the air is cool and fresh there is in it all the new life of the land of the silent pine and the moving waters lake wissanotti in the morning sunlight dont talk to me of the italian lakes or the tyrol or the swiss alps take them away move them somewhere else i dont want them  excursion day at half past six of a summer morning with the boat all decked in flags and all the people in mariposa on the wharf and the band in peaked caps with big cornets tied to their bodies ready to play at any minute i say dont tell me about the carnival of venice and the delhi durbar dont i wouldnt look at them id shut my eyes for light and colour give me every time an excursion out of mariposa down the lake to the indians island out of sight in the morning mist talk of your papal zouaves and your buckingham palace guard i want to see the mariposa band in uniform and the mariposa knights of pythias with their aprons and their insignia and their picnic baskets and their fivecent cigars  half past six in the morning and all the crowd on the wharf and the boat due to leave in half an hour notice itin half an hour already shes whistled twice at six and at six fifteen and at any minute now christie johnson will step into the pilot house and pull the string for the warning whistle that the boat will leave in half an hour so keep ready dont think of running back to smiths hotel for the sandwiches dont be fool enough to try to go up to the greek store next to netleys and buy fruit youll be left behind for sure if you do never mind the sandwiches and the fruit anyway here comes mr smith himself with a huge basket of provender that would feed a factory there must be sandwiches in that i think i can hear them clinking and behind mr smith is the german waiter from the caff with another basketindubitably lager beer and behind him the bartender of the hotel carrying nothing as far as one can see but of course if you know mariposa you will understand that why he looks so nonchalant and emptyhanded is because he has two bottles of rye whiskey under his linen duster you know i think the peculiar walk of a man with two bottles of whiskey in the inside pockets of a linen coat in mariposa you see to bring beer to an excursion is quite in keeping with public opinion but whiskeywell one has to be a little careful  do i say that mr smith is here why everybodys here theres hussell the editor of the newspacket wearing a blue ribbon on his coat for the mariposa knights of pythias are by their constitution dedicated to temperance and theres henry mullins the manager of the exchange bank also a knight of pythias with a small flask of pograms special in his hip pocket as a sort of amendment to the constitution and theres dean drone the chaplain of the order with a fishingrod you never saw such green bass as lie among the rocks at indians island and with a trolling line in case of maskinonge and a landing net in case of pickerel and with his eldest daughter lilian drone in case of young men there never was such a fisherman as the rev rupert drone   perhaps i ought to explain that when i speak of the excursion as being of the knights of pythias the thing must not be understood in any narrow sense in mariposa practically everybody belongs to the knights of pythias just as they do to everything else thats the great thing about the town and thats what makes it so different from the city everybody is in everything  you should see them on the seventeenth of march for example when everybody wears a green ribbon and theyre all laughing and gladyou know what the celtic nature isand talking about home rule  on st andrews day every man in town wears a thistle and shakes hands with everybody else and you see the fine old scotch honesty beaming out of their eyes  and on st georges daywell theres no heartiness like the good old english spirit after all why shouldnt a man feel glad that hes an englishman  then on the fourth of july there are stars and stripes flying over half the stores in town and suddenly all the men are seen to smoke cigars and to know all about roosevelt and bryan and the philippine islands then you learn for the first time that jeff thorpes people came from massachusetts and that his uncle fought at bunker hill it must have been bunker hillanyway jefferson will swear it was in dakota all right enough and you find that george duff has a married sister in rochester and that her husband is all right in fact george was down there as recently as eight years ago oh its the most american town imaginable is mariposaon the fourth of july  but wait just wait if you feel anxious about the solidity of the british connection till the twelfth of the month when everybody is wearing an orange streamer in his coat and the orangemen every man in town walk in the big procession allegiance well perhaps you remember the address they gave to the prince of wales on the platform of the mariposa station as he went through on his tour to the west i think that pretty well settled that question so you will easily understand that of course everybody belongs to the knights of pythias and the masons and oddfellows just as they all belong to the snow shoe club and the girls friendly society  and meanwhile the whistle of the steamer has blown again for a quarter to sevenloud and long this time for any one not here now is late for certain unless he should happen to come down in the last fifteen minutes  what a crowd upon the wharf and how they pile on to the steamer its a wonder that the boat can hold them all but thats just the marvellous thing about the mariposa belle  i dont knowi have never knownwhere the steamers like the mariposa belle come from whether they are built by harland and wolff of belfast or whether on the other hand they are not built by harland and wolff of belfast is more than one would like to say offhand  the mariposa belle always seems to me to have some of those strange properties that distinguish mariposa itself i mean her size seems to vary so if you see her there in the winter frozen in the ice beside the wharf with a snowdrift against the windows of the pilot house she looks a pathetic little thing the size of a butternut but in the summer time especially after youve been in mariposa for a month or two and have paddled alongside of her in a canoe she gets larger and taller and with a great sweep of black sides till you see no difference between the mariposa belle and the lusitania each one is a big steamer and thats all you can say  nor do her measurements help you much she draws about eighteen inches forward and more than thatat least half an inch more astern and when shes loaded down with an excursion crowd she draws a good two inches more and above the waterwhy look at all the decks on her theres the deck you walk on to from the wharf all shut in with windows along it and the after cabin with the long table and above that the deck with all the chairs piled upon it and the deck in front where the band stand round in a circle and the pilot house is higher than that and above the pilot house is the board with the gold name and the flag pole and the steel ropes and the flags and fixed in somewhere on the different levels is the lunch counter where they sell the sandwiches and the engine room and down below the deck level beneath the water line is the place where the crew sleep what with steps and stairs and passages and piles of cordwood for the engineoh no i guess harland and wolff didnt build her they couldnt have  yet even with a huge boat like the mariposa belle it would be impossible for her to carry all of the crowd that you see in the boat and on the wharf in reality the crowd is made up of two classesall of the people in mariposa who are going on the excursion and all those who are not some come for the one reason and some for the other  the two tellers of the exchange bank are both there standing side by side but one of themthe one with the cameo pin and the long face like a horseis going and the otherwith the other cameo pin and the face like another horseis not in the same way hussell of the newspacket is going but his brother beside him isnt lilian drone is going but her sister cant and so on all through the crowd   and to think that things should look like that on the morning of a steamboat accident  how strange life is  to think of all these people so eager and anxious to catch the steamer and some of them running to catch it and so fearful that they might miss itthe morning of a steamboat accident and the captain blowing his whistle and warning them so severely that he would leave them behindleave them out of the accident and everybody crowding so eagerly to be in the accident  perhaps life is like that all through  strangest of all to think in a case like this of the people who were left behind or in some way or other prevented from going and always afterwards told of how they had escaped being on board the mariposa belle that day  some of the instances were certainly extraordinary nivens the lawyer escaped from being there merely by the fact that he was away in the city  towers the tailor only escaped owing to the fact that not intending to go on the excursion he had stayed in bed till eight oclock and so had not gone he narrated afterwards that waking up that morning at halfpast five he had thought of the excursion and for some unaccountable reason had felt glad that he was not going   the case of yodel the auctioneer was even more inscrutable he had been to the oddfellows excursion on the train the week before and to the conservative picnic the week before that and had decided not to go on this trip in fact he had not the least intention of going he narrated afterwards how the night before someone had stopped him on the corner of nippewa and tecumseh streets he indicated the very spot and asked are you going to take in the excursion tomorrow and he had said just as simply as he was talking when narrating it no and ten minutes after that at the corner of dalhousie and brock streets he offered to lead a party of verification to the precise place somebody else had stopped him and asked well are you going on the steamer trip tomorrow again he had answered no apparently almost in the same tone as before  he said afterwards that when he heard the rumour of the accident it seemed like the finger of providence and fell on his knees in thankfulness  there was the similar case of morison i mean the one in glovers hardware store that married one of the thompsons he said afterwards that he had read so much in the papers about accidents latelymining accidents and aeroplanes and gasolinethat he had grown nervous the night before his wife had asked him at supper are you going on the excursion he had answered no i dont think i feel like it and had added perhaps your mother might like to go and the next evening just at dusk when the news ran through the town he said the first thought that flashed through his head was mrs thompsons on that boat  he told this right as i say itwithout the least doubt or confusion he never for a moment imagined she was on the lusitania or the olympic or any other boat he knew she was on this one he said you could have knocked him down where he stood but no one had not even when he got halfway downon his knees and it would have been easier still to knock him down or kick him people do miss a lot of chances  still as i say neither yodel nor morison nor anyone thought about there being an accident until just after sundown when they  well have you ever heard the long booming whistle of a steamboat two miles out on the lake in the dusk and while you listen and count and wonder seen the crimson rockets going up against the sky and then heard the fire bell ringing right there beside you in the town and seen the people running to the town wharf  thats what the people of mariposa saw and felt that summer evening as they watched the mackinaw lifeboat go plunging out into the lake with seven sweeps to a side and the foam clear to the gunwale with the lifting stroke of fourteen men  but dear me i am afraid that this is no way to tell a story i suppose the true art would have been to have said nothing about the accident till it happened but when you write about mariposa or hear of it if you know the place its all so vivid and real that a thing like the contrast between the excursion crowd in the morning and the scene at night leaps into your mind and you must think of it   but never mind about the accidentlet us turn back again to the morning  the boat was due to leave at seven there was no doubt about the hournot only seven but seven sharp the notice in the newspacket said the boat will leave sharp at seven and the advertising posters on the telegraph poles on missinaba street that began ho for indians island ended up with the words boat leaves at seven sharp there was a big notice on the wharf that said boat leaves sharp on time  so at seven right on the hour the whistle blew loud and long and then at seven fifteen three short peremptory blasts and at seven thirty one quick angry calljust oneand very soon after that they cast off the last of the ropes and the mariposa belle sailed off in her cloud of flags and the band of the knights of pythias timing it to a nicety broke into the maple leaf for ever  i suppose that all excursions when they start are much the same anyway on the mariposa belle everybody went running up and down all over the boat with deck chairs and camp stools and baskets and found places splendid places to sit and then got scared that there might be better ones and chased off again people hunted for places out of the sun and when they got them swore that they werent going to freeze to please anybody and the people in the sun said that they hadnt paid fifty cents to be roasted others said that they hadnt paid fifty cents to get covered with cinders and there were still others who hadnt paid fifty cents to get shaken to death with the propeller  still it was all right presently the people seemed to get sorted out into the places on the boat where they belonged the women the older ones all gravitated into the cabin on the lower deck and by getting round the table with needlework and with all the windows shut they soon had it as they said themselves just like being at home  all the young boys and the toughs and the men in the band got down on the lower deck forward where the boat was dirtiest and where the anchor was and the coils of rope  and upstairs on the after deck there were lilian drone and miss lawson the high school teacher with a book of german poetrygothey i think it wasand the bank teller and the younger men  in the centre standing beside the rail were dean drone and dr gallagher looking through binocular glasses at the shore  up in front on the little deck forward of the pilot house was a group of the older men mullins and duff and mr smith in a deck chair and beside him mr golgotha gingham the undertaker of mariposa on a stool it was part of mr ginghams principles to take in an outing of this sort a business matter more or lessfor you never know what may happen at these water parties at any rate he was there in a neat suit of black not of course his heavier or professional suit but a soft clinging effect as of burnt paper that combined gaiety and decorum to a nicety   yes said mr gingham waving his black glove in a general way towards the shore i know the lake well very well ive been pretty much all over it in my time  canoeing asked somebody  no said mr gingham not in a canoe there seemed a peculiar and quiet meaning in his tone  sailing i suppose said somebody else  no said mr gingham i dont understand it  i never knowed that you went on to the water at all gol said mr smith breaking in  ah not now explained mr gingham it was years ago the first summer i came to mariposa i was on the water practically all day nothing like it to give a man an appetite and keep him in shape  was you camping asked mr smith  we camped at night assented the undertaker but we put in practically the whole day on the water you see we were after a party that had come up here from the city on his vacation and gone out in a sailing canoe we were dragging we were up every morning at sunrise lit a fire on the beach and cooked breakfast and then wed light our pipes and be off with the net for a whole day its a great life concluded mr gingham wistfully  did you get him asked two or three together  there was a pause before mr gingham answered  we did he saiddown in the reeds past horseshoe point but it was no use he turned blue on me right away  after which mr gingham fell into such a deep reverie that the boat had steamed another half mile down the lake before anybody broke the silence again  talk of this sortand after all what more suitable for a day on the waterbeguiled the way   down the lake mile by mile over the calm water steamed the mariposa belle they passed poplar point where the high sandbanks are with all the swallows nests in them and dean drone and dr gallagher looked at them alternately through the binocular glasses and it was wonderful how plainly one could see the swallows and the banks and the shrubsjust as plainly as with the naked eye  and a little further down they passed the shingle beach and dr gallagher who knew canadian history said to dean drone that it was strange to think that champlain had landed there with his french explorers three hundred years ago and dean drone who didnt know canadian history said it was stranger still to think that the hand of the almighty had piled up the hills and rocks long before that and dr gallagher said it was wonderful how the french had found their way through such a pathless wilderness and dean drone said that it was wonderful also to think that the almighty had placed even the smallest shrub in its appointed place dr gallagher said it filled him with admiration dean drone said it filled him with awe dr gallagher said hed been full of it ever since he was a boy and dean drone said so had he  then a little further as the mariposa belle steamed on down the lake they passed the old indian portage where the great grey rocks are and dr gallagher drew dean drones attention to the place where the narrow canoe track wound up from the shore to the woods and dean drone said he could see it perfectly well without the glasses  dr gallagher said that it was just here that a party of five hundred french had made their way with all their baggage and accoutrements across the rocks of the divide and down to the great bay and dean drone said that it reminded him of xenophon leading his ten thousand greeks over the hill passes of armenia down to the sea dr gallagher said the he had often wished he could have seen and spoken to champlain and dean drone said how much he regretted to have never known xenophon  and then after that they fell to talking of relics and traces of the past and dr gallagher said that if dean drone would come round to his house some night he would show him some indian arrow heads that he had dug up in his garden and dean drone said that if dr gallagher would come round to the rectory any afternoon he would show him a map of xerxes invasion of greece only he must come some time between the infant class and the mothers auxiliary  so presently they both knew that they were blocked out of one anothers houses for some time to come and dr gallagher walked forward and told mr smith who had never studied greek about champlain crossing the rock divide  mr smith turned his head and looked at the divide for half a second and then said he had crossed a worse one up north back of the wahnipitae and that the flies were hadesand then went on playing freezeout poker with the two juniors in duffs bank  so dr gallagher realized that thats always the way when you try to tell people things and that as far as gratitude and appreciation goes one might as well never read books or travel anywhere or do anything  in fact it was at this very moment that he made up his mind to give the arrows to the mariposa mechanics institutethey afterwards became as you know the gallagher collection but for the time being the doctor was sick of them and wandered off round the boat and watched henry mullins showing george duff how to make a john collins without lemons and finally went and sat down among the mariposa band and wished that he hadnt come  so the boat steamed on and the sun rose higher and higher and the freshness of the morning changed into the full glare of noon and they went on to where the lake began to narrow in at its foot just where the indians island is all grass and trees and with a log wharf running into the water below it the lower ossawippi runs out of the lake and quite near are the rapids and you can see down among the trees the red brick of the power house and hear the roar of the leaping water  the indians island itself is all covered with trees and tangled vines and the water about it is so still that its all reflected double and looks the same either way up then when the steamers whistle blows as it comes into the wharf you hear it echo among the trees of the island and reverberate back from the shores of the lake  the scene is all so quiet and still and unbroken that miss cleghornthe sallow girl in the telephone exchange that i spoke ofsaid shed like to be buried there but all the people were so busy getting their baskets and gathering up their things that no one had time to attend to it  i mustnt even try to describe the landing and the boat crunching against the wooden wharf and all the people running to the same side of the deck and christie johnson calling out to the crowd to keep to the starboard and nobody being able to find it everyone who has been on a mariposa excursion knows all about that  nor can i describe the day itself and the picnic under the trees there were speeches afterwards and judge pepperleigh gave such offence by bringing in conservative politics that a man called patriotus canadiensis wrote and asked for some of the invaluable space of the mariposa timesherald and exposed it  i should say that there were races too on the grass on the open side of the island graded mostly according to ages races for boys under thirteen and girls over nineteen and all that sort of thing sports are generally conducted on that plan in mariposa it is realized that a woman of sixty has an unfair advantage over a mere child  dean drone managed the races and decided the ages and gave out the prizes the wesleyan minister helped and he and the young student who was relieving in the presbyterian church held the string at the winning point  they had to get mostly clergymen for the races because all the men had wandered off somehow to where they were drinking lager beer out of two kegs stuck on pine logs among the trees  but if youve ever been on a mariposa excursion you know all about these details anyway  so the day wore on and presently the sun came through the trees on a slant and the steamer whistle blew with a great puff of white steam and all the people came straggling down to the wharf and pretty soon the mariposa belle had floated out on to the lake again and headed for the town twenty miles away   i suppose you have often noticed the contrast there is between an excursion on its way out in the morning and what it looks like on the way home  in the morning everybody is so restless and animated and moves to and fro all over the boat and asks questions but coming home as the afternoon gets later and the sun sinks beyond the hills all the people seem to get so still and quiet and drowsy  so it was with the people on the mariposa belle they sat there on the benches and the deck chairs in little clusters and listened to the regular beat of the propeller and almost dozed off asleep as they sat then when the sun set and the dusk drew on it grew almost dark on the deck and so still that you could hardly tell there was anyone on board  and if you had looked at the steamer from the shore or from one of the islands youd have seen the row of lights from the cabin windows shining on the water and the red glare of the burning hemlock from the funnel and youd have heard the soft thud of the propeller miles away over the lake  now and then too you could have heard them singing on the steamerthe voices of the girls and the men blended into unison by the distance rising and falling in longdrawn melody ocanadaocanada  you may talk as you will about the intoning choirs of your european cathedrals but the sound of ocanada borne across the waters of a silent lake at evening is good enough for those of us who know mariposa  i think that it was just as they were singing like this ocanada that word went round that the boat was sinking  if you have ever been in any sudden emergency on the water you will understand the strange psychology of itthe way in which what is happening seems to become known all in a moment without a word being said the news is transmitted from one to the other by some mysterious process  at any rate on the mariposa belle first one and then the other heard that the steamer was sinking as far as i could ever learn the first of it was that george duff the bank manager came very quietly to dr gallagher and asked him if he thought that the boat was sinking the doctor said no that he had thought so earlier in the day but that he didnt now think that she was  after that duff according to his own account had said to macartney the lawyer that the boat was sinking and macartney said that he doubted it very much  then somebody came to judge pepperleigh and woke him up and said that there was six inches of water in the steamer and that she was sinking and pepperleigh said it was perfect scandal and passed the news on to his wife and she said that they had no business to allow it and that if the steamer sank that was the last excursion shed go on  so the news went all round the boat and everywhere the people gathered in groups and talked about it in the angry and excited way that people have when a steamer is sinking on one of the lakes like lake wissanotti  dean drone of course and some others were quieter about it and said that one must make allowances and that naturally there were two sides to everything but most of them wouldnt listen to reason at all i think perhaps that some of them were frightened you see the last time but one that the steamer had sunk there had been a man drowned and it made them nervous  what hadnt i explained about the depth of lake wissanotti i had taken it for granted that you knew and in any case parts of it are deep enough though i dont suppose in this stretch of it from the big reed beds up to within a mile of the town wharf you could find six feet of water in it if you tried oh pshaw i was not talking about a steamer sinking in the ocean and carrying down its screaming crowds of people into the hideous depths of green water oh dear me no that kind of thing never happens on lake wissanotti  but what does happen is that the mariposa belle sinks every now and then and sticks there on the bottom till they get things straightened up  on the lakes round mariposa if a person arrives late anywhere and explains that the steamer sank everybody understands the situation  you see when harland and wolff built the mariposa belle they left some cracks in between the timbers that you fill up with cotton waste every sunday if this is not attended to the boat sinks in fact it is part of the law of the province that all the steamers like the mariposa belle must be properly corkedi think that is the wordevery season there are inspectors who visit all the hotels in the province to see that it is done  so you can imagine now that ive explained it a little straighter the indignation of the people when they knew that the boat had come uncorked and that they might be stuck out there on a shoal or a mudbank half the night  i dont say either that there wasnt any danger anyway it doesnt feel very safe when you realize that the boat is settling down with every hundred yards that she goes and you look over the side and see only the black water in the gathering night  safe im not sure now that i come to think of it that it isnt worse than sinking in the atlantic after all in the atlantic there is wireless telegraphy and a lot of trained sailors and stewards but out on lake wissanottifar out so that you can only just see the lights of the town away off to the southwhen the propeller comes to a stopand you can hear the hiss of steam as they start to rake out the engine fires to prevent an explosionand when you turn from the red glare that comes from the furnace doors as they open them to the black dark that is gathering over the lakeand theres a night wind beginning to run among the rushesand you see the men going forward to the roof of the pilot house to send up the rockets to rouse the town safe safe yourself if you like as for me let me once get back into mariposa again under the night shadow of the maple trees and this shall be the last last time ill go on lake wissanotti  safe oh yes isnt it strange how safe other peoples adventures seem after they happen but youd have been scared too if youd been there just before the steamer sank and seen them bringing up all the women on to the top deck  i dont see how some of the people took it so calmly how mr smith for instance could have gone on smoking and telling how hed had a steamer sink on him on lake nipissing and a still bigger one a sidewheeler sink on him in lake abbitibbi  then quite suddenly with a quiver down she went you could feel the boat sink sinkdown downwould it never get to the bottom the water came flush up to the lower deck and thenthank heaventhe sinking stopped and there was the mariposa belle safe and tight on a reed bank  really it made one positively laugh it seemed so queer and anyway if a man has a sort of natural courage danger makes him laugh danger pshaw fiddlesticks everybody scouted the idea why it is just the little things like this that give zest to a day on the water  within half a minute they were all running round looking for sandwiches and cracking jokes and talking of making coffee over the remains of the engine fires   i dont need to tell at length how it all happened after that  i suppose the people on the mariposa belle would have had to settle down there all night or till help came from the town but some of the men who had gone forward and were peering out into the dark said that it couldnt be more than a mile across the water to millers point you could almost see it over there to the leftsome of them i think said off on the port bow because you know when you get mixed up in these marine disasters you soon catch the atmosphere of the thing  so pretty soon they had the davits swung out over the side and were lowering the old lifeboat from the top deck into the water  there were men leaning out over the rail of the mariposa belle with lanterns that threw the light as they let her down and the glare fell on the water and the reeds but when they got the boat lowered it looked such a frail clumsy thing as one saw it from the rail above that the cry was raised women and children first for what was the sense if it should turn out that the boat wouldnt even hold women and children of trying to jam a lot of heavy men into it  so they put in mostly women and children and the boat pushed out into the darkness so freighted down it would hardly float  in the bow of it was the presbyterian student who was relieving the minister and he called out that they were in the hands of providence but he was crouched and ready to spring out of them at the first moment  so the boat went and was lost in the darkness except for the lantern in the bow that you could see bobbing on the water then presently it came back and they sent another load till pretty soon the decks began to thin out and everybody got impatient to be gone  it was about the time that the third boatload put off that mr smith took a bet with mullins for twentyfive dollars that hed be home in mariposa before the people in the boats had walked round the shore  no one knew just what he meant but pretty soon they saw mr smith disappear down below into the lowest part of the steamer with a mallet in one hand and a big bundle of marline in the other  they might have wondered more about it but it was just at this time that they heard the shouts from the rescue boatthe big mackinaw lifeboatthat had put out from the town with fourteen men at the sweeps when they saw the first rockets go up  i suppose there is always something inspiring about a rescue at sea or on the water  after all the bravery of the lifeboat man is the true braveryexpended to save life not to destroy it  certainly they told for months after of how the rescue boat came out to the mariposa belle  i suppose that when they put her in the water the lifeboat touched it for the first time since the old macdonald government placed her on lake wissanotti  anyway the water poured in at every seam but not for a momenteven with two miles of water between them and the steamerdid the rowers pause for that  by the time they were halfway there the water was almost up to the thwarts but they drove her on panting and exhausted for mind you if you havent been in a fool boat like that for years rowing takes it out of you the rowers stuck to their task they threw the ballast over and chucked into the water the heavy cork jackets and lifebelts that encumbered their movements there was no thought of turning back they were nearer to the steamer than the shore  hang to it boys called the crowd from the steamers deck and hang they did  they were almost exhausted when they got them men leaning from the steamer threw them ropes and one by one every man was hauled aboard just as the lifeboat sank under their feet  saved by heaven saved by one of the smartest pieces of rescue work ever seen on the lake  theres no use describing it you need to see rescue work of this kind by lifeboats to understand it  nor were the lifeboat crew the only ones that distinguished themselves  boat after boat and canoe after canoe had put out from mariposa to the help of the steamer they got them all  pupkin the other bank teller with a face like a horse who hadnt gone on the excursionas soon as he knew that the boat was signalling for help and that miss lawson was sending up rocketsrushed for a row boat grabbed an oar two would have hampered him and paddled madly out into the lake he struck right out into the dark with the crazy skiff almost sinking beneath his feet but they got him they rescued him they watched him almost dead with exhaustion make his way to the steamer where he was hauled up with ropes saved saved   they might have gone on that way half the night picking up the rescuers only at the very moment when the tenth load of people left for the shorejust as suddenly and saucily as you please up came the mariposa belle from the mud bottom and floated  floated  why of course she did if you take a hundred and fifty people off a steamer that has sunk and if you get a man as shrewd as mr smith to plug the timber seams with mallet and marline and if you turn ten bandsmen of the mariposa band on to your hand pump on the bow of the lower decksfloat why what else can she do  then if you stuff in hemlock into the embers of the fire that you were raking out till it hums and crackles under the boiler it wont be long before you hear the propeller thud thudding at the stern again and before the long roar of the steam whistle echoes over to the town  and so the mariposa belle with all steam up again and with the long train of sparks careering from the funnel is heading for the town  but no christie johnson at the wheel in the pilot house this time  smith get smith is the cry  can he take her in well now ask a man who has had steamers sink on him in half the lakes from temiscaming to the bay if he can take her in ask a man who has run a york boat down the rapids of the moose when the ice is moving if he can grip the steering wheel of the mariposa belle so there she steams safe and sound to the town wharf  look at the lights and the crowd if only the federal census taker could count us now hear them calling and shouting back and forward from the deck to the shore listen there is the rattle of the shore ropes as they get them ready and theres the mariposa bandactually forming in a circle on the upper deck just as she docks and the leader with his batononetwoready now  o canada     four the ministrations of the rev mr drone  the church of england in mariposa is on a side street where the maple trees are thickest a little up the hill from the heart of the town the trees above the church and the grass plot that was once the cemetery till they made the new one the necropolis over the brow of the hill fill out the whole corner down behind the church with only the driving shed and a lane between is the rectory it is a little brick house with odd angles there is a hedge and a little gate and a weeping ash tree with red berries  at the side of the rectory churchward is a little grass lawn with low hedges and at the side of that two wild plum trees that are practically always in white blossom underneath them is a rustic table and chairs and it is here that you may see rural dean drone the incumbent of the church of england church sitting in the chequered light of the plum tress that is neither sun nor shadow generally you will find him reading and when i tell you that at the end of the grass plot where the hedge is highest there is a yellow bee hive with seven bees that belong to dean drone you will realize that it is only fitting that the dean is reading in the greek for what better could a man be reading beneath the blossom of the plum trees within the very sound of the bees than the pastorals of theocritus the light trash of modern romance might put a man to sleep in such a spot but with such food for reflection as theocritus a man may safely close his eyes and muse on what he reads without fear of dropping into slumber  some men i suppose terminate their education when they leave their college not so dean drone i have often heard him say that if he couldnt take a book in the greek out on the lawn in a spare half hour he would feel lost its a certain activity of the brain that must be stilled somehow the dean too seemed to have a native feeling for the greek language i have often heard people who might sit with him on the lawn ask him to translate some of it but he always refused one couldnt translate it he said it lost so much in the translation that it was better not to try it was far wiser not to attempt it if you undertook to translate it there was something gone something missing immediately i believe that many classical scholars feel this way and like to read the greek just as it is without the hazard of trying to put it into so poor a medium as english so that when dean drone said that he simply couldnt translate it i believe he was perfectly sincere  sometimes indeed he would read it aloud that was another matter whenever for example dr gallagheri mean of course old dr gallagher not the young doctor who was always out in the country in the afternoonwould come over and bring his latest indian relics to show to the dean the latter always read to him a passage or two as soon as the doctor laid his tomahawk on the table the dean would reach for his theocritus i remember that on the day when dr gallagher brought over the indian skull that they had dug out of the railway embankment and placed it on the rustic table the dean read to him so long from theocritus that the doctor i truly believe dozed off in his chair the dean had to wait and fold his hands with the book across his knee and close his eyes till the doctor should wake up again and the skull was on the table between them and from above the plum blossoms fluttered down till they made flakes on it as white as dr gallaghers hair  i dont want you to suppose that the rev mr drone spent the whole of his time under the trees not at all in point of fact the rectors life was one round of activity which lie himself might deplore but was powerless to prevent he had hardly sat down beneath the trees of an afternoon after his midday meal when there was the infant class at three and after that with scarcely an hour between the mothers auxiliary at five and the next morning the book club and that evening the bible study class and the next morning the early workers guild at eleventhirty the whole week was like that and if one found time to sit down for an hour or so to recuperate it was the most one could do after all if a busy man spends the little bit of leisure that he gets in advanced classical study there is surely no harm in it i suppose take it all in all there wasnt a busier man than the rural dean among the anglican clergy of the diocese  if the dean ever did snatch a halfday from his incessant work he spent it in fishing but not always that for as likely as not instead of taking a real holiday he would put in the whole afternoon amusing the children and the boys that he knew by making kites and toys and clockwork steamboats for them  it was fortunate for the dean that he had the strange interest and aptitude for mechanical advices which he possessed or otherwise this kind of thing would have been too cruel an imposition but the rev mr drone had a curious liking for machinery i think i never heard him preach a better sermon than the one on aeroplanes lo what now see you on high jeremiah two  so it was that he spent two whole days making a kite with chinese wings for teddy moore the photographers son and closed down the infant class for fortyeight hours so that teddy moore should not miss the pleasure of flying it or rather seeing it flown it is foolish to trust a chinese kite to the hands of a young child  in the same way the dean made a mechanical top for little marjorie trewlaney the cripple to see spun it would have been unwise to allow the afflicted girl to spin it there was no end to the things that mr drone could make and always for the children even when he was making the sandclock for poor little willie yodel who died you know the dean went right on with it and gave it to another child with just the same pleasure death you know to the clergy is a different thing from what it is to us the dean and mr gingham used often to speak of it as they walked through the long grass of the new cemetery the necropolis and when your sunday walk is to your wifes grave as the deans was perhaps it seems different to anybody  the church of england church i said stood close to the rectory a tall sweeping church and inside a great reach of polished cedar beams that ran to the point of the roof there used to stand on the same spot the little stone church that all the grownup people in mariposa still remember a quaint little building in red and grey stone about it was the old cemetery but that was all smoothed out later into the grass plot round the new church and the headstones laid out flat and no new graves have been put there for ever so long but the mariposa children still walk round and read the headstones lying flat in the grass and look for the old onesbecause some of them are ever so oldforty or fifty years back  nor are you to think from all this that the dean was not a man with serious perplexities you could easily convince yourself of the contrary for if you watched the rev mr drone as he sat reading in the greek you would notice that no very long period every passed without his taking up a sheet or two of paper that lay between the leaves of the theocritus and that were covered close with figures  and these the dean would lay upon the rustic table and he would add them up forwards and backwards going first up the column and then down it to see that nothing had been left out and then down it again to see what it was that must have been left out  mathematics you will understand were not the deans forte they never were the forte of the men who had been trained at the little anglican college with the clipped hedges and the cricket ground where rupert drone had taken the gold medal in greek fiftytwo years ago you will see the medal at any time lying there in its open box on the rectory table in case of immediate need any of the drone girls lilian or jocelyn or theodora would show it to you but as i say mathematics were not the rectors forte and he blamed for it in a christian spirit you will understand the memory of his mathematical professor and often he spoke with great bitterness i have often heard him say that in his opinion the colleges ought to dismiss of course in a christian spirit all the professors who are not in the most reverential sense of the term fit for their jobs  no doubt many of the clergy of the diocese had suffered more or less just as the dean had from lack of mathematical training but the dean always felt that his own case was especially to be lamented for you see if a man is trying to make a model aeroplanefor a poor family in the lower part of the townand he is brought to a stop by the need of reckoning the coefficient of torsion of castiron rods it shows plainly enough that the colleges are not truly filling their divine mission   but the figures that i speak of were not those of the model aeroplane these were far more serious night and day they had been with the rector now for the best part of ten years and they grew if anything more intricate  if for example you try to reckon the debt of a churcha large church with a great sweep of polished cedar beams inside for the special glorification of the all powerful and with imported tiles on the roof for the greater glory of heaven and with stainedglass windows for the exaltation of the all seeingif i say you try to reckon up the debt on such a church and figure out its interest and its present worth less a fixed annual payment it makes a pretty complicated sum then if you try to add to this the annual cost of insurance and deduct from it threequarters of a stipend year by year and then suddenly remember that threequarters is too much because you have forgotten the boardingschool fees of the littlest of the drones including french as an extrashe must have it all the older girls did you have got a sum that pretty well defies ordinary arithmetic the provoking part of it was that the dean knew perfectly well that with the help of logarithms he could have done the thing in a moment but at the anglican college they had stopped short at that very place in the book they had simply explained that logos was a word and arithmos a number which at the time seemed amply sufficient  so the dean was perpetually taking out his sheets of figures and adding them upwards and downwards and they never came the same very often mr gingham who was a warden would come and sit beside the rector and ponder over the figures and mr drone would explain that with a book of logarithms you could work it out in a moment you would simply open the book and run your finger up the columns he illustrated exactly the way in which the finger was moved and there you were mr gingham said that it was a caution and that logarithms i quote his exact phrase must be a terror  very often too nivens the lawyer who was a sidesman and mullins the manager of the exchange bank who was the chairman of the vestry would come and take a look at the figures but they never could make much of them because the stipend part was not a matter that one could discuss  mullins would notice the item for a hundred dollars due on fire insurance and would say as a business man that surely that couldnt be fire insurance and the dean would say surely not and change it and mullins would say surely there couldnt be fifty dollars for taxes because there werent any taxes and the dean would admit that of course it couldnt be for the taxes in fact the truth is that the deans figures were badly mixed and the fault lay indubitably with the mathematical professor of two generations back  it was always mullinss intention some day to look into the finances of the church the more so as his father had been with dean drone at the little anglican college with the cricket ground but he was a busy man as he explained to the rector himself the banking business nowadays is getting to be such that a banker can hardly call even his sunday mornings his own certainly henry mullins could not they belonged largely to smiths hotel and during the fishing season they belonged away down the lake so far away that practically no one unless it was george duff of the commercial bank could see them  but to think that all this trouble had come through the building of the new church  that was the bitterness of it  for the twentyfive years that rural dean drone had preached in the little stone church it had been his one aim as he often put it in his sermons to rear a larger ark in gideon his one hope had been to set up a greater evidence or very simply stated to kindle a brighter beacon  after twentyfive years of waiting he had been able at last to kindle it everybody in mariposa remembers the building of the church first of all they had demolished the little stone church to make way for the newer evidence it seemed almost a sacrilege as the dean himself said to lay hands on it indeed it was at first proposed to take the stone of it and build it into a sunday school as a lesser testimony then when that provided impracticable it was suggested that the stone be reverently fashioned into a wall that should stand as a token and when even that could not be managed the stone of the little church was laid reverently into a stone pile afterwards it was devoutly sold to a building contractor and like so much else in life was forgotten  but the building of the church no one i think will forget the dean threw himself into the work with his coat off and his white shirtsleeves conspicuous among the gang that were working at the foundations he set his hand to the shovel himself guided the roadscraper urging on the horses cheering and encouraging the men till they begged him to desist he mingled with the stonemasons advising helping and giving counsel till they pleaded with him to rest he was among the carpenters sawing hammering enquiring suggesting till they besought him to lay off and he was night and day with the architects assistants drawing planning revising till the architect told him to cut it out  so great was his activity that i doubt whether the new church would ever have been finished had not the wardens and the vestry men insisted that mr drone must take a holiday and sent him on the mackinaw trip up the lakesthe only foreign travel of the deans life   so in due time the new church was built and it towered above the maple trees of mariposa like a beacon on a hill it stood so high that from the open steeple of it where the bells were you could see all the town lying at its feet and the farmsteads to the south of it and the railway like a double pencil line and lake wissanotti spread out like a map you could see and appreciate things from the height of the new churchsuch as the size and the growing wealth of mariposathat you never could have seen from the little stone church at all  presently the church was opened and the dean preached his first sermon in it and he called it a greater testimony and he said that it was an earnest or first fruit of endeavour and that it was a token or pledge and he named it also a covenant he said too that it was an anchorage and a harbour and a lighthouse as well as being a city set upon a hill and he ended by declaring it an ark of refuge and notified them that the bible class would meet in the basement of it on that and every other third wednesday  in the opening months of preaching about it the dean had called the church so often an earnest and a pledge and a guerdon and a tabernacle that i think he used to forget that it wasnt paid for it was only when the agent of the building society and a representative of the hosanna pipe and steam organ co limited used to call for quarterly payments that he was suddenly reminded of the fact always after these men came round the dean used to preach a special sermon on sin in the course of which he would mention that the ancient hebrews used to put unjust traders to deatha thing of which he spoke with christian serenity  i dont think that at first anybody troubled much about the debt on the church dean drones figures showed that it was only a matter of time before it would be extinguished only a little effort was needed a little girding up of the loins of the congregation and they could shoulder the whole debt and trample it under their feet let them but set their hands to the plough and they could soon guide it into the deep water then they might furl their sails and sit every man under his own olive tree  meantime while the congregation was waiting to gird up its loins the interest on the debt was paid somehow or when it wasnt paid was added to the principal  i dont know whether you have had any experience with greater testimonies and with beacons set on hills if you have you will realize how at first gradually and then rapidly their position from year to year grows more distressing what with the building loan and the organ instalment and the fire insurancea cruel chargeand the heat and light the rector began to realize as he added up the figures that nothing but logarithms could solve them then the time came when not only the rector but all the wardens knew and the sidesmen knew that the debt was more than the church could carry then the choir knew and the congregation knew and at last everybody knew and there were special collections at easter and special days of giving and special weeks of tribulation and special arrangements with the hosanna pipe and steam organ co and it was noticed that when the rural dean announced a service of lenten sorrowaimed more especially at the business menthe congregation had diminished by forty per cent  i suppose things are just the same elsewherei mean the peculiar kind of discontent that crept into the church of england congregation in mariposa after the setting up of the beacon there were those who claimed that they had seen the error from the first though they had kept quiet as such people always do from breadth of mind there were those who had felt years before how it would end but their lips were sealed from humility of spirit what was worse was that there were others who grew dissatisfied with the whole conduct of the church  yodel the auctioneer for example narrated how he had been to the city and had gone into a service of the roman catholic church i believe to state it more fairly he had dropped inthe only recognized means of access to such a service he claimed that the music that he had heard there was music and that outside of his profession the chanting and intoning could not be touched  ed moore the photographer also related that he had listened to a sermon in the city and that if anyone would guarantee him a sermon like that he would defy you to keep him away from church meanwhile failing the guarantee he stayed away  the very doctrines were impeached some of the congregation began to cast doubts on eternal punishmentdoubts so grave as to keep them absent from the lenten services of sorrow indeed lawyer macartney took up the whole question of the athanasian creed one afternoon with joe milligan the dentist and hardly left a clause of it intact  all this time you will understand dean drone kept on with his special services and leaflets calls and appeals went out from the ark of gideon like rockets from a sinking ship more and more with every month the debt of the church lay heavy on his mind at times he forgot it at other times he woke up in the night and thought about it sometimes as he went down the street from the lighted precincts of the greater testimony and passed the salvation army praying around a naphtha lamp under the open sky it smote him to the heart with a stab  but the congregation were wrong i think in imputing fault to the sermons of dean drone there i do think they were wrong i can speak from personal knowledge when i say that the rectors sermons were not only stimulating in matters of faith but contained valuable material in regard to the greek language to modern machinery and to a variety of things that should have proved of the highest advantage to the congregation  there was i say the greek language the dean always showed the greatest delicacy of feeling in regard to any translation in or out of it that he made from the pulpit he was never willing to accept even the faintest shade of rendering different from that commonly given without being assured of the full concurrence of the congregation either the translation must be unanimous and without contradiction or he could not pass it he would pause in his sermon and would say the original greek is hoson but perhaps you will allow me to translate it as equivalent to hoyon and they did so that if there was any fault to be found it was purely on the side of the congregation for not entering a protest at the time  it was the same way in regard to machinery after all what better illustrates the supreme purpose of the all wise than such a thing as the dynamo or the reciprocating marine engine or the pictures in the scientific american  then too if a man has had the opportunity to travel and has seen the great lakes spread out by the hand of providence from where one leaves the new dock at the sound to where one arrives safe and thankful with ones dear fellowpassengers in the spirit at the concrete landing stage at mackinawis not this fit and proper material for the construction of an analogy or illustration indeed even apart from an analogy is it not mighty interesting to narrate anyway in any case why should the churchwardens have sent the rector on the mackinaw trip if they had not expected him to make some little return for it  i lay some stress on this point because the criticisms directed against the mackinaw sermons always seemed so unfair if the rector had described his experiences in the crude language of the ordinary newspaper there might i admit have been something unfitting about it but he was always careful to express himself in a way that showedor listen let me explain with an example  it happened to be my lot some years ago he would say to find myself a voyager just as one is a voyager on the sea of life on the broad expanse of water which has been spread out to the northwest of us by the hand of providence at a height of five hundred and eightyone feet above the level of the seai refer i may say to lake huron now how different that is from saying ill never forget the time i went on the mackinaw trip the whole thing has a different sound entirely in the same way the dean would go on  i was voyaging on one of those magnificent leviathans of the wateri refer to the boats of the northern navigation companyand was standing beside the forward rail talking with a dear brother in the faith who was journeying westward alsoi may say he was a commercial travellerand beside us was a dear sister in the spirit seated in a deck chair while near us were two other dear souls in grace engaged in christian pastime on the decki allude more particularly to the game of deck billiards  i leave it to any reasonable man whether with that complete and fairminded explanation of the environment it was not perfectly proper to close down the analogy as the rector did with the simple words in fact it was an extremely fine morning  yet there were some people even in mariposa that took exception and spent their sunday dinner time in making out that they couldnt understand what dean drone was talking about and asking one another if they knew once as he passed out from the doors of the greater testimony the rector heard some one say the church would be all right if that old mugwump was out of the pulpit it went to his heart like a barbed thorn and stayed there  you know perhaps how a remark of that sort can stay and rankle and make you wish you could hear it again to make sure of it because perhaps you didnt hear it aright and it was a mistake after all perhaps no one said it anyway you ought to have written it down at the time i have seen the dean take down the encyclopaedia in the rectory and move his finger slowly down the pages of the letter m looking for mugwump but it wasnt there i have known him in his little study upstairs turn over the pages of the animals of palestine looking for a mugwump but there was none there it must have been unknown in the greater days of judea   so things went on from month to month and from year to year and the debt and the charges loomed like a dark and gathering cloud on the horizon i dont mean to say that efforts were not made to face the difficulty and to fight it they were time after time the workers of the congregation got together and thought out plans for the extinction of the debt but somehow after every trial the debt grew larger with each year and every system that could be devised turned out more hopeless than the last  they began i think with the endless chain of letters of appeal you may remember the device for it was allpopular in clerical circles some ten or fifteen years ago you got a number of people to write each of them three letters asking for ten cents from three each of their friends and asking each of them to send on three similar letters three each from three each and three each more from each do you observe the wonderful ingenuity of it nobody i think has forgotten how the willing workers of the church of england church of mariposa sat down in the vestry room in the basement with a pile of stationery three feet high sending out the letters some i know will never forget it certainly not mr pupkin the teller in the exchange bank for it was here that he met zena pepperleigh the judges daughter for the first time and they worked so busily that they wrote out ever so many letterseight or ninein a single afternoon and they discovered that their handwritings were awfully alike which was one of the most extraordinary and amazing coincidences you will admit in the history of chirography  but the scheme failedfailed utterly i dont know why the letters went out and were copied broadcast and recopied till you could see the mariposa endless chain winding its way towards the rocky mountains but they never got the ten cents the willing workers wrote for it in thousands but by some odd chance they never struck the person who had it  then after that there came a regular winter of effort first of all they had a bazaar that was got up by the girls auxiliary and held in the basement of the church all the girls wore special costumes that were brought up from the city and they had booths where there was every imaginable thing for salepincushion covers and chair covers and sofa covers everything that you can think of if the people had once started buying them the debt would have been lifted in no time even as it was the bazaar only lost twenty dollars  after that i think was the magic lantern lecture that dean drone gave on italy and her invaders they got the lantern and the slides up from the city and it was simply splendid some of the slides were perhaps a little confusing but it was all therethe pictures of the dense italian jungle and the crocodiles and the naked invaders with their invading clubs it was a pity that it was such a bad night snowing hard and a curling match on or they would have made a lot of money out of the lecture as it was the loss apart from the breaking of the lantern which was unavoidable was quite trifling   i can hardly remember all the things that there were after that i recollect that it was always mullins who arranged about renting the hall and printing the tickets and all that sort of thing his father you remember had been at the anglican college with dean drone and though the rector was thirtyseven years older than mullins he leaned upon him in matters of business as upon a staff and though mullins was thirtyseven years younger than the dean he leaned against him in matters of doctrine as against a rock  at one time they got the idea that what the public wanted was not anything instructive but something light and amusing mullins said that people loved to laugh he said that if you get a lot of people all together and get them laughing you can do anything you like with them once they start to laugh they are lost so they got mr dreery the english literature teacher at the high school to give an evening of readings from the great humorists from chaucer to adam smith they came mighty near to making a barrel of money out of that if the people had once started laughing it would have been all over with them as it was i heard a lot of them say that they simply wanted to scream with laughter they said they just felt like bursting into peals of laughter all the time even when in the more subtle parts they didnt feel like bursting out laughing they said they had all they could do to keep from smiling they said they never had such a hard struggle in their lives not to smile  in fact the chairman said when he put the vote of thanks that he was sure if people had known what the lecture was to be like there would have been a much better turnout but you see all that the people had to go on was just the announcement of the name of the lecturer mr dreery and that he would lecture on english humour all seats twentyfive cents as the chairman expressed it himself if the people had had any idea any idea at all of what the lecture would be like they would have been there in hundreds but how could they get an idea that it would be so amusing with practically nothing to go upon   after that attempt things seemed to go from bad to worse nearly everybody was disheartened about it what would have happened to the debt or whether they would have ever paid it off is more than i can say if it hadnt occurred that light broke in on mullins in the strangest and most surprising way you can imagine it happened that he went away for his bank holidays and while he was away he happened to be present in one of the big cities and saw how they went at it there to raise money he came home in such a state of excitement that he went straight up from the mariposa station to the rectory valise and all and he burst in one april evening to where the rural dean was sitting with the three girls beside the lamp in the front room and he cried out  mr drone ive got itive got a way that will clear the debt before youre a fortnight older well have a whirlwind campaign in mariposa  but stay the change from the depth of depression to the pinnacle of hope is too abrupt i must pause and tell you in another chapter of the whirlwind campaign in mariposa     five the whirlwind campaign in mariposa  it was mullins the banker who told mariposa all about the plan of a whirlwind campaign and explained how it was to be done hed happened to be in one of the big cities when they were raising money by a whirlwind campaign for one of the universities and he saw it all  he said he would never forget the scene on the last day of it when the announcement was made that the total of the money raised was even more than what was needed it was a splendid sightthe business men of the town all cheering and laughing and shaking hands and the professors with the tears streaming down their faces and the deans of the faculties who had given money themselves sobbing aloud  he said it was the most moving thing he ever saw  so as i said henry mullins who had seen it explained to the others how it was done he said that first of all a few of the business men got together quietlyvery quietly indeed the more quietly the betterand talked things over perhaps one of them would dinejust quietlywith another one and discuss the situation then these two would invite a third manpossibly even a fourthto have lunch with them and talk in a general wayeven talk of other things part of the time and so on in this way things would be discussed and looked at in different lights and viewed from different angles and then when everything was ready they would go at things with a rush a central committee would be formed and subcommittees with captains of each group and recorders and secretaries and on a stated day the whirlwind campaign would begin  each day the crowd would all agree to meet at some stated place and each lunch togethersay at a restaurant or at a club or at some eating place this would go on every day with the interest getting keener and keener and everybody getting more and more excited till presently the chairman would announce that the campaign had succeeded and there would be the kind of scene that mullins had described  so that was the plan that they set in motion in mariposa   i dont wish to say too much about the whirlwind campaign itself i dont mean to say that it was a failure on the contrary in many ways it couldnt have been a greater success and yet somehow it didnt seem to work out just as henry mullins had said it would it may be that there are differences between mariposa and the larger cities that one doesnt appreciate at first sight perhaps it would have been better to try some other plan  yet they followed along the usual line of things closely enough they began with the regular system of some of the business men getting together in a quiet way  first of all for example henry mullins came over quietly to duffs rooms over the commercial bank with a bottle of rye whiskey and they talked things over and the night after that george duff came over quietly to mullinss rooms over the exchange bank with a bottle of scotch whiskey a few evenings after that mullins and duff went together in a very unostentatious way with perhaps a couple of bottles of rye to pete glovers room over the hardware store and then all three of them went up one night with ed moore the photographer to judge pepperleighs house under pretence of having a game of poker the very day after that mullins and duff and ed moore and pete glover and the judge got will harrison the harness maker to go out without any formality on the lake on the pretext of fishing and the next night after that duff and mullins and ed moore and pete glover and pepperleigh and will harrison got alf trelawney the postmaster to come over just in a casual way to the mariposa house after the night mail and the next day mullins and duff and  but pshaw you see at once how the thing is worked theres no need to follow that part of the whirlwind campaign further but it just shows the power of organization  and all this time mind you they were talking things over and looking at things first in one light and then in another lightin fact just doing as the big city men do when theres an important thing like this under way  so after things had been got pretty well into shape in this way duff asked mullins one night straight out if he would be chairman of the central committee he sprung it on him and mullins had no time to refuse but he put it to duff straight whether he would be treasurer and duff had no time to refuse   that gave things a start and within a week they had the whole organization on foot there was the grand central committee and six groups or subcommittees of twenty men each and a captain for every group they had it all arranged on the lines most likely to be effective  in one group there were all the bankers mullins and duff and pupkin with the cameo pin and about four others they had their photographs taken at ed moores studio taken in a line with a background of icebergsa winter sceneand a pretty penetrating crowd they looked i can tell you after all you know if you get a crowd of representative bank men together in any financial deal youve got a pretty considerable leverage right away  in the second group were the lawyers nivens and macartney and the restabout as levelheaded a lot as youd see anywhere get the lawyers of a town with you on a thing like this and youll find youve got a sort of brain power with you that youd never get without them  then there were the business menthere was a solid crowd for youharrison the harness maker and glover the hardware man and all that gang not talkers perhaps but solid men who can tell you to a nicety how many cents there are in a dollar its all right to talk about education and that sort of thing but if you want driving power and efficiency get business men theyre seeing it every day in the city and its just the same in mariposa why in the big concerns in the city if they found out a man was educated they wouldnt have himwouldnt keep him there a minute thats why the business men have to conceal it so much  then in the other teams there were the doctors and the newspaper men and the professional men like judge pepperleigh and yodel the auctioneer   it was all organized so that every team had its headquarters two of them in each of the three hotelsone upstairs and one down and it was arranged that there would be a big lunch every day to be held in smiths caff round the corner of smiths northern health resort and home of the wissanotti angleryou know the place the lunch was divided up into tables with a captain for each table to see about things to drink and of course all the tables were in competition with one another in fact the competition was the very life of the whole thing  its just wonderful how these things run when theyre organized take the first luncheon for example there they all were every man in his place every captain at his post at the top of the table it was hard perhaps for some of them to get there they had very likely to be in their stores and banks and offices till the last minute and then make a dash for it it was the cleanest piece of team work you ever saw  you have noticed already i am sure that a good many of the captains and committee men didnt belong to the church of england church glover for instance was a presbyterian till they ran the picket fence of the manse two feet on to his property and after that he became a freethinker but in mariposa as i have said everybody likes to be in everything and naturally a whirlwind campaign was a novelty anyway it would have been a poor business to keep a man out of the lunches merely on account of his religion i trust that the day for that kind of religious bigotry is past  of course the excitement was when henry mullins at the head of the table began reading out the telegrams and letters and messages first of all there was a telegram of good wishes from the anglican lord bishop of the diocese to henry mullins and calling him dear brother in grace the mariposa telegraph office is a little unreliable and it read dear brother in grease but that was good enough the bishop said that his most earnest wishes were with them  then mullins read a letter from the mayor of mariposa pete glover was mayor that yearstating that his keenest desires were with them and then one from the carriage company saying that its heartiest good will was all theirs and then one from the meat works saying that its nearest thoughts were next to them then he read one from himself as head of the exchange bank you understand informing him that he had heard of his project and assuring him of his liveliest interest in what he proposed  at each of these telegrams and messages there was round after round of applause so that you could hardly hear yourself speak or give an order but that was nothing to when mullins got up again and beat on the table for silence and made one of those crackling speechesjust the way business men speakthe kind of speech that a college man simply cant make i wish i could repeat it all i remember that it began now boys you know what were here for gentlemen and it went on just as good as that all through when mullins had done he took out a fountain pen and wrote out a cheque for a hundred dollars conditional on the fund reaching fifty thousand and there was a burst of cheers all over the room  just the moment he had done it up sprang george duffyou know the keen competition there is as a straight matter of business between the banks in mariposaup sprang george duff i say and wrote out a cheque for another hundred conditional on the fund reaching seventy thousand you never heard such cheering in your life  and then when netley walked up to the head of the table and laid down a cheque for a hundred dollars conditional on the fund reaching one hundred thousand the room was in an uproar a hundred thousand dollars just think of it the figures fairly stagger one to think of a hundred thousand dollars raised in five minutes in a little place like mariposa  and even that was nothing in less than no time there was such a crowd round mullins trying to borrow his pen all at once that his waistcoat was all stained with ink finally when they got order at last and mullins stood up and announced that the conditional fund had reached a quarter of a million the whole place was a perfect babel of cheering oh these whirlwind campaigns are wonderful things   i can tell you the committee felt pretty proud that first day there was henry mullins looking a little bit flushed and excited with his white waistcoat and an american beauty rose and with ink marks all over him from the cheque signing and he kept telling them that hed known all along that all that was needed was to get the thing started and telling again about what hed seen at the university campaign and about the professors crying and wondering if the high school teachers would come down for the last day of the meetings  looking back on the mariposa whirlwind i can never feel that it was a failure after all there is a sympathy and a brotherhood in these things when men work shoulder to shoulder if you had seen the canvassers of the committee going round the town that evening shoulder to shoulder from the mariposa house to the continental and up to mullinss rooms and over to duffs shoulder to shoulder youd have understood it  i dont say that every lunch was quite such a success as the first its not always easy to get out of the store if youre a busy man and a good many of the whirlwind committee found that they had just time to hurry down and snatch their lunch and get back again still they came and snatched it as long as the lunches lasted they came even if they had simply to rush it and grab something to eat and drink without time to talk to anybody they came  no no it was not lack of enthusiasm that killed the whirlwind campaign in mariposa it must have been something else i dont just know what it was but i think it had something to do with the financial the bookkeeping side of the thing  it may have been too that the organization was not quite correctly planned you see if practically everybody is on the committees it is awfully hard to try to find men to canvass and it is not allowable for the captains and the committee men to canvass one another because their gifts are spontaneous so the only thing that the different groups could do was to wait round in some likely placesay the bar parlour of smiths hotelin the hope that somebody might come in who could be canvassed  you might ask why they didnt canvass mr smith himself but of course they had done that at the very start as i should have said mr smith had given them two hundred dollars in cash conditional on the lunches being held in the caff of his hotel and its awfully hard to get a proper lunch i mean the kind to which a bishop can express regret at not being thereunder a dollar twentyfive so mr smith got back his own money and the crowd began eating into the benefactions and it got more and more complicated whether to hold another lunch in the hope of breaking even or to stop the campaign  it was disappointing yes in spite of all the success and the sympathy it was disappointing i dont say it didnt do good no doubt a lot of the men got to know one another better than ever they had before i have myself heard judge pepperleigh say that after the campaign he knew all of pete glover that he wanted to there was a lot of that kind of complete satiety the real trouble about the whirlwind campaign was that they never clearly understood which of them were the whirlwind and who were to be the campaign  some of them i believe took it pretty much to heart i know that henry mullins did you could see it the first day he came down to the lunch all dressed up with the american beauty and the white waistcoat the second day he only wore a pink carnation and a grey waistcoat the third day he had on a dead daffodil and a cardigan undervest and on the last day when the high school teachers should have been there he only wore his office suit and he hadnt even shaved he looked beaten  it was that night that he went up to the rectory to tell the news to dean drone it had been arranged you know that the rector should not attend the lunches so as to let the whole thing come as a surprise so that all he knew about it was just scraps of information about the crowds at the lunch and how they cheered and all that once i believe he caught sight of the newspacket with a twoinch headline a quarter of a million but he wouldnt let himself read further because it would have spoilt the surprise  i saw mullins as i say go up the street on his way to dean drones it was middle april and there was ragged snow on the streets and the nights were dark still and cold i saw mullins grit his teeth as he walked and i know that he held in his coat pocket his own cheque for the hundred with the condition taken off it and he said that there were so many skunks in mariposa that a man might as well be in the head office in the city  the dean came out to the little gate in the darkyou could see the lamplight behind him from the open door of the rectoryand he shook hands with mullins and they went in together     six the beacon on the hill  mullins said afterward that it was ever so much easier than he thought it would have been the dean he said was so quiet of course if mr drone had started to swear at mullins or tried to strike him it would have been much harder but as it was he was so quiet that part of the time he hardly seemed to follow what mullins was saying so mullins was glad of that because it proved that the dean wasnt feeling disappointed as in a way he might have  indeed the only time when the rector seemed animated and excited in the whole interview was when mullins said that the campaign had been ruined by a lot of confounded mugwumps straight away the dean asked if those mugwumps had really prejudiced the outcome of the campaign mullins said there was no doubt of it and the dean enquired if the presence of mugwumps was fatal in matters of endeavour and mullins said that it was then the rector asked if even one mugwump was in the christian sense deleterious mullins said that one mugwump would kill anything after that the dean hardly spoke at all  in fact the rector presently said that he mustnt detain mullins too long and that he had detained him too long already and that mullins must be weary from his train journey and that in cases of extreme weariness nothing but a sound sleep was of any avail he himself unfortunately would not be able to avail himself of the priceless boon of slumber until he had first retired to his study to write some letters so that mullins who had a certain kind of social quickness of intuition saw that it was time to leave and went away  it was midnight as he went down the street and a dark still night that can be stated positively because it came out in court afterwards mullins swore that it was a dark night he admitted under examination that there may have been the stars or at least some of the less important of them though he had made no attempt as brought out on crossexamination to count them there may have been too the electric lights and mullins was not willing to deny that it was quite possible that there was more or less moonlight but that there was no light that night in the form of sunlight mullins was absolutely certain all that i say came out in court  but meanwhile the rector had gone upstairs to his study and had seated himself in front of his table to write his letters it was here always that he wrote his sermons from the window of the room you looked through the bare white maple trees to the sweeping outline of the church shadowed against the night sky and beyond that though far off was the new cemetery where the rector walked of a sunday i think i told you why beyond that again for the window faced the east there lay at no very great distance the new jerusalem there were no better things that a man might look towards from his study window nor anything that could serve as a better aid to writing  but this night the deans letters must have been difficult indeed to write for he sat beside the table holding his pen and with his head bent upon his other hand and though he sometimes put a line or two on the paper for the most part he sat motionless the fact is that dean drone was not trying to write letters but only one letter he was writing a letter of resignation if you have not done that for forty years it is extremely difficult to get the words  so at least the dean found it first he wrote one set of words and then he sat and thought and wrote something else but nothing seemed to suit  the real truth was that dean drone perhaps more than he knew himself had a fine taste for words and effects and when you feel that a situation is entirely out of the common you naturally try if you have that instinct to give it the right sort of expression  i believe that at the time when rupert drone had taken the medal in greek over fifty years ago it was only a twist of fate that had prevented him from becoming a great writer there was a buried author in him just as there was a buried financier in jefferson thorpe in fact there were many people in mariposa like that and for all i know you may yourself have seen such elsewhere for instance i am certain that billy rawson the telegraph operator at mariposa could easily have invented radium in the same way one has only to read the advertisements of mr gingham the undertaker to know that there is still in him a poet who could have written on death far more attractive verses than the thanatopsis of cullen bryant and under a title less likely to offend the public and drive away custom he has told me this himself  so the dean tried first this and then that and nothing would seem to suit first of all he wrote  it is now forty years since i came among you a youth full of life and hope and ardent in the work before me then he paused doubtful of the accuracy and clearness of the expression read it over again and again in deep thought and then began again  it is now forty years since i came among you a broken and melancholy boy without life or hope desiring only to devote to the service of this parish such few years as might remain of an existence blighted before it had truly begun and then again the dean stopped he read what he had written he frowned he crossed it through with his pen this was no way to write this thin egotistical strain of complaint once more he started  it is now forty years since i came among you a man already tempered and trained except possibly in mathematics and then again the rector paused and his mind drifted away to the memory of the anglican professor that i spoke of who had had so little sense of his higher mission as to omit the teaching of logarithms and the rector mused so long that when he began again it seemed to him that it was simpler and better to discard the personal note altogether and he wrote  there are times gentlemen in the life of a parish when it comes to an epoch which brings it to a moment when it reaches a point  the dean stuck fast again but refusing this time to be beaten went resolutely on  reaches a point where the circumstances of the moment make the epoch such as to focus the life of the parish in that time  then the dean saw that he was beaten and he knew that he not only couldnt manage the parish but couldnt say so in proper english and of the two the last was the bitterer discovery  he raised his head and looked for a moment through the window at the shadow of the church against the night so outlined that you could almost fancy that the light of the new jerusalem was beyond it then he wrote and this time not to the world at large but only to mullins  my dear harry i want to resign my charge will you come over and help me   when the dean at last rose from writing that i think it was far on in the night as he rose he looked again through the window looked once and then once more and so stood with widening eyes and his face set towards what he saw  what was that that light in the sky there eastwardnear or far he could not say was it already the dawn of the new jerusalem brightening in the east or was itlookin the church itselfwhat is thatthat dull red glow that shines behind the stainedglass windows turning them to crimson that fork of flame that breaks now from the casement and flashes upward along the woodand seethat sudden sheet of fire that springs the windows of the church with the roar of splintered glass and surges upward into the sky till the dark night and the bare trees and sleeping street of mariposa are all illumined with its glow  fire fire and the sudden sound of the bell now breaking upon the night  so stood the dean erect with one hand pressed against the table for support while the mariposa fire bell struck out its warning to the sleeping townstood there while the street grew loud with the tumult of voiceswith the roaring gallop of the fire brigadewith the harsh note of the gongand over all other sounds the great seething of the flames that tore their way into the beams and rafters of the pointed church and flared above it like a torch into the midnight sky  so stood the dean and as the church broke thus into a very beacon kindled upon a hillsank forward without a sign his face against the table stricken   you need to see a fire in a place such as mariposa a town still half of wood to know what fire means in the city it is all different to the onlooker at any rate a fire is only a spectacle nothing more everything is arranged organized certain it is only once perhaps in a century that fire comes to a large city as it comes to the little wooden town like mariposa as a great terror of the night  that at any rate is what it meant in mariposa that night in april the night the church of england church burnt down had the fire gained but a hundred feet or less it could have reached from the driving shed behind the church to the backs of the wooden shops of the main street and once there not all the waters of lake wissanotti could stay the course of its destruction it was for that hundred feet that they fought the men of mariposa from the midnight call of the bell till the slow coming of the day they fought the fire not to save the church for that was doomed from the first outbreak of the flames but to stop the spread of it and save the town they fought it at the windows and at the blazing doors and through the yawning furnace of the open belfry fought it with the mariposa engine thumping and panting in the street itself aglow with fire like a servant demon fighting its own kind with tall ladders reaching to the very roof and with hose that poured their streams of tossing water foaming into the flames  most of all they fought to save the wooden driving shed behind the church from which the fire could leap into the heart of mariposa that was where the real fight was for the life of the town i wish you could have seen how they turned the hose against the shingles ripping and tearing them from their places with the force of the driven water how they mounted on the roof axe in hand and cut madly at the rafters to bring the building down while the black clouds of smoke rolled in volumes about the men as they worked you could see the fire horses harnessed with logging chains to the uprights of the shed to tear the building from its place  most of all i wish you could have seen mr smith proprietor as i think you know of smiths hotel there on the roof with a firemans helmet on cutting through the main beam of solid cedar twelve by twelve that held tight still when the rafters and the roof tree were down already the shed on fire in a dozen places and the other men driven from the work by the flaming sparks and by the strangle of the smoke not so mr smith see him there as he plants himself firm at the angle of the beams and with the full impact of his two hundred and eighty pounds drives his axe into the wood i tell you it takes a man from the pine country of the north to handle an axe right left left right down it comes with never a pause or stay never missing by a fraction of an inch the line of the stroke at it smith down with it till with a shout from the crowd the beam gapes asunder and mr smith is on the ground again roaring his directions to the men and horses as they haul down the shed in a voice that dominates the fire itself  who made mr smith the head and chief of the mariposa fire brigade that night i cannot say i do not know even where he got the huge red helmet that he wore nor had i ever heard till the night the church burnt down that mr smith was a member of the fire brigade at all but its always that way your little narrowchested men may plan and organize but when there is something to be done something real then its the man of size and weight that steps to the front every time look at bismarck and mr gladstone and president taft and mr smiththe same thing in each case  i suppose it was perfectly natural that just as soon as mr smith came on the scene he put on somebodys helmet and shouted his directions to the men and bossed the mariposa fire brigade like bismarck with the german parliament  the fire had broken out late late at night and they fought it till the day the flame of it lit up the town and the bare grey maple trees and you could see in the light of it the broad sheet of the frozen lake snow covered still it kindled such a beacon as it burned that from the other side of the lake the people on the night express from the north could see it twenty miles away it lit up such a testimony of flame that mariposa has never seen the like of it before or since then when the roof crashed in and the tall steeple tottered and fell so swift a darkness seemed to come that the grey trees and the frozen lake vanished in a moment as if blotted out of existence   when the morning came the great church of mariposa was nothing but a ragged group of walls with a sodden heap of bricks and blackened wood still hissing here and there beneath the hose with the sullen anger of a conquered fire round the ruins of the fire walked the people of mariposa next morning and they pointed out where the wreck of the steeple had fallen and where the bells of the church lay in a molten heap among the bricks and they talked of the loss that it was and how many dollars it would take to rebuild the church and whether it was insured and for how much and there were at least fourteen people who had seen the fire first and more than that who had given the first alarm and ever so many who knew how fires of this sort could be prevented  most noticeable of all you could see the sidesmen and the wardens and mullins the chairman of the vestry talking in little groups about the fire later in the day there came from the city the insurance men and the fire appraisers and they too walked about the ruins and talked with the wardens and the vestry men there was such a luxury of excitement in the town that day that it was just as good as a public holiday  but the strangest part of it was the unexpected sequel i dont know through what error of the deans figures it happened through what lack of mathematical training the thing turned out as it did no doubt the memory of the mathematical professor was heavily to blame for it but the solid fact is that the church of england church of mariposa turned out to be insured for a hundred thousand and there were the receipts and the vouchers all signed and regular just as they found them in a drawer of the rectors study there was no doubt about it the insurance people might protest as they liked the straight plain fact was that the church was insured for about twice the whole amount of the cost and the debt and the rectors salary and the boardingschool fees of the littlest of the drones all put together   there was a whirlwind campaign for you talk of raising moneythat was something like i wonder if the universities and the city institutions that go round trying to raise money by the slow and painful method called a whirlwind campaign that takes perhaps all day to raise fifty thousand dollars ever thought of anything so beautifully simple as this  the greater testimony that had lain so heavily on the congregation went flaming to its end and burned up its debts and its obligations and enriched its worshippers by its destruction talk of a beacon on a hill you can hardly beat that one  i wish you could have seen how the wardens and the sidesmen and mullins the chairman of the vestry smiled and chuckled at the thought of it hadnt they said all along that all that was needed was a little faith and effort and here it was just as they said and theyd been right after all  protest from the insurance people legal proceedings to prevent payment my dear sir i see you know nothing about the mariposa court in spite of the fact that i have already said that it was one of the most precise instruments of british fair play ever established why judge pepperleigh disposed of the case and dismissed the protest of the company in less than fifteen minutes just what the jurisdiction of judge pepperleighs court is i dont know but i do know that in upholding the rights of a christian congregationi am quoting here the text of the decisionagainst the intrigues of a set of infernal skunks that make too much money anyway the mariposa court is without an equal pepperleigh even threatened the plaintiffs with the penitentiary or worse  how the fire started no one ever knew there was a queer story that went about to the effect that mr smith and mr ginghams assistant had been seen very late that night carrying an automobile can of kerosene up the street but that was amply disproved by the proceedings of the court and by the evidence of mr smith himself he took his dying oathnot his ordinary one as used in the license cases but his dying onethat he had not carried a can of kerosene up the street and that anyway it was the rottenest kind of kerosene he had ever seen and no more use than so much molasses so that point was settled  dean drone did he get well again why what makes you ask that you mean was his head at all affected after the stroke no it was not absolutely not it was not affected in the least though how anybody who knows him now in mariposa could have the faintest idea that his mind was in any way impaired by the stroke is more than i can tell the engaging of mr uttermost the curate whom perhaps you have heard preach in the new church had nothing whatever to do with dean drones head it was merely a case of the pressure of overwork it was felt very generally by the wardens that in these days of specialization the rector was covering too wide a field and that if he should abandon some of the lesser duties of his office he might devote his energies more intently to the infant class that was all you may hear him there any afternoon talking to them if you will stand under the maple trees and listen through the open windows of the new infant school  and as for audiences for intelligence for attentionwell if i want to find listeners who can hear and understand about the great spaces of lake huron let me tell of it every time face to face with the blue eyes of the infant class fresh from the infinity of spaces greater still talk of grownup people all you like but for listeners let me have the infant class with their pinafores and their teddy bears and their feet not even touching the floor and mr uttermost may preach to his hearts content of the newer forms of doubt revealed by the higher criticism  so you will understand that the deans mind is if anything even keener and his head even clearer than before and if you want proof of it notice him there beneath the plum blossoms reading in the greek he has told me that he finds that he can read with the greatest ease works in the greek that seemed difficult before because his head is so clear now  and sometimeswhen his head is very clearas he sits there reading beneath the plum blossoms he can hear them singing beyond and his wifes voice     seven the extraordinary entanglement of mr pupkin  judge pepperleigh lived in a big house with hardwood floors and a wide piazza that looked over the lake from the top of oneida street  every day about halfpast five he used to come home from his office in the mariposa court house on some days as he got near the house he would call out to his wife  almighty moses martha who left the sprinkler on the grass  on other days he would call to her from quite a little distance off hullo mother got any supper for a hungry man  and mrs pepperleigh never knew which it would be on the days when he swore at the sprinkler you could see his spectacles flash like dynamite but on the days when he called hullo mother they were simply irradiated with kindliness  some days i say he would cry out with a perfect whine of indignation suffering caesar has that infernal dog torn up those geraniums again and other days you would hear him singing out hullo rover well doggie well old fellow  in the same way at breakfast the judge as he looked over the morning paper would sometimes leap to his feet with a perfect howl of suffering and cry everlasting moses the liberals have carried east elgin or else he would lean back from the breakfast table with the most goodhumoured laugh you ever heard and say ha ha the conservatives have carried south norfolk  and yet he was perfectly logical when you come to think of it after all what is more annoying to a sensitive highlystrung man than an infernal sprinkler playing all over the place and what more agreeable to a goodnatured eventempered fellow than a wellprepared supper or what is more likeable than ones good old affectionate dog bounding down the path from sheer delight at seeing youor more execrable than an infernal whelp that has torn up the geraniums and is too old to keep anyway  as for politics well it all seemed reasonable enough when the conservatives got in anywhere pepperleigh laughed and enjoyed it simply because it does one good to see a straight fine honest fight where the best man wins when a liberal got in it made him mad and he said sonot mind you from any political bias for his office forbid itbut simply because one cant bear to see the country go absolutely to the devil  i suppose too it was partly the effect of sitting in court all day listening to cases one gets what you might call the judicial temper of mind pepperleigh had it so strongly developed that ive seen him kick a hydrangea pot to pieces with his foot because the accursed thing wouldnt flower he once threw the canary cage clear into the lilac bushes because the blasted bird wouldnt stop singing it was a straight case of judicial temper lots of judges have it developed in just the same broad allround way as with judge pepperleigh   i think it must be passing sentences that does it anyway pepperleigh had the aptitude for passing sentences so highly perfected that he spent his whole time at it inside of court and out ive heard him hand out sentences for the sultan of turkey and mrs pankhurst and the emperor of germany that made ones blood run cold he would sit there on the piazza of a summer evening reading the paper with dynamite sparks flying from his spectacles as he sentenced the czar of russia to ten years in the salt minesand made it fifteen a few minutes afterwards pepperleigh always read the foreign newsthe news of things that he couldnt alteras a form of wild and stimulating torment  so you can imagine that in some ways the judges house was a pretty difficult house to go to i mean you can see how awfully hard it must have been for mr pupkin i tell you it took some nerve to step up on that piazza and say in a perfectly natural offhand way oh how do you do judge is miss zena in no i wont stay thanks i think i ought to be going i simply called a man who can do that has got to have a pretty fair amount of savoir what do you call it and hes got to be mighty well shaved and have his cameo pin put in his tie at a pretty undeniable angle before he can tackle it yes and even then he may need to hang round behind the lilac bushes for half an hour first and cool off and hes apt to make pretty good time down oneida street on the way back  still thats what you call love and if youve got it and are well shaved and your boots well blacked you can do things that seem almost impossible yes you can do anything even if you do trip over the dog in getting off the piazza  dont suppose for a moment that judge pepperleigh was an unapproachable or a harsh man always and to everybody even mr pupkin had to admit that that couldnt be so to know that you had only to see zena pepperleigh put her arm round his neck and call him daddy she would do that even when there were two or three young men sitting on the edge of the piazza you know i think the way they sit on the edge in mariposa it is meant to indicate what part of the family they have come to see thus when george duff the bank manager came up to the pepperleigh house he always sat in a chair on the verandah and talked to the judge but when pupkin or mallory tompkins or any fellow like that came he sat down in a sidelong fashion on the edge of the boards and then they knew exactly what he was there for if he knew the house well he leaned his back against the verandah post and smoked a cigarette but that took nerve  but i am afraid that this is a digression and of course you know all about it just as well as i do all that i was trying to say was that i dont suppose that the judge had ever spoken a cross word to zena in his lifeoh he threw her novel over the grapevine i dont deny that but then why on earth should a girl read trash like the errant quest of the palladin pilgrim and the life of sir galahad when the house was full of good reading like the life of sir john a macdonald and pioneer days in tecumseh township   still what i mean is that the judge never spoke harshly to zena except perhaps under extreme provocation and i am quite sure that he never never had to neil but then what father ever would want to speak angrily to such a boy as neil pepperleigh the judge took no credit himself for that the finest grown boy in the whole county and so broad and big that they took him into the missinaba horse when he was only seventeen and cleverso clever that he didnt need to study so clever that he used to come out at the foot of the class in mathematics at the mariposa high school through sheer surplus of brain power ive heard the judge explain it a dozen times why neil was so clever that he used to be able to play billiards at the mariposa house all evening when the other boys had to stay at home and study  such a powerful looking fellow too everybody in mariposa remembers how neil pepperleigh smashed in the face of peter mcginnis the liberal organizer at the big electionyou recall itwhen the old macdonald government went out judge pepperleigh had to try him for it the next morninghis own son they say there never was such a scene even in the mariposa court there was i believe something like it on a smaller scale in roman history but it wasnt half as dramatic i remember judge pepperleigh leaning forward to pass the sentencefor a judge is bound you know by his oathand how grave he looked and yet so proud and happy like a man doing his duty and sustained by it and he said  my boy you are innocent you smashed in peter mcginniss face but you did it without criminal intent you put a face on him by jehoshaphat that he wont lose for six months but you did it without evil purpose or malign design my boy look up give me your hand you leave this court without a stain upon your name  they said it was one of the most moving scenes ever enacted in the mariposa court   but the strangest thing is that if the judge had known what every one else in mariposa knew it would have broken his heart if he could have seen neil with the drunken flush on his face in the billiard room of the mariposa houseif he had known as every one else did that neil was crazed with drink the night he struck the liberal organizer when the old macdonald government went outif he could have known that even on that last day neil was drunk when he rode with the missinaba horse to the station to join the third contingent for the war and all the street of the little town was one great roar of people  but the judge never knew and now he never will for if you could find it in the meanness of your soul to tell him it would serve no purpose now except to break his heart and there would rise up to rebuke you the pictured vision of an untended grave somewhere in the great silences of south africa  did i say above or seem to imply that the judge sometimes spoke harshly to his wife or did you gather for a minute that her lot was one to lament over or feel sorry for if so it just shows that you know nothing about such things and that marriage at least as it exists in mariposa is a sealed book to you you are as ignorant as miss spiffkins the biology teacher at the high school who always says how sorry she is for mrs pepperleigh you get that impression simply because the judge howled like an algonquin indian when he saw the sprinkler running on the lawn but are you sure you know the other side of it are you quite sure when you talk like miss spiffkins does about the rights of it that you are taking all things into account you might have thought differently perhaps of the pepperleighs anyway if you had been there that evening when the judge came home to his wife with one hand pressed to his temple and in the other the cablegram that said that neil had been killed in action in south africa that night they sat together with her hand in his just as they had sat together thirty years ago when he was a law student in the city  go and tell miss spiffkins that hydrangeascanaries temperblazes what does miss spiffkins know about it all  but in any case if you tried to tell judge pepperleigh about neil now he wouldnt believe it hed laugh it to scorn that is neils picture in uniform hanging in the diningroom beside the fathers of confederation that militarylooking man in the picture beside him is general kitchener whom you may perhaps have heard of for he was very highly spoken of in neils letters all round the room in fact and still more in the judges library upstairs you will see pictures of south africa and the departure of the canadians there are none of the return and of mounted infantry and of unmounted cavalry and a lot of things that only soldiers and the fathers of soldiers know about  so you can realize that for a fellow who isnt military and who wears nothing nearer to a uniform than a daffodil tennis blazer the judges house is a devil of a house to come to  i think you remember young mr pupkin do you not i have referred to him several times already as the junior teller in the exchange bank but if you know mariposa at all you have often seen him you have noticed him i am sure going for the bank mail in the morning in an office suit effect of clinging grey with a gold necktie pin shaped like a riding whip you have seen him often enough going down to the lake front after supper in tennis things smoking a cigarette and with a paddle and a crimson canoe cushion under his arm you have seen him entering dean drones church in a top hat and a long frock coat nearly to his feet you have seen him perhaps playing poker in peter glovers room over the hardware store and trying to look as if he didnt hold three acesin fact giving absolutely no sign of it beyond the wild flush in his face and the fact that his hair stands on end  that kind of reticence is a thing you simply have to learn in banking i mean if youve got to be in a position where you know for a fact that the mariposa packing companys account is overdrawn by sixtyfour dollars and yet darent say anything about it not even to the girls that you play tennis withi dont say not a casual hint as a reference but not really tell them not for instance bring down the bank ledger to the tennis court and show themyou learn a sort of reticence and selfcontrol that people outside of banking circles never can attain  why ive known pupkin at the firemans ball lean against the wall in his dress suit and talk away to jim eliot the druggist without giving the faintest hint or indication that eliots note for twentyseven dollars had been protested that very morning not a hint of it i dont say he didnt mention it in a sort of way in the supper room just to one or two but i mean there was nothing in the way he leant up against the wall to suggest it  but however i dont mention that as either for or against mr pupkin that sort of thing is merely the a b c of banking as he himself told me when explaining why it was that he hesitated to divulge the exact standing of the mariposa carriage company of course once you get past the a b c you can learn a lot that is mighty interesting  so i think that if you know mariposa and understand even the rudiments of banking you are perfectly acquainted with mr pupkin what you remember him as being in love with miss lawson the high school teacher in love with her what a ridiculous idea you mean merely because on the night when the mariposa belle sank with every soul on board pupkin put off from the town in a skiff to rescue miss lawson oh but youre quite wrong that wasnt love ive heard pupkin explain it himself a dozen times that sort of thingpaddling out to a sinking steamer at night in a crazy skiffmay indicate a sort of attraction but not real love not what pupkin came to feel afterwards indeed when he began to think of it it wasnt even attraction it was merely respectthats all it was and anyway that was long before six or seven months back and pupkin admitted that at the time he was a mere boy   mr pupkin i must explain lived with mallory tompkins in rooms over the exchange bank on the very top floor the third with mullinss own rooms below them extremely comfortable quarters they were with two bedrooms and a sittingroom that was all fixed up with snowshoes and tennis rackets on the walls and dance programmes and canoe club badges and all that sort of thing  mallory tompkins was a young man with long legs and check trousers who worked on the mariposa timesherald that was what gave him his literary taste he used to read ibsen and that other dutch authorbumstone bumstone isnt itand you can judge that he was a mighty intellectual fellow he was so intellectual that he was as he himself admitted a complete eggnostic he and pupkin used to have the most tremendous arguments about creation and evolution and how if you study at a school of applied science you learn that theres no hell beyond the present life  mallory tompkins used to prove absolutely that the miracles were only electricity and pupkin used to admit that it was an awfully good argument but claimed that he had heard it awfully well answered in a sermon though unfortunately he had forgotten how  tompkins used to show that the flood was contrary to geology and pupkin would acknowledge that the point was an excellent one but that he had read a bookthe title of which he ought to have written downwhich explained geology away altogether  mallory tompkins generally got the best of the merely logical side of the arguments but pupkinwho was a tremendous christianwas much stronger in the things he had forgotten so the discussions often lasted till far into the night and mr pupkin would fall asleep and dream of a splendid argument which would have settled the whole controversy only unfortunately he couldnt recall it in the morning  of course pupkin would never have thought of considering himself on an intellectual par with mallory tompkins that would have been ridiculous mallory tompkins had read all sorts of things and had half a mind to write a novel himselfeither that or a play all he needed he said was to have a chance to get away somewhere by himself and think every time he went away to the city pupkin expected that he might return with the novel all finished but though he often came back with his eyes red from thinking the novel as yet remained incomplete  meantime mallory tompkins as i say was a mighty intellectual fellow you could see that from the books on the bamboo bookshelves in the sittingroom there was for instance the encyclopaedia metropolitana in forty volumes that he bought on the instalment plan for two dollars a month then when they took that away there was the history of civilization in fifty volumes at fifty cents a week for fifty years tompkins had read in it halfway through the stone age before they took it from him after that there was the lives of the painters one volume at a timea splendid thing in which you could read all about aahrens and aachenthal and aax and men of that class  after all theres nothing like educating oneself mallory tompkins knew about the opening period of all sorts of things and in regard to people whose names began with a you couldnt stick him  i dont mean that he and mr pupkin lived a mere routine of studious evenings that would be untrue quite often their time was spent in much less commendable ways than that and there were poker parties in their sittingroom that didnt break up till nearly midnight cardplaying after all is a slow business unless you put money on it and besides if you are in a bank and are handling money all day gambling has a fascination  ive seen pupkin and mallory tompkins and joe milligan the dentist and mitchell the ticket agent and the other boys sitting round the table with matches enough piled up in front of them to stock a factory ten matches counted for one chip and ten chips made a centso you see they werent merely playing for the fun of the thing of course its a hollow pleasure you realize that when you wake up at night parched with thirst ten thousand matches to the bad but banking is a wild life and everybody knows it  sometimes pupkin would swear off and keep away from the cursed thing for weeks and then perhaps hed see by sheer accident a pile of matches on the table or a match lying on the floor and it would start the craze in him i am using his own wordsa crazethats what he called it when he told miss lawson all about it and she promised to cure him of it she would have too only as i say pupkin found that what he had mistaken for attraction was only respect and theres no use worrying a woman that you respect about your crazes   it was from mallory tompkins that pupkin learned all about the mariposa people because pupkin came from away offsomewhere down in the maritime provincesand didnt know a soul mallory tompkins used to tell him about judge pepperleigh and what a wonderfully clever man he was and how he would have been in the supreme court for certain if the conservative government had stayed in another fifteen or twenty years instead of coming to a premature end he used to talk so much about the pepperleighs that pupkin was sick of the very name but just as soon as he had seen zena pepperleigh he couldnt hear enough of them he would have talked with tompkins for hours about the judges dog rover and as for zena if he could have brought her name over his lips he would have talked of her forever  he first saw herby one of the strangest coincidences in the worldon the main street of mariposa if he hadnt happened to be going up the street and she to be coming down it the thing wouldnt have happened afterwards they both admitted that it was one of the most peculiar coincidences they ever heard of pupkin owned that he had had the strangest feeling that morning as if something were going to happena feeling not at all to be classed with the one of which he had once spoken to miss lawson and which was at the most a mere anticipation of respect  but as i say pupkin met zena pepperleigh on the 26th of june at twentyfive minutes to eleven and at once the whole world changed the past was all blotted out even in the new forty volume edition of the instalment record of humanity that mallory tompkins had just receivedpupkin wouldnt have bothered with it  shethat word henceforth meant zenahad just come back from her boardingschool and of all times of year coming back from a boardingschool and for wearing a white shirt waist and a crimson tie and for carrying a tennis racket on the stricken street of a towncommend me to the month of june in mariposa  and for pupkin straight away the whole town was irradiated with sunshine and there was such a singing of the birds and such a dancing of the rippled waters of the lake and such a kindliness in the faces of all the people that only those who have lived in mariposa and been young there can know at all what he felt  the simple fact is that just the moment he saw zena pepperleigh mr pupkin was clean plumb straight flat absolutely in love with her  which fact is so important that it would be folly not to close the chapter and think about it     eight the foreordained attachment of zena pepperleigh and peter pupkin  zena pepperleigh used to sit reading novels on the piazza of the judges house half hidden by the virginia creepers at times the book would fall upon her lap and there was such a look of unstilled yearning in her violet eyes that it did not entirely disappear even when she picked up the apple that lay beside her and took another bite out of it  with hands clasped she would sit there dreaming all the beautiful daydreams of girlhood when you saw that faraway look in her eyes it meant that she was dreaming that a plumed and armoured knight was rescuing her from the embattled keep of a castle beside the danube at other times she was being borne away by an algerian corsair over the blue waters of the mediterranean and was reaching out her arms towards france to say farewell to it  sometimes when you noticed a sweet look of resignation that seemed to rest upon her features it meant that lord ronald de chevereux was kneeling at her feet and that she was telling him to rise that her humbler birth must ever be a bar to their happiness and lord ronald was getting into an awful state about it as english peers do at the least suggestion of anything of the sort  or if it wasnt that then her lover had just returned to her side tall and soldierly and sunburned after fighting for ten years in the soudan for her sake and had come back to ask her for her answer and to tell her that for ten years her face had been with him even in the watches of the night he was asking her for a sign any kind of signten years in the soudan entitles them to a signand zena was plucking a white rose just one from her hair when she would hear her fathers step on the piazza and make a grab for the pioneers of tecumseh township and start reading it like mad  she was always as i say being rescued and being borne away and being parted and reaching out her arms to france and to spain and saying goodbye forever to valladolid or the old grey towers of hohenbranntwein  and i dont mean that she was in the least exceptional or romantic because all the girls in mariposa were just like that an algerian corsair could have come into the town and had a dozen of them for the asking and as for a wounded english officerwell perhaps its better not to talk about it outside or the little town would become a regular military hospital  because mind you the mariposa girls are all right youve only to look at them to realize that you see you can get in mariposa a print dress of pale blue or pale pink for a dollar twenty that looks infinitely better than anything you ever see in the cityespecially if you can wear with it a broad straw hat and a background of maple trees and the green grass of a tennis court and if you remember too that these are cultivated girls who have all been to the mariposa high school and can do decimal fractions you will understand that an algerian corsair would sharpen his scimitar at the very sight of them  dont think either that they are all dying to get married because they are not i dont say they wouldnt take an errant knight or a buccaneer or a hungarian refugee but for the ordinary marriages of ordinary people they feel nothing but a pitying disdain so it is that each one of them in due time marries an enchanted prince and goes to live in one of the little enchanted houses in the lower part of the town  i dont know whether you know it but you can rent an enchanted house in mariposa for eight dollars a month and some of the most completely enchanted are the cheapest as for the enchanted princes they find them in the strangest places where you never expected to see them workingunder a spell you understandin drugstores and printing offices and even selling things in shops but to be able to find them you have first to read ever so many novels about sir galahad and the errant quest and that sort of thing   naturally then zena pepperleigh as she sat on the piazza dreamed of bandits and of wounded officers and of lord ronalds riding on foamflecked chargers but that she ever dreamed of a junior bank teller in a daffodil blazer riding past on a bicycle is pretty hard to imagine so when mr pupkin came tearing past up the slope of oneida street at a speed that proved that he wasnt riding there merely to pass the house i dont suppose that zena pepperleigh was aware of his existence  that may be a slight exaggeration she knew perhaps that he was the new junior teller in the exchange bank and that he came from the maritime provinces and that nobody knew who his people were and that he had never been in a canoe in his life till he came to mariposa and that he sat four pews back in dean drones church and that his salary was eight hundred dollars beyond that she didnt know a thing about him she presumed however that the reason why he went past so fast was because he didnt dare to go slow  this of course was perfectly correct ever since the day when mr pupkin met zena in the main street he used to come past the house on his bicycle just after bank hours he would have gone past twenty times a day but he was afraid to as he came up oneida street he used to pedal faster and fasterhe never meant to but he couldnt help ittill he went past the piazza where zena was sitting at an awful speed with his little yellow blazer flying in the wind in a second he had disappeared in a buzz and a cloud of dust and the momentum of it carried him clear out into the country for miles and miles before he ever dared to pause or look back  then mr pupkin would ride in a huge circuit about the country trying to think he was looking at the crops and sooner or later his bicycle would be turned towards the town again and headed for oneida street and would get going quicker and quicker and quicker till the pedals whirled round with a buzz and he came past the judges house again like a bullet out of a gun he rode fifteen miles to pass the house twice and even then it took all the nerve that he had  the people on oneida street thought that mr pupkin was crazy but zena pepperleigh knew that he was not already you see there was a sort of dim parallel between the passing of the bicycle and the last ride of tancred the inconsolable along the banks of the danube  i have already mentioned i think how mr pupkin and zena pepperleigh first came to know one another like everything else about them it was a sheer matter of coincidence quite inexplicable unless you understand that these things are foreordained  that of course is the way with foreordained affairs and thats where they differ from ordinary love   i wont even try to describe how mr pupkin felt when he first spoke with zena and sat beside her as they copied out the endless chain letter asking for ten cents they wrote out as i said no less than eight of the letters between them and they found out that their handwritings were so alike that you could hardly tell them apart except that pupkins letters were round and zenas letters were pointed and pupkin wrote straight up and down and zena wrote on a slant beyond that the writing was so alike that it was the strangest coincidence in the world of course when they made figures it was different and pupkin explained to zena that in the bank you have to be able to make a seven so that it doesnt look like a nine  so as i say they wrote the letters all afternoon and when it was over they walked up oneida street together ever so slowly when they got near the house zena asked pupkin to come in to tea with such an easy offhand way that you couldnt have told that she was half an hour late and was taking awful chances on the judge pupkin hadnt had time to say yes before the judge appeared at the door just as they were stepping up on to the piazza and he had a table napkin in his hand and the dynamite sparks were flying from his spectacles as he called out  great heaven zena why in everlasting blazes cant you get in to tea at a christian hour  zena gave one look of appeal to pupkin and pupkin looked one glance of comprehension and turned and fled down oneida street and if the scene wasnt quite as dramatic as the renunciation of tancred the troubadour it at least had something of the same elements in it  pupkin walked home to his supper at the mariposa house on air and that evening there was a gentle distance in his manner towards sadie the diningroom girl that i suppose no bank clerk in mariposa ever showed before it was like sir galahad talking with the tirewomen of queen guinevere and receiving huckleberry pie at their hands  after that mr pupkin and zena pepperleigh constantly met together they played tennis as partners on the grass court behind dr gallaghers housethe mariposa tennis club rent it you remember for fifty cents a monthand pupkin used to perform perfect prodigies of valour leaping in the air to serve with his little body hooked like a letter s sometimes too they went out on lake wissanotti in the evening in pupkins canoe with zena sitting in the bow and pupkin paddling in the stern and they went out ever so far and it was after dark and the stars were shining before they came home zena would look at the stars and say how infinitely far away they seemed and pupkin would realize that a girl with a mind like that couldnt have any use for a fool such as him zena used to ask him to point out the pleiades and jupiter and ursa minor and pupkin showed her exactly where they were that impressed them both tremendously because pupkin didnt know that zena remembered the names out of the astronomy book at her boardingschool and zena didnt know that pupkin simply took a chance on where the stars were  and ever so many times they talked so intimately that pupkin came mighty near telling her about his home in the maritime provinces and about his father and mother and then kicked himself that he hadnt the manliness to speak straight out about it and take the consequences  please dont imagine from any of this that the course of mr pupkins love ran smooth on the contrary pupkin himself felt that it was absolutely hopeless from the start  there were it might be admitted certain things that seemed to indicate progress  in the course of the months of june and july and august he had taken zena out in his canoe thirtyone times allowing an average of two miles for each evening pupkin had paddled zena sixtytwo miles or more than a hundred thousand yards that surely was something  he had played tennis with her on sixteen afternoons three times he had left his tennis racket up at the judges house in zenas charge and once he had with her full consent left his bicycle there all night this must count for something no girl could trifle with a man to the extent of having his bicycle leaning against the verandah post all night and mean nothing by it  more than thathe had been to tea at the judges house fourteen times and seven times he had been asked by lilian drone to the rectory when zena was coming and five times by nora gallagher to tea at the doctors house because zena was there  altogether he had eaten so many meals where zena was that his meal ticket at the mariposa lasted nearly double its proper time and the face of sadie the diningroom girl had grown to wear a look of melancholy resignation sadder than romance  still more than that pupkin had bought for zena reckoning it altogether about two buckets of ice cream and perhaps half a bushel of chocolate not that pupkin grudged the expense of it on the contrary over and above the ice cream and the chocolate he had bought her a white waistcoat and a walking stick with a gold top a lot of new neckties and a pair of patent leather bootsthat is they were all bought on account of her which is the same thing  add to all this that pupkin and zena had been to the church of england church nearly every sunday evening for two months and one evening they had even gone to the presbyterian church for fun which if you know mariposa you will realize to be a wild sort of escapade that ought to speak volumes   yet in spite of this pupkin felt that the thing was hopeless which only illustrates the dreadful ups and downs the wild alternations of hope and despair that characterise an exceptional affair of this sort  yes it was hopeless  every time that pupkin watched zena praying in church he knew that she was too good for him every time that he came to call for her and found her reading browning and omar khayyam he knew that she was too clever for him and every time that he saw her at all he realized that she was too beautiful for him  you see pupkin knew that he wasnt a hero when zena would clasp her hands and talk rapturously about crusaders and soldiers and firemen and heroes generally pupkin knew just where he came in not in it that was all if a war could have broken out in mariposa or the judges house been invaded by the germans he might have had a chance but as it washopeless  then there was zenas father heaven knows pupkin tried hard to please the judge he agreed with every theory that judge pepperleigh advanced and that took a pretty pliable intellect in itself they denounced female suffrage one day and they favoured it the next one day the judge would claim that the labour movement was eating out the heart of the country and the next day he would hold that the hope of the world lay in the organization of the toiling masses pupkin shifted his opinions like the glass in a kaleidoscope indeed the only things on which he was allowed to maintain a steadfast conviction were the purity of the conservative party of canada and the awful wickedness of the recall of judges  but with all that the judge was hardly civil to pupkin he hadnt asked him to the house till zena brought him there though as a rule all the bank clerks in mariposa treated judge pepperleighs premises as their own he used to sit and sneer at pupkin after he had gone till zena would throw down the pioneers of tecumseh township in a temper and flounce off the piazza to her room after which the judges manner would change instantly and he would relight his corn cob pipe and sit and positively beam with contentment in all of which there was something so mysterious as to prove that mr pupkins chances were hopeless  nor was that all of it pupkins salary was eight hundred dollars a year and the exchange bank limit for marriage was a thousand  i suppose you are aware of the grinding capitalistic tyranny of the banks in mariposa whereby marriage is put beyond the reach of ever so many mature and experienced men of nineteen and twenty and twentyone who are compelled to go on eating on a meal ticket at the mariposa house and living over the bank to suit the whim of a group of capitalists  whenever pupkin thought of this two hundred dollars he understood all that it meant by social unrest in fact he interpreted all forms of social discontent in terms of it russian anarchism german socialism the labour movement henry george lloyd georgehe understood the whole lot of them by thinking of his two hundred dollars  when i tell you that at this period mr pupkin read memoirs of the great revolutionists and even thought of blowing up henry mullins with dynamite you can appreciate his state of mind   but not even by all these hindrances and obstacles to his love for zena pepperleigh would peter pupkin have been driven to commit suicide oh yes he committed it three times as im going to tell you had it not been for another thing that he knew stood once and for all and in cold reality between him and zena  he felt it in a sort of way as soon as he knew her each time that he tried to talk to her about his home and his father and mother and found that something held him back he realized more and more the kind of thing that stood between them most of all did he realize it with a sudden sickness of heart when he got word that his father and mother wanted to come to mariposa to see him and he had all he could do to head them off from it  why why stop them the reason was simple enough that pupkin was ashamed of them bitterly ashamed the picture of his mother and father turning up in mariposa and being seen by his friends there and going up to the pepperleighs house made him feel faint with shame  no i dont say it wasnt wrong it only shows what difference of fortune the difference of being rich and being poor means in this world you perhaps have been so lucky that you cannot appreciate what it means to feel shame at the station of your own father and mother you think it doesnt matter that honesty and kindliness of heart are all that counts that only shows that you have never known some of the bitterest feelings of people less fortunate than yourself  so it was with mr pupkin when he thought of his father and mother turning up in mariposa his face reddened with unworthy shame  he could just picture the scene he could see them getting out of their limousine touring car with the chauffeur holding open the door for them and his father asking for a suite of roomsjust think of it a suite of roomsat the mariposa house  the very thought of it turned him ill  what you have mistaken my meaning ashamed of them because they were poor good heavens no but because they were rich and not rich in the sense in which they use the term in mariposa where a rich person merely means a man who has money enough to build a house with a piazza and to have everything he wants but rich in the other sensemotor cars ritz hotels steam yachts summer islands and all that sort of thing  why pupkins fatherwhats the use of trying to conceal it any longerwas the senior partner in the law firm of pupkin pupkin and pupkin if you know the maritime provinces at all youve heard of the pupkins the name is a household word from chedabucto to chidabecto and for the matter of that the law firm and the fact that pupkin senior had been an attorney general was the least part of it attorney general why theres no money in that its no better than the senate no no pupkin senior like so many lawyers was practically a promoter and he blew companies like bubbles and when he wasnt in the maritime provinces he was in boston and new york raising money and floating loans and when they had no money left in new york he floated it in london and when he had it he floated on top of it big rafts of lumber on the miramichi and codfish on the grand banks and lesser fish in the fundy bay youve heard perhaps of the tidal transportation company and fundy fisheries corporation and the paspebiac pulp and paper unlimited well all of those were pupkin senior under other names so just imagine him in mariposa wouldnt he be utterly foolish there just imagine him meeting jim eliot and treating him like a druggist merely because he ran a drug store or speaking to jefferson thorpe as if he were a barber simply because he shaved for money why a man like that could ruin young pupkin in mariposa in half a day and pupkin knew it  that wouldnt matter so much but think of the pepperleighs and zena everything would be over with them at once pupkin knew just what the judge thought of riches and luxuries how often had he heard the judge pass sentences of life imprisonment on pierpont morgan and mr rockefeller how often had pupkin heard him say that any man who received more than three thousand dollars a year that was the judicial salary in the missinaba district was a mere robber unfit to shake the hand of an honest man bitter i should think he was he was not so bitter perhaps as mr muddleson the principal of the mariposa high school who said that any man who received more than fifteen hundred dollars was a public enemy he was certainly not so bitter as trelawney the postmaster who said that any man who got from society more than thirteen hundred dollars apart from a legitimate increase in recognition of a successful election was a danger to society still he was bitter they all were in mariposa pupkin could just imagine how they would despise his father  and zena that was the worst of all how often had pupkin heard her say that she simply hated diamonds wouldnt wear them despised them wouldnt give a thank you for a whole tiara of them as for motor cars and steam yachtswell it was pretty plain that that sort of thing had no chance with zena pepperleigh why she had told pupkin one night in the canoe that she would only marry a man who was poor and had his way to make and would hew down difficulties for her sake and when pupkin couldnt answer the argument she was quite cross and silent all the way home   what was peter pupkin doing then at eight hundred dollars in a bank in mariposa if you ask that it means that you know nothing of the life of the maritime provinces and the sturdy temper of the people i suppose there are no people in the world who hate luxury and extravagance and that sort of thing quite as much as the maritime province people and of them no one hated luxury more than pupkin senior  dont mistake the man he wore a long sealskin coat in winter yes but mark you not as a matter of luxury but merely as a question of his lungs he smoked i admit it a thirtyfive cent cigar not because he preferred it but merely through a delicacy of the thorax that made it imperative he drank champagne at lunch i concede the point not in the least from the enjoyment of it but simply on account of a peculiar affection of the tongue and lips that positively dictated it his own longingand his wife shared itwas for the simple simple lifean island somewhere with birds and trees they had bought three or four islandsone in the st lawrence and two in the gulf and one off the coast of mainelooking for this sort of thing pupkin senior often said that he wanted to have some place that would remind him of the little old farm up the aroostook where he was brought up he often bought little old farms just to try them but they always turned out to be so near a city that he cut them into real estate lots without even having had time to look at them  butand this is where the emphasis layin the matter of luxury for his only son peter pupkin senior was a maritime province man right to the core with all the hardihood of the united empire loyalists ingrained in him no luxury for that boy no sir from his childhood pupkin senior had undertaken at the least sign of luxury to tan it out of him after the fashion still in vogue in the provinces then he sent him to an oldfashioned school to get it thumped out of him and after that he had put him for a year on a nova scotia schooner to get it knocked out of him if after all that young pupkin even when he came to mariposa wore cameo pins and daffodil blazers and broke out into ribbed silk saffron ties on pay day it only shows that the old adam still needs further tanning even in the maritime provinces  young pupkin of course was to have gone into law that was his fathers cherished dream and would have made the firm pupkin pupkin pupkin and pupkin as it ought to have been but young peter was kept out of the law by the fool system of examinations devised since his fathers time hence there was nothing for it but to sling him into a bank sling him was i think the expression so his father decided that if pupkin was to be slung he should be slung good and farclean into canada you know the way they use that word in the maritime provinces and to sling pupkin he called in the services of an old friend a man after his own heart just as violent as himself who used to be at the law school in the city with pupkin senior thirty years ago so this friend who happened to live in mariposa and who was a violent man said at once edward by jehoshaphat send the boy up here  so that is how pupkin came to mariposa and if when he got there his fathers friend gave no sign and treated the boy with roughness and incivility that may have been for all i know a continuation of the tanning process of the maritime people  did i mention that the pepperleigh family generations ago had taken up land near the aroostook and that it was from there the judges father came to tecumseh township perhaps not but it doesnt matter  but surely after such reminiscences as these the awful things that are impending over mr pupkin must be kept for another chapter     nine the mariposa bank mystery  suicide is a thing that ought not to be committed without very careful thought it often involves serious consequences and in some cases brings pain to others than oneself  i dont say that there is no justification for it there often is anybody who has listened to certain kinds of music or read certain kinds of poetry or heard certain kinds of performances upon the concertina will admit that there are some lives which ought not to be continued and that even suicide has its brighter aspects  but to commit suicide on grounds of love is at the best a very dubious experiment i know that in this i am expressing an opinion contrary to that of most true lovers who embrace suicide on the slightest provocation as the only honourable termination of an existence that never ought to have begun  i quite admit that there is a glamour and a sensation about the thing which has its charm and that there is nothing like it for causing a girl to realize the value of the heart that she has broken and which breathed forgiveness upon her at the very moment when it held in its hand the halfpint of prussic acid that was to terminate its beating for ever  but apart from the general merits of the question i suppose there are few people outside of lovers who know what it is to commit suicide four times in five weeks  yet this was what happened to mr pupkin of the exchange bank of mariposa  ever since he had known zena pepperleigh he had realized that his love for her was hopeless she was too beautiful for him and too good for him her father hated him and her mother despised him his salary was too small and his own people were too rich  if you add to all that that he came up to the judges house one night and found a poet reciting verses to zena you will understand the suicide at once it was one of those regular poets with a solemn jackass face and lank parted hair and eyes like puddles of molasses i dont know how he came thereup from the city probablybut there he was on the pepperleighs verandah that august evening he was reciting poetryeither tennysons or shelleys or his own you couldnt telland about him sat zena with her hands clasped and nora gallagher looking at the sky and jocelyn drone gazing into infinity and a little tubby woman looking at the poet with her head falling over sidewaysin fact there was a whole group of them   i dont know what it is about poets that draws women to them in this way but everybody knows that a poet has only to sit and saw the air with his hands and recite verses in a deep stupid voice and all the women are crazy over him men despise him and would kick him off the verandah if they dared but the women simply rave over him  so pupkin sat there in the gloom and listened to this poet reciting browning and he realized that everybody understood it but him he could see zena with her eyes fixed on the poet as if she were hanging on to every syllable she was she needed to and he stood it just about fifteen minutes and then slid off the side of the verandah and disappeared without even saying goodnight  he walked straight down oneida street and along the main street just as hard as he could go there was only one purpose in his mindsuicide he was heading straight for jim eliots drug store on the main corner and his idea was to buy a drink of chloroform and drink it and die right there on the spot  as pupkin walked down the street the whole thing was so vivid in his mind that he could picture it to the remotest detail he could even see it all in type in big headings in the newspapers of the following day  appalling suicide peter pupkin poisoned  he perhaps hoped that the thing might lead to some kind of public enquiry and that the question of brownings poetry and whether it is altogether fair to allow of its general circulation would be fully ventilated in the newspapers  thinking of that pupkin came to the main corner  on a warm august evening the drug store of mariposa as you know is all a blaze of lights you can hear the hissing of the sodawater fountain half a block away and inside the store there are ever so many peopleboys and girls and old people tooall drinking sarsaparilla and chocolate sundaes and lemon sours and foaming drinks that you take out of long straws there is such a laughing and a talking as you never heard and the girls are all in white and pink and cambridge blue and the soda fountain is of white marble with silver taps and it hisses and sputters and jim eliot and his assistant wear white coats with red geraniums in them and its just as gay as gay  the foyer of the opera in paris may be a fine sight but i doubt if it can compare with the inside of eliots drug store in mariposafor real gaiety and joy of living  this night the store was especially crowded because it was a saturday and that meant early closing for all the hotels except of course smiths so as the hotels were shut the people were all in the drug store drinking like fishes it just shows the folly of local option and the temperance movement and all that why if you shut the hotels you simply drive the people to the soda fountains and theres more drinking than ever and not only of the men too but the girls and young boys and children ive seen little things of eight and nine that had to be lifted up on the high stools at eliots drug store drinking great goblets of lemon soda enough to burst thembrought there by their own fathers and why simply because the hotel bars were shut  whats the use of thinking you can stop people drinking merely by cutting off whiskey and brandy the only effect is to drive them to taking lemon sour and sarsaparilla and cherry pectoral and caroka cordial and things they wouldnt have touched before so in the long run they drink more than ever the point is that you cant prevent people having a good time no matter how hard you try if they cant have it with lager beer and brandy theyll have it with plain soda and lemon pop and so the whole gloomy scheme of the temperance people breaks down anyway  but i was only saying that eliots drug store in mariposa on a saturday night is the gayest and brightest spot in the world  and just imagine what a fool of a place to commit suicide in  just imagine going up to the sodawater fountain and asking for five cents worth of chloroform and soda well you simply cant thats all  thats the way pupkin found it you see as soon as he came in somebody called out hello pete and one or two others called hullo pup and some said how goes it and others how are you toughing it and so on because you see they had all been drinking more or less and naturally they felt jolly and gladhearted  so the upshot of it was that instead of taking chloroform pupkin stepped up to the counter of the fountain and he had a bromoseltzer with cherry soda and after that he had one of those aerated seltzers and then a couple of lemon seltzers and a bromophizzer  i dont know if you know the mental effect of a bromoseltzer  but its a hard thing to commit suicide on  you cant  you feel so buoyant  anyway what with the phizzing of the seltzer and the lights and the girls pupkin began to feel so fine that he didnt care a cuss for all the browning in the world and as for the poetoh to blazes with him whats poetry anywayonly rhymes  so would you believe it in about ten minutes peter pupkin was off again and heading straight for the pepperleighs house poet or no poet and what was more to the point he carried with him three great bricks of eliots ice creamin green pink and brown layers he struck the verandah just at the moment when browning was getting too stale and dreary for words his brain was all sizzling and jolly with the bromoseltzer and when he fetched out the ice cream bricks and zena ran to get plates and spoons to eat it with and pupkin went with her to help fetch them and they picked out the spoons together they were so laughing and happy that it was just a marvel girls you know need no bromoseltzer theyre full of it all the time  and as for the poetwell can you imagine how pupkin felt when zena told him that the poet was married and that the tubby little woman with her head on sideways was his wife  so they had the ice cream and the poet ate it in bucketsful poets always do they need it and after it the poet recited some stanzas of his own and pupkin saw that he had misjudged the man because it was dandy poetry the very best that night pupkin walked home on air and there was no thought of chloroform and it turned out that he hadnt committed suicide but like all lovers he had commuted it   i dont need to describe in full the later suicides of mr pupkin because they were all conducted on the same plan and rested on something the same reasons as above  sometimes he would go down at night to the offices of the bank below his bedroom and bring up his bank revolver in order to make an end of himself with it this too he could see headed up in the newspapers as  brilliant boy banker blows out brains  but blowing your brains out is a noisy rackety performance and pupkin soon found that only special kinds of brains are suited for it so he always sneaked back again later in the night and put the revolver in its place deciding to drown himself instead yet every time that he walked down to the trestle bridge over the ossawippi he found it was quite unsuitable for drowningtoo high and the water too swift and black and the rushes too gruesomein fact not at all the kind of place for a drowning  far better he realized to wait there on the railroad track and throw himself under the wheels of the express and be done with it yet though pupkin often waited in this way for the train he was never able to pick out a pair of wheels that suited him anyhow its awfully hard to tell an express from a fast freight  i wouldnt mention these attempts at suicide if one of them hadnt finally culminated in making peter pupkin a hero and solving for him the whole perplexed entanglement of his love affair with zena pepperleigh incidentally it threw him into the very centre of one of the most impenetrable bank mysteries that ever baffled the ingenuity of some of the finest legal talent that ever adorned one of the most enterprising communities in the country  it happened one night as i say that pupkin decided to go down into the office of the bank and get his revolver and see if it would blow his brains out it was the night of the firemens ball and zena had danced four times with a visitor from the city a man who was in the fourth year at the university and who knew everything it was more than peter pupkin could bear mallory tompkins was away that night and when pupkin came home he was all alone in the building except for gillis the caretaker who lived in the extension at the back  he sat in his room for hours brooding two or three times he picked up a bookhe remembered afterwards distinctly that it was kants critique of pure reasonand tried to read it but it seemed meaningless and trivial then with a sudden access of resolution he started from his chair and made his way down the stairs and into the office room of the bank meaning to get a revolver and kill himself on the spot and let them find his body lying on the floor  it was then far on in the night and the empty building of the bank was as still as death pupkin could hear the stairs creak under his feet and as he went he thought he heard another sound like the opening or closing of a door but it sounded not like the sharp ordinary noise of a closing door but with a dull muffled noise as if someone had shut the iron door of a safe in a room under the ground for a moment pupkin stood and listened with his heart thumping against his ribs then he kicked his slippers from his feet and without a sound stole into the office on the ground floor and took the revolver from his tellers desk as he gripped it he listened to the sounds on the backstairway and in the vaults below  i should explain that in the exchange bank of mariposa the offices are on the ground floor level with the street below this is another floor with low dark rooms paved with flagstones with unused office desks and with piles of papers stored in boxes on this floor are the vaults of the bank and lying in them in the autumnthe grain seasonthere is anything from fifty to a hundred thousand dollars in currency tied in bundles there is no other light down there than the dim reflection from the lights out on the street that lies in patches on the stone floor  i think as peter pupkin stood revolver in hand in the office of the bank he had forgotten all about the maudlin purpose of his first coming he had forgotten for the moment all about heroes and love affairs and his whole mind was focussed sharp and alert with the intensity of the nighttime on the sounds that he heard in the vault and on the backstairway of the bank  straight away pupkin knew what it meant as plainly as if it were written in print he had forgotten i say about being a hero and he only knew that there was sixty thousand dollars in the vault of the bank below and that he was paid eight hundred dollars a year to look after it  as peter pupkin stood there listening to the sounds in his stockinged feet his faced showed grey as ashes in the light that fell through the window from the street his heart beat like a hammer against his ribs but behind its beatings was the blood of four generations of loyalists and the robber who would take that sixty thousand dollars from the mariposa bank must take it over the dead body of peter pupkin teller   pupkin walked down the stairs to the lower room the one below the ground with the bank vault in it with as fine a step as any of his ancestors showed on parade and if he had known it as he came down the stairway in the front of the vault room there was a man crouched in the shadow of the passage way by the stairs at the back this man too held a revolver in his hand and criminal or not his face was as resolute as pupkins own as he heard the tellers step on the stair he turned and waited in the shadow of the doorway without a sound  there is no need really to mention all these details they are only of interest as showing how sometimes a bank teller in a corded smoking jacket and stockinged feet may be turned into such a hero as even the mariposa girls might dream about  all of this must have happened at about three oclock in the night this much was established afterwards from the evidence of gillis the caretaker when he first heard the sounds he had looked at his watch and noticed that it was halfpast two the watch he knew was threequarters of an hour slow three days before and had been gaining since the exact time at which gillis heard footsteps in the bank and started downstairs pistol in hand became a nice point afterwards in the crossexamination  but one must not anticipate pupkin reached the iron door of the bank safe and knelt in front of it feeling in the dark to find the fracture of the lock as he knelt he heard a sound behind him and swung round on his knees and saw the bank robber in the half light of the passage way and the glitter of a pistol in his hand the rest was over in an instant pupkin heard a voice that was his own but that sounded strange and hollow call out drop that or ill fire and then just as he raised his revolver there came a blinding flash of light before his eyes and peter pupkin junior teller of the bank fell forward on the floor and knew no more   at that point of course i ought to close down a chapter or volume or at least strike the reader over the head with a sandbag to force him to stop and think in common fairness one ought to stop here and count a hundred or get up and walk round a block or at any rate picture to oneself peter pupkin lying on the floor of the bank motionless his arms distended the revolver still grasped in his hand but i must go on  by halfpast seven on the following morning it was known all over mariposa that peter pupkin the junior teller of the exchange had been shot dead by a bank robber in the vault of the building it was known also that gillis the caretaker had been shot and killed at the foot of the stairs and that the robber had made off with fifty thousand dollars in currency that he had left a trail of blood on the sidewalk and that the men were out tracking him with bloodhounds in the great swamps to the north of the town  this i say and it is important to note it was what they knew at halfpast seven of course as each hour went past they learned more and more at eight oclock it was known that pupkin was not dead but dangerously wounded in the lungs at eightthirty it was known that he was not shot in the lungs but that the ball had traversed the pit of his stomach  at nine oclock it was learned that the pit of pupkins stomach was all right but that the bullet had struck his right ear and carried it away finally it was learned that his ear had not exactly been carried away that is not precisely removed by the bullet but that it had grazed pupkins head in such a way that it had stunned him and if it had been an inch or two more to the left it might have reached his brain this of course was just as good as being killed from the point of view of public interest  indeed by nine oclock pupkin could be himself seen on the main street with a great bandage sideways on his head pointing out the traces of the robber gillis the caretaker too it was known by eight had not been killed he had been shot through the brain but whether the injury was serious or not was only a matter of conjecture in fact by ten oclock it was understood that the bullet from the robbers second shot had grazed the side of the caretakers head but as far as could be known his brain was just as before i should add that the first report about the bloodstains and the swamp and the bloodhounds turned out to be inaccurate the stains may have been blood but as they led to the cellar way of netleys store they may have also been molasses though it was argued to be sure that the robber might well have poured molasses over the bloodstains from sheer cunning  it was remembered too that there were no bloodhounds in mariposa although mind you there are any amount of dogs there  so you see that by ten oclock in the morning the whole affair was settling into the impenetrable mystery which it ever since remained  not that there wasnt evidence enough there was pupkins own story and gilliss story and the stories of all the people who had heard the shots and seen the robber some said the bunch of robbers go running past others said walking past in the night apparently the robber ran up and down half the streets of mariposa before he vanished  but the stories of pupkin and gillis were plain enough pupkin related that he heard sounds in the bank and came downstairs just in time to see the robber crouching in the passage way and that the robber was a large hulking villainous looking man wearing a heavy coat gillis told exactly the same story having heard the noises at the same time except that he first described the robber as a small thin fellow peculiarly villainous looking however even in the dark wearing a short jacket but on thinking it over gillis realized that he had been wrong about the size of the criminal and that he was even bigger if anything than what mr pupkin thought gillis had fired at the robber just at the same moment had mr pupkin  beyond that all was mystery absolute and impenetrable  by eleven oclock the detectives had come up from the city under orders from the head of the bank   i wish you could have seen the two detectives as they moved to and fro in mariposafine looking stern impenetrable men that they were they seemed to take in the whole town by instinct and so quietly they found their way to mr smiths hotel just as quietly as if it wasnt design at all and stood there at the bar picking up scraps of conversationyou know the way detectives do it occasionally they allowed one or two bystandersconfederates perhapsto buy a drink for them and you could see from the way they drank it that they were still listening for a clue if there had been the faintest clue in smiths hotel or in the mariposa house or in the continental those fellows would have been at it like a flash  to see them moving round the town that daysilent massive imperturbablegave one a great idea of their strange dangerous calling they went about the town all day and yet in such a quiet peculiar way that you couldnt have realized that they were working at all they ate their dinner together at smiths cafe and took an hour and a half over it to throw people off the scent then when they got them off it they sat and talked with josh smith in the back bar to keep them off mr smith seemed to take to them right away they were men of his own size or near it and anyway hotel men and detectives have a general affinity and share in the same impenetrable silence and in their confidential knowledge of the weaknesses of the public  mr smith too was of great use to the detectives boys he said i wouldnt ask too close as to what folks was out late at night in this town it dont do  when those two great brains finally left for the city on the fivethirty it was hard to realize that behind each grand impassible face a perfect vortex of clues was seething  but if the detectives were heroes what was pupkin imagine him with his bandage on his head standing in front of the bank and talking of the midnight robbery with that peculiar false modesty that only heroes are entitled to use  i dont know whether you have ever been a hero but for sheer exhilaration there is nothing like it and for mr pupkin who had gone through life thinking himself no good to be suddenly exalted into the class of napoleon bonaparte and john maynard and the charge of the light brigadeoh it was wonderful because pupkin was a brave man now and he knew it and acquired with it all the brave mans modesty in fact i believe he was heard to say that he had only done his duty and that what he did was what any other man would have done though when somebody else said thats so when you come to think of it pupkin turned on him that quiet look of the wounded hero bitterer than words  and if pupkin had known that all of the afternoon papers in the city reported him dead he would have felt more luxurious still  that afternoon the mariposa court sat in enquirytechnically it was summoned in inquest on the dead robberthough they hadnt found the bodyand it was wonderful to see them lining up the witnesses and holding crossexaminations there is something in the crossexamination of great criminal lawyers like nivens of mariposa and in the counter examinations of presiding judges like pepperleigh that thrills you to the core with the astuteness of it  they had henry mullins the manager on the stand for an hour and a half and the excitement was so breathless that you could have heard a pin drop nivens took him on first  what is your name he said  henry august mullins  what position do you hold  i am manager of the exchange bank  when were you born  december 30 1869  after that nivens stood looking quietly at mullins you could feel that he was thinking pretty deeply before he shot the next question at him  where did you go to school  mullins answered straight off the high school down home and nivens thought again for a while and then asked  how many boys were at the school  about sixty  how many masters  about three  after that nivens paused a long while and seemed to be digesting the evidence but at last an idea seemed to strike him and he said  i understand you were not on the bank premises last night where were you  down the lake duck shooting  you should have seen the excitement in the court when mullins said this the judge leaned forward in his chair and broke in at once  did you get any harry he asked  yes mullins said about six  where did you get them what in the wild rice marsh past the river you dont say so did you get them on the sit or how  all of these questions were fired off at the witness from the court in a single breath in fact it was the knowledge that the first ducks of the season had been seen in the ossawippi marsh that led to the termination of the proceedings before the afternoon was a quarter over mullins and george duff and half the witnesses were off with shotguns as soon as the court was cleared   i may as well state at once that the full story of the robbery of the bank of mariposa never came to the light a number of arrestsmostly of vagrants and suspicious characterswere made but the guilt of the robbery was never brought home to them one man was arrested twenty miles away at the other end of missinaba county who not only corresponded exactly with the description of the robber but in addition to this had a wooden leg vagrants with one leg are always regarded with suspicion in places like mariposa and whenever a robbery or a murder happens they are arrested in batches  it was never even known just how much money was stolen from the bank some people said ten thousand dollars others more the bank no doubt for business motives claimed that the contents of the safe were intact and that the robber had been foiled in his design  but none of this matters to the exaltation of mr pupkin good fortune like bad never comes in small instalments on that wonderful day every good thing happened to peter pupkin at once the morning saw him a hero at the sitting of the court the judge publicly told him that his conduct was fit to rank among the annals of the pioneers of tecumseh township and asked him to his house for supper at five oclock he received the telegram of promotion from the head office that raised his salary to a thousand dollars and made him not only a hero but a marriageable man at six oclock he started up to the judges house with his resolution nerved to the most momentous step of his life  his mind was made up  he would do a thing seldom if ever done in mariposa he would propose to zena pepperleigh in mariposa this kind of step i say is seldom taken the course of love runs on and on through all its stages of tennis playing and dancing and sleigh riding till by sheer notoriety of circumstance an understanding is reached to propose straight out would be thought priggish and affected and is supposed to belong only to people in books  but pupkin felt that what ordinary people dare not do heroes are allowed to attempt he would propose to zena and more than that he would tell her in a straight manly way that he was rich and take the consequences  and he did it  that night on the piazza where the hammock hangs in the shadow of the virginia creeper he did it by sheer good luck the judge had gone indoors to the library and by a piece of rare good fortune mrs pepperleigh had gone indoors to the sewing room and by a happy trick of coincidence the servant was out and the dog was tied upin fact no such chain of circumstances was ever offered in favour of mortal man before  what zena saidbeyond saying yesi do not know i am sure that when pupkin told her of the money she bore up as bravely as so fine a girl as zena would and when he spoke of diamonds she said she would wear them for his sake  they were saying these things and other thingsever so many other thingswhen there was such a roar and a clatter up oneida street as you never heard and there came bounding up to the house one of the most marvellous limousine touring cars that ever drew up at the home of a judge on a modest salary of three thousand dollars when it stopped there sprang from it an excited man in a long sealskin coatworn not for the luxury of it at all but from the sheer chilliness of the autumn evening and it was as of course you know pupkins father he had seen the news of his sons death in the evening paper in the city they drove the car through so the chauffeur said in two hours and a quarter and behind them there was to follow a special trainload of detectives and emergency men but pupkin senior had cancelled all that by telegram half way up when he heard that peter was still living  for a moment as his eye rested on young pupkin you would almost have imagined had you not known that he came from the maritime provinces that there were tears in them and that he was about to hug his son to his heart but if he didnt hug peter to his heart he certainly did within a few moments clasp zena to it in that fine fatherly way in which they clasp pretty girls in the maritime provinces the strangest thing is that pupkin senior seemed to understand the whole situation without any explanations at all  judge pepperleigh i think would have shaken both of pupkin seniors arms off when he saw him and when you heard them call one another ned and phillip it made you feel that they were boys again attending classes together at the old law school in the city  if pupkin thought that his father wouldnt make a hit in mariposa it only showed his ignorance pupkin senior sat there on the judges verandah smoking a corn cob pipe as if he had never heard of havana cigars in his life in the three days that he spent in mariposa that autumn he went in and out of jeff thorpes barber shop and eliots drug store shot black ducks in the marsh and played poker every evening at a hundred matches for a cent as if he had never lived any other life in all his days they had to send him telegrams enough to fill a satchel to make him come away  so pupkin and zena in due course of time were married and went to live in one of the enchanted houses on the hillside in the newer part of the town where you may find them to this day  you may see pupkin there at any time cutting enchanted grass on a little lawn in as gaudy a blazer as ever  but if you step up to speak to him or walk with him into the enchanted house pray modulate your voice a little musical though it isfor there is said to be an enchanted baby on the premises whose sleep must not lightly be disturbed     ten the great election in missinaba county  dont ask me what election it was whether dominion or provincial or imperial or universal for i scarcely know  it must of course have been going on in other parts of the country as well but i saw it all from missinaba county which with the town of mariposa was of course the storm centre and focus point of the whole turmoil  i only know that it was a huge election and that on it turned issues of the most tremendous importance such as whether or not mariposa should become part of the united states and whether the flag that had waved over the school house at tecumseh township for ten centuries should be trampled under the hoof of an alien invader and whether britons should be slaves and whether canadians should be britons and whether the farming class would prove themselves canadians and tremendous questions of that kind  and there was such a roar and a tumult to it and such a waving of flags and beating of drums and flaring of torchlights that such parts of the election as may have been going on elsewhere than in missinaba county must have been quite unimportant and didnt really matter  now that it is all over we can look back at it without heat or passion we can seeits plain enough nowthat in the great election canada saved the british empire and that missinaba saved canada and that the vote of the third concession of tecumseh township saved missinaba county and that those of us who carried the third concessionwell theres no need to push it further we prefer to be modest about it if we still speak of it it is only quietly and simply and not more than three or four times a day  but you cant understand the election at all and the conventions and the campaigns and the nominations and the balloting unless you first appreciate the peculiar complexion of politics in mariposa  let me begin at the beginning everybody in mariposa is either a liberal or a conservative or else is both some of the people are or have been liberals or conservatives all their lives and are called dyedinthewool grits or oldtime tories and things of that sort these people get from long training such a swift penetrating insight into national issues that they can decide the most complicated question in four seconds in fact just as soon as they grab the city papers out of the morning mail they know the whole solution of any problem you can put to them there are other people whose aim it is to be broadminded and judicious and who vote liberal or conservative according to their judgment of the questions of the day if their judgment of these questions tells them that there is something in it for them in voting liberal then they do so but if not they refuse to be the slaves of a party or the henchmen of any political leader so that anybody looking for henches has got to keep away from them  but the one thing that nobody is allowed to do in mariposa is to have no politics of course there are always some people whose circumstances compel them to say that they have no politics but that is easily understood take the case of trelawney the postmaster long ago he was a letter carrier under the old mackenzie government and later he was a letter sorter under the old macdonald government and after that a letter stamper under the old tupper government and so on trelawney always says that he has no politics but the truth is that he has too many  so too with the clergy in mariposa they have no politicsabsolutely none yet dean drone round election time always announces as his text such a verse as lo is there not one righteous man in israel or what ho is it not time for a change and that is a signal for all the liberal business men to get up and leave their pews  similarly over at the presbyterian church the minister says that his sacred calling will not allow him to take part in politics and that his sacred calling prevents him from breathing even a word of harshness against his fellow man but that when it comes to the elevation of the ungodly into high places in the commonwealth this means of course the nomination of the conservative candidate then hes not going to allow his sacred calling to prevent him from saying just what he thinks of it and by that time having pretty well cleared the church of conservatives he proceeds to show from the scriptures that the ancient hebrews were liberals to a man except those who were drowned in the flood or who perished more or less deservedly in the desert  there are i say some people who are allowed to claim to have no politicsthe office holders and the clergy and the school teachers and the hotel keepers but beyond them anybody in mariposa who says that he has no politics is looked upon as crooked and people wonder what it is that he is out after  in fact the whole town and county is a hive of politics and people who have only witnessed gatherings such as the house of commons at westminster and the senate at washington and never seen a conservative convention at tecumseh corners or a liberal rally at the concession school house dont know what politics means  so you may imagine the excitement in mariposa when it became known that king george had dissolved the parliament of canada and had sent out a writ or command for missinaba county to elect for him some other person than john henry bagshaw because he no longer had confidence in him  the king of course is very well known very favourably known in mariposa everybody remembers how he visited the town on his great tour in canada and stopped off at the mariposa station although he was only a prince at the time there was quite a big crowd down at the depot and everybody felt what a shame it was that the prince had no time to see more of mariposa because he would get such a false idea of it seeing only the station and the lumber yards still they all came to the station and all the liberals and conservatives mixed together perfectly freely and stood side by side without any distinction so that the prince should not observe any party differences among them and he didntyou could see that he didnt they read him an address all about the tranquillity and loyalty of the empire and they purposely left out any reference to the trouble over the town wharf or the big row there had been about the location of the new postoffice there was a general decent feeling that it wouldnt be fair to disturb the prince with these things later on as king he would of course have to know all about them but meanwhile it was better to leave him with the idea that his empire was tranquil  so they deliberately couched the address in terms that were just as reassuring as possible and the prince was simply delighted with it i am certain that he slept pretty soundly after hearing that address why you could see it taking effect even on his aidesdecamp and the people round him so imagine how the prince must have felt  i think in mariposa they understand kings perfectly every time that a king or a prince comes they try to make him see the bright side of everything and let him think that theyre all united judge pepperleigh walked up and down arm in arm with dr gallagher the worst grit in the town just to make the prince feel fine  so when they got the news that the king had lost confidence in john henry bagshaw the sitting member they never questioned it a bit lost confidence all right theyd elect him another right away theyd elect him half a dozen if he needed them they dont mind theyd elect the whole town man after man rather than have the king worried about it  in any case all the conservatives had been wondering for years how the king and the governorgeneral and men like that had tolerated such a man as bagshaw so long  missinaba county i say is a regular hive of politics and not the miserable crooked moneyridden politics of the cities but the straight real oldfashioned thing that is an honour to the country side any man who would offer to take a bribe or sell his convictions for money would be an object of scorn i dont say they wouldnt take moneythey would of course why notbut if they did they would take it in a straight fearless way and say nothing about it they mightits only humanaccept a job or a contract from the government but if they did rest assured it would be in a broad national spirit and not for the sake of the work itself no sir not for a minute  any man who wants to get the votes of the missinaba farmers and the mariposa business men has got to persuade them that hes the right man if he can do thatif he can persuade any one of them that he is the right man and that all the rest know it then theyll vote for him  the division i repeat between the liberals and the conservatives is intense yet you might live for a long while in the town between elections and never know it it is only when you get to understand the people that you begin to see that there is a cross division running through them that nothing can ever remove you gradually become aware of fine subtle distinctions that miss your observation at first outwardly they are all friendly enough for instance joe milligan the dentist is a conservative and has been for six years and yet he shares the same boathouse with young dr gallagher who is a liberal and they even bought a motor boat between them pete glover and alf mcnichol were in partnership in the hardware and paint store though they belonged on different sides  but just as soon as elections drew near the differences in politics became perfectly apparent liberals and conservatives drew away from one another joe milligan used the motor boat one saturday and dr gallagher the next and pete glover sold hardware on one side of the store and alf mcnichol sold paint on the other you soon realized too that one of the newspapers was conservative and the other was liberal and that there was a liberal drug store and a conservative drug store and so on similarly round election time the mariposa house was the liberal hotel and the continental conservative though mr smiths place where they always put on a couple of extra bar tenders was what you might call independentliberalconservative with a dash of imperialism thrown in mr gingham the undertaker was as a natural effect of his calling an advanced liberal but at election time he always engaged a special assistant for embalming conservative customers  so now i think you understand something of the general political surroundings of the great election in missinaba county  john henry bagshaw was the sitting member the liberal member for missinaba county  the liberals called him the old war horse and the old battleaxe and the old charger and the old champion and all sorts of things of that kind the conservatives called him the old jackass and the old army mule and the old booze fighter and the old grafter and the old scoundrel  john henry bagshaw was i suppose one of the greatest political forces in the world he had flowing white hair crowned with a fedora hat and a smooth statesmanlike face which it cost the country twentyfive cents a day to shave  altogether the dominion of canada had spent over two thousand dollars in shaving that face during the twenty years that bagshaw had represented missinaba county but the result had been well worth it  bagshaw wore a long political overcoat that it cost the country twenty cents a day to brush and boots that cost the dominion fifteen cents every morning to shine  but it was money well spent  bagshaw of mariposa was one of the most representative men of the age and its no wonder that he had been returned for the county for five elections running leaving the conservatives nowhere just think how representative he was he owned two hundred acres out on the third concession and kept two men working on it all the time to prove that he was a practical farmer they sent in fat hogs to the missinaba county agricultural exposition and the worlds fair every autumn and bagshaw himself stood beside the pig pens with the judges and wore a pair of corduroy breeches and chewed a straw all afternoon after that if any farmer thought that he was not properly represented in parliament it showed that he was an ass  bagshaw owned a half share in the harness business and a quarter share in the tannery and that made him a business man he paid for a pew in the presbyterian church and that represented religion in parliament he attended college for two sessions thirty years ago and that represented education and kept him abreast with modern science if not ahead of it he kept a little account in one bank and a big account in the other so that he was a rich man or a poor man at the same time  add to that that john henry bagshaw was perhaps the finest orator in mariposa that of course is saying a great deal there are speakers there lots of them that can talk two or three hours at a stretch but the old war horse could beat them all they say that when john henry bagshaw got well started say after a couple of hours of talk he could speak as pericles or demosthenes or cicero never could have spoken  you could tell bagshaw a hundred yards off as a member of the house of commons he wore a pepperandsalt suit to show that he came from a rural constituency and he wore a broad gold watchchain with dangling seals to show that he also represents a town you could see from his quiet low collar and white tie that his electorate were a godfearing religious people while the horseshoe pin that he wore showed that his electorate were not without sporting instincts and knew a horse from a jackass  most of the time john henry bagshaw had to be at ottawa though he preferred the quiet of his farm and always left it as he said with a sigh if he was not in ottawa he was in washington and of course at any time they might need him in london so that it was no wonder that he could only be in mariposa about two months of the year  that is why everybody knew when bagshaw got off the afternoon train one day early in the spring that there must be something very important coming and that the rumours about a new election must be perfectly true  everything that he did showed this he gave the baggage man twentyfive cents to take the check off his trunk the bus driver fifty cents to drive him up to the main street and he went into callahans tobacco store and bought two tencent cigars and took them across the street and gave them to mallory tompkins of the timesherald as a present from the prime minister  all that afternoon bagshaw went up and down the main street of mariposa and you could see if you knew the signs of it that there was politics in the air he bought nails and putty and glass in the hardware store and harness in the harness shop and drugs in the drug store and toys in the toy shop and all the things like that that are needed for a big campaign  then when he had done all this he went over with mcginnis the liberal organizer and mallory tompkins the timesherald man and gingham the great independentliberal undertaker to the back parlour in the mariposa house  you could tell from the way john henry bagshaw closed the door before he sat down that he was in a pretty serious frame of mind  gentlemen he said the election is a certainty were going to have a big fight on our hands and weve got to get ready for it  is it going to be on the tariff asked tompkins  yes gentlemen im afraid it is the whole thing is going to turn on the tariff question i wish it were otherwise i think it madness but theyre bent on it and we got to fight it on that line why they cant fight it merely on the question of graft continued the old war horse rising from his seat and walking up and down heaven only knows i warned them i appealed to them i said fight the thing on graft and we can win easy take this constituencywhy not have fought the thing out on whether i spent too much money on the town wharf or the postoffice what better issues could a man want let them claim that i am crooked and let me claim that im not surely that was good enough without dragging in the tariff but now gentlemen tell me about things in the constituency is there any talk yet of who is to run  mallory tompkins lighted up the second of his prime ministers cigars and then answered for the group  everybody says that edward drone is going to run  ah said the old war horse and there was joy upon his face is he at last thats good thats goodnow what platform will he run on  independent  excellent said mr bagshaw independent thats fine on a programme of what  just simple honesty and public morality  come now said the member thats splendid that will help enormously honesty and public morality the very thing if drone runs and makes a good showing we win for a certainty tompkins you must lose no time over this cant you manage to get some articles in the other papers hinting that at the last election we bribed all the voters in the county and that we gave out enough contracts to simply pervert the whole constituency imply that we poured the public money into this county in bucketsful and that we are bound to do it again let drone have plenty of material of this sort and hell draw off every honest unbiased vote in the conservative party  my only fear is continued the old war horse losing some of his animation that drone wont run after all hes said it so often before and never has he hasnt got the money but we must see to that gingham you know his brother well you must work it so that we pay drones deposit and his campaign expenses but how like drone it is to come out at this time  it was indeed very like edward drone to attempt so misguided a thing as to come out an independent candidate in missinaba county on a platform of public honesty it was just the sort of thing that anyone in mariposa would expect from him  edward drone was the rural deans younger brotheryoung mr drone they used to call him years ago to distinguish him from the rector he was a somewhat weaker copy of his elder brother with a simple inefficient face and kind blue eyes edward drone was and always had been a failure in training he had been once upon a time an engineer and built dams that broke and bridges that fell down and wharves that floated away in the spring floods he had been a manufacturer and failed had been a contractor and failed and now lived a meagre life as a sort of surveyor or land expert on goodness knows what  in his political ideas edward drone was and as everybody in mariposa knew always had been crazy he used to come up to the autumn exercises at the high school and make speeches about the ancient romans and titus manlius and quintus curtius at the same time when john henry bagshaw used to make a speech about the maple leaf and ask for an extra half holiday drone used to tell the boys about the lessons to be learned from the lives of the truly great and bagshaw used to talk to them about the lessons learned from the lives of the extremely rich drone used to say that his heart filled whenever he thought of the splendid patriotism of the ancient romans and bagshaw said that whenever he looked out over this wide dominion his heart overflowed  even the youngest boy in the school could tell that drone was foolish not even the school teachers would have voted for him  what about the conservatives asked bagshaw presently is there any talk yet as to who theyll bring out gingham and mallory tompkins looked at one another they were almost afraid to speak  hadnt you heard said gingham theyve got their man already  who is it said bagshaw quickly theyre going to put up josh smith  great heaven said bagshaw jumping to his feet smith the hotel keeper  yes sir said mr gingham thats the man  do you remember in history how napoleon turned pale when he heard that the duke of wellington was to lead the allies in belgium do you remember how when themistocles heard that aristogiton was to lead the spartans he jumped into the sea possibly you dont but it may help you to form some idea of what john henry bagshaw felt when he heard that the conservatives had selected josh smith proprietor of smiths hotel  you remember smith youve seen him there on the steps of his hoteltwo hundred and eighty pounds in his stockinged feet youve seen him selling liquor after hours through sheer public spirit and you recall how he saved the lives of hundreds of people on the day when the steamer sank and how he saved the town from being destroyed the night when the church of england church burnt down you know that hotel of his too half way down the street smiths northern health resort though already they were beginning to call it smiths british arms  so you can imagine that bagshaw came as near to turning pale as a man in federal politics can  i never knew smith was a conservative he said faintly he always subscribed to our fund  he is now said mr gingham ominously he says the idea of this reciprocity business cuts him to the heart  the infernal liar said mr bagshaw  there was silence for a few moments then bagshaw spoke again  will smith have anything else in his platform besides the trade question  yes said mr gingham gloomily he will  what is it  temperance and total prohibition  john henry bagshaw sank back in his chair as if struck with a club there let me leave him for a chapter     eleven the candidacy of mr smith  boys said mr smith to the two hostlers stepping out on to the sidewalk in front of the hotelhoist that there british jack over the place and hoist her up good  then he stood and watched the flag fluttering in the wind  billy he said to the desk clerk get a couple more and put them up on the roof of the caff behind the hotel wire down to the city and get a quotation on a hundred of them take them signs american drinks out of the bar put up noo ones with british beer at all hours clear out the rye whiskey and order in scotch and irish and then go up to the printing office and get me them placards  then another thought struck mr smith  say billy he said wire to the city for fifty pictures of king george get em good and get em coloured it dont matter what they cost  all right sir said billy  and billy called mr smith as still another thought struck him indeed the moment mr smith went into politics you could see these thoughts strike him like waves get fifty pictures of his father old king albert  all right sir  and say i tell you while youre at it get some of the old queen victorina if you can get em in mourning with a harp and one of them lions and a threepointed prong  it was on the morning after the conservative convention josh smith had been chosen the candidate and now the whole town was covered with flags and placards and there were bands in the streets every evening and noise and music and excitement that went on from morning till night  election times are exciting enough even in the city but there the excitement dies down in business hours in mariposa there arent any business hours and the excitement goes on all the time  mr smith had carried the convention before him there had been a feeble attempt to put up nivens but everybody knew that he was a lawyer and a college man and wouldnt have a chance by a man with a broader outlook like josh smith  so the result was that smith was the candidate and there were placards out all over the town with smith and british allegiance in big letters and people were wearing badges with mr smiths face on one side and king georges on the other and the fruit store next to the hotel had been cleaned out and turned into committee rooms with a gang of workers smoking cigars in it all day and half the night  there were other placards too with bagshaw and liberty bagshaw and prosperity vote for the old missinaba standard bearer and up town beside the mariposa house there were the bagshaw committee rooms with a huge white streamer across the street and with a gang of bagshaw workers smoking their heads off  but mr smith had an estimate made which showed that nearly two cigars to one were smoked in his committee rooms as compared with the liberals it was the first time in five elections that the conservative had been able to make such a showing as that  one might mention too that there were drone placards outfive or six of themlittle things about the size of a pocket handkerchief with a statement that mr edward drone solicits the votes of the electors of missinaba county but you would never notice them and when drone tried to put up a streamer across the main street with drone and honesty the wind carried it away into the lake  the fight was really between smith and bagshaw and everybody knew it from the start  i wish that i were able to narrate all the phases and the turns of the great contest from the opening of the campaign till the final polling day but it would take volumes  first of all of course the trade question was hotly discussed in the two newspapers of mariposa and the newspacket and the timesherald literally bristled with statistics then came interviews with the candidates and the expression of their convictions in regard to tariff questions  mr smith said the reporter of the mariposa newspacket wed like to get your views of the effect of the proposed reduction of the differential duties  by gosh pete said mr smith you can search me have a cigar  what do you think mr smith would be the result of lowering the ad valorem british preference and admitting american goods at a reciprocal rate  its a corker aint it answered mr smith whatll you take lager or domestic  and in that short dialogue mr smith showed that he had instantaneously grasped the whole method of dealing with the press the interview in the paper next day said that mr smith while unwilling to state positively that the principle of tariff discrimination was at variance with sound fiscal science was firmly of opinion that any reciprocal interchange of tariff preferences with the united states must inevitably lead to a serious per capita reduction of the national industry   mr smith said the chairman of a delegation of the manufacturers of mariposa what do you propose to do in regard to the tariff if youre elected  boys answered mr smith ill put her up so darned high they wont never get her down again   mr smith said the chairman of another delegation im an old free trader  put it there said mr smith som i there aint nothing like it   what do you think about imperial defence asked another questioner  which said mr smith  imperial defence  of what  of everything  who says it said mr smith  everybody is talking of it  what do the conservative boys at ottaway think about it answered mr smith  theyre all for it  well im fer it too said mr smith   these little conversations represented only the first stage the argumentative stage of the great contest it was during this period for example that the mariposa newspacket absolutely proved that the price of hogs in mariposa was decimal six higher than the price of oranges in southern california and that the average decennial import of eggs into missinaba county had increased four decimal six eight two in the last fifteen years more than the import of lemons in new orleans  figures of this kind made the people think most certainly  after all this came the organizing stage and after that the big public meetings and the rallies perhaps you have never seen a county being organized it is a wonderful sight  first of all the bagshaw men drove through crosswise in top buggies and then drove through it again lengthwise whenever they met a farmer they went in and ate a meal with him and after the meal they took him out to the buggy and gave him a drink after that the mans vote was absolutely solid until it was tampered with by feeding a conservative  in fact the only way to show a farmer that you are in earnest is to go in and eat a meal with him if you wont eat it he wont vote for you that is the recognized political test  but of course just as soon as the bagshaw men had begun to get the farming vote solidified the smith buggies came driving through in the other direction eating meals and distributing cigars and turning all the farmers back into conservatives  here and there you might see edward drone the independent candidate wandering round from farm to farm in the dust of the political buggies to each of the farmers he explained that he pledged himself to give no bribes to spend no money and to offer no jobs and each one of them gripped him warmly by the hand and showed him the way to the next farm  after the organization of the county there came the period of the public meetings and the rallies and the joint debates between the candidates and their supporters  i suppose there was no place in the whole dominion where the trade questionthe reciprocity questionwas threshed out quite so thoroughly and in quite such a national patriotic spirit as in mariposa for a month at least people talked of nothing else a man would stop another in the street and tell him that he had read last night that the average price of an egg in new york was decimal ought one more than the price of an egg in mariposa and the other man would stop the first one later in the day and tell him that the average price of a hog in idaho was point six of a cent per pound less or morehe couldnt remember which for the moment than the average price of beef in mariposa  people lived on figures of this sort and the man who could remember most of them stood out as a born leader  but of course it was at the public meetings that these things were most fully discussed it would take volumes to do full justice to all the meetings that they held in missinaba county but here and there single speeches stood out as masterpieces of convincing oratory take for example the speech of john henry bagshaw at the tecumseh corners school house the mariposa timesherald said next day that that speech would go down in history and so it willever so far down  anyone who has heard bagshaw knows what an impressive speaker he is and on this night when he spoke with the quiet dignity of a man old in years and anxious only to serve his country he almost surpassed himself near the end of his speech somebody dropped a pin and the noise it made in falling fairly rattled the windows  i am an old man now gentlemen bagshaw said and the time must soon come when i must not only leave politics but must take my way towards that goal from which no traveller returns  there was a deep hush when bagshaw said this it was understood to imply that he thought of going to the united states  yes gentlemen i am an old man and i wish when my time comes to go to depart leaving as little animosity behind me as possible but before i do go i want it pretty clearly understood that there are more darn scoundrels in the conservative party than ought to be tolerated in any decent community i bear he continued malice towards none and i wish to speak with gentleness to all but what i will say is that how any set of rational responsible men could nominate such a skunk as the conservative candidate passes the bounds of my comprehension gentlemen in the present campaign there is no room for vindictive abuse let us rise to a higher level than that they tell me that my opponent smith is a common saloon keeper let it pass they tell me that he has stood convicted of horse stealing that he is a notable perjurer that he is known as the blackesthearted liar in missinaba county let us not speak of it let no whisper of it pass our lips  no gentlemen continued bagshaw pausing to take a drink of water let us rather consider this question on the high plane of national welfare let us not think of our own particular interests but let us consider the good of the country at large and to do this let me present to you some facts in regard to the price of barley in tecumseh township  then amid a deep stillness bagshaw read off the list of prices of sixteen kinds of grain in sixteen different places during sixteen years  but let me turn bagshaw went on to another phase of the national subject and view for a moment the price of marsh hay in missinaba county  when bagshaw sat down that night it was felt that a liberal vote in tecumseh township was a foregone conclusion  but here they hadnt reckoned on the political genius of mr smith when he heard next day of the meeting he summoned some of his leading speakers to him and he said  boys theyre beating us on them statissicks ourn aint good enough  then he turned to nivens and he said  what was them figures you had here the other night  nivens took out a paper and began reading  stop said mr smith what was that figure for bacon  fourteen million dollars said nivens  not enough said mr smith make it twenty theyll stand for it them farmers  nivens changed it  and what was that for hay  two dollars a ton  shove it up to four said mr smith and i tell you he added if any of them farmers says the figures aint correct tell them to go to washington and see for themselves say that if any man wants the proof of your figures let him go over to england and asktell him to go straight to london and see it all for himself in the books   after this there was no more trouble over statistics i must say though that it is a wonderfully convincing thing to hear trade figures of this kind properly handled perhaps the best man on this sort of thing in the campaign was mullins the banker a man of his profession simply has to have figures of trade and population and money at his fingers ends and the effect of it in public speaking is wonderful  no doubt you have listened to speakers of this kind but i question whether you have ever heard anything more typical of the sort of effect that i allude to than mullinss speech at the big rally at the fourth concession  mullins himself of course knows the figures so well that he never bothers to write them into notes and the effect is very striking  now gentlemen he said very earnestly how many of you know just to what extent the exports of this country have increased in the last ten years how many could tell what per cent of increase there has been in one decade of our national importationthen mullins paused and looked round not a man knew it  i dont recall he said exactly the precise amount myselfnot at this momentbut it must be simply tremendous or take the question of population mullins went on warming up again as a born statistician always does at the proximity of figures how many of you know how many of you can state what has been the decennial percentage increase in our leading cities  there he paused and would you believe it not a man could state it  i dont recall the exact figures said mullins but i have them at home and they are positively colossal  but just in one phase of the public speaking the candidacy of mr smith received a serious setback  it had been arranged that mr smith should run on a platform of total prohibition but they soon found that it was a mistake they had imported a special speaker from the city a grave man with a white tie who put his whole heart into the work and would take nothing for it except his expenses and a sum of money for each speech but beyond the money i say he would take nothing  he spoke one night at the tecumseh corners social hall at the same time when the liberal meeting was going on at the tecumseh corners school house  gentlemen he said as he paused half way in his speechwhile we are gathered here in earnest discussion do you know what is happening over at the meeting place of our opponents do you know that seventeen bottles of rye whiskey were sent out from the town this afternoon to that innocent and unsuspecting school house seventeen bottles of whiskey hidden in between the blackboard and the wall and every single man that attends that meetingmark my words every single manwill drink his fill of the abominable stuff at the expense of the liberal candidate  just as soon as the speaker said this you could see the smith men at the meeting look at one another in injured surprise and before the speech was half over the hall was practically emptied  after that the total prohibition plank was changed and the committee substituted a declaration in favour of such a form of restrictive license as should promote temperance while encouraging the manufacture of spirituous liquors and by a severe regulation of the liquor traffic should place intoxicants only in the hands of those fitted to use them   finally there came the great day itself the election day that brought as everybody knows the crowning triumph of mr smiths career there is no need to speak of it at any length because it has become a matter of history  in any case everybody who has ever seen mariposa knows just what election day is like the shops of course are as a matter of custom all closed and the bar rooms are all closed by law so that you have to go in by the back way all the people are in their best clothes and at first they walk up and down the street in a solemn way just as they do on the twelfth of july and on st patricks day before the fun begins everybody keeps looking in at the different polling places to see if anybody else has voted yet because of course nobody cares to vote first for fear of being fooled after all and voting on the wrong side  most of all did the supporters of mr smith acting under his instructions hang back from the poll in the early hours to mr smiths mind voting was to be conducted on the same plan as bearshooting  hold back your votes boys he said and dont be too eager wait till she begins to warm up and then let em have it good and hard  in each of the polling places in mariposa there is a returning officer and with him are two scrutineers and the electors i say peep in and out like mice looking into a trap but if once the scrutineers get a man well into the polling booth they push him in behind a little curtain and make him vote the voting of course is by secret ballot so that no one except the scrutineers and the returning officer and the two or three people who may be round the poll can possibly tell how a man has voted  thats how it comes about that the first results are often so contradictory and conflicting sometimes the poll is badly arranged and the scrutineers are unable to see properly just how the ballots are being marked and they count up the liberals and conservatives in different ways often too a voter makes his mark so hurriedly and carelessly that they have to pick it out of the ballot box and look at it to see what it is  i suppose that may have been why it was that in mariposa the results came out at first in such a conflicting way perhaps that was how it was that the first reports showed that edward drone the independent candidate was certain to win you should have seen how the excitement grew upon the streets when the news was circulated in the big rallies and meetings of the liberals and conservatives everybody had pretty well forgotten all about drone and when the news got round at about four oclock that the drone vote was carrying the poll the people were simply astounded not that they were not pleased on the contrary they were delighted everybody came up to drone and shook hands and congratulated him and told him that they had known all along that what the country wanted was a straight honest nonpartisan representation the conservatives said openly that they were sick of party utterly done with it and the liberals said that they hated it already three or four of them had taken drone aside and explained that what was needed in the town was a straight clean nonpartisan postoffice built on a piece of ground of a strictly nonpartisan character and constructed under contracts that were not tainted and smirched with party affiliation two or three men were willing to show to drone just where a piece of ground of this character could be bought they told him too that in the matter of the postmastership itself they had nothing against trelawney the present postmaster in any personal sense and would say nothing against him except merely that he was utterly and hopelessly unfit for his job and that if drone believed as he had said he did in a purified civil service he ought to begin by purifying trelawney  already edward drone was beginning to feel something of what it meant to hold office and there was creeping into his manner the quiet selfimportance which is the first sign of conscious power  in fact in that brief halfhour of office drone had a chance to see something of what it meant henry mcginnis came to him and asked straight out for a job as federal censustaker on the ground that he was hard up and had been crippled with rheumatism all winter nelson williamson asked for the post of wharf master on the plea that he had been laid up with sciatica all winter and was absolutely fit for nothing erasmus archer asked him if he could get his boy pete into one of the departments at ottawa and made a strong case of it by explaining that he had tried his cussedest to get pete a job anywhere else and it was simply impossible not that pete wasnt a willing boy but he was sloweven his father admitted itslow as the devil blast him and with no head for figures and unfortunately hed never had the schooling to bring him on but if drone could get him in at ottawa his father truly believed it would be the very place for him surely in the indian department or in the astronomical branch or in the new canadian navy there must be any amount of opening for a boy like this and to all of these requests drone found himself explaining that he would take the matter under his very earnest consideration and that they must remember that he had to consult his colleagues and not merely follow the dictates of his own wishes in fact if he had ever in his life had any envy of cabinet ministers he lost it in this hour  but drones hour was short even before the poll had closed in mariposa the news came sweeping in true or false that bagshaw was carrying the county the second concession had gone for bagshaw in a regular landslide six votes to only two for smithand all down the township line road where the hay farms are bagshaw was said to be carrying all before him  just as soon as that news went round the town they launched the mariposa band of the knights of pythias every man in it is a liberal down the main street with big red banners in front of it with the motto bagshaw forever in letters a foot high such rejoicing and enthusiasm began to set in as you never saw everybody crowded round bagshaw on the steps of the mariposa house and shook his hand and said they were proud to see the day and that the liberal party was the glory of the dominion and that as for this idea of nonpartisan politics the very thought of it made them sick right away in the committee rooms they began to organize the demonstration for the evening with lantern slides and speeches and they arranged for a huge bouquet to be presented to bagshaw on the platform by four little girls all liberals all dressed in white  and it was just at this juncture with one hour of voting left that mr smith emerged from his committee rooms and turned his voters on the town much as the duke of wellington sent the whole line to the charge at waterloo from every committee room and subcommittee room they poured out in flocks with blue badges fluttering on their coats  get at it boys said mr smith vote and keep on voting till they make you quit  then he turned to his campaign assistant billy he said wire down to the city that im elected by an overwhelming majority and tell them to wire it right back send word by telephone to all the polling places in the county that the hull town has gone solid conservative and tell them to send the same news back here get carpenters and tell them to run up a platform in front of the hotel tell them to take the bar door clean off its hinges and be all ready the minute the poll quits  it was that last hour that did it just as soon as the big posters went up in the windows of the mariposa newspacket with the telegraphic despatch that josh smith was reported in the city to be elected and was followed by the messages from all over the county the voters hesitated no longer they had waited most of them all through the day not wanting to make any error in their vote but when they saw the smith men crowding into the polls and heard the news from the outside they went solid in one great stampede and by the time the poll was declared closed at five oclock there was no shadow of doubt that the county was saved and that josh smith was elected for missinaba   i wish you could have witnessed the scene in mariposa that evening it would have done your heart goodsuch joy such public rejoicing as you never saw it turned out that there wasnt really a liberal in the whole town and that there never had been they were all conservatives and had been for years and years men who had voted with pain and sorrow in their hearts for the liberal party for twenty years came out that evening and owned up straight that they were conservatives they said they could stand the strain no longer and simply had to confess whatever the sacrifice might mean they were prepared to make it  even mr golgotha gingham the undertaker came out and admitted that in working for john henry bagshaw hed been going straight against his conscience he said that right from the first he had had his misgivings he said it had haunted him often at night when he would be working away quietly one of these sudden misgivings would overcome him so that he could hardly go on with his embalming why it appeared that on the very first day when reciprocity was proposed he had come home and said to mrs gingham that he thought it simply meant selling out the country and the strange thing was that ever so many others had just the same misgivings trelawney admitted that he had said to mrs trelawney that it was madness and jeff thorpe the barber had he admitted gone home to his dinner the first day reciprocity was talked of and said to mrs thorpe that it would simply kill business in the country and introduce a cheap shoddy american form of haircut that would render true loyalty impossible to think that mrs gingham and mrs trelawney and mrs thorpe had known all this for six months and kept quiet about it yet i think there were a good many mrs ginghams in the country it is merely another proof that no woman is fit for politics   the demonstration that night in mariposa will never be forgotten the excitement in the streets the torchlights the music of the band of the knights of pythias an organization which is conservative in all but name and above all the speeches and the patriotism  they had put up a big platform in front of the hotel and on it were mr smith and his chief workers and behind them was a perfect forest of flags they presented a huge bouquet of flowers to mr smith handed to him by four little girls in whitethe same four that i spoke of above for it turned out that they were all conservatives  then there were the speeches judge pepperleigh spoke and said that there was no need to dwell on the victory that they had achieved because it was history there was no occasion to speak of what part he himself had played within the limits of his official position because what he had done was henceforth a matter of history and nivens the lawyer said that he would only say just a few words because anything that he might have done was now history later generations he said might read it but it was not for him to speak of it because it belonged now to the history of the country and after them others spoke in the same strain and all refused absolutely to dwell on the subject for more than half an hour on the ground that anything that they might have done was better left for future generations to investigate and no doubt this was very true as to some things anyway  mr smith of course said nothing he didnt have tonot for four yearsand he knew it     twelve lenvoi the train to mariposa  it leaves the city every day about five oclock in the evening the train for mariposa  strange that you did not know of it though you come from the little townor did long years ago  odd that you never knew in all these years that the train was there every afternoon puffing up steam in the city station and that you might have boarded it any day and gone home no not homeof course you couldnt call it home now home means that big red sandstone house of yours in the costlier part of the city home means in a way this mausoleum club where you sometimes talk with me of the times that you had as a boy in mariposa  but of course home would hardly be the word you would apply to the little town unless perhaps late at night when youd been sitting reading in a quiet corner somewhere such a book as the present one  naturally you dont know of the mariposa train now years ago when you first came to the city as a boy with your way to make you knew of it well enough only too well the price of a ticket counted in those days and though you knew of the train you couldnt take it but sometimes from sheer homesickness you used to wander down to the station on a friday afternoon after your work and watch the mariposa people getting on the train and wish that you could go  why you knew that train at one time better i suppose than any other single thing in the city and loved it too for the little town in the sunshine that it ran to  do you remember how when you first began to make money you used to plan that just as soon as you were rich really rich youd go back home again to the little town and build a great big house with a fine verandahno stint about it the best that money could buy planed lumber every square foot of it and a fine picket fence in front of it  it was to be one of the grandest and finest houses that thought could conceive much finer in true reality than that vast palace of sandstone with the porte cochere and the sweeping conservatories that you afterwards built in the costlier part of the city  but if you have half forgotten mariposa and long since lost the way to it you are only like the greater part of the men here in this mausoleum club in the city would you believe it that practically every one of them came from mariposa once upon a time and that there isnt one of them that doesnt sometimes dream in the dull quiet of the long evening here in the club that some day he will go back and see the place  they all do only theyre half ashamed to own it  ask your neighbour there at the next table whether the partridge that they sometimes serve to you here can be compared for a moment to the birds that he and you or he and some one else used to shoot as boys in the spruce thickets along the lake ask him if he ever tasted duck that could for a moment be compared to the black ducks in the rice marsh along the ossawippi and as for fish and fishingno dont ask him about that for if he ever starts telling you of the chub they used to catch below the mill dam and the green bass that used to lie in the watershadow of the rocks beside the indians island not even the long dull evening in this club would be long enough for the telling of it  but no wonder they dont know about the five oclock train for mariposa very few people know about it hundreds of them know that there is a train that goes out at five oclock but they mistake it ever so many of them think its just a suburban train lots of people that take it every day think its only the train to the golf grounds but the joke is that after it passes out of the city and the suburbs and the golf grounds it turns itself little by little into the mariposa train thundering and pounding towards the north with hemlock sparks pouring out into the darkness from the funnel of it  of course you cant tell it just at first all those people that are crowding into it with golf clubs and wearing knickerbockers and flat caps would deceive anybody that crowd of suburban people going home on commutation tickets and sometimes standing thick in the aisles those are of course not mariposa people but look round a little bit and youll find them easily enough here and there in the crowd those people with the clothes that are perfectly all right and yet look odd in some way the women with the peculiar hats and thewhat do you saylast years fashions ah yes of course that must be it  anyway those are the mariposa people all right enough that man with the twodollar panama and the glaring spectacles is one of the greatest judges that ever adorned the bench of missinaba county that clerical gentleman with the wide black hat who is explaining to the man with him the marvellous mechanism of the new air brake one of the most conspicuous illustrations of the divine structure of the physical universe surely you have seen him before mariposa people oh yes there are any number of them on the train every day  but of course you hardly recognize them while the train is still passing through the suburbs and the golf district and the outlying parts of the city area but wait a little and you will see that when the city is well behind you bit by bit the train changes its character the electric locomotive that took you through the city tunnels is off now and the old wood engine is hitched on in its place i suppose very probably you havent seen one of these wood engines since you were a boy forty years agothe old engine with a wide top like a hat on its funnel and with sparks enough to light up a suit for damages once in every mile  do you see too that the trim little cars that came out of the city on the electric suburban express are being discarded now at the way stations one by one and in their place is the old familiar car with the stuff cushions in red plush how gorgeous it once seemed and with a box stove set up in one end of it the stove is burning furiously at its sticks this autumn evening for the air sets in chill as you get clear away from the city and are rising up to the higher ground of the country of the pines and the lakes  look from the window as you go the city is far behind now and right and left of you there are trim farms with elms and maples near them and with tall windmills beside the barns that you can still see in the gathering dusk there is a dull red light from the windows of the farmstead it must be comfortable there after the roar and clatter of the city and only think of the still quiet of it  as you sit back half dreaming in the car you keep wondering why it is that you never came up before in all these years ever so many times you planned that just as soon as the rush and strain of business eased up a little you would take the train and go back to the little town to see what it was like now and if things had changed much since your day but each time when your holidays came somehow you changed your mind and went down to naragansett or nagahuckett or nagasomething and left over the visit to mariposa for another time  it is almost night now you can still see the trees and the fences and the farmsteads but they are fading fast in the twilight they have lengthened out the train by this time with a string of flat cars and freight cars between where we are sitting and the engine but at every crossway we can hear the long muffled roar of the whistle dying to a melancholy wail that echoes into the woods the woods i say for the farms are thinning out and the track plunges here and there into great stretches of bushtall tamerack and red scrub willow and with a tangled undergrowth of bush that has defied for two generations all attempts to clear it into the form of fields  why look that great space that seems to open out in the halfdark of the falling eveningwhy surely yeslake ossawippi the big lake as they used to call it from which the river runs down to the smaller lakelake wissanottiwhere the town of mariposa has lain waiting for you there for thirty years  this is lake ossawippi surely enough you would know it anywhere by the broad still black water with hardly a ripple and with the grip of the coming frost already on it such a great sheet of blackness it looks as the train thunders along the side swinging the curve of the embankment at a breakneck speed as it rounds the corner of the lake  how fast the train goes this autumn night you have travelled i know you have in the empire state express and the new limited and the maritime express that holds the record of six hundred whirling miles from paris to marseilles but what are they to this this mad career this breakneck speed this thundering roar of the mariposa local driving hard to its home dont tell me that the speed is only twentyfive miles an hour i dont care what it is i tell you and you can prove it for yourself if you will that that train of mingled flat cars and coaches that goes tearing into the night its engine whistle shrieking out its warning into the silent woods and echoing over the dull still lake is the fastest train in the whole world  yes and the best toothe most comfortable the most reliable the most luxurious and the speediest train that ever turned a wheel  and the most genial the most sociable too see how the passengers all turn and talk to one another now as they get nearer and nearer to the little town that dull reserve that seemed to hold the passengers in the electric suburban has clean vanished and gone they are talkinglistenof the harvest and the late election and of how the local member is mentioned for the cabinet and all the old familiar topics of the sort already the conductor has changed his glazed hat for an ordinary round christie and you can hear the passengers calling him and the brakesman bill and sam as if they were all one family  what is it nownine thirty ah then we must be nearing the townthis big bush that we are passing through you remember it surely as the great swamp just this side of the bridge over the ossawippi there is the bridge itself and the long roar of the train as it rushes sounding over the trestle work that rises above the marsh hear the clatter as we pass the semaphores and switch lights we must be close in now  what it feels nervous and strange to be coming here again after all these years it must indeed no dont bother to look at the reflection of your face in the windowpane shadowed by the night outside nobody could tell you now after all these years your face has changed in these long years of moneygetting in the city perhaps if you had come back now and again just at odd times it wouldnt have been so  thereyou hear itthe long whistle of the locomotive one two three you feel the sharp slackening of the train as it swings round the curve of the last embankment that brings it to the mariposa station see too as we round the curve the row of the flashing lights the bright windows of the depot  how vivid and plain it all is just as it used to be thirty years ago there is the string of the hotel buses drawn up all ready for the train and as the train rounds in and stops hissing and panting at the platform you can hear above all other sounds the cry of the brakesmen and the porters  mariposa mariposa   and as we listen the cry grows fainter and fainter in our ears and we are sitting here again in the leather chairs of the mausoleum club talking of the little town in the sunshine that once we knew
