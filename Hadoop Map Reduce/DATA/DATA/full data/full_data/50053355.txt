 and a bosun tight and a midshipmite     and the crew of the captains gig    and he shook his fists and he tore his hair     till i really felt afraid   for i couldnt help thinking the man had been drinking     and so i simply said    oh elderly man its little i know     of the duties of men of the sea   and ill eat my hand if i understand     how you can possibly be    at once a cook and a captain bold     and the mate of the nancy brig   and a bosun tight and a midshipmite     and the crew of the captains gig    then he gave a hitch to his trousers which     is a trick all seamen larn

survivors stayed    and then we murdered the bosun tight     and he much resembled pig   then we wittled free did the cook and me     on the crew of the captains gig    then only the cook and me was left     and the delicate question which   of us two goes to the kettle arose     and we argued it out as sich    for i loved that cook as a brother i did     and the cook he worshipped me   but wed both be blowed if wed either be stowed     in the other chaps hold you see    ill be eat if you dines off me says tom     yes that says i youll be   im boiled if i die my friend quoth i     and

 t will soothing be if i let you see     how extremely nice youll smell    and he stirred it round and round and round     and he sniffed the foaming froth   when i ups with his heels and smothers his squeals     in the scum of the boiling broth    and i eat that cook in a week or less     andas i eating be   the last of his chops why i almost drops     for a wessel in sight i see                                           and i never larf and i never smile     and i never lark nor play   but i sit and croak and a single joke     i havewhich is to say    oh i am a cook and a captain bold     and

times and saturday review   beguiled the leisure of the crew    kindhearted captain reece rn   was quite devoted to his men   in point of fact good captain reece   beatified the mantelpiece    one summer eve at halfpast ten   he said addressing all his men   come tell me please what i can do   to please and gratify my crew    by any reasonable plan   ill make you happy if i can   my own

if you united of em to   unmarried members of the crew    if youd ameliorate our life   let each select from them a wife   and as for nervous me old pal   give me your own enchanting gal    good

the dame that day   addressed her in his playful way   and did it want a wedding ring   it was a tempting ickle sing    well well the chaplain i will seek   well all be married this day week   at yonder church upon the hill   it is my duty and i will    the sisters cousins aunts and niece   and widowed ma of captain reece   attended there as they were bid   it was their duty and they did  illustration     the bishop and the busman     it was a bishop bold     and london was his see   he was short and stout and round about     and zealous as could be    it also was a jew     who drove a putney bus   for flesh of swine however fine     he did not care a cuss    his name was hash baz ben     and jedediah too   and solomon and zabulon     this busdirecting jew    the bishop said said he     ill see what i can do   to christianize and make you wise     you poor benighted jew    so every blessed day     that bus he rode outside   from fulham town both up and down     and loudly thus he cried    his name is hash baz ben     and jedediah too   and solomon and zabulon     this busdirecting jew    at first the busman smiled     and rather liked the fun   he merely smiled that hebrew child     and said eccentric one    and gay young dogs would wait     to see the bus go by   these gay young dogs in striking togs     to hear the bishop cry    observe his grisly beard     his race it clearly shows   he sticks no fork in ham or pork   observe my friends his nose    his name is hash baz ben     and jedediah too   and solomon and zabulon     this busdirecting jew    but though at first amused     yet after seven years   this hebrew child got awful riled     and busted into tears    he really almost feared     to leave his poor abode   his nose and name and beard became     a byword on that road    at length he swore an oath     the reason he would know   ill call and see why ever he     does persecute me so    the good old bishop sat     on his ancestral chair   the busman came sent up his name     and laid his grievance bare    benighted jew he said     and chuckled loud with joy   be christian you instead of jew     become a christian boy    ill neer annoy you more     indeed replied the jew   shall i be freed you will indeed     then done said he with you    the organ which in man     between the eyebrows grows   fell from his face and in its place     he found a christian nose    his tangled hebrew beard     which to his waist came down   was now a pair of whiskers fair     his name adolphus brown    he wedded in a year     that prelates daughter jane   hes grown quite fairhas auburn hair     his wife is far from plain      the folly of brown  by a general agent     i knew a boora clownish card     his only friends were pigs and cows and   the poultry of a small farmyard     who came into two hundred thousand    good fortune worked no change in brown     though shes a mighty social chymist   he was a clownand by a clown     i do not mean a pantomimist    it left him quiet calm and cool     though hardly knowing what a crown was   you cant imagine what a fool     poor rich uneducated brown was    he scouted all who wished to come     and give him monetary schooling   and i propose to give you some     idea of his insensate fooling    i formed a company or two    of course i dont know what the rest meant   i formed them solely with a view    to help him to a sound investment    their objects weretheir only cares     to justify their boards in showing   a handsome dividend on shares     and keep their good promoter going    but nothe lout prefers his brass     though shares at par i freely proffer   yeswill it be believedthe ass     declines with thanks my wellmeant offer    he added with a bumpkins grin     a weakly intellect denoting   hed rather not invest it in     a company of my promoting    you have two hundred thou or more     said i youll waste it lose it lend it   come take my furnished second floor     ill gladly show you how to spend it    but will it be believed that he     with grin upon his face of poppy   declined my aid while thanking me     for what he called my philanthroppy    some blind suspicious fools rejoice     in doubting friends who wouldnt harm them   they will not hear the charmers voice     however wisely he may charm them    i showed him that his coat all dust     top boots and cords provoked compassion   and proved that men of station must     conform to the decrees of fashion    i showed him where to buy his hat     to coat him trouser him and boot him   but nohe wouldnt hear of that     he didnt think the style would suit him    i offered him a country seat     and made no end of an oration   i made it certainly complete     and introduced the deputation    but nothe clown my prospects blights     the worth of birth it surely teaches   why should i want to spend my nights     in parliament amaking speeches    i havent never been to school     i aint had not no eddication   and i should surely be a fool     to publish that to all the nation    i offered him a trotting horse     no hack had ever trotted faster   i also offered him of course     a rare and curious old master    i offered to procure him weeds     wines fit for one in his position   but though an ass in all his deeds     hed learnt the meaning of commission    he called me thief the other day     and daily from his door he thrusts me   much more of this and soon i may     begin to think that brown mistrusts me    so deaf to all sound reasons rule     this poor uneducated clown is   you cannot fancy what a fool     poor rich uneducated brown is      the three kings of chickeraboo     there were three niggers of chickeraboo     pacifico bangbang popchopwho   exclaimed one terribly sultry day     oh lets be kings in a humble way    the first was a highlyaccomplished bones     the next elicited banjo tones   the third was a quiet retiring chap     who danced an excellent breakdown flap    we niggers said they have formed a plan   by which whenever we like we can   extemporize islands near the beach   and then well collar an island each    three casks from somebody elses stores   shall repperesent our island shores   their sides the ocean wide shall lave   their heads just topping the briny wave    great britains navy scours the sea   and everywhere her ships they be   shell recognize our rank perhaps   when she discovers were royal chaps    if to her skirts you want to cling   its quite sufficient that youre a king   she does not push inquiry far   to learn what sort of king you are    a ship of several thousand tons   and mounting seventysomething guns   ploughed every year the ocean blue   discovering kings and countries new    the brave rearadmiral bailey pip   commanding that superior ship   perceived one day his glasses through   the kings that came from chickeraboo    dear eyes said admiral pip i see   three flourishing islands on our lee   and bless me most extrornary thing   on every island stands a king    come lower the admirals gig he cried   and over the dancing waves ill glide   that low obeisance i may do   to those three kings of chickeraboo    the admiral pulled to the islands three   the kings saluted him graciouslee   the admiral pleased at his welcome warm   pulled out a printed alliance form    your majesty sign me this i pray   i come in a friendly kind of way   i come if you please with the best intents   and queen victorias compliments    the kings were pleased as they well could be   the most retiring of all the three   in a cellarflap to his joy gave vent   with a banjobones accompaniment    the great rearadmiral bailey pip   embarked on board his jolly big ship   blue peter flew from his lofty fore   and off he sailed to his native shore    admiral pip directly went   to the lord at the head of the government   who made him by a stroke of a quill   baron de pippe of pippetonneville    the college of heralds permission yield   that he should quarter upon his shield   three islands vert on a field of blue   with the pregnant motto chickeraboo    ambassadors yes and attaches too   are going to sail for chickeraboo   and see on the good ships crowded deck   a bishop whos going out there on spec    and let us all hope that blissful things   may come of alliance with darkey kings   oh may we never whatever we do   declare a war with chickeraboo   illustration     the bishop of rumtifoo     from east and south the holy clan   of bishops gathered to a man   to synod called pananglican     in flocking crowds they came   among them was a bishop who   had lately been appointed to   the balmy isle of rumtifoo     and peter was his name    his peopletwentythree in sum   they played the eloquent tumtum   and lived on scalps served up in rum     the only sauce they knew   when first good bishop peter came   for peter was that bishops name   to humor them he did the same     as they of rumtifoo    his flock ive often heard him tell   his name was peter loved him well   and summoned by the sound of bell     in crowds together came   oh massa why you go away   oh massa peter please to stay   they called him peter people say     because it was his name    he told them all good boys to be   and sailed away across the sea   at london bridge that bishop he     arrived one tuesday night   and as that night he homeward strode   to his pananglican abode   he passed along the borough road     and saw a gruesome sight    he saw a crowd assembled round   a person dancing on the ground   who straight began to leap and bound     with all his might and main   to see that dancing man he stopped   who twirled and wriggled skipped and hopped   then down incontinently dropped     and then sprang up again    the bishop chuckled at the sight   this style of dancing would delight   a simple rumtifoozleite     ill learn it if i can   to please the tribe when i get back   he begged the man to teach his knack   right reverend sir in half a crack     replied that dancing man    the dancing man he worked away   and taught the bishop every day   the dancer skipped like any fay     good peter did the same   the bishop buckled to his task   with battements cuts and pas de basque   ill tell you if you care to ask     that peter was his name    come walk like this the dancer said   stick out your toesstick in your head   stalk on with quick galvanic tread     your fingers thus extend   the attitudes considered quaint   the weary bishop feeling faint   replied i do not say it aint     but time my christian friend    we now proceed to something new   dance as the paynes and lauris do   like thisone twoone twoone two     the bishop never proud   but in an overwhelming heat   his name was peter i repeat   performed the payne and lauri feat     and puffed his thanks aloud    another game the dancer planned   just take your ankle in your hand   and try my lord if you can stand     your body stiff and stark   if when revisiting your see   you learnt to hop on shorelike me   the novelty must striking be     and must excite remark    no said the worthy bishop no   that is a length to which i trow   colonial bishops cannot go     you may express surprise   at finding bishops deal in pride   but if that trick i ever tried   i should appear undignified     in rumtifoozles eyes    the islanders of rumtifoo   are wellconducted persons who   approve a joke as much as you     and laugh at it as such   but if they saw their bishop land   his leg supported in his hand   the joke they wouldnt understand     twould pain them very much     to the terrestrial globe  by a miserable wretch     roll on thou ball roll on   through pathless realms of

as a man of a mournful mind   no characteristic trait had he     of any distinctive kind    from the ranks one day cried private james     oh majorgeneral john   ive doubts of our respective names     my mournful mind upon    a glimmering thought occurs to me     its source i cant unearth   but ive a kind of notion we     were cruelly changed at birth    ive a strange idea each others names

fullprivate james     its a joke of doubtful taste    but being a man of doubtless worth     if you feel certain quite   that we were probably changed at birth     ill venture to say youre right    so

hed eaten the balance you see     scale and balance is punning you see    there was haughty pishtushpoohbah     there was lumbering doodledumdeh   despairing alackadeyah     and good little tootletumteh     exemplary tootletumteh    one day there was grief in the crew     for they hadnt a morsel of meat   and borria bungalee boo     was dying for something to eat     come provide me with

there is jocular waggetyweh     there is musical dohrehmifah     theres the nightingale dohrehmifah    so the forces of bungalee boo     marched forth in a terrible row   and the ladies who fought for queen loo     prepared to encounter the foe     this dreadful insatiate foe    but they sharpened no weapons at all     and they poisoned no arrowsnot they   they made ready to conquer or fall     in a totally different way     an entirely different way    with a crimson and pearlywhite dye     they endeavored to make themselves fair   with black they encircled each eye     and with yellow they painted their hair     it was wool but they thought it was hair    and the forces they met in the field     and the men of king borria said   amazonians immediately yield     and their arrows they drew to the head     yes drew them right up to the head    but jocular waggetyweh     ogled doodledumdeh which was wrong   and neat little tittyfolleh     said tootletum you go along     you naughty

 i do not think i ever knew   a man so wholly given to     creating a sensation   or praps i should in justice say   to what in an adelphi play     is known as situation    he passed his time designing traps   to flurry unsuspicious chaps     the taste was his innately   he couldnt walk into a room   without ejaculating boom     which startled ladies greatly    hed wear a mask and muffling cloak   not you will understand in joke     as some assume disguises   he did it actuated by   a simple love of mystery     and fondness for surprises    i need not say he loved a maid   his eloquence threw into shade     all others who adored her   the maid though pleased at first i know   found after several years or so     her startling lover bored her    so when his orders came to sail   she did not faint or scream or wail     or with her tears anoint him   she shook his hand and said goodbye   with laughter dancing in her eye     which seemed to disappoint him    but ere he went aboard his boat   he placed around her little throat     a ribbon blue and yellow   on which he hung a double tooth   a simple token this in sooth     twas all he had poor fellow    i often wonder he would say   when very very far away     if angelina wears it   a plan has entered in my head   i will pretend that i am dead     and see how angy bears it    the news he made a messmate tell   his angelina

end of treasure   he said my noble gal be mine   the noble gal did not decline     but simply said with pleasure    when this was told to captain todd   at first he thought it rather odd     and felt some perturbation   but very long he did not grieve   he thought he could a way perceive     to such a situation    ill not reveal myself said he   till they are both in the eccle     siastical arena   then suddenly i will appear   and paralyzing them with fear     demand my angelina    at length arrived the wedding day   accoutred in the usual way     appeared the bridal body   the worthy clergyman began   when in the gallant captain ran     and cried behold your toddy    the bridegroom praps was terrified   and also possibly the bride     the bridesmaids were affrighted   but angelina

asitting at her windowsill one day   a beautiful young gentleman he chanced to pass that way   she cast her eyes upon him and he looked so good and true   that she thought i could be happy with a gentleman like you    and every morning passed her house that cream of gentlemen   she knew she might expect him at a quarter unto ten   a sorter in the customhouse it was his daily road   the customhouse was fifteen minutes walk from her abode    but alice was a pious girl who knew it wasnt wise   to look at strange young sorters with expressive purple eyes   so she sought the village priest to whom her family confessed   the priest by whom their little sins were carefully assessed    oh holy father alice said twould grieve you would it not   to discover that i was a most disreputable lot   of all unhappy sinners im the most unhappy one   the padre said whatever have you been and gone and done    i have helped mamma to steal a little kiddy from its dad   ive assisted dear papa in cutting up a little lad   ive planned a little burglary and forged a little check   and slain a little baby for the coral on its neck    the worthy pastor heaved a sigh and dropped a silent tear   and said you mustnt judge yourself too heavily my dear   its wrong to murder babies little corals for to fleece   but sins like that one expiates at halfacrown apiece    girls will be

o there is another crime i havent mentioned yet    a pleasantlooking gentleman with pretty purple eyes   ive noticed at my window as ive sat acatching flies   he passes by it every day as certain as can be   i blush to say ive winked at him and he has winked at me    for shame said father paul my erring daughter on my word   this is the most distressing news that i have ever heard   why naughty girl your excellent papa has pledged your hand   to a promising young robber the lieutenant of his band    this dreadful piece of news will pain your worthy parents so   they are the most remunerative customers i know   for many years theyve kept starvation from my doors   i never knew so criminal a family as yours    the common country folk in this insipid neighborhood   have nothing to confess theyre so ridiculously good   and if you marry any one respectable at all   why youll reform and what will then become of father paul    the worthy priest he up and drew his cowl upon his crown   and started off in haste to tell the news to robber brown   to tell him how his daughter who now was for marriage fit   had winked upon a sorter who reciprocated it    good robber brown he muffled up his anger pretty well   he said i have a notion and that notion i will tell   i will nab this gay young sorter terrify him into fits   and get my gentle wife to chop him into little bits    ive studied human nature and i know a thing or two   though a girl may fondly love a living gent as many do   a feeling of disgust upon her senses there will fall   when she looks upon his body chopped particularly small    he traced that gallant sorter to a still suburban square   he watched his opportunity and seized him unaware   he took a lifepreserver and he hit him on the head   and mrs brown dissected him before she went to bed    and pretty little alice grew more settled in her mind   she never more was guilty of a weakness of the kind   until at length good robber brown bestowed her pretty hand   on the promising young robber the lieutenant of his band      ben allah achmet  or the fatal tum     i once did know a turkish man     whom i upon a twopairback met   his name it was effendi khan     backsheesh pasha ben allah achmet    a doctor brown i also knew     ive often eaten of his bounty   the turk and he they lived at hooe     in sussex that delightful county    i knew a nice young lady there     her name was isabella sherson   and though she wore anothers hair     she was an interesting person    the turk adored the maid of hooe     although his harem would have shocked her   but brown adored that maiden too     he was a most seductive doctor    theyd follow her whereer shed go     a course of action most improper   she neither knew by sight and so     for neither of them cared a copper    brown did not know that turkish male     he might have been his sainted mother   the people in this simple tale     are total strangers to each other    one day that turk he sickened sore     which threw him straight into a sharp pet   he threw himself upon the floor     and rolled about upon hiscarpet    it made him moanit made him groan     and almost wore him to a mummy   why should i hesitate to own     that pain was in his little tummy    at length a doctor came and rung     as allah achmet had desired   who felt his pulse looked up his tongue     and hummed and hawed and then inquired    where is the pain that long has preyed     upon you in so sad a way sir   the turk he giggled blushed and said     i dont exactly like to say sir    come nonsense said good doctor brown     so this is turkish coyness is it   you must contrive to fight it down     come come sir please to be explicit    the turk he shyly bit his thumb     and coyly blushed like one halfwitted   the pain is in my little tum     he whispering at length admitted    then take you this and take you that     your blood flows sluggish in its channel   you must get rid of all this fat     and wear my medicated flannel    youll send for me when youre in need     my name is brownyour life ive saved it   my rival shrieked the invalid     and drew a mighty sword and waved it    this to thy weazand christian pest     aloud the turk in frenzy yelled it   and drove right through the doctors chest     the sabre and the hand that held it    the blow was a decisive one     and doctor brown grew deadly pasty   now see the mischief that youve done     you turks are so extremely hasty    there are two doctor browns in hooe     hes short and stoutim tall and wizen   youve been and run the wrong one through     thats how the error has arisen    the accident was thus explained     apologies were only heard now   at my mistake im really pained     i am indeed upon my word now

and everybody said       how can he be repaid   this very greatthis very goodthis very gifted man   but nobody could hit upon a practicable plan    at last the point was given up in absolute despair   when a distant cousin died and he became a millionaire   with a county seat in parliament a moor or two of grouse   and a taste for making inconvenient speeches in the house   then it flashed upon britannia that the fittest of rewards   was to take him from the commons and to put him in the lords   and who so fit to sit in it deny it if you can   as this very greatthis very goodthis very gifted

lace has a charm for the fair   and ive plenty of that and to spare       while a lovers professions       when uttered in hessians   are eloquent everywhere         a fact that i counted upon         when i first put this uniform on    i said when i first put it on     it is plain to the veriest dunce       that every beauty       will feel it her duty   to yield to its glamor at once   they will see that im freely goldlaced   in a uniform handsome and chaste       but the peripatetics       of longhaired Ã¦sthetics   are very much more to their taste         which i never counted upon

  there are one or two rules that all family fools     must observe if they love their profession       there are one or two rules         half a dozen maybe       that all family fools         of

intellectual chap     and think of things that would astonish you       i often think its comical         how nature always does contrive       that every boy and every gal         thats born into the world alive       is either a little liberal         or else a little conservative               fal lal la    when in that house mps divide     if theyve a brain and cerebellum too   theyre got to leave that brain outside     and vote just as their leaders tell em to   but then the prospect of a lot     of statesmen all in close proximity   athinking for themselves is what     no man can face with equanimity       then lets rejoice with loud fal lal         that nature wisely does contrive       that every boy and every gal         thats born into the world alive       is either a little

a brief which i bought of a booby   a couple of shirts and a collar or two     and a ring that looked like a ruby    in westminster hall i danced a dance     like a semidespondent fury   for i thought i should never hit on a chance     of addressing a british jury   but i soon got tired of third class journeys     and dinners of bread and water   so i fell in love with a rich attorneys     elderly ugly daughter    the rich attorney he wiped his eyes     and replied to my fond professions   you shall reap the reward of your enterprise     at the bailey and middlesex sessions   youll soon get used to her looks said he     and a very nice girl youll find her   she may very well pass for fortythree     in the dusk with a light behind her    the rich attorney was as good as his word     the briefs came trooping gaily   and every day my voice was heard     at the sessions or ancient bailey   all thieves who could my fees afford     relied on my orations   and many a burglar ive restored     to his friends and his relations    at length i became as rich as the gurneys     an incubus then i thought her   so i threw over that rich attorneys     elderly ugly daughter   the rich attorney my

 no possible doubt whatever    but owing im much disposed to fear       to his terrible taste for tippling   that highly respectable gondolier   could never declare with a mind sincere   which of the

embark without delay       on the duties of the day    first we polish off some batches   of political dispatches       and foreign politicians circumvent   then if business isnt heavy   we may hold a royal levee       or ratify some acts of parliament   then we probably review the household troops   with the usual shalloo humps and shalloo hoops   or receive with ceremonial and state   an interesting eastern potentate       after that we generally       go and dress our private valet   its rather a nervous dutyhes a touchy little man       write some letters literary       for our private secretary   he is shaky in his spelling so we help him if we can       then in view of cravings inner       we go down and order dinner   or we polish the regalia and the coronation plate       spend an hour in titivating       all our gentlemeninwaiting   or we run on little errands for the ministers of state       oh philosophers may sing       of the troubles of a king   yet the duties are delightful and the privileges great       but the privilege and pleasure       that we treasure beyond measure   is to run on little errands for the ministers of state    after luncheon making merry   on a bun and glass of sherry       if weve nothing particular to do   we may make a proclamation   or receive a deputation       then we possibly create a peer or two   then we help a fellow creature on his path   with the garter or the thistle or the bath   or we dress and toddle off in semistate   to a festival a function or a fete       then we go and stand as sentry       at the palace private entry   marching hither marching thither up and down and to and fro       while the warrior on duty       goes in search of beer and beauty   and it generally happens that he hasnt far to go       he relieves us if hes able       just in time to lay the table   then we dine and serve the coffee and at halfpast twelve or one       with a pleasure thats emphatic       we retire to our
