44229594	wrecked but not ruined by rm ballantyne   set in the outback of canada this book unfolds in the area with which ballantyne was so familiar  if you like to read about this area you will find lots in this book to amuse you  it makes a good audiobook too   wrecked but not ruined by rm ballantyne    chapter one  the outpost  on the northern shores of the gulf of saint lawrence there stood not very long ago a group of wooden houses which were simple in construction and lowly in aspect  the region around them was a vast uncultivated uninhabited solitude  the road that led to them was a rude one  it wound round a rugged cliff under the shelter of which the houses nestled as if for protection from the cold winds and the snowdrifts that took special delight in revelling there  this group of buildings was at the time we write of an outpost of the furtraders those hardy pioneers of civilisation to whom chiefly we are indebted for opening up the way into the northern wilderness of america  the outpost was named the cliff after the bold precipice near the base of which it stood  a slender stockade surrounded it a flagstaff rose in the centre of it and a rusty old ships carronade reared defiantly at its front gate  in virtue of these warlike appendages the place was sometimes styled the fort  when first established the cliff fort lay far beyond the outmost bounds of civilised life but the progress of emigration had sent forward wave after wave into the northern wilderness and the tide rose at last until its distant murmur began to jar on the ears of the traders in their lonely dwelling warning them that competition was at hand and that if they desired to carry on the trade in peace they must push still further into the bush or be hopelessly swallowed up in the advancing tide  when the unwelcome sounds of advancing civilisation first broke the stillness of this desolate region the chief of the tradingpost was seated at breakfast with his clerk  he was a tall goodlooking young englishman named reginald redding  the clerk bob smart was a sturdy youth who first saw the light among the mountains of scotland doubtless he had been named robert when baptised but his intimates would not have understood you had you mentioned him by that name  bob had just helped reginald to the wing of a salt goose and was about to treat himself to a leg of the same when the cook entered  this cook was a man  it may also be said with truth that he was more than most men  at the outpost men were few and of women there were none  it may be imagined then that the cooks occupations and duties were numerous  francois le rue besides being cook to the establishment was waiter chambermaid firewoodchopper butcher baker drawerofwater trader furpacker and interpreter  these offices he held professionally  when off duty and luxuriating in tobacco and relaxation he occupied himself as an amateur shoemaker tailor musician and stickwhittler to the no small advantage of himself and his fellowoutcasts of whom there were five or six besides the principals already mentioned  le rues face bore an expression of dissatisfaction and perplexity as he entered the hall  oh monsieur redding he exclaimed dem squatters de black scoundrils what is be called macklodds has bin come at last  ho ho the mcleods have come have they said redding laying down his knife and fork and looking earnestly at the man i had heard of their intention  oui yis vraiment said le rue with vehemence dey has come to jenkins creek more dan tree veeks pass  von sauvage come an tell me he have see dem  got put up von hut an have begin de sawmill  well well francois returned redding with a somewhat doubtful smile as he resumed his knife and fork bring some more hot water and keep your mind easy  the mcleods cant do us much harm  their sawmill will work for many a day before it makes much impression on the forests hereabouts  there is room for us all  forests exclaimed the cook with a frown and a shrug of his shoulders non dey not hurt moche timber but dey vill trade vid de injinsde sauvagesan give dem drink an git all de furs an fat den vill come of dat  without waiting for a reply the indignant cook went in quest of hot water leaving the traders to discuss the salt goose and the news  thats bad news said bob smart  what do you propose to do in the circumstances  something definite must be done replied redding but i dont yet see my way as to what  having finished the goose between them and turned its skeleton over with an inquisitive glance to make sure that nothing eatable had escaped the two friends finished their frugal meal with a cup of tea and a fried cake of the simplest elementsflour and waterafter which they drew their chairs to the fireplacea large open chimney well filled with blazing logslighted their pipes and entered on a discussion of the mcleods and their present position  when their pipes were emptied redding arose and turning his back to the fire said  well bob smart this is the outcome of our cogitations  i am almost certain that these mcleods have taken up their quarters within the boundary of our companys reserve lands and if so they must be routed out of their nest at once  delay in such matters is often fatal  the law of use and wont bob is soon established but i have a strong objection to act in uncertainty  i will therefore drive up to the hut of jonas bellew with whom i shall leave horse and sleigh as the track ends at boulder creek and proceed on snowshoes to the new settlement in partridge bay where the surveyor lives who has the plans of our reserve lands  i shall examine these plans and if i find that our property has been invaded then  death and confusion to the mcleods interrupted bob  well perhaps that is the best thing to do but the spring is well advanced  the thermometer stood high this morning  if a thaw should set in you will find the walking in snowshoes bad  if is a word to which you attach too much importance bob  we have not at present to do with what may be but with what is  true nevertheless a prudent man has regard to probabilities replied bob with an air of much wisdom as he relighted his pipe  just so returned redding and as there is every probability that i shall be absent a good many days i leave you in charge of this establishment with strict injunctions to keep aloof from the mcleods and at the same time to keep an eye on them  francois le rue will accompany me  i shall start immediately therefore be pleased to go and tell le rue to get himself and the sleigh ready while i put on my travelling gear  obedient to the order smart left the room while his superior clothed himself in a leathern coat and leggings fur cap moccasins and mittens  in half an hour redding and his man stepped into a sleigh which was barely large enough to hold them  they packed themselves up to the armpits in bearskin rugs and then redding gave his rough little nag a touch of the whip which caused him to start forward with a jerk that set all the bells on his harness ringing merrily  another minute and they dashed out at the gate swept round the base of the beetling cliff that frowned above the outpost and entered the sombre shadow of the forest    chapter two  the recluse of boulder creek  the road along which the travellers proceeded was desolate and dreary in the extreme  already darkened by clouds and snowdrift it was rendered still more gloomy by overhanging and snowladen branches of stunted pines  it was just broad enough to permit the passage of a single vehicle being a mere woodmans track which had been extended beyond the ordinary limits of such tracks for his personal convenience by jonas bellew a trapper who dwelt at that part of the coast already mentioned as boulder creek the track followed the windings of a streamlet which was at that time covered with snow and only distinguishable by the absence of bushes along its course  it turned now to the right now to the left as rocks or mounds or cliffs presented obstacles  in some places it dived precipitately into a hollow that necessitated careful driving in others it ran straight up to the brow of a hill at an angle that obliged the travellers not only to get out and walk but also to aid their panting pony by putting their shoulders to the back of the sleigh  here and there a level patch occurred over which they trotted briskly and then down they went again by a steep incline into the bed of an iceburied stream to find a similarly steep ascent on the other side occasionally coming to a walllike cliff surrounded by a tangled and trackless forest they were forced to seek the shores of the sea and there among rocks and icedrift pick their way slowly along  fortunately this road just opposite to jenkins creek where the mcleods had commenced their squatting operations ran along the shore at some distance from the entrance to the creek so that redding could pass without encountering the newcomers whom he was anxious to avoid until the question of the invasion of the fur companys rights was settled  despite their utmost efforts night began to close upon the travellers before they reached bellews shanty in boulder creek  take care monsieur there is von portion dangereux here said francois le rue  where asked redding as he checked the pony a little and looked earnestly ahead  ah dere exclaimed le rue  his remark was needless for at that moment the sleigh turned over a ledge of rock and pitched its occupants into a snowdrift  killded gasped the canadian as he emerged from the snow with eyes ears and nostrils stuffed full nonot quite  satisfying himself that no bones were broken he turned abruptly to look for his companion whose motionless legs sticking out of the drift were the only visible portions of his body  anxiously and swiftly did francois drag his master out and great was his relief when poor redding looked at him with a bewildered gaze and demanded to know what had happened  oh  i see capsized he said rising and pressing his hand to his brow i believe i must have hit my head against a stump for ive been slightly stunned  however alls well that ends well  not hurt francois  no monsieurnot fatever  thats right lend a hand to lift the sleighhoop therejump in  le rue obeyed  the bearrug was replaced around them and the pony which had stood as quiet as a lamb during the accident started forward again  voila von light exclaimed the canadian  at that moment they had rounded the corner of a high cliff and come into view of boulder creek  there was just light enough to make the chaotic grandeur of the place visible in a ghostly degree  great boulders and masses of rock which had fallen from the neighbouring mountains and cliffs lay piled about in the creek or gully in wildest confusion  some of these masses were as large as a small hut but they were of all sizes as well as shapes  it was a weird scene and forbidding nevertheless some human being had seen fit to take up his abode there as was made apparent by the light referred to by le rue  picking their way carefully among the boulders the travellers at last reached a loghut which was so small weatherworn and grey that from a short distance it might have easily been mistaken even in daylight for one of the rocks by which it was surrounded  the door stood wide open and through it streamed the light of a roaring fire of wood  so powerful was the contrast between the ruddy light and the cold grey scene without that to the approaching travellers it appeared as if the whole interior of the hut glowed with fervent heat  in the small doorway stood the figure of a man who was so large as almost to fill up the entrance and so black by contrast with the glowing background that neither feature nor form was distinguishable save his sharp outline  the outline however was a remarkably telling one  it told of a broad chest and square shoulders of massive limbs and an easy air and a sturdy attitude and suggested difficulty in the way of entering that hut without leave asked and obtained  hallo exclaimed the outline in a voice so deep that it must have been unfathomable  how dee do bellew cried reginald redding as he drove into the stream of light pulled up and sprang from the sleigh  hearty sir hearty thank ee replied the outline advancing and becoming a little more visible on the surface as he did so  hallo  le rue how are ee  glad to see you both  step in  a good fire on a coldish night is cheeryaint it mister redding  indeed it is bellew especially when the night happens to be also darkish  ha oui interposed le rue bustling into the hut with the bearrug it vas so darkish dat ve capsize under de cliff an amost knock de whole affair to smattomssleigh cheval an peepil  im glad to see that the peepil is all right however said bellew glancing at his visitors with what may be called a grave smile it might have bin worse for thats an ugly corner under the cliff an needs careful drivin even in daylight  ive not come off quite scatheless however said redding rubbing the top of his head tenderly for here is a bump that would perplex the whole college of phrenologists  skin broke sir asked bellew advancing and examining the part  no all right  a good supper will be the best cure for it  if i was a phrenologist now id name it the bump of topheaviness  sit down sir sit down le rue an look after my kettle while i see to your nag  so saying their host went out and left his unexpected but evidently welcome guests to make themselves comfortable  although jonas bellew was a recluse he was by no means an ascetic  he was marked by deep gravity of countenance coupled with a kindly humorous disposition  no one knew where he came from or why he had taken up his abode in such a lonely spot  many of the rough fellows who hang on the outskirts of the wilderness had tried as they said to pump him on these points but jonas was either a dry well or a deep one for pumping brought forth nothing  he gained a livelihood by shooting fishing trapping wild animals for their skins and sometimes by doing what he called odd jobs in the settlements  your home appears to me to grow wilder every time i see it said redding as bellew reentered the hut and busied himself in spreading on a rough deal table the materials of a plain but substantial meal  that seems to be the idea of most men who come here replied the trapper but its not many that favour me with a visit  ha vraiment dat must be true interposed the canadian for no body vill com here xcept them as do want hims legs broke  well i have seen a few damaged shins and broken heads since i came to this location said jonas but such accidents occur chiefly among the canadian french who seem on the whole to be a clumsy set  not von half so clumsy as de engleesh or irish or scosh retorted le rue  perhaps youre right an mayhap youre wrong lad anyway here is supper  the frenchmen are always good at their victuals so sit in an go to work  take the keg mister redding  ive not found time yet to make chairs but its wonderful how well a man gets along without such luxuries  especially when a man sits down to a venisonsteak like this said the furtrader taking the offered seat while his man sat down on a block of wood set on end and prepared to prove the truth of the trappers assertion in regard to french capacity for food  taint venison said bellew assisting his companions to the meat in question its bear  indeed and not bad food for a hungry man returned redding as he began supper  where got you him  down near jenkins creek where the mcleods are setting up their sawmill  the mcleods exclaimed redding looking up suddenly have you seen the mcleods  ay ive bin helpin them a bit wi the mill  goin down again tomorrow  if this weather holds the ice must give way soon and then well be able to push ahead faster  the trapper said this quietly and without looking up from the bearsteak with which he was busy so that reddings look of surprise appeared to be lost on him  the furtrader and his man exchanged glances  for a few minutes the process of mastication completely engrossed the trio but the thoughts of the furtrader were busy for he was disappointed to find that one whom he respected so much as jonas bellew should thus coolly state that he was aiding the interlopers  presently he laid down his knife and fork and said  are you aware bellew that these mcleods have settled themselves on the companys reserve lands  no sir i wasnt aware of it  well then i now tell you that they have said redding who unfortunately for himself and others possessed an easilyroused spirit and was apt to become irascible when the rightsreal or supposedof the company which he represented appeared in danger of violation  at least he continued in a less positive tone i have reason to believe that such is the case and i am now on my way to  he paused abruptly feeling the impropriety of revealing his plans to one who although a quiet and sensible man and not given to talk too much was nevertheless by his own admission an aider and abettor of the enemy  whereabouts is the boundary line asked bellew after a short silence  at jenkins creekthat creek is the boundary answered the furtrader  on which side of the creek have they begun to build the mill  they havent begun yet sir but i believe they intend to commence on the south side  so far well replied redding but if i find that they have raised a stone or planted a stake on the north side of the creek ill  here feeling that he was about to give way to a boastful spirit he got himself out of the difficulty of having to finish the sentence by making a sudden and somewhat stern demand for more bearsteak  vid pleasieur monsieur said le rue placing a huge slice on his masters plate  well sir i hope youll find that they havent overstepped the boundary said bellew because the mcleods look as if theyd be troublesome customers to deal with  the furtrader made no reply  he felt indignant at the bare idea of his being checked in doing his duty by any man or men who were troublesome by which expression he understood bellew to mean that they were resolute and physically powerful in opposition he therefore thought it best to avoid any further tendency to boast by holding his tongue  not so his volatile retainer who stuck his fork into a lump of meat vindictively as if it had been the body of a mcleod and exclaimed  hah vat you say troblesom eh who care for dat  if de macklodds do touche by von small hinch de lands of de companieve villhah  another stab of the fork was all that the savage le rue vouchsafed as an explanation of his intentions  in this frame of mind reginald redding and his man started off next morning on foot at an early hour slept that night at a place called sams hut and the following evening drew near to the end of their journey    chapter three  a brief but agreeable meeting  the little outskirt settlement of partridge bay was one of those infant colonies which was destined to become in future years a flourishing and thicklypeopled district of canada  at the period of our story it was a mere cluster of dwellings that were little better than shanties in point of architecture and appearance  they were however somewhat larger than these and the cleared fields around them with here and there a little garden railed in gave them a more homelike aspect than the dwellings of the woodmen  the valley in which the settlement stood was one of those magnificent stretches of primeval forest which used to be the huntinggrounds of the red man and from which he had not at that time been thrust by the paleface for here and there his wigwam might still be seen sending its wreath of blue smoke above the treetops  it was eveninga calm sunny glorious spring eveningwhen redding and his man overtopped the heights that enclosed the vale and paused as well to gaze upon the scene as to recover breath  far below them lay the hamlet a cluster of black dots on a field of pure snow  roseate lights on undulations and cold blue shadows in hollows were tamed down in effect by the windows of the hamlet which shot forth beams of blazing fire at the setting sun  illimitable space seemed to stretch away to the place where the horizon would have been if it had not lost itself in a golden glory and this vast reach was a varied irregular network of dark pines and fields of snowthe pines tipped everywhere with sparkling snowwreaths the fields streaked everywhere with long shadows  little winding lines of a grey colour which radiated from the hamlet indicated the tracks where the settlers drove their sleighs and woodsledges  many of these were seen moving along the faroff tracks like insects while the tinkle of the sleighbells floated upwards like fairy music  yes i shall take up my abode there murmured redding as he gazed in rapt admiration on the beautiful scene  monsieur said his companion  i say that i should like to dwell there answered redding  it is a splendid country and will be better known in days to come  vraiment truly a magnifircent kontry returned le rue gorgeows magnifique  i vould giv moche ver moche to have leetil cottage an vife an cow an pigs dere  as redding had been thinking of something similar he laughed and commenced the descent of the zigzag track that led to the hamlet  they had proceeded only a few yards when turning round a cluster of pines they suddenly discovered some travellers in difficultya man whose horse had shied or stumbled off the narrow track and was embedded up to the girths in the soft snow and two females whose furry garments all besprinkled with snow showed that they had just emerged from the sledge which lay on its side behind the horse  the drivers chief anxiety seemed to be to quiet and restrain his horse which being highspirited was plunging in vain and frantic efforts to extricate himself to the great danger of shafts and harness  to run up and aid the man was of course the instant impulse of our travellers  ah good luck to ee exclaimed the driver in tones that were unmistakably irish here howld is head till i get the sled clear  all right cried the englishman seizing the reins near the mouth of the terrified animal and holding its head forcibly down while le rue assisted the owner to unharness  in a few minutes the vehicle was righted and the horse released  while the driver was busy readjusting the harness he accompanied the operation with a running fire of grateful expressions such asthere now aint ye in luck rooney  arrah gentleman its my blissin i bestow on yez  och but id have bin lost intirely widout ye  well well its always the way  im no sooner in a scrape than im sure to get out of it  its meself is a favoured man  now thin ladies git in for were late enough on the road  on the two ladies thus addressed redding and his man had been gazing in silent surprise for they were so goodlooking and so blooming that it seemed to the two men who had been accustomed of late to the sight of none but the brown dames of the red skins as if a couple of beings from another and a purer world had dropped suddenly upon their path one of the two was evidently a lady and was possessed of no common share of beauty  her dark hair contrasted powerfully with the fairness of her skin and the whiteness of her teeth  her dazzling black eyes almost and her red lips altogether laughed as she observed reddings gaze of astonishment  her companion a very pretty canadian girl was evidently her maid  we owe you many thanks kind sirs said the lady for your opportune assistance  pardon me madam said redding hastening forward in some confusion as he recovered from his rather rude stare of surprise i dwell in the wilderness and have been so unaccustomed of late to the sight of ladies thatthatallow me to assist you into the sleigh  mademoiselle permettez moi said le rue advancing to the waitingmaid and politely offering his hand  another moment and the ladies were seated in the vehicle and carefully repacked by our travellers while their irish driver mounted to his seat in front and gathered up the reins  thanks gentlemen many thanks repeated the ladies with bewitching smiles  good luck to ee both cried the driver as he flourished his whip and drove away  redding and his man stood silently gazing for several minutes at the turn in the road where the vision had vanished  heaven for two minits an nowgone for evair said le rue with a deep sigh  redding echoed the sigh and then laughed at the lugubrious expression of his mans face  oh such eyes exclaimed le rue  yes shes rather goodlooking replied redding thinking of the lady  goodlooking nonbootifoolexiquitely bootifool cried le rue thinking of the maid  again redding laughed  well well francois said he whether goodlooking or beautiful matters little for its not likely that we shall ever see them again so the less you think about them the betterallons we are late enough and must not loiter  they pushed ahead at once at a rapid pace but although neither spoke each thought with somewhat similar feelings of the little incident just described  lest the reader should be surprised at so small a matter affecting them so deeply we must remark that these furtraders had lived for some years in a region where they saw no females except the brown and rather dirty squaws of the indians who visited the cliff fort with furs  their fort was indeed only three days journey from the little settlement of partridge bay but as the space which lay between was a particularly rugged part of the wilderness with only a portion of roadunworthy of the namehere and there and the greater part of the way only passable on foot or by means of dogsledges none but an occasional red man or a trapper went to and fro and as the nature of the furtraders business called for very little intercourse with the settlementstheir furs being sent by water to quebec in summerit followed that the inhabitants of the cliff fort rarely visited partridge bay  the sudden vision therefore of two pretty females of a higher type had not only the effect on redding and his man of novelty but also stirred up old memories and associations  such good use did they now make of their time that the settlement of partridge bay was reached before dark and our hero went off immediately in quest of the surveyor  mr gambart was a cheerful healthy plump little man with a plump little wife and three plump little daughters  plumpness was not only a characteristic of the gambarts but also of their surroundings for the cottage in which they dwelt had a certain air of plumpness about it and the spot on which it stood was a round little knob of a hill  here reginald redding was hospitably receivedwe might almost say joyfully because visitors to the settlement were so rare that whoever made his appearance was sure to be received as a welcome guest if he only carried the credentials of honesty and ordinary good nature on his countenance  reddings impatience however to get at the truth of the matter that had brought him there induced him very soon to forsake the society of the three plump little daughters and retire to the plump little fathers workroom  it is my opinion said mr gambart as he carefully unfolded the plan that you may find the mcleods have trespassed somewhat on your reserves for if my memory serves me rightly there is a small islet as you see herejust in the centre of the creek half of which belongs to you  i see it said the furtrader earnestly gazing on the dot which represented the said island  well continued the surveyor that islet is a mere rock just above the waterfall and i am of opinion that it would be almost impossible for any one to erect a mill there without encroaching to some extent on your half of it  good replied the furtrader can you let me have a copy of the plan tomorrow  tonight if you please  i have one by me  then ill be off by daybreak the day after tomorrow said redding with much decision  why such haste asked the surveyor the mcleods are not likely to run away from you  i know them well for they dwelt long in this settlement and were ever regarded as men of firm purposequite immovable indeed when once they had made up their minds on any point so youll be sure to find them at jenkins creek carrying out their plans even though you should delay your return for a month  come make up your mind to stay with us at least a few days  it will do you as well as me good and will send you back to banishment in a better frame of mind  redding although strongly tempted by the comforts of civilised life and the hospitality of his hostnot to mention the attractions of the plump little daughterssternly resolved not to swerve an inch from the path of what he believed to be his duty  he entertained a strong suspicion that these mcleods had penetrated into the wilderness to the neighbourhood of the cliff fort not so much for the purpose of cutting timber as for secret opposition in the furtrade of which the company he represented had for many years enjoyed almost a monopoly  his pride was touched his spirit was fired  perhaps the peaceful and secluded life he had led rendered this little opportunity of warfare more a pleasure than a pain to him  at all events the thing was not to be tolerated  the sawmill which the mcleods had an undoubted right to erect on the unoccupied lands was being planted on the very border of the companys reserve lands which they had purchased and which were clearly laid down in plans  he would see to it that these interlopers did not trespass by an inchno not by an eighth of an inchif he had power to prevent it  the fact that the mcleods were said to be resolute men made him more determined to assert his rights  he therefore declined mr gambarts invitation firmly  i will stay said he only one day to look out for a house and then return  look out for a house exclaimed the surveyor in surprise what mean you  do you think of settling down here  indeed i do replied redding with a smile  i have long been brooding over that subject  the fact is mr gambart that i am tired of solitude  i am a sociable being and find it hard to endure the society of only five or six men in a place where there are no women no children and no end of bears  i intend to leave the fur companys serviceindeed my resignation is already sent inpurchase a small farm here and get  get a wife a horse a dog and a gun and settle down to enjoy yourself eh interrupted the surveyor  well i had not gone quite so much into details answered redding with a laugh but you are right in so far as settling down goes  my only fear is that it wont be easy to find a place that will at once suit my fancy and my purse  the small sum of money left me by my father at his death two years ago will not purchase a very extensive place but  i know the very thing to suit you interrupted the surveyor with emphasis a splendid little cottagequite a mansion in miniaturewith garden fences fields outhouses etcetera all complete and going literally for an old song  come well go visit it by the pale moonlight just now return to have tea with the ladies and tomorrow well go see it by daylight  it is close at hand the name is loch dhu and it has only one objection  what may that be asked redding much amused at the abrupt little mans energy  wont tell you till youve seen it come  without more ado they sallied forth and walked along the snowy track that led to the cottage in question  a few minutes sufficed to bring them to it and the first glance showed the furtrader that his friend had not exaggerated the beauty of the place  the cottage although small was so elegant in form and so tastefully planned in every respect that it well deserved the title of a mansion in miniature  it stood on a rising ground which was crowned with trees and the garden in front the summerhouse the porch the trelliswork fence the creepers the flowerbedseverything in fact told that it had been laid out and planned by a refined mind  of course redding had to call in the aid of his imagination a little for at the moment when he first beheld it the whole scene was robed in a mantle of snow  close to the house and in sight of the front windows was a small lake or pond by the side of which rose an abrupt precipice of about fifty feet in height  beyond this a little to the right lay the undulating fields of the settlement dotted with clumps of trees and clusters of cottages  most beautiful exclaimed the furtrader but why named loch dhu which if i mistake not is the gaelic for black lake  because that little pond answered the surveyor when freed from its wintry coat looks dark and deep even at midday under the shadow of that beetling cliff  truly i like it well said redding as he turned again to look at the cottage are you its architect  i am answered mr gambart but a greater mind than mine guided my pencil in the process of its creation  indeed and what is the objection to it that you spoke of  that replied the surveyor with a mysterious look i must on second thoughts decline to tell you  how then can you expect me to buy the place demanded redding in surprise  why because i a disinterested friend strongly recommend you to do so  you believe in me  well i tell you that there is no objection to the place but one and that one wont prove to be an objection in the long run though it is one just now  the price is as you know ridiculously small first because the family who owned it have been compelled by reverses of fortune to part with it and are in urgent need of ready cash and secondly because few people have yet found out the beauties of this paradise which will one day become a very important district of canada  humph well i believe in your friendship and to some extent in your wisdom though i doubt your capacity to prophesy said redding however if you wont tell me the objection i must rest content tomorrow we will look at it in daylight and if i then see no objections to it myself ill buy it  the morrow came  in the blaze of the orb of day loch dhu looked more beautiful than it did by moonlight  after a thorough examination of house and grounds the furtrader resolved to purchase it and commissioned his plump little friend to carry out the transaction thereafter he and his man retraced their steps to the wilderness still breathing unutterable things against the entire clan of mcleod    chapter four  pioneering  we turn now to the enemythe mcleods  the father and his two sons sat in a rude shanty on a bench and an empty keg drinking tea out of tin cans  they were all stalwart darkhaired gravevisaged mountaineers of scotland  unitedly they would have measured at least eighteen feet of humanity  the only difference between the father and the sons was that a few silver hairs mingled with the black on the head of the former and a rougher skin covered his countenance  in other respects he seemed but an elder brother  ian he said to his firstborn as he refilled his tin can with tea how many more timbers have you to prepare for the dam  six replied the son laconically  it seems to me observed kenneth the second son that if the frost holds much longer we shall be thrown idle for everything is ready now to begin the works  idle we need not be returned the father as long as there is timber to fell in the forest  we must prepare logs to be sawn as well as the mill to saw them  i cant help thinking father said ian that we did not act wisely in spending all the remainder of our cash in an order for goods from england  we should have waited to see how the mill paid before setting up a store  besides i have my doubts as to the woodcutters or other people passing this outotheway spot in sufficient numbers to make a store pay for many a day to come and even if they do people coming up the coast will have the fur companys store at the cliff fort to go to for supplies  its too late to think of these things now retorted the elder mcleod we have made the venture and must go through with it  our case shows the folly of taking the advice of a friend of whose wisdom one is not well assured  no doubt gambart meant to do us a service and fancied that he knew this coast well but it is quite plain that he was mistaken for i have no doubt now from the situation of the place that there will be little or no traffic here for a long time to come  so then we might as well have thrown the remnant of our wrecked fortunes into the sea said kenneth gravely  not quite returned the father with a smile  if we can only manage to hold on for a year or two we shall be sure to succeed for there can be no question that the tide of immigration is beginning to set in this direction but it does not flow fast and our great difficulty in the meantime will be the want of ready cash  act in haste and repent at leisure said ian  one can scarcely be said to act in haste retorted his father who is almost forced into a course of action  my chief mistake was in putting too much trust in gambart  well said kenneth rising and stretching his huge frame as he placed a hatchet on his shoulder theres nothing like a good breakfast for giving a man heart to face difficulties  ill away to work  what a pity that we may not raise some of our timbers on the other side of the creek for it is admirably adapted to our purpose  dont you think we might father  no replied the elder mcleod the other side belongs to the furtraders whose rights must be respected  ian and his father soon followed kenneth to the scene of their labours  the spot was a wild one but in many respects it was wellsuited to the purpose for which these adventurers had chosen it  the coast line at jenkins creek was precipitous  cliffs crowned with pines rose in some places perpendicularly from the shingly beach of the gulf and elsewhere the ground was very rugged  the creek itself was a mere streamlet which ran a short course from the mountains of the interior brawling down a wild gully of inconsiderable extent  near its mouth was a cascade divided by a small rock or islet  it was between this rock and the south shore that the mcleods purposed to erect their dam when the ice should have cleared away and here in the meantime the three men busied themselves in cutting and shaping the necessary timbers and forming the rougher parts of the machinery of the mill  they toiled steadily till noon and then returned to their loghut for dinner which consisted of cold pork hot tea biscuit and salt butter they were still in the midst of this meal when the door opened and a man entered carrying under his arm a pair of long snowshoes which he had just taken off  glad to see you bellew we had expected you earlier said the elder mcleod rising and shaking hands with the trapper  i would have been earlier replied bellew handing a letter to mcleod but for a redskin whom i met on the way who delayed me somewhat  he tells me something about a wreck having been seen by some of his tribe a good bit down the gulf but what between the difficulty of makin out his lingo and his stupidity or unwillingness to communicate all he knew i have found out very little about it  this only i feel pretty sure of that a wreck must have occurred and that from something he said there may perhaps be some poor fellows lying on the shore there  if so they will surely perish in such weather said mcleod and the least we can do is to go and try to rescue them  no need for you to go said the trapper i will go alone with a small supply of provisions and see whether it be true  if i find any of em alive i can make them comfortable enough for a short time and then return here for such help as may be required  youll start at once then asked mcleod  yes at once  here have something to eat first said kenneth pointing to the viands  jonas bellew accepted the invitation  at once he sat down and ate in silence heartily while the elder mcleod read the letter  have you bad news asked ian as he watched his fathers face  not exactly bad but its disappointing  this is from gambart listen    my dear mcleodi have just heard that the flourmill in this place   which you were so anxious to purchase has come unexpectedly into the   market owing to the sudden death of its owner  it is to be had cheap   tooat a very much lower figure than you offered before leaving   partridge bay  i strongly advise you to secure it without delay   this letter goes by sam smalls to bellew the trapper who will   doubtless deliver it to you  youd better send him straight back with   your reply  humph good advice this time said ian when his father ceased to read if we could only take it  tis hard to have every penny we possess locked up with such a chance before us  couldnt we borrow in the meantime from gambart himself  i will never purchase property with borrowed capital replied the elder mcleod  well it cant be helped said ian consoling himself with another slice of cold pork  now im ready to start said bellew rising and wiping his mouth with the cuff of his capote  in a few minutes the trapper on snowshoes and with a pack of provisions on his back was striding down the coast at a pace that soon left the creek far behind him  three days after this incident the trio at jenkins creek were aroused while sitting at their midday meal by the tinkle of sleighbells their sittingroom window was filled chiefly with parchment but there was one square of it filled with glass  through this as from a loophole the inmates could reconnoitre any one who approached their hut  two dogsleighs exclaimed ian turning from the loophole with a look of surprise  flora and elise cried kenneth and his father in the same breath as they started up eagerly and hastened to the door  they were right  flora jumping out of the furs of a vehicle which resembled a slipperbath and was drawn by four panting dogs ran into the hut exclaiming dear father and threw her arms round the neck of the elder mcleod who was not slow to return the embrace  elise entered with smiling face and curtsied to the young men who advanced and shook her heartily by the hand  hould their hids mister kenneth exclaimed the driver of the foremost sleigh as he sought to undo the traces of the dogs  sure theyre all alikehorses or dogs they never will lay still when theyre wanted to bad luck to em intirely  me heart is all but broke  theregit along wid ye  dont be hard on them rooney said kenneth laughing they seem to have done good service  true for ye replied rooney it wouldnt have bin aisy to git the ladies down here widout em the snow was so soft wi the thaw that it nigh tore the snowshoes off me feet an my poor legs is at laist three inches longer than whin i set out if not four  well flo said ian although i know you to be a resolute girl i didnt believe you would undertake a journey over a country without a road at such a season of the year  i knew she would come said her father patting the girls head tenderly but didnt expect her quite so soon  thats just the reason why i came said flora bustling about the room in search of a reasonably clean spot on which to deposit her fur cap and muff i wanted to take you by surprise you dear old duck  here elise take these things and put them on a bed or something of that sort if there is one in the house  i declare there is not a spot in this room that is not covered with smoke and grease  how can you be so dirty  it is high time that elise and i came to put your house in order  you neednt laugh kenneth you ought to be ashamed of yourselves  this is dinnertime i fancy  have you any to spare for us  let me seebut stay first tell me how you have been and what you have done and  please miss said the maid returning from a little sideroom there isnt a spot clean enough to put your things on  the beds are no better than the chairs and tables  oh you dirty thing said flora seating herself on her fathers knee and gazing remonstratively into his face  a quiet smile played on the dark visage of the elder mcleod as he kissed her and said  how could you expect us flo to keep things very tidy in a place like this where weve had to work hard with our axes every day and all day and no woman to help us in domestic affairs  why sometimes weve been so tired at the end of a day that instead of cleaning up we have tumbled into bed boots and all  but there is one little corner of our otherwise dirty hut which we have reserved for ladyvisitors  see here  he rose unlocked a little door in a corner of the dininghall and throwing it open disclosed to the astonished gaze of his visitors a small apartment which was a perfect marvel of cleanliness and propriety true it was a very simple and what may be styled a homemade apartment  the walls floor and ceiling were of unpainted wood but the wood was perfectly fresh and smelt pleasantly of resin  the window was preposterously small with only four squares of glass in it and it was curtained with mere calico but the calico was rosecoloured which imparted a delightfully warm glow to the room and the view from the window of pinewoods and cliffs and snowfields backed by the distant sea was magnificent  two little beds in the corner furthest from the window looked so snug that the tendency of beholders to lie down and go to sleep forthwith was only overcome by a sensation of fear lest the fairies to whom they unquestionably belonged might object  there was a rather clumsilymade chest of drawers in one corner the workmanship of kenneth a bookshelf fashioned by ian and a table with three chairs made by mcleod senior  oh how kind of you said flora to her father when she afterwards sat with him alone in this boudoir and looked round on everything with the deepest interest  well it was natural that i should get ready a comfortable place for my only flower  your only flower exclaimed flora why what do you call ian and kenneth and roderick  not flowers certainly replied her father pulling her down on his knee they may be regarded as useful vegetables if you will but they are scarcely flowers that one likes to fondle  there now sir you have fondled me enough at present so tell me all about yourself and your doings  tell me first flo how it fared with you by the way  oh that is soon told  after you left me i remained with old mrs crowder in peaceful serenity until rooney came back from quebec and then i consulted with him as to the possibility of getting down here before the close of winter  being an old norwester and an irishman he had his answer ready  sure said he theres nothin aisier  the masther bade me go down to jenkins creek wi the things as soon as possible which ornarily mains faster than yer able so i meant to be off tomorrow be daybreak on fut wid a sled behind me  but if your ladyship intinds to honour me wid yer company this is how we cud do it ill hire a sleigh an drive ye down to sam smalls hut  i know that sam has got one or two sleds and teams of dogs for like myself hes an owld norwester an likes to revive owld memories by takin a trip now an then in the owld fashion  theres no road av coorse but dogs aint like horses they dont have no need of roads so that dont matter  ill git owld bogus the injin to help  he an i can bate the tracks wid our snowshoes and the dogs ill follow kindly an so well all go down to the creek together  well continued flora this plan was carried out at once  we started next day and got on famously in the sledge  we had only one upset  it might have been an awkward one for the horse was very restive when he got off the track into the deep snow but fortunately just at the time up came two travellers one of them such a handsome man and they got us out of our difficulty  were you in danger my pet asked mcleod  not exactly in danger except the danger of having to walk at night through the forest and without snowshoes  hm not such a small danger that as you seem to think flo said mcleod gravely  however these gentlemen got you out of the scrape well go on  well on we went came to sam smalls hut slept there got two dogsledges slept at the hut of jonas bellew in boulder creek whose door we were obliged to break open for he wasnt at homeand here we are  well my pet here you are likely to remain for some time to come its not exactly as fine a residence as youve been accustomed to but there are many worse  worse exclaimed flora there couldnt be many betterin the circumstances  i regard it as a small palace  dear father she added dont let our reverses weigh so heavily on you  think of your favourite saying its an ill wind that blows no good  perhaps good may be in the wind somewhere for us  ay and ill think of one of your favourite sayings too flo every cloud has a silver lining  but ive got a better saying than that now father said flora with sudden earnestness the saying that dear mother was so fond of quoting from the bible before she died come unto me all ye that labour and are heavy laden and i will give you rest  oh father that word comforts me now for i have gone to jesus and have pleaded with him his own promise that whatever we shall ask in his name god will give it to us  bless you flo said her father tenderly and what did you ask for success in our new enterprise  no i asked for guidance in every step of it for that is certain to lead to success  do you feel sure of getting an answer to that prayer flo asked mcleod gazing at his daughter with a perplexed expression  quite sure replied flo confidently because god who cannot lie has promised  now what will you say if we fail in this enterprise asked her father  that my prayer has been answered replied flo  what if he guides us to failure will you count that an answer  yes indeed i will  more than that i will count our failure to be success for whatever god leads us to must be success if we commit our ways to him  thats a convenient doctrine replied mcleod with a slight smile as he called to remembrance several conversations he had had with infidels during his travels and no one will ever be able to refute you for whatever betide you will still be able to maintain logically that you have received an answer  just so father and why not  is not that convenient doctrine as you call it in accordance with the word of god himself who says that all things work together for good to them that love him  you have learned to talk like your dear mother flo said mcleod rising we will continue this subject another time  at present i must away to work with the boys  he left the room hastily and his daughter calling in the assistance of elise proceeded to arrange her little boudoir in a somewhat more sedate though by no means less joyful frame of mind than that in which she had made her entry into her new and unquestionably humble residence    chapter five  the enemy  meanwhile reginald reddingstill breathing defiance to the clan of mcleod with his heart steeled against all softer influences and with all his bristles erectarrived at jenkins creek  seeing no one about the door of the hut he passed it with an indignant frown and proceeded direct to the cascade where from a considerable distance he had observed the three settlers as they busily plied their axes  a thaw had set in  the little cascade was beginning to roar ominously almost savagely behind the curtain of ice which had concealed almost the whole of it during winter  the ice on the edge of the saint lawrence had already given way and was being swept out to sea in variouslysized fields and masses  everything gave indication that the reign of winter had come to an end that the shortlived spring had laid its warm hand on the whole region and that summer was not far distant summer acts its part with promptitude in those regions  men out there are usually vigorous in taking advantage of the change the mcleods were making the most of their time when the furtrader approached  it should be getting near suppertime said the elder mcleod looking at the sun  not far from it said kenneth flinging down his axe and wiping the perspiration from his brow as he glanced in the same direction what a comfort it is to have flo to look after meals it makes one feelhallo who come heresee two men rounding the cliff just above the house  the elder mcleod made no reply but waited until the strangers were sufficiently near to be addressed then touching his cap he said good evening heartily  to this reginald redding replied good evening stiffly while his man bestowed a gaze of unmistakable scorn all round  a little surprised but not much alarmed by their manner mcleod said that it was an unusual pleasure to meet with strangers in such an outoftheway place that he and his sons having finished their days work were about to return to their hut for supper and that he would be more than delighted if they would take potluck with them  redding who was by nature of a kindly sociable disposition felt rather put out by this reception especially when the invitation was pressed on him with much cordiality by kenneth as well as by ian  even the scorn on le rues lip began to melt away like the snow  but the furtrader felt that the interests of his employers were at stake besides had he not said to others had he not vowed to himself that he would not give way an inchno not so much as a hairsbreadthto these longlegged interlopers who now that he beheld them were evidently furtraders in disguisemen who made use of a socalled sawmill as a mere blind to divert attention from the real object they had in view  sir said redding with quiet dignity i am the fur companys agent in this district in charge of the cliff fort  had redding been in charge of the rock of gibraltar with its mighty armament of heavy guns he could not have assumed an air of greater importance  i am glad to hear it replied mcleod more and more perplexed by the youths manner because i have been anxious for some days to consult you as to the exact boundary line of your companys reserve  if you will accompany me to the creek replied redding pointing to the islet on which the mcleods had already marked off a portion of rock and planted a couple of stakes i will enlighten you on that point  willingly answered mcleod preparing to follow with his two sons  hah thought redding as he drew near the spot and observed the stakes not a doubt of it inches indeed they have encroached feet feetif not yards on our property  he gave no audible sound however to his thoughts until the party had reached the islet which was connected with the mainland by a plank then he turned to mcleod with the air of a man who has resolved to wage war to the knife for his rights  le rue seeing his master in this mood drew himself up compressed his lips and darkened his frown  the line of demarcation said redding slowly but with much decision of tone and manner runs exactly down the centre of this stream and cuts precisely across the centre of this rock  now sir he turned abruptly here to look his adversary full in the face  in doing so his vision passing over the shoulders of his enemy encountered the bright face and astonished gaze of flora mcleod who had just come to let her father and brothers know that their evening meal awaited them  reginald redding was struck dumb  glancing round to see what had fascinated the gaze of the furtrader mcleod turned with a smile and said  my daughter flora misterahi beg pardonyour name is i think  redding murmured the furtrader with hesitation for he had begun to doubt his own identity  just so  flo has come to tell us mr redding that supper is ready so if you will condescend to accept of our rough and ready hospitality we shall be delighted  but before going pray let us finish this matter  you were about to say  oh nothingnothing worth mentioning said redding hurriedly endeavouring to recover himself i merelythe fact isthata rock like this is soso utterly insignificant that the idea of trespassing on it is quite absurd quite out ofwhy surely i cannot be mistaken he added lifting his cap this must be the young lady whom i had the pleasure of meeting on the road hither at a time when  when your presence and aid were most opportune interrupted flora as she held out her hand with a gracious smile and a blush  why flora blushed is best known to herself  the same may be said in regard to the fact that reginald redding felt rather awkwardthough not naturally an awkward manand looked rather sheepish as he took the hand timidly  it is also worthy of record that the touch of floras hand sent a galvanic stream up reddings arm which curled round his head ran down his spine and passed out into the rock at the extremities of his ten toes  indeed exclaimed mcleod senior while a peculiar expression crossed his swarthy countenance as if a new idea had hit him then mr redding i am your debtor but come let us to supper before it cools i suppose that no more need be said about the boundary line  i have not been guilty of trespassing it seems on your companys reserves  not in the least answered the furtrader promptly with a glance at his man  vraiment non cernly not exclaimed le rue emphatically not a trace of scorn being now visible on his benign countenance  matters being thus amicably disposed of the party adjourned to the hut where they sat down to a substantial repast the foundation of which was boiled bacon and tea the superstructure biscuits and butter  here francois le rue met with a profound disappointment  he had rightly judged that where the mistress dwelt the maid must necessarily abide accordingly on entering the hut he had the extreme satisfaction of obtaining a glance of grateful recognition from elises bright eyes but the sanguine trader had also counted on the pleasure of her company at supper in the kitchen of the establishment while his master should sup with the mcleods in the parlour  in this he was mistaken  in such an outoftheway region the young canadian girl was counted as much a companion as a servant and while she performed the duties of attendant at the table in the hall she also sat modestly down at the same table to partake of the evening meal  francois on the other hand was told to go to the kitchen and make himself comfortable  the kitchen was a little outhouse not unlike a gigantic dogkennel separated by a space of six feet or so from the principal dwelling  opening its door le rue entered with a heavy heart supposing that he should have to eat his supper in dreary solitude not dat i cares moch for dat thought he as he raised the latch for is accostomed to solitairness but ah ven i tinks of  hooroo shouted a gruff voice scattering at once his thoughts and his solitairness  le rue started as he encountered the surprised gaze of a man but being in a crusty humour he only exclaimedhah and returned the gaze  sure its you or yer ghost exclaimed the identical driver whom the two furtraders had so lately assisted out of difficulties  give us yer fist young man  ah then its good luck is yer portion rooney didnt i think to sit down to me supper in solitood whin in comes like a vision the frind as was a frind indade to me and the ladies the other day  come in come in sit ye down there an ait till yer fit to bust och but its mesilf is glad this night  there putt off yer capote if yer at all like me yell not be fit to taste a morsel till yer in yer shirt sleeves  howldill hang it on the peg for ee  now thin go to work  dont spare it  faix theres plinty more where that came from though there aint much variety here  its pig for breakfast pig for dinner an pig for supperwid a slice o cowld pig at odd times whin yer extra hungry  an then yell have to pigin wid myself at night for theres only wan bed in this coolinairy mansion not bein room to howld more  thats yer sortthe taes hot anyhow  there was no withstanding such a welcome as this  francois le rue thawed instantly and thereafter warmed up to intense cordiality while he plied his knife and fork on the pig and quaffed the steaming tae talking between mouthfuls as his voluble friend gave him opportunity  an abrupt check however was put to the pleasant flow of his spirits when rooney having occasion to refer to the ladies remarked in an enthusiastic tone that elise was a angelnothin more nor lessonly widout wings  the demon jealousy instantly fired the soul of the canadian  vat you knows about she he demanded with suppressed emotion  knows about her exclaimed rooney with increased enthusiasm while le rues spirit dilated with increasing jealousy what do i not know about her is the question  sure ive knowed her iver since she was a purty little curlyhided child ive knowed her goodness to her parients till the day of their death an her gentleness in the time of sorrow an her jollity in the time of joy an her faithfulness to her mistress in adversity an her ginral goodness at all times blissins on her  francois ceased devouring pig and played with his knife while he mentally almost unconsciously measured the number of inches that lay between the outside of rooneys chest and the core of his heart  youse verai fond of her it seems he said with deep sarcasm  thats just what i am replied rooney stuffing an enormous piece of bacon into his no less enormous mouth  its raison i have too he added thickly but quite audibly for she nursed my poor wife through a long illness an its my belaif she wouldnt ha bin alive this day but for the care and attintion she got from elise  the demon fled horrified out at the keyholethe window being shutand le rue feeling the deepest regard for rooney relieved his feelings with a sigh and more pig  while the irishman and canadian were entertaining each other thus in the kitchen the highlanders and englishman were no less cordial and busy in the hall  rough and ready the hospitality indeed was for the board was not only uncovered but unplaned and the dishes were cracked and dintedaccording to their nature but the heartiness of the welcome the solidity of the simple viands the strength of appetite and above all the presence of bright eyes and gentle spirits threw a luxurious halo round the humble apartment in the light of which reginald redding revelled  teathe cup which cheers but does not inebriatewas used at that board as if it had been brandy and water  the men not only drank it during the progress of the meal but afterwards sat long over it and dallied with it and urged each other to have some more of it and quaffed it to the health of absent friends and told stories and cut jokes and sang songs over it and replenished it with hot water to such an extent that it gradually changed its nature and became that harmless beverage loved by frenchmen eau sucre  that it cheered was evident for laughter was often loud and sometimes long  that it did not inebriate was equally clear for the talk of the party was frequently grave as well as gay  it was especially grave when towards the end of the evening mcleod senior in answer to some allusion of his guest as to the beauties of partridge bay became confidential and told how he had once dwelt in that settlement for many years in a happy home which he had specially built for himself or rather as he said with a kindly glance at his pretty daughter which he had built specially for his wife and child how it had pleased god to take from him his dear partner before they had been long in the new house how the failure of a friend had involved him in ruin and compelled him to sell off all he had possessed and begin life anew with the scanty remnants of his fortune how he had taken the advice of another friend and come to jenkins creek to set up a sawmill having previously invested nearly all his funds in an order for goods from england for the purpose of setting up a general store as it was highly probable the country would go on prospering and the demand for such a store become great how he had had letters from his youngest son rodericka lad of nineteen who had been educated in the old countrytelling him that the goods had been bought and shipped in the betsy of plymouth and how that he roderick intended to take passage in the same ship the week following and join his father and brothers in their new sphere of labour how that sometimes he felt depressed by the sudden reverse of fortune but was always cheered and raised up again by his daughter flo who had a wonderful waysomewhat like her motherof inducing him when things looked darkest to turn his eyes to the source of all light and comfort and hope and prosperity  you may be sure that reginald redding listened to all this with the deepest interest and sympathy for as he glanced at floras speaking countenanceand he did glance at it pretty frequentlyhe observed new beauty in her expression and bright teardrops in her eyes  ah flo said her father when he had finished no one has such good cause to regret the loss of our old home as yourself for i dont think mr gambart could have planned it without your aid  what exclaimed redding with a look of sudden surprise what was the name of your place in partridge bay  i gave it a highland name said mcleod with a sad smile after a place in scotland that once belonged to my mothers familyloch dhu  for a moment or two the young furtrader remained speechless  he looked first at flora and then at her father and after that at her brothers without being able to make up his mind how to act  he now understood the reason of gambarts silence as to the former owners of loch dhu and he would have given worlds at that moment if he had never seen or heard of the place for it seemed such a heartless position to be placed in the fortunate owner of the lovely spot over the loss of which flora and her family evidently mourned so deeply  he could not bear the thought of having to reveal the truth still less could he bear the thought of concealing it  he was therefore about to make the disagreeable confession when the thoughts of the whole party were suddenly diverted to another channel by the opening of the door and the entrance of one of those gaunt sons of the forest who were wont to hang on the skirts of civilisation as it advanced to wrest from them their native wilderness  the indian stalked into the room handed a dirty piece of folded paper to mcleod and sat down beside the fire after the fashion of his race in solemn silence    chapter six  out in the snow  when jonas bellew set off in search of the rumoured wreck as related in a previous chapter he passed the cliff fort without calling there partly because he did not wish to waste time and partly because he had no desire to hold converse at that time with mr smart who he rightly suspected must have shared in reddings suspicions as to the intentions of the mcleods  making a straight cut therefore across the bay in front of the furtrading establishment on ice that had not yet been floated away he gained the land below the fort and continued his journey down the coast that night he slept in the snow  let not the reader entertain the mistaken idea that such a sleepingplace was either cold wet or uncomfortable  it was the reverse of all that being warm dry and cosy  the making of this bed we record here for the benefit of housemaids and all whom it may concern  first of all the sturdy trapper walked along the coast sometimes on snowshoes when fields of snowcovered ice projected out to sea at other times on foot with the snowshoes slung over his back when long stretches of sand or shingly beach from which the ice had been swept away presented themselves  this process of progression he continued till night began to close upon him  then he bethought him of encamping and retired to the neighbouring woods for the purpose  the woods referred to consisted chiefly of pines which fringed the base of the precipitous hills by which that part of the gulf of saint lawrence is bordered  here he selected the largest tree he could find and threw down his bundle of food and blankets under the flat spreading branches thereof  resting one of his snowshoes against the stem of the tree he proceeded to dig a huge hole in the snow using his other snowshoe as a shovel  the operation cost him much labour for he had to dig completely down to the ground and the snow in the woods was still between three and four feet deep  when a hole of ten feet long by five broad was thus cleared to the bottom the natural walls were raised by the snow thrown out to a total height of about six feet  this was bellews bedchamber  the spreading pinebranches overhead were its admirable roof  next the trapper cut down a young pine with the tender branches of which he covered the floor of his chamber to a depth of ten or twelve inches  this was his mattress and a soft warm elastic one it was as the writer of this narrative can testify from personal experience  the head of the mattress rested against the stem of the pine tree and a convenient root thereof served bellew for a pillow  at the foot of the bed he had left the floor of his chamber uncovered this was his fireplace and in the course of ten minutes or so he cut down and chopped into billets enough of dry wood to fill it with materials for a splendid fire  these being arranged with a core of dry moss and broken twigs in the centre the patient man struck a light by means of flint steel and tinder and applied it  while the first few tongues of fire were crackling in the core of moss he spread a thick blanket on his bed and then stood up leisurely to fill his pipe and dreamily to watch the kindling of the fire  and this was a sight worth watching for the change in the aspect of affairs was little short of miraculous  before the flames shot forth jonas bellew looking over the edge of a black hole that was disagreeably suggestive of a tomb could dimly perceive a stretch of cold grey ghostly forest through the openings of which hummocks of ice could be seen floating away over the black waters of the sea  the little starlight that prevailed only served to render darkness visible and thus to increase the desolate aspect of the scene  but when the ruddy flames began to shoot forth and tip with a warm glow the nearest projections they brought out in startling prominence the point of bellews nose and the bowl of his little pipe  continuing to gain strength they seemed to weaken the force of distant objects in proportion as they intensified those that were near  the pale woods and dark waters outside deepened into invisible black while the snowwalls of bellews chamber glowed as if on fire and sparkled as if set with diamonds  the tree stem became a ruddy column with bellews shadow lying black as ink against it and the branches above became like a redhot roof  it may perhaps be supposed that the snowwalls melted under this ordeal nothing of the sort  their tendency to do so was checked effectually not only by a sharp frost but by the solid backing of snow behind them and the little that did give way in close proximity to the fire ran unobtrusively down to the earth and crept away under the snow towards the sea for bellew had made his camp with the fire at its lower end so that not a drop of water could by any means reach the spot whereon he lay  having stuffed his little tin can or kettle with snow he put this on the fire to melt and then spread out his bacon and biscuit and sugar and tea all of which being in course of time prepared he sat down to enjoy himself and felt as well as looked supremely happy  then jonas bellew went on his knees and prayedfor he was one of those men who do not think it unmanly to remember the giver of all that they enjoyand thereafter he rolled himself in his blanket pillowed his head on the treeroot and sank into profound reposesuch repose as is known only to healthy infants and hardworking men and women  little by little the fire burnt low the ruddy lights grew dim the pale lights reappeared and the encampment resumed its tomblike appearance until the break of another day gave it a new aspect and caused jonas bellew to rise yawn shake the hoarfrost from his blanket pack up his traps and resume his journey    chapter seven  a sad discovery  a wreck on a rocky shore is at all times a dreary sight but especially so when the shore is that of an uninhabited land and when the rocks as well as the wreck are fringed with snowwreaths and cumbered with ice  some such thoughts probably filled the mind of the trapper when on the afternoon of the day whose dawn we have mentioned he stood beside the wreck of what had once been a fullrigged ship and gazed intently on the scene of desolation  life and death were powerfully suggested to him  many a time had he seen such a craft breasting the waves of the broad saint lawrence when every dip of the bow every bend of the taper masts every rattle of the ropes and every mellow shout of the seamen told of vigorous life and energy and now the broken masts and yards tipped and fringed with snowwreaths the shattered stern out of which the cargo had been evidently washed long ago the decks crushed down with snow the bulged sides the bottom pierced by rocks the bowsprit burst to shivers by the opposing cliff the pendant and motionless cordage even the slight ripple of the sleeping sea which deepened rather than broke the prevailing silence all told eloquently of deathdeath perchance to passengers and crew at all events to sanguine hopes and prospects nevertheless there was much life connected with that deathlike scene as the sequel of our tale will show  the trapper although fond of moralising was not prone to indulge in sentiment when circumstances called him to action  he had come suddenly in sight of the wreck on turning the point of the frowning cliff where the gallant ship had met her doom and stood only for a few seconds to gaze sadly on the scene  hastening forward he proceeded at once to make a thorough survey of the vessel  first he went to the stern to ascertain if possible her name  the greater part of the stern had as we have said been torn away but after careful search he discovered a piece of wood on which he could plainly trace portions of the letters b and e and t  the remainder of the word whatever it was had been completely erased  bellew did not at first climb on board the ship because from her general aspect he knew full well that there could be no survivor in her besides through the yawning stern he could see nearly the whole of the interior  his next step was to search the neighbourhood for tracks in order to see whether or not the wreck had been lately visited by human beings this search resulted in discoveries which perplexed him greatly for not only did he find numerous footprints which crossed each other in various directions but he knew from their appearance that these had been recently made and that they were those of white men as well as red some of them showing the prints of shoes while others displayed the marks of moccasins  had bellew discovered one or two tracks made by men of the forest like himself his knowledge of woodcraft would have enabled him at once to decide which way they had come and whither they had gone but with at least a dozen meandering tracks radiating from the ship in all directions as well towards the sea as the land he felt himself puzzled  he knew well enough that they were too fresh to be those of the wrecked crew unless indeed the crew had remained by the ship but in that case there would have been evidences of an encampment of some sort such as fittingsup on board or huts on shore  he followed the tracks that led to the sea and found that they terminated abruptly as if those who had made them had plunged into the water and drowned themselves  before following up those that went landward he returned to the ship and clambered on board but found nothing to reward him for his pains  the sea had swept the hold fore and aft so completely that nothing whatever was left  these investigations did not take up much time  the trapper after one or two circuits found the spot where the footsteps became disentangled from the maze of individual tracks and led not along the shore as he had supposed they would but up into a narrow gorge and now he learned that the tracks of what appeared a multitude of people had been made by the running to and fro of not more than a dozen men six of whom were natives  thinking it probable that the party could not be far distant for the gorge up which they had proceeded seemed of very limited extent the trapper pushed forward with increasing expectation not unmingled with anxiety  turning the point of a projecting cliff he came suddenly on a sight that filled him with sadness  it was the mouldering remains of a human beingone who had been a seaman to judge from the garments which covered him  one glance sufficed to show the trapper that his services there were not required  he also observed that the fresh tracks which he had been following circled round the body of the seaman and then led straight on  following these bellew soon came to an open circular space at the head of the gorge where the appearance of smoke rising from among the trees arrested his attention  in a few minutes he had reached the spot whence it issued and there to his surprise found mr bob smart with five of his men and several indians standing in solemn silence round something on the ground that appeared to rivet their attention  some of the men looked up as bellew approached and nodded to him for the trapper was wellknown in the district they also moved aside and let him pass  whats wrong mr smart he asked on coming up  the furtrader pointed to the ground on which lay a group of men who at a first glance appeared to be dying  one in particular a youth seemed to be in the very last stage of exhaustion  smart had just risen from his side after administering a cup of hot tea when the trapper appeared  i fear he wont last long said smart turning to bellew with a shake of his head  what have you been givin him asked bellew stooping and feeling his pulse  just a cup of tea replied smart i have unfortunately nothing better  we only heard of the wreck yesterday and came down in our boat in such haste that we forgot spirits  besides i counted on bringing whoever i should find up to the fort without delay but although we may move most of these poor fellows i doubt much that we darent move him  this was said in a whisper for the poor fellows referred to although unable to rise lay listening eagerly to every word that was spoken there were six of themone a negroall terribly emaciated and more or less badly frostbitten  they formed the remnant of a crew of twentyfive many of whom after suffering dreadfully from hunger and frostbites had wandered away into the woods and in a half delirious state had perished  you have hot water i see said the trapper hastily unfastening his pack fetch some  bob smart promptly and gladly obeyed for he saw that bellew was a man of action and appeared to know what to do  youre right mr smart said bellew as he poured a little of the contents of a bottle into the tin pannikin that had served him for a teacup the night before this poor lad couldnt stand moving just now fortunately ive brought some spirits with me  it will start fresh life in him if hes not too far gone already  here sir he continued in a louder tone let me put this to your lips  the youth opened a pair of brilliant black eyes and gazed earnestly at the speaker then smiled faintly and sipped the offered beverage  as might have been expected he at once revived a little under its influence  there thats enough just now it dont do to take much at a time ill give ee somethin else in a minute said bellew as he went from one to another and administered a teaspoonful or two to each  they were very grateful and said so in words more or less emphatic one of them indeed who appeared to have once been a jovial seaman intimated that he would be glad to take as many more teaspoonfuls of that same as bellew chose to administer but the trapper paying no attention to the suggestion proceeded to open his store of provisions and to concoct in his tin teakettle a species of thin soup  while this was simmering he began to remove the blankets with which bob smart had covered the unfortunate men  dont you think said bob that it would be well to leave their wraps alone till we get them up to the fort  theyre badly bitten and i know little about dressing sores  by the time we get there mr redding will probably have returned from partridge bay and hes more than half a a doctor i believe  nevertheless ill have a look said bellew with a smile for im a bit of a doctor myself in such mattersabout a quarter of one if i may say so  without further parley the trapper laid bare their sores and truly the sad sight fully justified smarts remark that the poor fellows were badly bitten  one of them the seaman above referred to whom his comrades styled ned had only lost the ends of one or two toes and the forefinger of his left hand but some of the others had been so severely frostbitten in their feet that all the toes were rotting off the negro in particular had lost his left foot while the heelbone of the other was exposed to the extent of nearly an inch and all the toes were gone we describe here from memory what we have actually seen  in perfect silence but with a despatch that would have done credit to hospital training the trapper removed the dead flesh dressed the sores applied poultices of certain herbs gathered in the woods and bandaged them up  this done he served out the thin soup with another small allowance of spirits and hot water after which with the able assistance of bob smart and his men he wrapped them up in their blankets and made arrangements for having them conveyed to the boat which had been pulled into a convenient creek further down the shore than the wreck  strange to say the youth who appeared to be dying was the least injured by frostbites of the party his fingers and face being untouched and only a portion of the skin of his feet damaged but this was explained by the seaman ned who on hearing bellews expression of surprise said with a touch of feeling  its not the frost as damaged him sir its the water an the rocks wen we was wrecked sirnow three weeks ago or therebywed ableeged to send a hawser ashore an not one of us could swim from the capn to the cabinboy so mister mcleod he wolunteered to  mister who demanded bellew hastily  mister mcleod  what was your ships name  the betsy sir  from what port  plymouth  ho ho well go on  well as i was asayin sir mister mcleod whos as bold as a lion he wolunteered to swim ashore wi a line an swim he did though the sea was rollin in on the cliffs like the falls o niagerywhich im told lie somewhere in these latitudesleastwise theyre putt down in all the charts so  we tried for to dissuade him at first but when the starn o the ship was tore away and the cargo began to wash out we all saw that it was neck or nothin so we let him go  for a time he swam like a good un but when hed bin dashed agin the cliffs two or three times an washed back again among the wreck of spars cargo and riggin we thought it was all over with all of us  howsever we wasnt forsooken at the eleventh hour for a wave all of a sudden washed him high and dry on a ledge of rock an he stood up and waved his hand and then fell down in a swound  then we thought again it was all up with us for every wave went roarin up to young mister mcleod as if it wor mad to lose him and one or two of em even sent the foam washin in about his legs  well sir the last one that did that seemed to bring him to for as it washed over his face he jumped up and held on to the rocks like a limpet  then he got a little higher on the cliff and when we saw he was looking out to us we made signs to him that a hawser was made fast to the line an all ready  he understood us an began to haul away on the line but we could see that he had bin badly hurt from the way he stopped from time to time to git breath and rested his head on a big rock that rose at his side like a great capstan  howsever he got the hawser ashore at last an made it fast round the big rock an so by means of that an the blessin o providence we all got ashore praps added ned thoughtfully it might have bin as well if some of us hadnthowsever we wasnt to know that at the time you understand sir  it must not be supposed that ned said all this in the hearty tones that were peculiar to his former self  the poor fellow could only utter it sentence by sentence in a weak voice which was strengthened occasionally by a sip from that same beverage which had first awakened his admiration  meanwhile the object of his remarks had fallen asleep  now mister smart said bellew taking the furtrader aside from all that i have heard and seen it is clear to me that this wreck is the vessel in which the mcleods of jenkins creek had shipped their property from england and that this youth is roderick the youngest son of the family  ive bin helping the mcleods of late with their noo sawmill and ive heard the father talking sometimes with his sons about the betsy of plymouth and their brother roderick  at another time bob smart would not have been at all sorry to hear that the interloping mcleods had lost all their property but now he was filled with pity and asked jonas bellew with much anxiety what he thought was best to be done  the best thing to do said bellew is to carry these men to the boat and have them up to the cliff fort without delay  well set about it at once  youll go with us i suppose  no ill remain behind and take care of young mcleod  in his present state it would likely cost him his life to move him  then ill leave some of my men with you  not needful replied the trapper you know im used to bein alone an managin things for myself  after you get them up you may send down a couple of men with some provisions and their hatchets  for tonight i can make the poor fellow all snug with the tarpaulin of your boat  in accordance with these plans the shipwrecked men were sent up to the cliff fort  roderick mcleod was sheltered under a tarpaulin tent and carefully tended by bellew and one of smarts most active indians was despatched with a pencilnote to jenkins creek  it was this note which interrupted the conversation between reginald redding and the elder mcleod at a somewhat critical moment and this note as the reader may easily believe threw the whole establishment into sudden consternation    chapter eight  shifting winds  immediately on receipt of the note referred to vigorous preparations were made to convey relief to roderick mcleod  such provisions as the party at jenkins creek could muster were packed into the smallest possible space because the boat or cobble which was to convey them down the gulf was very smallscarcely large enough to hold the party which meant to embark in it  this party consisted of mcleod senior kenneth and flora it being arranged that ian and rooney should remain to prosecute as well as to guard the works at the creek  seeing that there was so little room to spare in the boat reginald redding decided to hasten down on foot to the cliff fort in order to see to the comfort of the wrecked men who had been sent there  he however offered the rescue party the services of his man le rue an offer which was accepted all the more readily that the canadian possessed some knowledge of the coast  it was very dark when they started but fortunately calm  mcleod had resolved to travel night and day if the weather permitted until he should reach the scene of the wreck and to take snatches of rest if possible in the boat  there were only two oars in the boat so that one of its crew was always idle  this however proved to be rather an advantage for by affording frequent relief to each rower it saved the strength of all and at the same time enabled them to relieve the tedium of the journey to poor flora  at first they proceeded along under the deep shade of the ghostlike cliffs in unbroken silence the mind of each no doubt being busy with the wreck of their last remnant of fortune as well as with the dangerous condition in which the youthful roderick lay but as the dawn of day approached they began to talk a little and when the sun arose its gladdening beams appeared to carry hope to each breast inducing an almost cheerful state of mind  in the case of francois le rue the influence of sunshine was so powerful that a feeling of sympathy and respect for the mcleods in the calamity which had overtaken them alone restrained him from breaking out into song  father said flora as her sire wearied by a long spell at the bow oar resigned his seat to kenneth and sat down beside her that glorious light brings to my remembrance a very sweet verse weeping may endure for a night but joy cometh in the morning  true true flo returned her father i wish i had the simple faith that you seem to possess but i havent so theres no use in pretending to it  this he added bitterly seems only a pure and unmitigated disaster  the last remnant of my fortune is wrecked i am utterly ruined and my poor boy is perhaps dying  flora did not reply  she felt that in his present state of mind nothing she could say would comfort him  at that moment le rue suddenly roused himself and suggested that it was about time to think of breakfast  as all the party were of the same mind the boat was allowed to drift down the gulf with the tide while the pork and biscuitbags were opened  little time was allowed for the meal nevertheless the mercurial canadian managed between mouthfuls to keep up a running commentary on things in general  among other things he referred to the property which his master had just purchased in partridge bay  whereabouts is this property that you talk of asked mcleod becoming interested at the mention of partridge bay  about la tete of de village near de house of monsieur gambart  what like a place is it asked mcleod becoming suddenly much more interested  oh one place mos bootiful replied le rue with enthusiasm de house is superb de grounds splendeed et le prospect magnifique wid plenty of duckperhaps sometimes goose vild vonsin von lac near cliff immense  at the mention of the lake and the cliff mcleods brow darkened and he glanced at flora who met his glance with a look of surprise  did you happen to hear the name of the place asked mcleod  oui it vas i tink lac do or doosometing like so  the scoundrel muttered mcleod between his teeth while a gleam of wrath shot from his eyes  le rue looked at him with some surprise being uncertain as to the person referred to by this pithy remark and flora glanced at him with a look of anxiety  after a brief silence he said to flora in a low tone as though he were expressing the continuation of his thoughts to think that the fellow should thus abuse my hospitality by inducing me to speak of our fallen fortunes and of our being obliged to part with the old home we had loved so well and never to utter a word about his having bought the place  perhaps suggested flora you had not mentioned the name of the place and so it might not have occurred to him that  oh yes i did interrupted her father with increasing anger as his memory recalled the converse with redding on the preceding night i remember it well for he asked the name and i told it him  its not that i care a straw whether the old place was bought by tom dick or harry but i cant stand his having concealed the fact from me after so much i may say confidential conversation about it and our affairs generally  when i meet him again the young coxcomb shall have a piece of my mind  mcleod was as we have said an angry man and as the intelligent reader well knows angry men are apt to blind themselves and to become outrageously unreasonable  he was wrong in supposing that he did not care a straw who should have bought the old place  without perhaps admitting it to himself he had entertained a hope that the home which was intimately associated with his wife and in which some of the happiest years of his life had been spent would remain unsold until he should manage to scrape together money enough to repurchase it  if it had been sold to the proverbial tom or dick or harry he would have been bitterly disappointed the fact that it was sold to one who had as he thought deceived him while enjoying his hospitality only served as a reason for his finding relief to disappointment in indignation flora who had entertained similar hopes in regard to loch dhu shared the disappointment but not the indignation for although it did seem unaccountable that one so evidently candid and truthful as redding should conceal the actual state of matters she felt certain that there was some satisfactory explanation of the mystery and in that state of mind she determined to remain until time should throw further light on the affair  neither she nor her father happened to remember that the truth had broken on redding at the moment when the indian entered the hut at jenkins creek with the news of the wreck which created such a sudden excitement there that it banished thoughts of all other things from the minds of every one  the elder mcleod was a man of very strong and sensitive feelings so that although possessed of an amiable and kindly disposition he found it exceedingly difficult to forget injuries especially when these were unprovoked  his native generosity might have prompted him perhaps to find some excuse for the furtraders apparent want of candour or to believe that there might be some explanation of it but as it was he flung into the other scale not only the supposed injury inflicted by redding but all his weighty disappointments at the loss of his old home and of course generosity kicked the beam  acting on these feelings he turned the bow of the boat inshore without uttering a word and when her keel grated on the gravelly beach he looked somewhat sternly at le rue and said  you may jump ashore and go back to your fort  monsieur exclaimed le rue aghast with surprise  jump ashore repeated mcleod with a steady quiet look of impassibility  go tell your master that i do not require further assistance from him  the canadian felt that mcleods look and tone admitted of neither question nor delay  his surprise therefore gave way to a burst of indignation  he leaped ashore with a degree of energy that sent the little boat violently off the beach and the shingles spurted from his heels as he strode into the forest renewing his vows of vengeance against his late friends and old enemies de macklodds    chapter nine  surmisings disagreements vexations and botherations  great was the amazement and perplexity of reginald redding when his faithful cook returned to the cliff fort bearing the elder mcleods message  at first he jumped to the conclusion that mcleod had observed his affection for flora and meant thus to give him a broad hint that his addresses were not agreeable  being like mcleod an angry man he too became somewhat blind  all his pride and indignation were aroused the more he brooded over the subject however the more he came to see that this could not be the cause of mcleods behaviour  he was terribly perplexed and finally after several days he determined to go down to the scene of the wreck and demand an explanation  it is the proper course to follow he muttered to himself one day after breakfast while brooding alone over the remnants of the meal for it would be unjust to allow myself to lie under a false imputation and it would be equally unjust to allow the mcleods to remain under a false impression  perhaps some enemy may have put them against me anyhow i shall go down and try to clear the matter up  if i succeed well  if not  his thoughts were diverted at this point by the entrance of bob smart that energetic individual had been to visit the frostbitten seamen for whose comfort an old outhouse had been made weathertight and fitted up as a roughandready hospital  theyre all getting on famously said bob rubbing his hands as he sat down and pulled out the little black pipe to which he was so much addicted  greens left little toe looks beautiful this morning quite red and healthy and i think wont require amputation which is well for it is doubly a left little toe since you cut off the right one yesterday  his big toe seems to my amateur eye in a thoroughly convalescent state but his left middle finger obviously requires removal  youll do it today i suppose  yes i meant to do it yesterday answered redding with much gravity but gave it another chance  hows brixton  oh hes all right  he groans enough to make one believe hes the worst of em all but his hurts are mostly skin deep and will heal no doubt in course of time  his nose certainly looks blobby enough like an overripe plum and i rather think its that which makes him growl so horribly but after all it wont be shortened more than quarter of an inch which will be rather an advantage for it was originally too long then as to harper and jennings they are quite cheery and their appetites increasing which is the best of signs though i fear poor fellows that the first will lose a hand and the other a foot  the dressings you put on yesterday seem to have relieved them much  i wish i could say the same for the poor nigger  his foot is sure to go  its in such a state that i believe the cleverest surgeon alive couldnt save it and even if he could whats left of it would be of no use  you know i have a mechanical turn and could make him a splendid wooden leg if you will pluck up courage to cut it off  no said redding decidedly its all very well to lop off a finger or a toe with a razor but i dont think its allowable for an amateur to attempt a foot except under circumstances of extreme urgency  well it dont much matter continued bob smart drawing vigorously at the black pipe for well have an opportunity of sending them up to quebec in a week or so and in the meantime the poor fellows are very jolly considering their circumstances  that man ned wright keeps them all in good humour  although as you know he has suffered severely in hands and feet he feels himself well enough to limp about the room and act the part as he says of stooard and cook to the ships company he insisted on beginning last night just after you left and i found him hard at it this morning when i went to see them  he must have been the life of the ship before she went ashore for he goes about continually trolling out some verses of his own composing though he has got no more idea of tune in him than the maintopmast backstay to which or something of the same kind he makes very frequent reference  here is a verse of his latest composition    ooooh its once i froze the end of my nose   on the coast of labrador sir   an i lost my smell an my taste as well   an my pipe which made me roar sir   but the traders come an think wot they done   they poked an pinched an skewered me   they cut an snipped an they carved an ripped   an they clothed an fed an cured me    chorushooroo its true   an a sailors life for me  not bad eh said bob  might be worse answered redding with the air of one whose mind is preoccupied  ive often wondered continued bob smart in a moralising tone and looking intently at the wreaths of smoke that curled from his lips as if for inspiration ive often wondered how it is that sailorsespecially british sailorsappear to possess such an enormous fund of superabundant rollicking humour insomuch that they will jest and sing sometimes in the midst of troubles and dangers that would take the spirit out of ordinary men such as you and me  bob smart said redding earnestly  yes said bob  dyou know it strikes me that i ought to go down to the wreck to see how the mcleods are getting on  o ah well to change the subject dyou know mr redding that same idea struck me some days ago for jonas bellew has left them to look after his own affairs and the indians were to go north on the 13th so the mcleods must have been living for some time on salt provisions unless they have used their guns with better success than has been reported of them  if you remember i have mentioned it to you more than once but you seemed to avoid the subject  well perhaps i did and perhaps i had my reasons for it  however i am going down now immediately after dressing the poor fellows sores will you therefore be good enough to get the small boat ready with some fresh meat and tell le rue and michel to be prepared to start in an hour or so  the day after the above conversation mcleod senior walked down to the wreck accompanied by flora  kenneth had been left in charge of the invalid whose system had received such a shock that his recovery was extremely slow and it had been deemed advisable not only to avoid but to forbid all reference to the wreck  indeed roderick himself seemed to have no desire to speak about it and although he had roused himself on the arrival of his relations he had hitherto lain in such a weak semilethargic state that it was feared his head must have received severer injury than was at first supposed  on the morning of the day in question an indian had arrived with a letter from mr gambart of partridge bay which had not tended to soothe the luckless father  it seems very unfortunate said flora in a sympathetic tone  seems unfortunate exclaimed mcleod with some asperity it is unfortunate  why what could be more so  just think of it flo  here am i without a penny of ready cash in the world and although gambart knows this as well as i do myself he writes me first that he has sold loch dhu to that fellow redding and now that he has bought barkers mill for me without my sanction  but you gave him leave to sell loch dhu suggested flora  oh yes yes of course and i told him to let it go at a low sum for i needed cash very much at the beginning of this venture at jenkins creek  but i find that our expenses are so small that i could afford to hold on for some time on the funds i have  to be sure gambart could not know that butbutwhy did the fellow go and buy that mill for me its being a great bargain and a splendid property just now are no excuse for he knew my poverty and also knew that i shall feel bound in honour to take it off his hands when i manage to scrape the sum together because of course it was done in a friendly way to oblige me no doubt he will say that theres no hurry about repayment and that he wont take interest and so forth but he had no business to buy it at all  flora made no reply to this for she saw that her father was waxing wroth under his misfortunes  her silence tended rather to increase his wrath for he was dissatisfied with himself more than with others and would have been glad even of contradiction in order that he might relieve his feelings by disputation  while this state of mind was strong upon him they reached a turn in the path that brought the wreck into view and revealed the fact that a boat lay on the beach from which three men had just landed  two of these remained by the boat while the third advanced towards the woods  floras hand tightened on her fathers arm  surely that is mr redding she said  the frown which had clouded mcleods brow instantly deepened  go he said walk slowly back towards the hut  i will overtake you in a few minutes  flora hesitated  wont you let me stay father  no my dear i wish to talk privately with reddinggo  he patted her kindly on the head and she left him with evident reluctance  goodmorning mr mcleod said redding as he approached  goodmorning replied the other stiffly without extending his hand  redding flushed but restrained himself and continued in a calm matterofcourse tone  thinking it probable that you might be in want of fresh provisions i have run down with a small supply which is at your service  thank you replied mcleod still stiffly i am not quite destitute of fresh provisions and happen to have a good supply of ammunition besides if i were starving i would not accept aid from one who has deceived me  deceived you exclaimed redding waxing indignant more at mcleods tone and manner than his words wherein have i deceived you  as he put the question his mind leaped to the line of demarcation between the properties at jenkins creek and he racked his brains hastily to discover what he could have said or done at their first interview that could have been misunderstood  mcleod was one of those men in whom anger is easily increased by the exhibition of anger in others  it was therefore in a still more offensive tone that he said  sir you deceived me by violating the laws of hospitalityby keeping silence when candour required you to speak  sir exclaimed redding still thinking of the line of demarcation and losing his temper altogether in all that has passed between us i have invariably spoken with candour and if at any time i have kept silence i consider that in so doing i have done you a favour  when two fiery men clash an explosion is the natural result  very well sir said mcleod with a look of withering contempt as i dont accept your favours i dont thank you for them so you may take yourself off as soon as you please  he waited for no reply but turned abruptly on his heel and walked away while redding with a face of scarlet strode down the beach and leaped into his boat  not a word did he utter to his astonished men beyond ordering them to pull back to the fort  apparently the rate of rowing was not fast enough to please him for in a few minutes he ordered michel to take the helm and himself seized the oar which he plied with such vigour that as michel afterwards averred the rudder had to be kept nearly hard aport all the time to prevent the boat being pulled round even though le rue was working like a steam engine and blowing like a grampus  towards the afternoon this exercise coupled with reflection cooled reginald reddings spirit while it warmed his body and at last he deemed it right to pause for the purpose of letting the men have a pipe and a mouthful of food  while they were busy refreshing themselves he leant over the stern gazed down into the water and brooded over his supposed wrongs  whether it was the clearness of the still water through which he could see the little fish and crabs floating and crawling placidly among the pebbles at the bottom or the soothing influence of the quiet afternoon or the sedative effect of a reflective condition of mind we know not but it is certain that before the pipes were smoked out he furtrader observed that his reflected visage wore a very unpleasantlooking frown insomuch that a slight smile curled his lips  the contrast between the frowning brows and the smiling lips appeared so absurd that to prevent the impropriety of becoming too suddenly goodhumoured he turned his eyes towards his men and encountered the perplexed gaze of le rue as that worthy sat with his elbows on his knees in the calm enjoyment of his pipe  redding at once resumed his frown  francois said he did you have much conversation with mcleod before he dismissed you on the way down  oui monsieur we had ver moche conversatione  can you remember what it was about  oh oui  bout amost all tings  i tell him de mos part of my histoireme fadder me moder broder sister an all dat bout vich he seem not to care von buttin  den ve convarsatione bout de furtrade an de  well well interrupted redding but what was the last thing just before he sent you off  ah let me zee  ouiit was bout youself  i tell him bout de propertyde lock doo vat you was  le rue exclaimed redding suddenly and very angrily youre a consummate ass  vraiment said le rue with a slight shrug of his shoulders i am so for remaining in de service of von goose  there was such goodhumoured impudence in the mans face as he said this that redding laughed in spite of himself  well he said your readiness to talk has at all events caused bad feeling between me and the mcleods  however it dont matter  ship your oars again and give way with a will  the men obeyed and as redding sat buried in meditation at the helm he became convinced that mcleods anger had been aroused by his silence in regard to the purchase of loch dhu for he himself had almost forgotten that the sudden entrance of the indian had checked the words which were at the moment on his lips  when he thought of this and of flora he resolved to pull back and explain matters but when he thought of mcleods tone and manner he determined to proceed to the fort  then when he thought of rodericks precarious state his mind again wavered but other thoughts and plans suggesting themselves he finally decided on returning home  that night he encamped in the woods and continued to brood over the campfire long after his men were asleep  next day he reached the cliff fort when after seeing to the welfare of the wrecked men he informed bob smart that he meant to absent himself for about a week and to leave him bob in charge  he also gave orders that no one should quit the post or furnish any assistance to the mcleods  but sir said bob smart in surprise they will be sure to starve  no fear of them replied redding kenneth is young and active and they have plenty of ammunition  if report be true returned bob neither kenneth nor any of his kin can hit a sheep at twenty yards off  bellew says they are as blind as bats with the gun  no matter  they have a boat and one of them can row back to jenkins creek for fresh meat  anyway do as i bid you and be very careful of the wrecked men  smart although fond of discussion knew how to obey  he therefore said no more but bade redding goodnight and retired to his humble couch which he was wont to say was a fine example of compensation inasmuch as the fact of its being three inches too narrow was counterbalanced by its being six inches too long    chapter ten  a friend in need  look here my love said plump little mr gambart to his plump little wife bustling into the parlour with an open letter in his hand isnt this vexatious  just listenits from mcleod    my dear gambarti take the opportunity of jonas bellew leaving me   to write a line in reply to your last which was brought on to me by   the indian  you will be sorry to learn that the betsy of plymouth   in which all my goods were embarked is lying here a total wreck and   the goods have been washed out of hernot a bale or cask saved  but   worse than that poor roderick has been badly injured in getting   ashore and now lies here unable to move  many of the poor fellows   who composed the crew have been lost and those saved are in a sad   condition  i was sorry to hear of loch dhu being sold but now that   my fortunes have been so utterly and literally wrecked it is perhaps   as well as it is  im sorry however that you bought barkers mill   for me  in the circumstances i will find it difficult to repay you   for a long time to come  now said gambart isnt this vexing  i thought it would please him so much for of course he knows that i would never press him for the money  did you tell him asked mrs gambart that in the event of his not wanting the mill you would gladly take it yourself  no i didnt think that necessary  didnt i continued the little lady pursing her little mouth didnt i advise you to do so at the time  you certainly did my dear  and did i not continued mrs gambart severely advise you further not to keep mr redding in ignorance as to who was the late owner of loch dhu for fear of mischief coming of it  yes my love answered gambart with everincreasing humility but no mischief has come of it apparently and i thought  oh yes interrupted his lady i know you thought  you always think when you shouldnt and you never think when you should  in his heart the little man repelled this accusation but thought it best in the circumstances to hold his tongue  after a moment or two the lady went on  besides you dont know that no mischief has come of it  take my advice now  write immediately to mr mcleod telling him that you only ventured to buy the mill for him because you were very anxious to secure it for yourself in the event of his not wanting it and add that in the selling of loch dhu you concealed from mr redding the name of the former owner because of an absurd fancy in your own mind which it is not worth while to mention  wont that be a sort of humiliating confession urged the little man timidly  to this the little woman replied that it was better to make a sort of humiliating confession than to admit the full extent of his unreasoning stupidity and the surveyor half agreeing with her in his own mind immediately went to his study wrote the epistle as directed and sent it off express by an indian  meanwhile the party at the wreck found themselves in the unpleasant condition of having nothing fresh to eat  as we have said the trapper had left them knowing that the furtraders and the indians were quite capable of looking after their wants  but soon afterwards the indians went away down the gulf to hunt seals and none of the mcleods being able to speak their language they could not or would not be got to understand that one of them was wanted to remain and hunt for the sick man  as mcleod had still some provisions on hand with a gun and ammunition besides his boat he did not much mind the departure of the red men at the time  as time wore on however and their fresh provisions failed he became anxious and wished that he had not so angrily declined the aid offered by the furtraders  neither father nor son had the slightest taste for field sports so that when they saw the track of an animal they found it almost impossible to follow it up with success and when by good fortune they chanced to discover a partridge or a squirrel they invariably missed it  this incapacity and a scarcity of game had at last reduced them to extremities  kenneth said his father one morning as they walked up and down beside the hut in which flora sat talking to roderick we must give up our vain attempts at hunting for it is quite plain that you and i are incapable of improvement  after that splendid shot of yours in which you only blew a bunch of feathers out of a bird that was not more than four yards from the end of your gun  that interrupted kenneth was the very cause of my missing  had it been a little further off i should certainly have killed it  but father you seem to forget the squirrels tail which is the only trophy you have to show of your prowess after blazing away right and left for two weeks  no i dont forget it lad returned his father it is because of these sad truths that i have now determined to give it up and send you with the boat for supplies to jenkins creek  of course ian cannot send to us having no boat and rooney or the indian would take too long a time to scramble through the tangled woods of this rugged part of the coast besides which all they could carry on their backs would not last more than a few days and as long as ian does not hear from us he will naturally think that all is going on well  it will take you six days to go and come but what with the little that remains of our fresh meat and a chance partridge or two we shall be able to keep roderick going till you return  hes getting stronger now and as for flo and me we can get along famously with salt pork and biscuit for so short a time  but why should i not go rather to the cliff fort asked kenneth  the store there is a public one and our buying food from the furtraders will lay us under no obligation to mr redding whom excuse me i think you have judged too hastily  it matters not how i have judged him retorted mcleod sternly  there is no occasion to go near him at all  as i have said  he stopped abruptly for at that moment an indian was seen approaching  he was a powerfullybuilt fellow with a handsome figure and face though the latter was very dark and he walked with a stoop and an awkward slouching gait  he wore his long black hair in straight elfin locks those in front having been cut across the forehead just above the eyebrows as being the simplest method of clearing the way for vision he was clad in a very dirty soiled huntingshirt and leggings of leather with moccasins of the same and carried a long gun on his shoulder  mcleod also observed with much satisfaction that several partridges hung by their necks from the belt which encircled his waist  of course the meeting that ensued was conducted in pantomime with a few useless remarks in english from kenneth who appeared to entertain an idea which is not uncommon among sailors namely that a man who knows nothing whatever of the language is more likely to understand bad than good english  where you come from he asked after shaking hands with the indian and giving him the salutation watchee  what cheer which he understood and returned  a shake of the head was the reply  where you gogo said kenneth in the hope apparently that emphasis might awaken intelligence  again the indian shook his head  whats the use of asking him said mcleod senior  see here is a language that is understood by all men  he pulled a powder flask from his pocket and shaking it at the ear of the savage offered it to him at the same time pointing to the partridges and to his own open mouth  this pantomime was evidently comprehensible for the man at once threw the birds at mcleods feet and taking the flask emptied its contents into his own powderhorn  good said mcleod picking up the birds  now kenneth if we can prevail on this redskin to remain by us it wont be necessary to send you to jenkins creek  as he spoke flora issued from the opening of the tarpaulin tent exclaimingfather ive just  on seeing the red man she stopped and gazed at him with much interest the native returned the gaze and for one moment a gleam of admiration lighted up his swarthy countenance but it passed like a flash of light and left that stoical look of impassibility so common to the men of the american wilderness  what were you about to say flo asked her father  that ive just learned a piece of good news from roderick  he seemed inclined to talk about the wreck this morning  seeing him so much better i gave him encouragement and he has just told me that before leaving england he had taken the advice of a friend and insured the whole of our goods that were shipped in the betsy  thats good news indeed flo better than i deserve after my unbelieving remarks about the efficacy of prayer  and here is good news for you of another kind he added holding up one of the partridges fresh meat for roderick and a hunter who looks as if he could keep us well supplied if we can only prevail on him to stay with us  try what you can do flo if he has a spark of gallantry in him he will be sure to understand what you say to him but it must be in the language of signs flo for he evidently understands no english  thus appealed to flora advanced to the indian and taking him somewhat timidly by the sleeve led him to the opening of the tent and pointed to the sick man then to the cleanscraped bones of the last rabbit he had eaten after which she pointed to the game just purchased touched the indians gun and making a sweep with her hand towards the forest looked him full in the face  the indian allowed the faintest possible smile to curl his lips for a moment and then with a slight inclination of his head but without uttering a word turned abruptly and went off at a long swinging pace into the woods  pon my word flo said mcleod your pantomime has been most effective but i have doubts as to whether he understands you to have invited him to be our hunter or commanded him to go about his business  i think weve seen the last of him said kenneth somewhat gloomily  he will return said flora with decision  well time will show rejoined mcleod meanwhile we will delay the trip to jenkins creek for a day and ill go have a talk with roderick about that lucky insurance business  time did settle the matter of the indians intentions almost sooner than had been expected for that same evening he returned with a further supply of fresh meat and laid it down at floras feet  nothing however would prevail on him to remain and sup with the party  having received a small supply of powder and shot in payment he at once turned away and reentered his native wilderness  thus day by day for about a week the silent man made his appearance every evening with fresh supplies and we might almost say disappeared after delivering them  one day kenneth determined to offer to accompany him on his next appearance  accordingly he prepared his gun rolled up his blanket and strapped it on his shoulders and when the indian arrived in the evening as usual he presented himself equipped for the chase  the indian expressed some surprise in his looks and at first seemed to object to kenneths companionship but at length gave in and they entered the forest together  it seemed at first as if the red man wished to test the physical powers of his white brother for he led him over hill and dale through swamp and brake during the greater part of that night  fortunately there was bright moonlight  but kenneth was stout of frame and enduring in spirit he proved to be quite a match for the redskin  at last they encamped under a tall pine and after a hearty supper sat staring at each other and smoking in silence until sleep induced them to lie down  next morning by daybreak kenneth was roused by his companion who after a hasty meal led him another long march through a wild but beautiful country where several partridges and rabbits were shot by the indian and a great many more were missed by kenneth much to the amusement of his companion  towards evening the red man turned his steps in the direction of the tarpaulin tent    chapter eleven  an adventure and a surprise  that evening the elder mcleod and flora had adventure which nearly cost them their lives  as the sun began to descend roderick who was recovering fast under the influence of goodcheer and good nursing begged flora to go out and walk with her father as she had not left his side all day  she consented and sauntered with her father in the direction of the seashore  now it so happened that a brown bear of a species which is still to be found on the uninhabited parts of the labrador coast had selected that hour and that locality for his own evening promenade  at a certain part of the slight track which had been formed by the mcleods in their visits to the shore the bushes were very thick and here on rounding a bend in the track they met the bear face to face  had there been some little space between them the animal would probably have turned and fled but being taken by surprise he stood fast  mcleod and his daughter stood aghast on seeing the monster  the former was unarmed with the exception of a small huntingknife and a stout walkingstick  in the first rush of his feelings he suddenly flung his stick at the bear and with so true an aim that the heavy head struck it exactly on the point of its nose  nothing could have been more unfortunate for the creatures rage was at once excited  with a savage growl he rose on his hind legs in the attitude of attack  quick run back flo ill check him here cried mcleod drawing the little huntingknife  but poor flora was incapable of running  white with terror she stood gazing at the bear as if fascinated  her father seeing this stepped in front of her with that overwhelming rush of determination which is sometimes felt by courageous men when under the influence of despair for he felt that with such a weapon he might as well have assailed an elephant  at that moment the wellknown voice of kenneth was heard to utter a tremendous shout close at hand  almost at the same instant a sharp crack was heard and the bear fell at mcleods feet shot through the heart  we need scarcely say that it was a ball from the gun of the indian which had thus opportunely put an end to the bears career and still less need we remark that profuse and earnest were the thanks bestowed on him by the whole party  we must christen you sharpeye after this lucky shot said kenneth when the excitement had subsided  now sharpeye he added taking his red friend by the arm you must stay and sup with us tonight  come along whether you understand me or not ill take no denial  if the indian did not understand the language of his friends he evidently understood their pantomime for he made no further objection to remain but accompanied them to the camp and sat silently smoking at their fire which was kindled in front of the tent door so that the sick man might enjoy the blaze as well as the companionship  while thus engaged they were suddenly interrupted by the appearance of another indian who advanced quietly into the circle of light and sat down  a messenger no doubt said mcleod after the first salutation  a messenger he indeed proved to be for after casting a furtive look not unmingled with surprise and suspicion at his brother redskin he opened a small bag which hung at his girdle and delivered to mcleod senior a very dirtylooking letter  ha from gambart he exclaimed reading the inscription  let us see whathallo  sharpeye where are you off to  this question was called forth in consequence of the red man rising quietly and throwing his gun on his shoulder  instead of replying however he turned abruptly and walked off into the woods  the most unaccountable man i ever knew exclaimed kenneth  i shouldnt wonder if this messenger and he are implacable foes and cant bear to sit at the same fire together  the remark which kenneth began half in jest was finished in earnest for he had not done speaking when the messenger also arose and glided into the woods  get the gun ready said mcleod unfolding the letter theres no saying what these fellows may do when their bloods up  kenneth obeyed while his father read the letter which as the reader has no doubt guessed was that written by gambart at his imperious little wifes command  i was sure there must be some satisfactory explanation of the matter said flora when her father had finished reading  so was i said kenneth examining the priming of his gun  the elder mcleod felt and looked uncomfortable  what is it all about asked roderick from the tent  oh nothing particular answered his father except that there have been some mistakes and foolish concealments in connection with a certain reginald redding whom i fear i have been rather hasty in judging  well that neednt trouble you returned roderick for youve only to explain the mistakes and confess your haste  hm  i suppose i must said mcleod and i rather think that flora will  a deep blush and an imploring look from flora stopped him  just then a rustle was heard among the leaves outside the circle of the campfires light and kenneth cocked his gun as sharpeye stalked forward and sat solemnly down by the fire  i hope you havent killed him sharpeye said kenneth looking with some anxiety at the indians girdle as though he expected to see a fresh and bloody scalp hanging there  of course the indian gave no answer but the minds of all were immediately relieved by seeing the messenger return and sit down as he had done before after which he opened his bag and drawing out another letter handed it to mcleod  what another letter  why did you not deliver it with the first forgot i supposeeh  what have we here  its fromi do believe its from reginald redding  the indian must have called at the cliff fort in passing but however he got it here it is so ill read it    dear sir hm rather friendly consideringafter leaving you   on the occasion of our last unsatisfactory meeting i should think   it was it occurred to me that such indignation on your part not   to mention his own must have been the result of some mistake or   misapprehension  after some reflection i recalled to mind that on the   night i first met you and learned that the name of your property in   partridge bay was loch dhu the sudden entrance of the messenger with   the sad and startling news of the wreck prevented my telling you that   i had become the purchaser of that property and that strange though   it may seem to you i did not up to that moment know the name of the   person from whom i had bought it  this ignorance was owing to a fancy   of my friend mr gambart to conceal the name from mea fancy which   i am still unable to account for but which doubtless can be explained   by himself  if this silence on my part is as i think probable the   cause of your supposing that i intentionally deceived you i trust   that you will find this explanation sufficient to show that you have   been labouring under a mistake  no doubt i was if on the other   hand i am wrong in this conjecture i trust that you will do me the   justice to point out the socalled deception of which i am supposed   to be guilty in order that i may clear myself from a false   imputation  well father that clears up the matter sufficiently doesnt it said kenneth  it does unquestionably replied mcleod especially when coupled with the letter from gambart which has so strangely reached us at the same time with that of redding  well well after all things looked bad to me at first  im sorry however that i gave way to temper when we met for the explanation might have come at that time but the hotheaded young fellow gave way to temper too  mcleod said this in the tone of a man who while admitting his fault looks about for palliating circumstances  however he continued rising and folding the letter i must write at once to let him know that his explanation is satisfactory and that that  that you apologise for your haste said flora with a laugh  certainly not replied mcleod stoutly  i forgive him for getting angry with me but i am not called on to ask forgiveness for being indignant with a man whom i supposed i had good reason to believe was a deceiver  it is not necessary to ask forgiveness when no offence was meant said sharpeye in good english as he suddenly rose and advancing to the elder mcleod held out his hand  mcleod gazed at the indian for a moment in silent amazement  i fear continued sharpeye with a smile that i have to ask your forgiveness for having ventured really to practise deception on you  he removed a dark wig as he spoke and revealed to the astonished gaze of the mcleods the light curly hair of reginald redding  miraculous apparition exclaimed mcleod grasping the proffered hand can i venture to believe my eyes  he glanced as if for sympathy to the spot where flora had been seated but flora for reasons best known to herself had quietly retired to the interior of the tarpaulin tent and was just then absorbed in her duties as nurse to the invalid    chapter twelve  the last  several months after the events narrated in the last chapter a very merry party was assembled in mr william gambarts drawingroom at partridge bay  the party was small by reason of the drawingroom not being large but it was very select and remarkably hearty  plump little gambart was there beaming with goodwill  his plump little partner was also there radiant with matronly smiles his plump little daughters too bewitching with youthful beauty set off by indescribable flounces combined with flutterings of white lace  their aspect was also rendered more captivating and charmingly confused by ribbons rings and ringlets for the reader must remember that we write of those good old times before the introduction of that severely classic style of hairdressing which converts now ninetenths of the fair sex into human cockatoos  among the guests assembled were mcleod and his three sons clad not in the half trapper halt indian style in which they were introduced to the reader but in superfine broadcloth garments the admirable fit of which suggested the idea that they must have been sewed on in regent street london and sent out to canada with their owners in them in separate boxes labelled this side up with care  there was also present mr bob smart smarter in personal appearance than he had ever been before in virtue of a blue surtout with brass buttons which had lain for many years on sale in the store at the cliff fort but never had been bought because the indians who coveted were too poor to purchase it and no other human being in his senses would have worn it its form being antique collar exceedingly high sleeves very tight and the two brass buttons behind being very close together and unreasonably high up  but bob was not particular  nothing he said would prevent him being at that party  he saw as well as felt that he looked like a maniac in the blue coat but not possessing a dresscoat and being possessed of moral heroism he shut his mental eyes ignored taste and feeling put on the coat and went  jonas bellew was also there in a new blue cloth capote scarlet belt and moccasins in which he looked every inch a man if not a gentleman sometimes in the kitchen often in the pantry occasionally in the passages and always in the way for he was excitedly abrupt in his motions might have been seen the face and figure of francois le rue francois was obviously performing the part of a waiter for he wore a badlyfitting suit of black white cotton gloves three sizes too large and pumps with white socks besides which he flourished a white napkin as if it were a warbanner and held on tenaciously to a corkscrew  the pretty face of elise was also there assisting to spread moral sunshine on the party and fair cloths on all the tables  a close observer might have noted that wherever elise shone there le rue took occasion to sun himself  deep in the mysterious regions of the backkitchenwhich bore as much resemblance to civilised backkitchens as an english forest does to the backwoodsmister rooney might have been seen much dirtier than other people owing to the nature of his culinary occupations and his disregard of appearances  a huge favour once white but now dirty decorated the irishmans broad chest  similar favours not dirty were pinned to the breasts of all the guests giving unmistakable evidence that the occasion was a wedding  hooroo ye descendant of an expatriated frog cried rooney staggering under the weight of an enormous pot come here wont ee an lind a hand  wan would think it was yer own weddin was goin on  here slew round the crane ye excitable cratur  preehaps mes own veddin vill foller ver quick said le rue with a sly glance at elise as he assisted rooney to suspend the big pot on its appropriate hook  troth then  i cant compliment the taste o the poor girl as takes ee replied rooney with a still slyer glance at elise  the girl referred to remarked that no girl in her senses would accept either of them as a gift and went off tossing her head  just then a cheer was heard in the lobby and elise le rue and rooney rushed out in time to see flora mcleod like an april dayall smiles and tearshanded into a gig she was much dishevelled by reason of the various huggings she had undergone from sundry bridesmaids and sympathetic female friends chief among whom was a certain mrs crowder who in virtue of her affection for the mcleod family her age and her deafness had constituted herself a compound of mother and grandmamma to flora  the gig was fitted to hold only two  when flora was seated reginald reddingalso somewhat dishevelled owing to the hearty not to say violent congratulations of his male friendsjumped in seized the reins and cracked his whip  the horse being a young and spirited animal performed a series of demivolts which caused all the ladies to scream threw the gig into convulsions and old mrs crowder almost into fits  thereafter it shot away like an arrow amid ringing cheers and a shower of old slippers  this was the last of redding and flora for that day but it was by no means the last of the party  in those regions at that time whatever they may do in those regions nowadays wedding parties were peculiarly festive scenes in which dancing was one of the means by which not only the young but the middleaged were wont to let off superabundant steam and a violin more or less cracked and vigorously played was the instrument which created inspiration  it would take a volume to tell of all that was said and done on that great and memorable occasionhow the plump little miss gambarts fluttered about like erratic flowers or like captivating comets drawing a long tail of the partridge bay young men after them how as the evening wore on all social distinctions were swept away and the servants were invited to exchange duty in the kitchen for dancing in the hall how le rue danced so often with elise and made his admiration of her so obvious that she became quite ashamed of him and cast him off in favour of any one else who asked her how jonas bellew was prevailed on to ask mrs crowder to dance a scotch reel with him which she not only agreed to do but did to the delight of jonas and the admiration of all the company how mister rooney volunteered to dance the sailors hornpipe and acquitted himself so well despite the inability of the violinist to play the proper tune that his performance was greeted with rapturous applause how the floor at last began to show symptoms of giving way and how their only musician did finally give way from sheer exhaustion and thus brought matters to an abrupt close  but all this and a great deal more that we have not told was as nothing compared to the feast of reason and the flow of soul that occurred at the supper a meal which had been expressly reserved as a last resource when the violinist should break down  another volume at least would be required to record it all  there was food of course in profusion and there was also which is not always so common splendid sauce in the form of appetite  there were also songs and toasts and speeches which would have done credit to the halls of more civilised lands in all of which the performers exhibited every phase of human nature from the sublime to the ridiculous  at this stage of the proceedings mcleod senior conducted himself with that manly straightforward vigour which had characterised him during the earlier part of the festivities though he faltered a little and almost broke down when in a speech he referred to flora as a bright sunbeam whom god in his love had permitted to shine upon his path for many years who in prosperity had doubled his joys and who in adversity had taught him that the hearer and answerer of prayer not only can but does bring good out of evil of which fact he was a living instance that day for it was the loss of his goods by shipwreck which had enabled him at a critical moment in his affairs to make a fresh start in life that had now placed him on the road to prosperity so that wrecked but not ruined he thought might be appropriately adopted as his family motto it was this wreck also which had in a great measure brought him into intimate acquaintance with the man who had saved his daughters life as well as his own cheers and who had that day carried off a prize renewed cheers a jewel enthusiastic cheers in which the ladies attempted to transcend the gentlemen he repeated a prize the true value of which was fully known only to himself  here the remainder of the speechof which a few emphasised words such as blessings health prosperity etcetera were heardwas lost in a burst of continuous cheering which suddenly terminated in an uproarious shout of laughter when le rue accidentally knocked the neck off a bottle of beer whose contents spouted directly and violently into his face  the touch of feeling displayed in mcleods speech filled little mr gambart with an irresistible desire to start to his legs and claim his rights  he regarded himself in connection with mrs gambart he said with a winning smile at his fair partner as the author and authoress humanly speaking of course of the whole affair by which he meant the affair that had just come off so auspiciously  he had seen and mrs gambart had seen from the very first that mr redding was deeply in love with flora mcleod as how could he be otherwise that he mr gambart including mrs gambart foresaw that in selling loch dhu to mr redding he was virtually sending it back to the mcleod family that unless he had concealed the name of the owners at first he could not have effected the sale for mr redding at that time thought the mcleods werewere  here an awful frown from mrs gambart intimating that he gambart was touching on subjects which he had no right to make public threw him into confusion out of which condition he delivered himself amidst some laughter and much applause by a bold and irrelevant continuation of the subject to the effect that knowing all that and a great deal more besides he including mrs gambart had not only effected a sale which he might say was the mainsail that had caught the breezes of prosperity by which the craft of the mcleods so to speak had been blown so happily that day into the partridge bay haven of felicity tremendous cheering during which gambart wiped his bald head and flushed face and collected himself  moreover he continued it was he who against mcleods will had bought barkers mill hear hear from bob smart who thought he was quoting poetry and although of course he had not known that the goods in the betsy were insured at this point another frown pulled him up and made him reckless he nevertheless would stoutly hold against any man cheers or woman cheers and laughter that he including mrs gambart had had a finger in the pie which after simmering for a considerable time the pie not the finger in the oven ofof cheers ah had that night been done brown from bob smart to a turn severely and been dished up in such splendid style that a more auspicious climax couldcould  the remainder was drowned in vociferous cheering in which mr gambart himself joined shook hands with the guests on each side of him sat down and blew his nose  it was at this point that bob smart overcome by a gush of feeling burst into a song the burden of which was that the light of former days being faded their glories past and shaded and the joys of other days being too bright to last it was not worth while doing more than making a simple statement of these facts without expressing a decided opinion either one way or another in regard to them  as he sang this rather pretty song in the voice of a cracked teakettle a thrill of delight ran through the company when deaf mrs crowder being ignorant of what was going on suddenly said that as there seemed to be a pause in the flow of soul she although a woman would venture to express a sentiment if not to propose a toast  this was of course received with a shout of joy which effectually quenched mr smart  in a sweet tremulous little voice the old lady said let us wish with all our hearts that health happiness charity and truth may dwell as long as it shall stand under the rooftree of loch dhu  of course this called mcleod to his legs again after which there were more speeches and more songsboth grave and gayuntil natures sweet restorer balmy sleep began gently to tickle the guests reminding them that felicity is not less enhanced by occasions of exuberant mirth than by periods of tranquil repose  what more can we say good reader than that old mrs crowders wish was fulfilled to the letter for a large family trained by redding and flora to respect the laws of god and love the name of jesus caused the rooftree of loch dhu to ring full many a year thereafter with joyous tones that were the direct result of health happiness charity and truth  mcleod senior dwelt hard by and was made glad as well as thoughtful by the sight  ian and kenneth made a comfortable livelihood out of the sawmill at jenkins creek which ultimately became a populous settlement whither the young reddings went annually in summer to enjoy themselves in which enjoyment they were greatly aided by jonas bellew the trapper  roderick was equally prosperous with barkers mill at partridge bay  rooney continued to the end of his days in the service of his old master while le rue and elise a happy couple became respectively butler and cook at loch dhu over the door of which establishment redding had engraved his fatherinlaws favourite mottowrecked but not ruined  the end
