80176586	pickle the spy or the incognito of prince charles     i knew the master  on many secret steps of his career i have an authentic memoir in my hand the master of ballantrae    preface    this woful history began in my study of the pelham papers in the additional manuscripts of the british museum  these include the letters of pickle the spy and of james mohr macgregor  transcripts of them were sent by me to mr robert louis stevenson for use in a novel which he did not live to finish  the character of pickle indeed like that of the master of ballantrae is alluring to writers of historical romance  resisting the temptation to use pickle as the villain of fiction i have tried to tell his story with fidelity the secret so long kept of prince charless incognito is divulged no less by his own correspondence in the stuart mss than by the letters of pickle  for her majestys gracious permission to read the stuart papers in the library of windsor castle and to engrave a miniature of prince charles in the royal collection i have respectfully to express my sincerest gratitude  to mr holmes her majestys librarian i owe much kind and valuable aid  the pickle papers and many despatches in the state papers were examined and copied for me by miss e a ibbs  in studying the stuart papers i owe much to the aid of miss violet simpson who has also assisted me by verifying references from many sources  it would not be easy to mention the numerous correspondents who have helped me but it were ungrateful to omit acknowledgment of the kindness of mr horatio f brown and of mr george t omond  i have to thank mr alexander pelham trotter for permission to cite the ms letter book of the exiled chevaliers secretary andrew lumisden in mr trotters possession  miss macpherson of cluny kindly gave me a copy of a privately printed memorial of her celebrated ancestor and by clunys kind permission i have been allowed to see some letters from his charter chest apparently the more important secret papers have perished in the years of turmoil and exile  this opportunity may be taken for disclaiming any belief in the imputations against cluny conjecturally hazarded by newton or kennedy in the following pages  the chiefs destitution in france after a long period of suffering in scotland refutes these suspicions bred in an atmosphere of jealousy and distrust  among the relics of the family are none of the objects which charles in 17661767 found it difficult to obtain from clunys representatives for lack of a proper messenger  to sir arthur halkett bart of pitfirrane i am obliged for a view of balhaldies correspondence with his agent in scotland  the directors of the french foreign office archives courteously permitted monsieur leon pajot to examine and copy for me some of the documents in their charge  these it will be seen add but little to our information during the years 17491766  i have remarked in the proper place that mr murray rose has already printed some of pickles letters in a newspaper  as mr murray rose assigned them to james mohr macgregor i await with interest his arguments in favour of this opinion in his promised volume of essays  the ornament on the cover of this work is a copy of that with which the volumes of prince charless own library were impressed  i owe the stamp to the kindness of miss warrender of bruntsfield  among printed books the most serviceable have been mr ewalds work on prince charles lord stanhopes history and dr brownes history of the highlands and clans  had mr ewald explored the stuart papers and the memoirs of dargenson grimm de luynes barbier and the letters of madame du deffand edited by m de lescure with the political correspondence of frederick the great little would have been left for gleaners in his track  i must not forget to thank mr and mrs bartels for researches in old magazines and journals  mr bartels also examined for me the printed correspondence of frederick the great  to the kindness of j a erskine cunningham esq of balgownie i owe permission to photograph the portrait of young glengarry in his possession  if i might make a suggestion to historical students of leisure it is this  the life of the old chevalier james iii has never been written and is well worth writing  my own studies alas prove that prince charless character was incapable of enduring misfortune  his father less brilliant and less popular was a very different man and i think has everything to gain from an unprejudiced examination of his career  he has certainly nothing to lose  since this work was in type the whole of bishop forbess ms the lyon in mourning has been printed for an historical society in scotland  i was unable to consult the ms for this book but it contains i now find no addition to the facts here set forth  november 5 1896    chapter iintroductory to pickle    subject of this bookthe last rally of jacobitism hitherto obscure nature of the new materialsinformation from spies

faded and so tarnished has hitherto remained obscure  the facts on which waverley is based are familiar to all the world  those on which redgauntlet rests were but imperfectly known even to sir walter scott  the story of the fortyfive is the tale of highland loyalty the story of 17501763 is the record of highland treachery or rather of the treachery of some highlanders  that story now for the first time to be told is founded on documents never hither to published or never previously pieced together  the additional manuscripts of the british museum with relics of the government of henry pelham and his brother the duke of newcastle have yielded their secrets and given the information of the spies  the stuart papers at windsor partly published in brownes history of the highland clans and by lord stanhope but mainly virginal of type fill up the interstices in the pelham papers like pieces in a mosaic and reveal the general design  the letters of british ambassadors at paris dresden berlin hanover leipzig florence st petersburg lend colour and coherence  the political correspondence of frederick the great contributes to the effect  a trifle of information comes from the french foreign office archives french printed memoires and letters neglected by previous english writers on the subject offer some valuable indeed essential hints and illustrate charless relations with the wits and beauties of the reign of louis xv  by combining information from these and other sources in print manuscript and tradition we reach various results  we can now follow and understand the changes in the singular and wretched development of the character of prince charles edward stuart  we get a curious view of the manners and a lurid light on the diplomacy of the middle of the eighteenth century  we go behind the scenes of many conspiracies  above all we encounter an extraordinary personage the great highborn highland chief who sold himself as a spy to the english government  his existence was suspected by scott if not clearly known and understood  in his introduction to redgauntlet 3 sir walter scott says that the ministers of george iii thought it proper to leave dr camerons new schemes in concealment 1753 lest by divulging them they had indicated the channel of communication which it is now well known they possessed to all the plots of charles edward  to indicate that secret channel of communication between the government of the pelhams and the jacobite conspirators of 17491760 is one purpose of this book  tradition has vaguely bequeathed to us the name of pickle the spy the foremost of many traitors  who pickle was and what he did a whole romance of prosperous treachery is now to be revealed and illustrated from various sources  pickle was not only able to keep the duke of newcastle and george ii well informed as to the inmost plots if not the most hidden movements of prince charles but he could either paralyse a serious or promote a premature rising in the highlands as seemed best to his english employers  we shall find pickle in company with that devoted jacobite lochgarry travelling through the highlands exciting hopes consulting the chiefs unburying a hidden treasure and encouraging the clans to rush once more on english bayonets  romance in a way is stereotyped and it is characteristic that the last romance of the stuarts should be interwoven with a secret treasure  this mass of french gold buried after culloden at loch arkaig in one of the most remote recesses of the highlands was to the jacobites what the dwarf andvaris hoard was to the niflungs a curse and a cause of discord  we shall see that rivalry for its possession produced contending charges of disloyalty forgery and theft among certain of the highland chiefs and these may have helped to promote the spirit of treachery in pickle the spy  it is probable though not certain that he had acted as the agent of cumberland before he was sold to henry pelham and he was certainly communicating the results of his inquiries in one sense to george ii and in another sense to the exiled james iii in rome  he was betraying his own cousins and traducing his friends  pickle is plainly no common spy or paltry vidette as he words it  possibly sir walter scott knew who pickle was  in him scott if he had chosen would have found a character very like barry lyndon but worse very unlike any personage in the waverley novels and somewhat akin to the master of ballantrae  the cool goodhumoured smiling unscrupulous villain of high rank and noble lineage the scoundrel happily unconscious of his own unspeakable infamy proud and sensitive upon the point of honour the picturesque hypocrite in religion is a being whom we do not meet in sir walters romances in pickle he had such a character ready made to his hand but in the time of scott it would have been dangerous as it is still disagreeable to unveil this old mystery of iniquity  a friend of sir walters a man very ready with the pistol the last as was commonly said of the highland chiefs was of the name and blood of pickle and would have taken up pickles feud  sir walter was not to be moved by pistols but not even for the sake of a good story would he hurt the sensibilities of a friend or tarnish the justly celebrated loyalty of the highlands  now the friend of scott the representative of pickle in scotts generation was a highlander and pickle was not only a traitor a profligate an oppressor of his tenantry and a liar but according to jacobite gossip which reached king james a forger of the kings name  moreover he was in all probability one fountain of that reproach true or false which still clings to the name of the brave and gentle archibald cameron the brother of lochiel whom pickle brought to the gallows  if we add that when last we hear of pickle he is probably engaged in a double treason and certainly meditates selling a regiment of his clan like hessians to the hanoverian government it will be plain that his was no story for scott to tell  pickle had at least the attraction of being eminently handsome  no statelier gentleman than pickle as his faded portrait shows him in full highland costume ever trod a measure at holyrood  tall athletic with a frank and pleasing face pickle could never be taken for a traitor and a spy  he seemed the fitting lord of that castellated palace of his race which beautiful and majestic in decay mirrors itself in loch oich  again the man was brave for he moved freely in france england and scotland well knowing that the skian was sharpened for his throat if he were detected  and the most extraordinary fact in an extraordinary story is that pickle was detected and denounced to the king over the water by mrs archibald cameron the widow of his victim  yet the breach between james and his little court on one side and prince charles on the other was then so absolute that the prince was dining with the spy chatting with him at the operaball and presenting him with a gold snuffbox at about the very time when pickles treachery was known in rome afterwards the knowledge of his infamy came too late if it came at all  the great scheme had failed cameron had fallen and frederick of prussia ceasing to encourage jacobitism had become the ally of england  these things sound like the inventions of the romancer but they rest on unimpeachable evidence printed and manuscript and chiefly on pickles own letters to his king to his prince and to his english employerswe cannot say paymasters for pickle was never paid he obtained indeed singular advantages but he seldom or never could wring ready money from the duke of newcastle  to understand pickles career the reluctant reader must endure a certain amount of actual history in minute details of date and place every one is acquainted with the brilliant hour of prince charles his landing in moidart accompanied by only seven men his march on edinburgh his success at prestonpans the race to derby the retreat to scotland the gleam of victory at falkirk the ruin of culloden the long months of wanderings and distress the return to france in 1746  then came two years of baffled intrigues next the treaty of aixlachapelle insisted on the princes expulsion from france last he declined to withdraw  on december 10 1748 he was arrested at the opera was lodged in the prison of vincennes was released and made his way to the popes city of avignon arriving there in the last days of december 1748  on february 28 1749 he rode out of avignon and disappeared for many months from the ken of history for nearly eighteen years he preserved his incognito vaguely heard of here and there in england france germany flanders but always involved in mystery  on that mystery impenetrable to his father pickle threw light enough for the purposes of the english government but not during the darkest hours of charless incognito  le prince edouard says barbier in his journal for february 1750 fait ladmiration et la curiosite de leurope  this work alas is not likely to add to the admiration entertained for the unfortunate adventurer but any surviving curiosity as to the princes secret may be assuaged  in the days of 17491750 before pickles revelations begin the drafts of the princes memoranda notes and angry love letters preserved in her majestys library enable us to follow his movements  on much that is obscurely indicated in scarcely decipherable scrawls light is thrown by the french memoirs of that age  the names of madame de talmond madame daiguillon and the celebrated montesquieu are beacons in the general twilight  the memoirs also explain what was previously inexplicable the motives of charles in choosing a life in a hole of a rock as he said after the peace of aixlachapelle 1748  it is necessary however to study the internal feuds of the jacobites at this period and these are illuminated by the stuart papers the letters of james and his ministers  the plan of our narrative therefore will be arranged in the following manner  first we sketch the character of prince charles in boyhood during his scottish expedition and as it developed in cruelly thwarting circumstances between 1746 and 1749  in illustrating his character the hostile parties within the jacobite camp must be described and defined  from february 1749 to september 1750 when he visited london we must try to pierce the darkness that has been more than egyptian  we can at least display the total ignorance of courts and diplomatists as to charless movements before pickle came to their assistance and we discover a secret which they ought to have known  after the date 1752 we give as far as possible the personal history of pickle before he sold himself and we unveil his motives for his villany  then we display pickle in action we select from his letters we show him deep in the scottish english and continental intrigues  he spoils the elibank plot he reveals the hostile policy of frederick the great he leads on to the arrest of archibald cameron he sows disunion he traduces and betrays  he finally recovers his lands robs his tenants dabbles probably in the french scheme of invasion 1759 offers further information tries to sell a regiment of his clan and dies unexposed in 1761  minor spies are tracked here and there as rob roys son james mohr macgregor samuel cameron and oliver macallester  english machinations against the princes life and liberty are unveiled  his utter decadence is illustrated and we leave him weary dishonoured and abandoned   a sair sair altered man prince charlie cam hame   to rome and the refusal there of even a titular kingship  the whole book aims chiefly at satisfying the passion of curiosity however unimportant a secret may be it is pleasant to know what all europe was once vainly anxious to discover  in the revelation of manners too and in tracing the relations of famous wits and beauties with a person then so celebrated as prince charles there is a certain amount of entertainment which may excuse some labour of research  our history is of next to no political value but it revives as in a magic mirror somewhat dim certain scenes of actual human life  now and again the mist breaks and real passionate faces gestures of living men and women are beheld in the clear obscure  we see lochgarry throw his dirk after his son and pronounce his curse  we mark pickle furtively scribbling after midnight in french inns  we note charles hiding in the alcove of a ladys chamber in a convent  we admire the rich anger of his polish mistress and the sullen rage of lord hyndford baffled by the perfidious court of frederick the great  the old histories emerge into light like the writing in sympathetic ink on the secret

says lord stanhope is one of those characters that cannot be portrayed at a single sketch but have so greatly altered as to require a new delineation at different periods 12a  now he glitters all over like the star which they tell you appeared at his nativity and which still shines beside him micat inter omnes on a medal struck in his boyhood 12b  anon he is sunk in besotted vice a cruel lover a solitary tippler a broken man  we study the period of transition  descriptions of his character vary between the noble encomium written in prison by archibald cameron the last man who died for the stuarts and the virulent censures of lord elcho and dr king veterans known to sir walter scott wept at the mention of the princes name yet as early as the tenth year after prestonpans his most devoted adherent henry goring left him in an angry despair nevertheless the character so variously estimated so tenderly loved so loathed so despised was one character modified swiftly or slowly as its natural elements developed or decayed under the various influences of struggle of success of long endurance of hope deferred and of bitter disappointment  the gay kind brave loyal and clement prince charlie became the fierce shabby battered exile homeless and all but friendless  the change of course was not instantaneous but gradual it was not the result of one but of many causes  even out of his final degradation charles occasionally speaks with his real voice  his inborn goodness of heart remarked before his earliest adventures utters its protest against the self he has become just as on the other hand long ere he set his foot on scottish soil his father had noted his fatal inclination to wine and revel  the processes in this change of character the events the temptations the trials under which charles became an altered man have been very slightly studied and indeed have been very obscurely known  even mr ewald the author of the most elaborate biography of the prince 13 neglected some important french printed sources while manuscript documents here for the first time published were not at his command  the present essay is itself unavoidably incomplete for of family papers bearing on the subject many have perished under the teeth of time and in one case of rats while others are not accessible to the writer  nevertheless it is hoped that this work elucidates much which has long been veiled in the motives conduct and secret movements of charles during the years between 1749 and the death in 1766 of his father the old chevalier  charles then emerged from a retirement of seventeen years the european game of hide and seek was over and it is not proposed to study the prince in the days of his manifest decline and among the disgraces of his miserable marriage  his incognito is our topic the period of deep and isolated enterprise which puzzled every foreign office in europe and practically only ended as far as hope was concerned with the breakup of the jacobite party in 1754 1756 or rather with hawkes defeat of conflans in 1759  ours is a strange and melancholy tale of desperate loyalties and of a treason almost unparalleled for secrecy and persistence  we have to do with the backstairs of diplomacy with spies and traitors with cloak and sword with blabbing servants and inquisitive ambassadors with disguise and discovery with friends more staunch than steel or weaker than water with petty jealousies with the relentless persecution of a brave man and with the consequent ruin of a gallant life  to understand the psychological problem the degradation of a promising personality it is necessary to glance rapidly at what we know of charles before his scottish expedition  to begin at the beginning in physical qualities the prince was dowered by a kind fairy  he was firmly though slimly built of the best stature for strength and health  he had a body made for war writes lord elcho who hated him  the gift of beauty in his case peculiarly fatal as will be seen had not been denied to him  his brow was high and broad his nose shapely his eyes of a rich dark brown his hair of a chestnut hue golden at the tips  though his eyes are described as blue both in 1744 by sir horace mann and in later life 1770 by an english lady in rome though lord stanhope and mr stevenson agree in this error brown was really their colour 15a  charles inherited the dark eyes of his father the black bird and of mary stuart  this is manifest from all the original portraits and miniatures including that given by the prince to his secretary murray of broughton now in my collection  in boyhood charless face had a merry mutinous rather reckless expression as portraits prove  hundreds of faces like his may be seen at the public schools indeed charles had many doubles who sometimes traded on the resemblance sometimes wittingly or unwittingly misled the spies that constantly pursued him 15b  his adherents fondly declared that his natural air of distinction his princely bearing were too marked to be concealed in any travesty  yet no man has in disguises of his person been more successful  we may grant the grand air to charles but we must admit that he could successfully dissemble it  about 1743 when a number of miniatures of the prince were done in italy for presentation to adherents charless boyish mirth as seen in these works of art has become somewhat petulant if not arrogant but he is still a lad with the bloom of a lass  a shade of aspiring melancholy marks a portrait done in france just before the expedition to scotland  le toques fine portrait of the prince in armour 1748 shows a manly and martial but rather sinister countenance  a plaster bust done from a life mask if not from le moines bust in marble 1750 was thought the best likeness by dr king  this bust was openly sold in red lion square and when charles visited dr king in september 1750 the doctors servant observed the resemblance  i have never seen a copy of this bust and the medal struck in 1750 an intaglio of the same date and a very rare profile in the collection of the duke of atholl give a similar idea of the prince as he was at thirty  a distinguished artist who outlined charless profile and applied it to another of her present majesty in youth tells me that they are almost exact counterparts  next we come to the angry eyes and swollen features of ozias humphreyss miniature in the duke of atholls collection and in his sketch published in the lockhart papers 1776 and finally to the fallen weary old face designed by gavin hamilton  charless younger brother henry duke of york was a prettier boy but it is curious to mark the prematurely priestly and italianate expression of the duke in youth while charles still seems a merry lad  of charles in boyhood many anecdotes are told  at the age of two or three he is said to have been taken to see the pope in his garden and to have refused the usual marks of reverence  walton the english agent in florence reports an outbreak of ferocious temper in 1733 17a  though based on gossip the story seems to forebode the later excesses of anger  earlier in 1727 the duc de liria a son of marshal berwick draws a pretty picture of the child when about seven years old  the king of england did not wish me to leave before may 4 and i was only too happy to remain at his feet not merely on account of the love and respect i have borne him all my life but also because i was never weary of watching the princes his sons  the prince of wales was now six and a half and besides his great beauty was remarkable for dexterity grace and almost supernatural cleverness  not only could he read fluently but he knew the doctrines of the christian faith as well as the master who had taught him  he could ride could fire a gun and more surprising still i have seen him take a crossbow and kill birds on the roof and split a rolling ball with a shaft ten times in succession  he speaks english french and italian perfectly and altogether he is the most ideal prince i have ever met in the course of my life  the duke of york his majestys second son is two years old and a prodigy of beauty and strength 17b  gray certainly no jacobite when at rome with horace walpole speaks very kindly of the two gay young princes  he sneers at their melancholy father of whom montesquieu writes ce prince a une bonne physiononie et noble  il paroit triste pieux 18a  young charles was neither pious nor melancholy  of charles at the age of twenty the president de brosses the author of les dieux fetiches speaks as an unconcerned observer  i hear from those who know them both thoroughly that the eldest has far higher worth and is much more beloved by his friends that he has a kind heart and a high courage that he feels warmly for his familys misfortunes and that if some day he does not retrieve them it will not be for want of intrepidity 18b  charless gallantry when under fire as a mere boy at the siege of gaeta 1734 was indeed greatly admired and generally extolled 18c  his courage has been much more foolishly denied by his enemies than too eagerly applauded by friends who had seen him tried by every species of danger  aspersions have been thrown on charless personal bravery it may be worth while to comment on them  the story of lord elchos reproaching the prince for not heading a charge of the second line at culloden has unluckily been circulated by sir walter scott  on february 9 1826 scott met sir james stuart denham whose father was out in the fortyfive and whose uncle was the lord elcho of that date  lord elcho wrote memoirs still unpublished but used by mr ewald in his life of the prince  elcho is a hostile witness  for twenty years he vainly dunned charles for a debt of 15001 according to sir james stuart denham elcho asked charles to lead a final charge at culloden retrieve the battle or die sword in hand the prince rode off the field elcho calling him a damned cowardly italian  no such passage occurs in elchos diary  he says that after the flight he found charles in the belief that he had been betrayed anxious only for his irish officers and determined to go to france not to join the clans at ruthven  elcho most justly censured and resolved never to have anything more to do with him a broken vow 19a  as a matter of fact sir robert strange saw charles vainly trying to rally the highlanders and sir stuart thriepland of fingask gives the same evidence 19b  in his seclusion during 1750 charles wrote a little memoir still unpublished about his highland wanderings  in this he says that he was led off the field by those about him when the clans broke at culloden  the prince then changed his horse his own having been wounded by a musketball in the shoulder 20a  the secondhand chatter of hume in his letter to sir john pringle february 13 1773 is unworthy of serious attention  helvetius told hume that his house at paris had sheltered the prince in the years following his expulsion from france in 1748  he called charles the most unworthy of mortals insomuch that i have been assured when he went down to nantz to embark on his expedition to scotland he took fright and refused to go on board and his attendants thinking the matter gone too far and that they would be affronted for his cowardice carried him in the night time into the ship pieds et mains lies  the sceptical hume accepts this absurd statement without even asking or at least without giving the name of helvetiuss informant  the adventurer who insisted on going forward when at his first landing in scotland even sir thomas sheridan with all the chiefs present advised retreat cannot conceivably have been the poltroon of humes myth  even humes correspondent sir john pringle was manifestly staggered by the anecdote and tells hume that another of his fables is denied by the very witness to whom hume appealed 20b  hume had cited lord holdernesse for the story that charless presence in london in 1753 1750 seems to be meant was known at the time to george ii  lord holdernesse declared that there was nothing in the tale given by hume on his authority  that charles did not join the rallied clans at ruthven after culloden was the result of various misleading circumstances not of cowardice  even after 1746 he constantly carried his life in his hand not only in expeditions to england and probably to scotland and ireland but in peril from the daggers of assassins as will later be shown  highspirited and daring charles was also hardy  in italy he practised walking without stockings to inure his feet to long marches  he was devoted to boarhunting shooting and golf 21a he had no touch of italian effeminacy otherwise he could never have survived his highland distresses  in travelling he was swift and incapable of fatigue  he has said early observer the habit of keeping a secret  many secrets indeed he kept so well that history is still baffled by them as diplomatists were perplexed between 1749 and 1766 21b  we may discount murray of broughtons eulogies charless greek latin and hebrew and his knowledge of history and philosophy though backed by the jesuit cordara 21c  charless education had been interrupted by quarrels between his parents about catholic or protestant tutors  his cousin and governor sir thomas sheridan a descendant of james ii certainly did not teach him to spell his style in french and english is often obscure and when it is clear we know not whether he was not inspired by some more literary adviser  in matters of taste he was fond of music and archaeology and greatly addicted to books  de brosses however considered him less cultivated than princes should be at his age and dargenson says that his knowledge was scanty and that he had little conversation  a few of his books the morocco tooled with the prince of waless feathers remain but not enough to tell us much about his literary tastes  on these however we shall give ample information in paris after culloden he bought macchiavellis works probably in search of practical hints on statecraft  in spite of a proclamation by charles which montesquieu applauded he certainly had no claim to a seat in the french academy which montesquieu playfully offered to secure for him  in brief charles was a spirited eager boy very capable of patience intensely secretive and as he showed in 17451746 endowed with a really extraordinary clemency and in one regard where his enemies were concerned with a sense of honour most unusual in his generation  his care for the wounded after prestonpans is acknowledged by the timid and whiggish home in his history of the rebellion and is very warmly and gracefully expressed in a letter to his father written at holyrood 23a  he could not be induced to punish miscreants who attempted his life and snapped pistols in his face  he could hardly be compelled to retort to the english offer of 300001 for his head by issuing a similar proclamation about the elector  i smiled and created it the proclamation of a reward of 30000l for his head with the disdain it deserved upon which they the highlanders flew into a violent rage and insisted upon my doing the same by him  this occurs in a letter from charles to james september 10 1745 dated from perth  a copy is found among bishop forbess papers  here charles deplores the cruelties practised under charles ii and james ii and the consequent estrangement of the duke of argyll 23b  in brief the contest between charles and cumberland was that of a civilised and chivalrous commander against a foe as treacherous and cruel as a huron or an iroquois  on this point there is no possibility of doubt  the english government offered a vast reward for charles dead or alive  the soldiers were told significantly by cumberland that he did not want prisoners  on the continent assassins lurked for the prince and ambassadors urged the use of personal violence  meanwhile the prince absolutely forbade even a legitimate armed attack directed mainly against his enemy then red handed from the murder of the wounded  with this loyalty to his foes with this clemency to enemies in his power charles certainly combined a royal grace and could do handsome things handsomely  thus in 1745 some of the tenants of oliphant of gask would not don the white cockade at his command  he therefore laid an arrest or inhibition on their cornfields charles finding the grain hanging deadripe as he marched through perthshire inquired the cause and when he had learned it broke the taboo by cutting some ears with his sword or by gathering them and giving them to his horse saving that the farmers might now by his authority follow his example and break the inhibition 24a  making every allowance for an enthusiasm of loyalty on the part of the narrators in bishop forbess ms lyon in mourning partly published by robert chambers in jacobite memoirs 24b it is certain that the courage endurance and gay content of the prince in his highland wanderings deserve the high praise given by smollett thus in many ways we see the elements of a distinguished and attractive character in charles  his enemies like the renegade dr king of st marys hall ob 1763 in his posthumous anecdotes accused the prince of avarice  he would borrow money from a lady says king while he had plenty of his own he neglected those who had ruined themselves for his sake  henry goring accused the prince of shabbiness to his face but assuredly he who insisted on laying down money on the rocks of a deserted fishers islet to pay for some dry fish eaten there by himself and his companionshe who gave liberally to gentle and simple out of the treasure buried near loch arkaig who refused a french pension for himself and asked favours only for his friendsafforded singular proofs of dr kings charge of selfish greed  the fault grew on him later  after breaking with the french court in 1748 charles had little or nothing of his own to give away his sobieski jewels he had pawned for the expenses of the war having no heart to wear them he said on this side of the water  he was often in actual need though we may not accept dargensons story of how he was once seen selling his pistols to a gunmaker 25a  if ever he was a miser that vice fixed itself upon him in his utter moral ruin  were there then no signs in his early life of the faults which grew so rapidly when hope was lost  there were such signs  as early as 1742 james had observed in charles a slight inclination to wine and gaiety and believed that his companions especially francis strickland 25b were setting him against his younger brother the duke of york who had neither the health nor the disposition to be a roysterer 26a  again on february 3 1747 james recurs in a long letter to what passed in 1742 because that is the foundation and i may say the key of all that has followed  now in 1742 murray of broughton paid his first visit to rome and was fascinated by charles  this unhappy man afterwards the judas of the cause was unscrupulous in private life in matters of which it is needless to speak more fully  he was or gave himself the air of being a very stout protestant  james employed him but probably liked him little  it is to be gathered from jamess letter of february 3 1747 that he suspected charles of listening to advice probably from murray about his changing his religion  you cannot forget how you were prevailed upon to speak to your brother the devout duke of york on very nice and delicate subjects and that without saying the least thing to me though we lived in the same house    you were then much younger than you are now and therefore could be more easily led by specious arguments and pretences     it will to be sure have been represented to you that our religion is a great prejudice to our interest but that it may in some measure be remedied by a certain free way of thinking and acting 26b  in 1749 james made a disagreeable discovery which he communicated to lord lismore  a cassette or coffer belonging to charles had apparently been left in paris and after many adventures on the road was brought to rome by the french ambassador  james opened it and found that it contained letters from myself and the queen  but it also offered proof that the prince had carried on a secret correspondence with england long before he left rome in 1744 probably his adherents wished james to resign in his favour 27a  as to religion dr king admits that charles was no bigot and dargenson contrasted his disengaged way of treating theology with the exaggerated devoutness of the duke of york  even during the march into england lord elcho told an inquirer that the princes religion was still to seek  assuredly he would never make shipwreck on the stuart fidelity to catholicism  all this was deeply distressing to the pious james and all this dated from 1742 that is from the time of murray of broughtons visit to rome indifference to religious strictness was even then accompanied by a love of wine in some slight degree  already too a little rift in the friendship of the princely brothers was apparent there were secrets between them which henry must have communicated to james  as for the fatal vice of drink it is hinted at on april 15 1747 by an anonymous paris correspondent of lord dunbars  charles had about him an irish cordelier one kelly whom he employed as a secretary kelly is accused of talking contemptuously about james  it were to be wished that his royal highness would forbid that friar his apartment because he passes for a notorious drunkard    and his royal highnesss character in point of sobriety has been a little blemished on this friars account 28a  the cold hunger and fatigue of the highland distresses had no doubt often prompted recourse to the national dram of whiskey and charles would put a bottle of brandy to his lips without ceremony says bishop forbes  the prince on one occasion is said to have drunk the champion bowlsman of the islands under the table 28b  what had been a jovial feast became a custom a consolation and a curse while there is reason as has been seen to suppose that charles quite early in life showed promise of intemperance  in happier circumstances these early tastes might never have been developed into a positive disease  james himself in youth had not been a pattern of strict sobriety but later middle age found him almost ascetic  we have sketched a character endowed with many fine qualities and capable of winning devoted affection  we now examine the rapid decline of a nature originally noble  returned from scotland in 1746 prince charles brought with him a head full of indigested romance a heart rich in chimerical expectations  he now prided himself on being a plain hardy mountaineer  he took a line of his own he concealed his measures from the spyridden court of his father in rome he quarrelled with his brother the duke of york when the duke accepted a cardinals hat  he broke violently with the french king who would not aid him he sulked at avignon  he sought spanish help which was refused  he again became the centre of fashion and of disaffection in paris ladies travelled from england merely to see him in his box at the theatre  princesses and duchesses pulled caps for him  naturally cold as his enemies averred where women were concerned he was now beleaguered besieged taken by storm by the fair  he kept up the habit of drinking which had been noted in him even before his expedition to scotland   he allowed his old boyish scepticism caused by a mixed protestant and catholic education to take the form of studied religious indifference  after defying and being expelled by louis xv he adopted what has never perhaps been observed the wild advice of dargenson la bete and louiss ex minister of foreign affairs he betook himself to a life of darkling adventures to a hidden and homeless exile  in many of his journeys he found pickle in his path and pickle finally made his labours vain  the real source of all this imbroglio in addition to an exasperated daring and a strangely secretive temperament was a deep wellgrounded mistrust of the people employed by his father the old king over the water  whatever james knew was known in london by next mail  charles was aware of this and was not aware that his own actions were almost as successfully spied upon and reported  he therefore concealed his plans and movements from james and even till pickle came on the scenefrom europe and from england  the result of his reticence was an irremediable rupture between the king and the prince of walesover the water an incurable split in the jacobite camp  the general outline here sketched must now be filled up in detail the origo mali was the divisions among the jacobites  ever since 1715 these had existed and multiplied  mar was thought to be a traitor  atterbury in exile suspected obrien lord lismore  the earl marischal and kelly 30a were set against jamess ministers lord sempil lord lismore and balhaldie the exiled chief of the macgregors  lord dunbar murray brother of lord mansfield was in jamess disgrace at avignon  sempil balhaldie lismore were the kings party opposed to marischal kelly sheridan lally tollendal the princes party  each sect inveighed against the other in unmeasured terms of reproach  this division widened when charles was in france just before the expedition to scotland  one of jamess agents in paris lord sempil writes to him on july 5 1745 with warnings against the princes counsellors especially sir thomas sheridan charless governor and lefthanded cousin and kelly  they with lally tollendal and others arranged the descent on scotland without the knowledge of james or sempil whom charles and his party bitterly distrusted as they also distrusted lord lismore obrien jamess other agent  while the prince was in scotland 17451746 even before prestonpans the jacobite affairs in france were perplexed by the action of lismore sempil and balhaldie acting for james while the old earl marischal who had been in the rising of 1715 and the glenshiel affair of 1719 acted for the prince  with the earl marischal was for some time lord clancarty of whom sempil speaks as a very brave and worthy man 31a  on the other hand oliver macallester the spy describes clancarty with whom he lived as a slovenly drunken blaspheming rogue one of whose eyes general braddock had knocked out with a bottle in a tavern brawl  clancarty gave himself forth as a representative of the english jacobites but dargenson in his memoires says he could produce no names of men of rank in the party except his own  dargenson was pestered by women priests and ragged irish adventurers  in september 1745 the earl marischal and clancarty visited dargenson then foreign minister of louis xv in the kings camp in flanders  they asked for aid and the scene as described by the spy macallester on clancartys information was curious  dargenson taunted the lord marischal with not being at charless side in scotland  to the slovenly clancarty he said sir your wig is illcombed  would you like to see my perruquier  he manages wigs very well  clancarty who wore an ordinary black tie wig jumped up saying in english damn the fellow  he is making his diversion of us 32a  the lord marischal was already on bad personal terms with charles  clancarty was a ruffian dargenson was the adviser who suggested charless hidden and fugitive life after 1748  the singular behaviour of the earl marischal in 17511754 will afterwards be illustrated by the letters of pickle who drew much of his information from the unsuspicious old ambassador of frederick the great to the court of versailles  it is plain that the duke of ormonde was right when he said that too many people are meddling in your majestys affairs with the french court at this juncture november 15 1745  the duke of york charless brother was on the seaboard of france in autumn 1745  at arras he met the gallant chevalier wogan who had rescued his mother from prison at innspruck 32b  clancarty lord marischal and lally tollendal were pressing for a french expedition to start in aid of charles  sempil balhaldie lismore were intriguing and interfering  voltaire wrote a proclamation for charles to issue  an expedition was arranged troops and ships were gathered at boulogne  swedes were to join from gothenburg  on christmas eve 1745 nothing was ready and the secret leaked out  a million was sent to scotland the money arrived too late we shall hear more of it 33a  the duke of york though he fought well at antwerp was kneeling in every shrine and was in church when the news of culloden was brought to him  this information he gave in the present century to one of the stair family 33b  the rivalries and enmities went on increasing and multiplying into crossdivisions after charles made his escape to france in august 1746  he was filled with distrust of his fathers advisers his own were disliked by james  the correspondence of horace mann and of walton an english agent in florence shows that england received all intelligence sent to james from paris and knew all that passed in jamess cabinet in rome 33c  the abbe grant was suspected of being the spy  among so many worse than doubtful friends charles after 1746 took his own course even his father knew little or nothing of his movements  between his departure from avignon february 1749 and the accession of pickle to the hanoverian side autumn 1749 or 1750 charles baffled every foreign office in europe  indeed pickle was of little service till 1751 or 1752  curious light on charless character and on the entangled quarrels of the jacobites is cast by dargensons memoires  in spring 1747 the duke of york disappeared from paris almost as cleverly as charles himself could have done  dargenson thus describes his manoeuvre  he fled from paris with circumstances of distinguished treachery insigne fourberie towards his brother the prince  he invited charles to supper his house was brilliantly lighted up all his servants were in readiness but he had made his escape by five oclock in the afternoon aided by cardinal tencin  his governor the chevalier graeme was not in the secret  the prince waited for him till midnight and was in a mortal anxiety  he believed that the english attempts to kidnap or assassinate himself had been directed against his brother  at last after three days he received a letter from the duke of york explaining his fatal design to accept a cardinals hat  prince charles is determined never to return to rome but rather to take refuge in some hole in a rock  charles in fact saw that if he was to succeed in england he could not have too little connection with rome  dargenson describes his brother henry as italian superstitious a rogue avaricious fond of ease and jealous of the prince  cardinal tencin he says and lord and lady lismore have been bribed by england to wheedle henry into the cardinalate which england desires more than anything in the world  charles expressed the same opinion in an epigram  lady lismore for a short time believed to be the mistress of louis xv was deeply suspected  whatever may be the truth of these charges m de puysieux an enemy of charles succeeded at the foreign office to dargenson who had a queer sentimental liking for the prince cardinal tencin was insulted and was hostile the lismores were absolutely estranged if not treacherous there was a quarrel between james and henry in rome and charles in paris 35a  such was the state of affairs at the end of 1747 while pickle was still a prisoner in the tower of london engaged he tells us in acts of charity towards his fellowcaptives  meanwhile charless private conduct demands a moments attention madame de pompadour was all powerful at court 35b  this was therefore a favourable moment for charles in a chivalrous affection for the injured french queen his dead mothers kinswoman to insult the reigning favourite  madame de pompadour sent him billets on that thick smooth vellum paper of hers sealed with the arms of france the prince tossed them into the fire and made no answer it is pickle who gives us this information  maria theresa later stooped to call madame de pompadour her cousin  charles was prouder or less politic afterwards he stooped like maria theresa  for his part says dargenson the prince now amused himself with love affairs  madame de guemene almost ravished him by force they have quarrelled after a ridiculous scene he is living now with the princesse de talmond  he is full of fury and wishes in everything to imitate charles xii of sweden and stand a siege in his house like charles xii at bender  this was in anticipation of arrest after the treaty of aixlachapelle in which his expulsion from france was one of the conditions  this princesse de talmond as we shall see was the unworthy flora macdonald of charles in his later wanderings his protectress and unlike flora his mistress  she was not young madame daiguillon calls her vieille femme in a curious play la prison du prince charles edouard stuart written by dargenson in imitation of shakespeare 36a  the princesse nee marie jablonowski a cousin of the queen of france and of charles married anne charles prince de talmond of the great house of la trimouille in 1730  she must have been nearly forty in 1749 and some ten years older than her lover  we shall later when charles is concealed by the princesse de talmond present the reader with her portrait by the mordant pen of madame du deffand  here voltaires rhymed portrait may be cited   les dieux en la donnant naissance aux lieux par la saxe envahis lui donnerent pour recompense le gout quon ne trouve quen france    et lesprit de tous les pays   the princesse who frequented the philosophes appears to have encouraged charles in free thinking and ostentatious indifference in religion  he is a handsome prince and i should love him as much as my wife does says poor m de talmond in dargensons play but why is he not saintly and ruled by the congregation de saint ignace like his father  it is madame de talmond who preaches to him independence and incredulity  she is bringing the curse of god upon me  how old will she be before the conversion for which i pray daily to saint francois xavier  such was madame de talmond an old mistress of a young man flighty philosophical and sharp of tongue  on july 18 1748 charles communicated to louis xv his protest against the article of the peace of aixlachapelle which drove him out of every secular state in europe  louis broke a solemn treaty by assenting to this article  charles published his protest and sent it to montesquieu  he complained that montesquieu had not given him the new edition of his book on the romans  la confiance devroit etre mieux etabli entre les auteurs  jespere que ma facon de penser pour vous mattirera la continuation de votre bonne volonte pour moi 37a  montesquieu praised charless simplicity nobility and eloquence  comme vous le dites tres bien vous estes un auteur were you not so great a prince the duchesse de guillon daiguillon and i would secure you a place in the academy  the duchesse daiguillon who later watched by montesquieus death bed was a friend of charles  she and madame de talmond literally pull caps for him in dargensons play  but she was in favour of his going to fribourg with a pension after the peace  madame de talmond encouraged resistance  louiss minister m de cousteille applied to fribourg for an asylum for charles on june 24 1748  on september 8 burnaby wrote for england a long remonstrance to the laudable states of fribourg calling charles this young italian the states in five lines rebuked burnabys impertinence as unconfined in its expressions and so unsuitable to a sovereign state that we did not judge it proper to answer it 38a  to fribourg charles would not go  he braved the french court in every way  he even insisted on a goldsmiths preferring his order for a great service of plate to the kings and having obtained the plate he feasted the princesse de talmond his friend and cousin the duc de bouillon and a crowd of other distinguished people 38b in his demeanour charles resolutely affronted the french ministers there were terrible scenes with madame de talmond especially when charles was forbidden the house by her husband  charles was led away from her closed door by bulkeley the brotherinlaw of marshal berwick and a friend of montesquieus 39a  thus the violence which afterwards interrupted and ended charless liaison with madame de talmond had already declared itself  one day according to dargenson the lady said you want to give me the second volume in your romance of compromising madame de montbazon his cousin with your two pistolshots  no more is known of this adventure  but charles was popular both in court and town  his resistance to expulsion was applauded  de gevres was sent by the king to entreat charles to leave france he received de gevres gallantly his hand on his swordhilt  dargenson saw him at the opera on december 3 1748 fort gai et fort beau admire de tout le public  on december 10 1748 charles was arrested at the door of the opera house bound hand and foot searched and dragged to vincennes  the deplorable scene is too familiar for repetition  one point has escaped notice  charles according to dargenson had told de gevres that he would die by his own hand if arrested  two pistols were found on him he had always carried them since his scottish expedition  but a pair of compasses was also found  now it was with a pair of compasses that his friend lally tollendal long afterwards attempted to commit suicide in prison  the pistols were carried in fear of assassination but what does a man want with a pair of compasses at the opera 40a  after some days of detention at vincennes charles was released was conducted out of french territory and made his way to avignon where he resided during january and february 1749  he had gained the sympathy of the mob both in paris and in london  some of the french court including the dauphin were eager in his cause  songs and poems were written against louis xv dargenson as we know being out of office composed a play on charless martyrdom  so much contempt for louis was excited that a nail was knocked into the coffin of french royalty  the king at the dictation of england had arrested bound imprisoned and expelled his kinsman his guest and by the treaty of fontainebleau his ally  applause and pity from the fickle and forgetful the prince had won but his condition was now desperate  refusing to accept a pension from france he was poor his jewels he had pawned for the scottish expedition  he had disobeyed his fathers commands and mortally offended louis by refusing to leave france  his adherents in paris as their letters to rome prove were in despair  his party as has been shown was broken up into hostile camps  lochiel was dead lord george murray had been insulted and estranged  the earl marischal had declined charless invitation to manage his affairs 1747  elcho was a persistent and infuriated dun  clancarty was reviling charles james louis england and the world at large madame de pompadour cardinal tencin and de puysieux were all hostile  the english jacobites though loyal were timid  europe was hermetically sealed against the prince  refuge in fribourg where the english threatened the town charles had refused  not a single shelter was open to him for englands policy was to drive him into the dominions of the pope where he would be distant and despised  of advisers he had only such attached friends as henry goring bulkeley harrington or such distrusted boon companions as kellyagainst whom the english jacobites set all wheels in motion charless refuge at avignon even was menaced by english threats directed at the pope  the prince tried to amuse himself he went to dances he introduced boxing matches 41a just as years before he had brought golf into italy  but his position was untenable and he disappeared  from the gossip of dargenson we have learned that charles was no longer the same man as the gallant leader of the race to derby or the gay and resourceful young ascanius who won the hearts of the highlanders by his cheerful courage and contented endurance  he was now embittered by defeat by suspicions of treachery which the irish about him kindled and fanned by the broken promises of louis xv by the indifference of spain  he had become a wild man as his fathers secretary edgar calls himour dear wild man  he spelled the name lome sauvage  he was in brief a desperate a soured and a homeless outcast  his chief french friends were ladiesmadame de vasse madame de talmond and others  montesquieu living in their society and sending wine from his estate to the jacobite lord elibank rejoicing too in an irish jacobite housekeeper mlle betti was well disposed like voltaire in an indifferent wellbred way  most of these people were later protecting and patronising the prince when concealed from the view of europe but theirs was a vague and futile alliance  charles and his case were desperate  in this mood and in this situation at avignon he carried into practice the counsel which dargenson had elaborated in a written memoir  i gave them charles and henry the best possible advice says la bete  my memoire i entrusted to obrien at antwerp  therein i suggested that the two princes should never return to italy but that for some years they should lead a hidden and wandering life between france and spain  charles might be given a pension and the vicariat of navarre  this should only be allowed to slip out by degrees while england would grow accustomed to the notion that they were not in rome and would be reduced to mere doubts as to their place of residence  now they would be in spain now in france finally in some town of navarre where their authority would by slow degrees be admitted  peace once firmly established it would not be broken over this question  they would be in a huguenot country and able to pass suddenly into great britain 43  this was dargensons advice before henry fled rome to be made a cardinal and before the treaty of aixlachapelle closing europe against charles was concluded  the object of dargenson is plain he wished to keep charles out of the popes domains as england wanted to drive the prince into the centre of popery  if he resided in rome protestant england would always suspect charles moreover he would be remote from the scene of action  to the popes domains therefore charles would not go  but the scheme of skulking in france spain and navarre had ceased to be possible  he therefore adopted the fugitive and hidden life recommended by dargenson he secretly withdrew from avignon and for many months his places of residence were unknown  charles says voltaire hid himself from the whole world  we propose to reveal his hidingplaces    chapter iiithe prince in fairylandfebruary 1749september 1750 i  what the world said    europe after peace of aixlachapellea vast

manncharles and a strikecharles reported to be very illreally on the point of visiting englandseptember 1750  europe after the peace of aixlachapelle was like a vast political gambling establishment  nothing or nothing but the expulsion of prince charles from every secular state had been actually settled nobody was really satisfied with the peace  the populace in france as in england was discontented  princes were merely resting and looking round for new combinations of forces  the various courts from st petersburg to dresden from london to vienna were so many tables where the great game of national faro was being played over the heads of the people by kings queens abbes soldiers diplomatists and pretty women  projects of new alliances were shuffled and cut like the actual cards which were seldom out of the hands of the players when casanova or barry lyndon held the bank and challenged all comers  it was the age of adventurers from the mendacious casanova to the mysterious saintgermain from the chevalier deon to charles edward stuart  that royal player was warned off the turf as it were ruled out of the game  where among all these attractive tables was one on which prince charles in 1749 might put down his slender stake his name his sword the lives of a few thousand highlanders the fortunes of some faithful gentlemen who would accept charless empty alliance which promised little but a royal title and a desperate venture  the prince had wildly offered his hand to the czarina he was to offer that hand vainly stretched after a flying crown to a princess of prussia and probably to a lady of poland  at this moment the polish crown was worn by augustus of saxony who was reckoned a bad life  the polish throne the polish alliance had been after various unlucky adventures since the days of henri iii and the duc dalencon practically abandoned by france  but louis xv was beginning to contemplate that extraordinary intrigue in which conti aimed at the crown of poland and the comte de broglie was employed 1752 to undermine and counteract the schemes of louiss official representatives 46a  as a sobieski by his mothers side the son of the exiled james who himself had years before been asked to stand as a candidate for the kingdom of poland charles was expected by politicians to make for warsaw when he fled from avignon  it is said on the authority of a polish manuscript communicated by baron de rondeau that there was a conspiracy in poland to unseat augustus iii and give the crown to prince charles 46b  in 1719 charless maternal grandfather had declined a russian proposal to make a dash for the crown so the chivalrous wogan narrates  in 1747 june 6 chambrier had reported to frederick the great that cardinal tencin was opposed to the ambition of the saxon family which desired to make the elective crown of poland hereditary in its house  the cardinal said that in his opinion there was a prince who would figure well in poland le jeune edouard prince charles who had just made himself known and in whom there was the stuff of a man 46c  but frederick the great declined to interfere in polish matters and tencin was only trying to get rid of charles without a rupture  in may 1748 frederick refused to see graeme a jacobite who was sent to demand a refuge for the prince in prussia 46d  without frederick and without sweden charles in 1749 could do nothing serious in poland  the distracted politics of poland however naturally drew the attention of europe to that country when charles on february 28 vanished out of avignon into fairyland like frederick after molwitz  every court in europe was vainly searched for the boy that cannot be found  the newsletters naturally sent him to poland so did jacobite myth  the purpose of this chapter is to record the guesses made by diplomatists at charless movements and the expedients by which they vainly endeavoured to discover him  we shall next lift as far as possible the veil which has concealed for a century and a half adventures in themselves unimportant enough  in spite of disappointments and dark hours of desertion charles who was much of a boy probably enjoyed the mystery which he now successfully created  if he could not startle europe by a brilliant appearance on any stage he could keep it talking and guessing by a disappearance he obviously relished secrecy passwords disguises the properties of the conspirator in the spirit of tom sawyer and huckleberry finn  he came of an evasive race  his grandfather as duke of york had fled from england disguised as a girl  his father had worn many disguises in many adventures  he had been betty burke  though it is certain that in march 1749 the only month when he almost evades us charles could not have visited berlin livadia stockholm the reader may care to be reminded of a contemporary jacobite romance in which he is made to do all these things  a glance should be cast on the pamphlet called a letter from h gg esq  london 1750  the editor announces that the letter has been left in his lodgings by a mistake it has not been claimed as the person for whom it was meant has gone abroad and so the editor feels free to gratify the curiosity of the town  the piece in truth is a jacobite tract meant to keep up the spirits of the faithful and it is probable that the author really had some information though he is often either mistaken or fables by way of a blind  about february 11 says the scribe nominally henry goring charless equerry an exofficer of the queen of hungary a mysterious stranger the chevalier de la luze came to avignon and was received by the prince with extraordinary marks of distinction he understood not one word of english which destroys if true the theory that the earl marischal or marshal keith is intended french and italian he spoke well but with a foreign accent  kelly ventured to question the prince about the stranger but was rebuffed one day probably february 24 the stranger received despatches and vanished as he had come  the prince gave a supper dargensons ball and when his guests had retired summoned goring into his study  he told goring that there were spies about him the earl marischal we know distrusted kelly he rallied him on a love affair and said that goring only should be his confidant  next morning very early they two started for lyons disguised as french officers  as far as lyons indeed the french police actually traced them 49a  but according to the pamphlet they did not stop in lyons they rested at a small town two leagues further on whence the prince sent dispatches to kelly at avignon  engaging a new valet charles pushed to strasbourg where he again met la luze now described as a person whose extraordinary talents had gained him the confidence one of the wisest princes in europe obviously pointing to frederick of prussia the master of marshal keith and the friend and host of his brother the earl marischal  at strasbourg charles rescued a pretty young lady from a fire she lost her heart at once to the comte despoir his travelling title but the prince behaved like scipio not to mention a patriarch famous for his continence  i am no stoic said his royal highness to la luze but i have always been taught that pleasures how pardonable soever in themselves become highly criminal when indulged to the prejudice of another adding many other noble and unimpeachable sentiments  after a romantic adventure with english or scottish assassins in which his royal highness shot a few of them the travellers arrived at leipzig  la luze now assumed his real name and carried charles by cross roads to a certain court where he spent ten days with much satisfaction  he stayed at the house of la luze berlin and the earl marischal appear to be hinted at but the marischal told pickle that he had never seen charles at berlin secret business was done and then through territories friendly or hostile a certain port was reached  they sailed from dantzig were driven into a hostile port riga escaped and made another port stockholm where they met lochgarry whom the prince thought had been one of those that fell at culloden  this is nonsense  lochgarry had been with charles after culloden and had proposed to waylay cumberland which the prince forbade murray of broughton in his examination and bishop forbes agree on this point and james we know sent by edgar a message to lochgarry on christmas eve 1748 50a  charles therefore knew excellently well that lochgarry did not die at culloden  after royal but very secret entertainment in this kingdom sweden charles went into lithuania where old friends of his maternal ancestors the sobieskis welcomed him  he resumed a gaiety which he had lost ever since his arrest at the opera in paris and had an interview with a most illustrious and firm friend to his person and interest  though his marriage says the pamphleteer had been much talked of he has always declined making any applications of that nature himself  it was his fixed determination to beget no royal beggars  dargenson reports charless remark that he will never marry till the restoration and no doubt he was occasionally this mood among others 51a  the pamphleteer vows that the prince loves and is loved but will not marry till his affairs take a more favourable turn  the lady is of consummate beauty yet is that beauty the least of her perfections  the pamphlet concludes with vague enigmatic hopes and promises and certainly leaves its readers little wiser than they were before  in the opinion of the messrs sobieski stuart who called themselves his grandsons charles really did visit sweden and his jewel as grand master of the grand masonic lodge of stockholm is still preserved there 51b  the castle where he resided in lithuania it is said is that of radzivil 51c  the affectionate and beautiful lady is the princess radzivil to whom the newspapers were busy marrying charles at this time  the authors of tales of the century relying on some vague polish traditions think that a party was being made to raise the prince to the polish crown  in fact there is not a word of truth in henry gorings letter  we now study the perplexities of courts and diplomatists  pickle was not yet at hand with accurate intelligence and even after he began to be employed the english government left their agents abroad to send in baffled surmises  from paris on march 8 colonel joseph yorke whom dargenson calls by many ill names wrote i am told for certain that he the prince is now returned to avignon 52a mann in florence hears march 7 that the prince has sent a mr lockhart to james to ask for money but that was really done on december 31 1748 52b  on march 11 yorke learned from puysieux that the prince had been recognised by postboys as he drove through lyons towards metz probably puysieux thought on an affair of gallantry  others says yorke have sent him to poland or sweden which even in 1746 had been getting ready troops to assist charles in scotland 52c  on march 20 yorke hints that charles may be in or near paris as he probably was  berlin was suggested as his destination by horace mann april 4  again he has been seen in disguise walking into a gate of paris april 11 52d  on april 14 walton from florence writes that james has had news of his son is much excited and is sending fitzmorris to join him  the pope knows and is sure to blab 52e  on may 3 yorke mentions a rumour often revived that the prince is dead  on may 9 the jacobites in paris show a letter from oxford inviting charles to the opening of the radcliffe where they assure him of better reception than the university has had at court lately 53a  mann may 2 mentions the radzivil marriage arranged in a selfdenying way by the princesse de talmond  on may 17 yorke hears from puysieux that the french ambassador in saxony avers that charles is in poland and that sir charles williams has remonstrated with count bruhl  on may 1 1749 sir charles hanbury williams wrote from leipzig to the duke of newcastle  he suspects that charles is one of several persons who have just passed through leipzig on the way to poland count bruhl is almost certain of it 53b  on may 5 when charles was really in or near venice hanbury williams sends a copy of his remonstrance with bruhl  i asked count bruhl whether in the present divided and factious state of the nobility of poland his polish majesty would like to have a young adventurer who can fish in no waters that are not troubled and who by his mother is allied to a family that once sat upon the polish throne to go into that country where it would be natural for him to endeavour to encourage factions nourish divisions and foment confederations to the utmost of his power and might not the evilminded and indisposed poles be glad to have such a tool in their hands which at some time or other they might make use of to answer their own ends  to this count bruhl answered in such terms as i could wish and i must do him the justice to say that he showed the best disposition to serve his majesty in the affair in question but i am yet of opinion that whatever is done effectually in this case must be done by the court of petersburg and i would humbly advise that as soon as it is known for certain that the pretenders son is in poland his majesty should order his minister at the court of petersburg to take such steps as his majestys great wisdom shall judge most likely to make the czarina act with a proper vigour upon this occasion  your grace knows that the republic of poland is at present divided into two great factions the one which is in the interest of russia to which the friends of the house of austria attach themselves the other is in the interest of france and prussia  as i thought it most likely if the pretenders son went into poland he would seek protection from the french party i have desired and requested the french ambassador that he would write to the french resident at warsaw and to others of his friends in poland that he might be informed of the truth of the pretenders arrival and the place that he was at in poland as soon as possible and that when he was acquainted with it he would let me know what came to his knowledge all which he has sincerely promised me to do and i do not doubt but he will keep his word     it is publicly said that the pretenders sons journey to poland is with a design to marry a princess of the house of radzivil  as soon as i hear anything certain about the pretenders son being in poland i will most humbly offer to your grace the method that i think will be necessary for his majesty to pursue with respect to the king and republic of poland in case his majesty should think fit not to suffer the pretenders son to remain in that country  c hanbury williams   on may 12 williams believes that charles is not in poland  on may 18 he guesses wrongly that the prince is in paris  on may 25 he fanciesplainly perceivesthat the french ambassador at dresden believes in the polish theory  on june 9 bruhl tells williams correctly that charles is in venice  on june 11 hanbury williams proposes to have a harmless priest seized and robbed and to kidnap prince charles  i give this example of british diplomatic energy and chivalrous behaviour   from sir charles hanbury williams dresden  june 11 ns 1749      count bruhl has communicated to me the letters which he received by the last post from the saxon resident at venice who says that the pretenders son had been at venice for some days that he has received two expresses from his father at rome since his being there but that nobody knew how long he intended to stay there   mons bruhl further informs me that he hears from poland that the prince of radzivil who is great general of lithuania has a strong desire to marry his daughter to the pretenders son  the young lady is between eleven and twelve years old very plain and can be no great fortune for she has two brothers but yet mons bruhl is of opinion that there is some negotiation on foot for this marriage which is managed by an italian priest who is a titular bishop whose name is lascarisk sic and who lives in and governs the prince radzivils family  this priest is soon to set out for italy under pretence of going to rome for the jubilee year but mons bruhl verily thinks that he is charged with a secret commission for negotiating the abovementioned marriage  if his majesty thinks it worth while to have this priest watched i will answer for having early intelligence of the time he intends beginning his journey and then it would be no difficult matter to have him stopped and his papers taken from him as he goes through the austrian territories into italy  the more i think of it the more i am persuaded that the pretenders son will not go into poland for many reasons especially for one which is that for a small sum of money i will undertake to find a pole who will engage to seize upon his person in any part of poland and carry him to any port in the north that his majesty shall appoint  i have had offers of this sort already made me to which your grace may be sure i gave no answer except thanking the persons for the zeal they showed for the king my master but i am convinced that the thing is very practicable  i had this day the honour to dine with the king of poland and as i sat next to him at table he told me that he was very glad to hear that the pretenders son was at length found to be at venice for that he would much rather have him there than in poland to which i answered that i was very glad upon his polish majestys account that the pretenders son had not thought fit to come into any of his majestys territories since i believed the visit would be far from being agreeable  to which the king of poland replied that it would be a very disagreeable visit to him and after that expressed himself in the handsomest manner imaginable with respect to his majesty and the regard he had for his sacred person and royal house and i am convinced if the pretenders son had gone into poland his polish majesty and his minister would have done everything in their power to have drove him out of that kingdom as soon as possible  c hanbury williams  pssince my writing this letter count bruhl tells me that the news of the pretenders sons being at venice is confirmed by letters from his best correspondent at rome but both accounts agree in the pretenders sons being at venice incognito and that he appears in no public place so that very few people know of his being there     c h w   in 1751 hanbury williams renewed his proposal about waylaying lascaris  charles as we shall see was for a short time at venice in may 1749 meanwhile the game of hide and seek through europe went on as merrily as ever  lord hyndford so well known to readers of mr carlyles frederick now opens in full cry from moscow but really on a hopelessly wrong scent  as illustrating hyndfords opinion of frederick who had invested him with the order of the thistle we quote this worthy diplomatist   lord hyndford to the duke of newcastle 58a moscow  june 19 1749      i must acquaint your grace of what i have learnt through a private canal from the last relation of mr gross the russian minister at berlin although i dare say it is no news to your grace mr gross writes that some days before the date of his letter the pretenders eldest son arrived at potsdam and had been very well received by the king of prussia general keith and his brother the late earl marshal and all the other english scotch and irish jacobites in the prussian service were to wait upon him  this does not at all surprise me but mons valony the french minister went likewise to make his compliments at a country house hired on purpose for this young vagabond  this is all that i know as yet of this affair in general for the chancellor has not thought proper as yet to inform me of the particulars  however this public incontestable proof of the little friendship and regard the king of prussia has for his majesty and his royal family and for the whole british nation will i hope open the eyes of the people who are blind to that princes monstrous faults if any such are still left amongst us and i doubt not but it will save his majesty the trouble of sending sir c hanbury williams or any other minister to that perfidious court  hyndford   this was all a mares nest but hyndford is for kidnapping the prince  he writes   moscow  june 26 1749  my lordsince the 19th inst which was the date of my last letter to your grace i have been with the chancellor who made his excuses that he had not sooner communicated to me the intelligence which mr gross the russian minister at berlin had sent him concerning the pretenders eldest son  the chancellor confirmed all that i wrote to your grace on the 19th upon that subject and he told me that he had received a second letter from mr gross wherein that minister says that the young pretender had left the country house where he was in the neighbourhood of berlin and had entirely disappeared without its being hitherto possible for him mr gross or count choteck the austrian minister to find out the route he has taken although it is generally believed that he is gone into poland and that now the king of prussia and his ministers deny that ever the pretenders son was there and take it mightily amiss of anybody that pretends to affirm it  i am sorry that the russian troops are not now in poland for otherwise i believe it would have been an easy matter to prevail upon this court to catch this young knight errant and to send him to siberia where he would not have been any more heard of and if the court of dresden will enter heartily into such a scheme it will not be impossible yet to apprehend him and as it is very probable that the king of prussia has sent him into poland to make a party and breed confusion it appears to be king augustuss interest to secure him  hyndford   many months later on feb 2 17491750 lord hyndford writing from hanover retracted  the rumour of charless presence at berlin he found was started by count de choteck the austrian ambassador  in fact choteck used to meet a fair lady secretly in a garden near berlin and near the house of fieldmarshal keith and his brother lord marischal  hard by was an inn where a stranger lodged a rich and handsome youth whom choteck meeting took for prince charles he was really a young polish gentleman into whose reasons for retirement we need not examine  frederick in his mischievous way wrote about all this from potsdam on june 24 1749  we have played a trick on choteck he spends much on spies and to prove that he is well served he has taken it into his head that young edouard really at venice is at berlin  he has been very busy over this and no doubt has informed his court  on july 7 1749 frederick in a letter to his minister at moscow said that only dense ignorance could credit the berlin legend 61  these documents certainly demonstrate that the prince fluttered the courts and that the jacobite belief in english schemes to kidnap or murder him was not a mere mythical delusion  only an opportunity was wanted  he had spared the duke of cumberlands life even after the horrors of culloden  but hanbury williams knows a pole who will waylay him hyndford wants to carry him off to siberia  it was not once only on the other hand but twice at least that charles protected the butcher cumberland  in 1746 he saved his enemy from lochgarrys open attempt  in 1747 may 4 a certain father myles macdonnell wrote from st germain to james in rome  he dwells on the jealousies among the jacobites and particularly denounces kelly then a trusted intimate of charles  kelly he says is a drunkard and worse  it was probably he who raised a scruple against a scheme relating to cumberlands hateful person  honest warrantable people from london came to paris and offered without either fee or reward to do the business  what was the business what measures were to be taken against cumberlands hateful person father myles macdonnell writing to james a catholic priest to a catholic king does not speak of assassination  he talks of the scruple raised against securing cumberlands person  i suspect parson kelly of making a scruple of an action the most meritorious that could possibly be committed writes father myles 62a  the talk of kidnapping in such cases as those of cumberland and prince charlesmen of spirit and armedis a mere blind  murder is meant father myless letter proves that unknown to james in rome there was a london conspiracy to kill the butcher but prince charles again rejected the proposal  he was less ungenerous than hyndford and hanbury williams  the amusing thing is that the english government knew quite as well as father macdonnell or james all about the conspiracy to slay the duke of cumberland  here is the information which reached mann through rome 62b   from mr thomas chamberlayne to sir h mann  capranica  november 18 1747      the family at rome    was informed by one who arrived there last october from london that there are twelve persons whose names i could not learn but none of distinction that are formed in a club or society and meet at the nags head in east street holborn  they have bound themselves under most solemn oaths that this winter they will post themselves in different parts of the city of london mostly frequented by his royal highness the duke of cumberland in his night visits to whom and are resolved to lay violent hands on his royal person  the parole among the different parties in their respective posts is the bloody butcher  they are all resolute fellows who first declared at their entering in this conspiracy to despise death or torture  this motive is worthy of your care so i am certain youll make proper use of it     thomas chamberlayne   if charles afterwards attempted to repay in kind the attentions of his royal cousins or of their ministers this can hardly be reckoned inhuman  if he was fluttering the courts theyprussia russia france polandwere leading him the life of a tracked beast  they were determined to drive him into the papal domains even in venice he was harried by spies 63  on may 30 to retrace our steps mann from florence reports that charles has arrived at the papal nuncios in venice attended by one servant in the livery of the duke of modena  walton adds that he has not a penny june 6  walton july 11 writes from florence that the prince is reported from venice to have paid assiduous court to the second daughter of the duke of modena a needy potentate but that he suddenly disappeared 64 on sept 5 1749 walton says he is in france  on sept 26 walton writes that he is offering his sword to the czarina who declines he is at lubeck or oct 3 at avignon  on oct 20 mann writes that from lubeck charles has asked the imperial ambassador at paris to implore the kaiser to give him an asylum in his states  on oct 31 mann only knows that the pope and james reciprocally ask each other news about the prince  on jan 23 1750 poor mann is quite at a loss  james receives letters from the prince but never with date of place otherwise mann would have been better informed walton hears that james believes charles to be imprisoned in a french fortress  from paris jan 17 1750 albemarle wrote that he heard the prince was in berlin  the prince later told pickle that he had been in berlin more than once and as we shall see frederick amused him with hopes of assistance  kelly has left charless followers in distress at avignon  kelly in fact received his conge he was distrusted by the earl marischal and carte the historian  on jan 28 albemarle hears that charles has been in paris under the habit of a capuchine fryar and this was a disguise of his according to pickle  meanwhile the french government kept protesting their total ignorance  on april 3 1750 walton announces that james has had a long letter from charles containing his plans and those of his adherents for which he demands the royal approval  james has sent a long letter to charles by the courier of the duc de nivernais the french ambassador in rome  by the middle of june james is reported by walton to be full of hope and to have heard excellent news  but these expectations were partly founded on a real scheme of charles partly on a strike of colliers at newcastle  a mob orator there proclaimed the prince and the jacobites in rome thought that his royal highness was heading the strike 65a  in july the same illusions were entertained  on august 12 albemarle from paris reports the prince to be dangerously ill probably not far from the french capital  he was really preparing to embark for england albemarle by way of trap circulated in the english press a forged newsletter from nancy in lorraine dated august 24 1750  it announced charless death of pneumonia in hopes of drawing forth a jacobite denial  this stratagem failed  on august 4 james though piqued by being kept in the dark sent charles a fresh commission of regency 65b  of the princes english expedition of september 1750 the government of george ii knew nothing  pickle was in rome at the moment not with charles what pickle knew the english ministers knew but there is a difficulty in dating his letters before 1752 and i am not aware that any despatches of his from rome are extant  we have now brought the history to a point september 1750 where the prince for a moment emerges from fairyland and where we are not left to the perplexing conjectures of diplomatists in paris dresden florence hanover and st petersburg  in september 1750 charles certainly visited london  there is a point of light  we now give an account of his actual movements in 17491750    chapter ivthe

of observing the success of charles in mystifying europe  diplomatists ambassadors and wits would have been surprised indeed had they known that one of the most famous men of the age possessed the secret for which they were seeking  the author of lesprit des lois could have enlightened them for charless mystery was no mystery to montesquieu who was friendly with scottish and english jacobites  the french ministers truly or falsely always professed entire ignorance  they promised to arrest the prince wherever he might be found on french soil and transport him to sea by civita vecchia 68  it will be shown later that at least in the autumn of 1749 this ignorance was probably feigned  what is really known of the movements of the prince in 1749 curiously enough mr ewald does not seem to have consulted the stuart papers at windsor while the extracts in brownes history of the highland clans are meagre  to these papers then we turn for information  the most useful portions are not charless letters to james  these are brief and scanty  thus he writes from avignon january 15 1749 we are enjoying here the finest weather ever was seen  he always remarks that his health is perfect  he orders patterns for his servants liveries and a button blue and yellow still remains in a letter from edgar  the button outlasts the dynasty  our intelligence must be extracted from illspelled closely scrawled and much erased sheets of brown paper on which charles has scribbled drafts for letters to his household to waters his banker in paris to adherents in paris or london and to ladies the notes are almost and in places are quite illegible  the prince practised a disguised hand and used pseudonyms instead of names many letters have been written in sympathetic ink and then exposed to fire or the action of acids  however something can be made out but not why he concealed his movements even from his banker even from his household oxburgh kelly harrington and graeme  it is certain that he started with a marriage in his eye from avignon on february 28 1749 accompanied by henry goring of the austrian service  there had already been a correspondence vaguely hinted at by jamess secretary edgar between charles and the duke and a princess of hessedarmstadt  on february 24 1749 charles drafted at avignon a proposal for the hand of the dukes daughter  he also drafted undated a request to the king of poland for leave to bring his wife the princess of hessedarmstadt into polish territory 69  we may imagine his polish majestys answer  of course the marriage did not take place  charles had other secrets  on february 3 1749 he wrote to waters about the care to be taken with certain letters  these were a correspondence with thomas newton major kennedy at mr alexander macartys in grays inn london  newton was in relations with cluny macpherson through a friend in northumberland  cluny skulking on his highland estates was transmitting or was desired to transmit a part of the treasure of 40000 louis dor buried soon after culloden at the head of loch arkaig 70a  of this fatal treasure we shall hear much  a percentage of the coin was found to be false money a very characteristic circumstance  moreover cluny seems to have held out hopes always deferred of a rising in the highlands  charles had to be ready in secrecy to put himself at the head of this movement  there was also to be an english movement which was frowned on by official jacobitism  on february 3 1749 charles writes from avignon to thomas newton kennedy about the money sent south by cluny  he repeated his remarks on march 6 giving no place of residence  but probably he was approaching paris dangerous as such a visit was for in a note of march 6 to waters he says that he will soon call for letters 70b  his noms de guerre at this time were williams and benn later he chose john douglas  he was also smith mildmay burton and so forth  there should have been no difficulty in discovering charles  modern police in search of a person who is wanted spy on his mistress now the princesse de talmond when out of favour at versailles went to certain lands in lorraine near her exiled king stanislas  in lorraine therefore at luneville the court of the exking of poland or at commercy barleduc or wherever the princesse de talmond might be charles was sure to be heard of by an intelligent spy if permitted to enter the country  consequently we are not surprised to find charles drafting on april 3 at luneville where he resided at the house of one mittie physician of the exking of poland a project for my arrival in paris  mr benn himself must go straight to dijon and his companion mr smith goring to paris  mr smith will need a chaise which he must buy at luneville next he will take up the servant of c p prince charles at ligny but on leaving that place mr smith must ride on horseback and the chaise can go there as if for his return to paris the person in it seeming to profit by this opportunity  mr benn the prince must remain for some days as if he wanted to buy a trunk and will give his own as if in friendship to mr smith all this seeming mere chance work  next mr smith will go his way and his friend will go his after waiting a few days and on arriving at dijon must write to nobody except the letter to w waters  the chevalier graeme whom he must see and to whom he may mention having been at dijon on the princes business without naming his companion but as if alone knows nothing and graeme must be left in the dark as if he mr smith goring were in the same case and were waiting new orders in total ignorance not having seen me for a long time 71  there follow a few private addresses in paris and the name to be remarked of mademoiselle ferrand  all this is very puzzling we only make out that by some confusion of the personalities of benn the prince and mr smith goring charles hoped to enter paris undetected  yet he was seen entering a gate of paris in disguise  doubtless he had lady allies but a certain mademoiselle ferrand to whom he wrote he seems not to have known personally  we shall find that she was later of use to him and indeed his most valuable friend and ally  next we find this letter of april 10 to madame henrietta drummond doubtless of the family of macgregor called drummond of balhaldie charles appears to have had enough of paris and is going to venice he is anxious to meet the earl marischal   april 10 1749  i have been very impatient to be able to give you nuse of me as i am fully persuaded of yr friendship and concern for everything that regards me i send you here enclosed a letter for ld marishal be pleased to enclose it and forward it without loss of time the bearer he is neither known by you or me is charged to receive at any time what letters you want to send me and you may be shure of their arriving safe  iff lord marishal agrees with my desier when you give his packet to yr bearer you must put over it en dilligence iff otherwise direct by my name as i sign it here  i flatter myself of the continuation of your friendship as i hope you will never doubt of mine which shall be constant  i remain yr moste obedient humble servant  john douglas  pstell ye bearer when to comback for the answer of ye enclosed or any other letters you want to send me  ps to lord marischalwhatever party you take be pleased to keep my writing secret and address to me at venise to the sig ignazio testori to mr de villelongue under cover to a banquier of that town and it will come safe to me  to md henrietta drummond   charles on april 20 wrote another letter to the lord marischal imploring for an interview at some place to be fixed  but the old lord was not likely to go from berlin to venice whither charles was hastening  it is perfectly plain that leaving avignon on february 28 charles was making for paris on march 6 by a circuitous route through lorraine where he doubtless met madame de talmond and a double back on burgundy  what he did or desired in paris we do not know he is said to have visited lally tollendal and he must have seen waters his banker  by april 10 he is starting for venice where he had as a boy been royally received  but in 1744 the republic of venice had resumed relations with england interrupted by charless too kind reception in 1737  the whole romance therefore of henry gorings letter and all the voyages to stockholm berlin lithuania and so forth are visions  charles probably saw some friends in paris was tolerated in lorraine where his father was protected before 1715 and he vainly looked for a home in any secular state of europe  this was all or nearly all that occurred between march and may 1749  europe was fluttered secret service money was poured out like water diplomatists caballed and scribbled despatches all for very little  the best place to have hunted for charles was really at luneville near the gay court of his kinsman the duke stanislas leczinski the father of the queen of france  there charless sometime admirer voltaire was a welcome guest thither too as we saw went his elderly cousin people said his mistress the princesse de talmond  but the english diplomatists appear to have neglected luneville  dargenson was better informed  on april 26 charles was at strasbourg  here dargenson says he was seen and warned to go by an ecuyer of the late cardinal rohan hence he wrote again to the earl marischal at berlin  from this note it is plain that he had sent goring mr smith to the earl goring indeed had carried his letters of april l020  he again proposes a meeting with the earl marischal at venice  he will answer for the expenses and apologises for such a long and fatiguing journey  he wrote to waters you may let mr newton know that whenever he has thoroly finished his business mr williams the prince will make him very wellcum in all his cuntrihouses  the business of mr newton was to collect remittances from cluny  on april 30 the prince as mr williams expresses his surprise and impatience for the delay of the horses money and other goods promised by mr newton  on may 3 charles wrote without address to goring i go strete to venice and would willingly avoid your garrison towns as much as possible  id est of france  i believe to compass that by goin by ruffach to pfirt  there to wate for me  the chese chaise you may either leve it in consine to your postmaster of belfort or what is still better to give it to the bearer  goring and harrington were to meet the bearer at belfort but harrington seems to have been mystified and to have failed in effecting a junction  the poor gentleman we learn from letters of stafford and sheridan charless retainers at avignon could scarcely raise money to leave that town  sir james harrington was next to meet charles at venice  he was to carry a letter for charles to a venetian banker  nota bene that same banquier though he will deliver to me your letter knows nothing about me nor who i am     change your name and in fine keep as private as possible till i tell you what is to be done  harrington failed and lay for months in pawn at venice pouring out his griefs in letters to goring  he was a lachrymose conspirator  these weary affairs are complicated by mysterious letters to ladies for example to mademoiselle lalasse je vous prie mademoiselle de rendre justice a mon inviolable attachement     may 3  he gives her examples of his natural and of his disguised handwriting probably she helped him in forwarding his correspondence  charless chief anxiety was to secure the lord marischal  bulkeley and the official english jacobites kept insisting that he should have a man with him who was trusted by the party  kelly was distrusted though bulkeley defends him and was cashiered in autumn  charless friends also kept urging that he must appear in public but where bulkeley suggested bologna  the earl marischal later july 5 was for fribourg  no place was really both convenient and possible  on may 17 charles wrote from venice to the earl marischal i am just arrived but will not be able for some days to know what reception to meet with  he fears he may be chased from hence and his fears were justified  on the same day may 17 he wrote to edgar in rome venice next to france is the best for my interest and the only one in italy  venice ejected the prince  on may 26 he wrote to his father  siri received last night from ye nuntio a definitive answer about my project which is quite contrary to my expectation as i have nothing further to do here and would not run the least risk of being found out i depart this very evening having left a direction to the said nuntio how to forward my letters for me  on the same day he wrote to chioseul de stainville the minister at versailles of the empress could an anonymous exiled prince be received by the kaiser and the queen of hungary  he would remain incognito  on june 3 charles wrote to james without address or news and to bulkeley  now my friend must skulk to the perfect dishonour and glory of his worthy relations until he finds a reception fitting at home or abroad  on the back of the draft he writes  what can a bird do that has not found a right nest  he must flit from bough to boughainsi use les irondel  probably charles after a visit perhaps to ferrara returned to paris and his princess  we find a draft thus conceived and spelled   arrengement  goring to come here immediately he to know nothing but that i am just arrived  i am not to go to paris but at the end of the month as sooner no answer can be had moreover perhaps obliged to wait another which would oblige me to remain to long in p  he also june 3 wrote to montesquieu from whom i think there is an unsigned friendly letter  he sent compliments to the duchesse daiguillon a lady much attached to montesquieu  an unsigned english letter june 5 advised him to appear publicly  people are coming to inquire into reports about his character after which it is possible some proposals may be made to you  the writer will say more when in a safer place  newton kennedy meanwhile had been imprisoned and examined in london but had been released and was at paris  he bought for the prince a fine case of double barrill pistols made by barber and much admired on this side  charles expresses gratitude for the gift  newton had been examined by the duke of newcastle about the 40000 louis dor buried at loch arkaig in 1740 but had given no information  on june 26 charles again asks bulkeley what can a bird do that has found no right nest  on june 30 the prince was probably in paris whither we have seen that he meant to go  he had found a right nest and a very curious nest he had found  the secret of the princes retreat became known many years later to grimm the paris correspondent of catherine the great  charless biographers have overlooked or distrusted grimms gossip but it is confirmed by charless accidentally writing two real names in place of pseudonyms in his correspondence  the history of his nest was this  after her reign as favourite of louis xiv madame de montespan founded a convent of st joseph in the rue st dominique in the faubourg st germain  attached to the convent were rooms in which ladies of rank might make a retreat or practically occupy chambers 79  about this convent and its inmates grimm writes as follows  the unfortunate prince charles after leaving the bastille really vincennes lay hidden for three years in paris in the rooms of madame de vasse who then resided with her friend the celebrated mademoiselle ferrand at the convent of st joseph  to mademoiselle de ferrand the abbe condillac owed the ingenious idea of the statue which he has developed so well in his treatise on the sensations the princesse de talmond with whom prince charles was always much in love inhabited the same house  all day he was shut up in a little garderobe of madame de vasses whence by a secret staircase he made his way at night to the chambers of the princesse  in the evening he lurked behind an alcove in the rooms of mademoiselle ferrand  thus unseen and unknown he enjoyed every day the conversation of the most distinguished society and heard much good and much evil spoken of himself  the existence of the prince in this retreat and the profound mystery which so long hid him from the knowledge of the world by a secret which three women shared and in a house where the flower of the city and the court used to meet seems almost miraculous  m de choiseul who heard the story several years after the departure of the prince could not believe it  when minister of foreign affairs he wrote to madame de vasse and asked her for the particulars of the adventure  she told him all and did not conceal the fact that she had been obliged to get rid of the prince because of the too lively scenes between him and madame de talmond  they began in tender effusions and often ended in a quarrel or even in blows  this fact we learn from an intimate friend of madame de vasse 80  there is exaggeration here  the prince was not living a life fugitive and cloistered for three whole unbroken years  but the convent of st joseph was one of his hidingplaces from 1749 to 1752 of madame de vasse i have been unable to learn much  a lady of that name was presented at court in 1745 and the duc de luynes describes her as conveniently handsome  she is always alluded to as la grandemain in charless correspondence but once he lets her real name slip out in a memorandum  mademoiselle ferrands father is apparently described by dhozier as ferrand ecuyer sieur des marres et de ronville en normandie  many of charless letters are addressed to mademoiselle luci sister of la grandemain  now madame de vasse seems from a passage in the duc de luyness memoires to have been the only daughter of her father m de peze but once charles writing to mademoiselle luci addresses the letter to mademoiselle la marre for marres  now as marres was an estate of the ferrands this address seems to identify mademoiselle luci with mademoiselle ferrand the intimate friend not really the sister of madame de vasse  mademoiselle ferrand as grimm shows had a taste for philosophy  we shall remark the same taste in the princes friend mademoiselle luci  thus the secret which puzzled europe is revealed  the prince sought vainly in poland prussia italy silesia and staffordshire was really lurking in a fashionable parisian convent  better had he been where the wind blows over seven glens and seven bens and seven mountain moors like the prince in the gaelic fairy stories  we return to details  on june 30 1749 the prince still homeless writes a curious letter to mademoiselle ferrand  the confidence mademoiselle which i propose to place in you may seem singular as i have not the good fortune to know you  the comtesse de routh however will be less surprised  this lady was the wife of an irishman commanding a regiment in the french service one of those stationed on the frontier of flanders  you mademoiselle ferrand who have made a relation de cartouche the famous robber may consent to be the depositary of my letter  i pray you to give this letter to the comtesse de routh and to receive from her all the packets addressed to monsieur douglas  he then requests madame de routh not to let the waterses know that she is the intermediary  the reason for all this secrecy is obvious  dargenson not the bete but his brother had threatened waters with the loss of his head if he would not tell where the prince was concealed 82  the banker did not want to know the dangerous fact and was able to deny his knowledge with a clear conscience  on july 23 charles again wrote to mademoiselle ferrand  it is very bold of cartouche to write once more without knowing whether you wish to be concerned with him but people of our profession are usually impudent indeed we must be if we are to earn our bread     i pray you to have some confidence in this handwriting and to believe that cartouche though he be cartouche is a true friend  as for his smuggling business even if it does not succeed as he hopes he will be none the less grateful to all who carry his flag as he will be certain that if he fails it is because success is impossible 83  this letter was likely to please a romantic girl as we may suppose mademoiselle ferrand to have been despite her philosophy  stafford and sheridan now kept writing pitiful appeals for money from avignon  charles answers july 31 1749  i wish i were in a situation at present to relive them i estime in an exotick cuntry that desiers nothing else but to exercise their arbitrary power in distressing all honest men even them that are most allies to their own soverain  charles in fact was himself very poor  when money came in either from english adherents or from the loch arkaig hoard he sent large remittances to avignon  money did come in partly no doubt from english adherents  we find the following orders from the prince to colonel goring   from the prince to goring  ye 31st july 1749  i gave you lately a proof of my confidence by our parting together from avignion so that you will not be surprized of a new instance you are to repair on receipt of this to london there to let know to such friends as you can see my situation and resolutions all tending to nothing else but the good and relieve of our poor country which ever was and shall be my only thoughts  take care of yrself do not think to be on a detachement but only a simple minister that is to comback with a distinct account from them parts and remain assured of my constant friendship and esteem  c p r  for goring  pscypher  i  s h a l  c o n q u e r  3 w k y p t d b q x m f  my name shall be john douglas  jean noe dorville  fils  a frankfort sur maine a banquier of that town   the prince may have been at frankfort but as a rule he was hiding in lorraine when not in paris or near it and as we have seen was under the protection of various french and fashionable flora macdonalds  of these ladies madame de beauregard and the princesse de talmond are apparently the same person  with them or her she also appears as la tante and la vieille charless relations were stormy  he wearied her he broke with her he scolded her and returned to her again  another protectress madame daiguillon was the mistress of the household most frequented by montesquieu le filosophe as charles calls him  madame du deffand has left to us portraits of both the princesse de talmond and madame daiguillon  madame de talmond has beauty and wit and vivacity that turn for pleasantry which is our national inheritance seems natural to her     but her wit deals only with pleasant frivolities her ideas are the children of her memory rather than of her imagination  french in everything else she is original in her vanity  ours is more sociable inspires the desire to please and suggests the means hers is truly sarmatian artless and indolent she cannot bring herself to flatter those whose admiration she covets     she thinks herself perfect says so and expects to be believed  at this price alone does she yield a semblance of friendship  semblance i say for her affections are concentrated on herself    she is as jealous as she is vain and so capricious as to make her at once the most unhappy and the most absurd of women  she never knows what she wants what she fears whom she loves or whom she hates  there is no nature in her expression  with her chin in the air she poses eternally as tender or disdainful absent or haughty all is affectation     she is feared and hated by all who live in her society  yet she has truth courage and honesty and is such a mixture of good and evil that no steadfast opinion about her can be entertained  she pleases she provokes  we love hate seek and avoid her  it is as if she communicated to others the eccentricity of her own caprice  where a character like hers met a nature like the princes peace and quiet were clearly out of the question  madame du deffand is not more favourable to another friend of charles madame daiguillon  this lady gave a supper every saturday night where neither her husband the lover of the princesse de conti nor her son later the successor of choiseul as minister of louis xv was expected to appear  the most brilliant men french or foreign were her guests attracted by her abundant active impetuous and original intellect by her elevated conversation and her kindness of manner 86  she was according to gustavus iii the living gazette of the court the town the provinces and the academy  voltaire wrote to her rhymed epistles  says madame du deffand her mouth is fallen in her nose crooked her glance wild and bold and in spite of all this she is beautiful  the brilliance of her complexion atones for the irregularity of her features  her waist is thick her bust and arms are enormous yet she has not a heavy air  her energy gives her ease of movement  her wit is like her face brilliant and out of drawing  profusion activity impetuosity are her ruling qualities    she is like a play which is all spectacle all machines and decorations applauded by the pit and hissed by the boxes      montesquieu was hardly a spectator in the pit yet he habitually lived at madame daiguillons she is original he said and she with madame dupre de saintmaur watched by the deathbed of the philosopher 87  in unravelling the hidden allusions of charless correspondence i at first recognised madame daiguillon in charless friend la grandemain  the name seemed a suitable sobriquet for a lady with gros bras like madame daiguillon might have large hands  the friendship of la grandemain with the philosophe montesquieu also pointed to madame daiguillon  but charles at a later date makes a memorandum that he has deposited his strong box with money at the rooms of la comtesse de vasse in the rue saint dominique faubourg st germain  that box again as he notes was restored by la grandemain  this fact with grimms anecdote identifies la grandemain not with madame daiguillon but with madame de vasse the comtesse as goring calls her though grimm makes her a marquise  if montesquieus private papers and letters in ms had been published in full we should probably know more of this matter his relations with bulkeley were old and most intimate  before he died he confessed to father routh an irish jesuit whom voltaire denounces in candide  this routh must have been connected with colonel routh an irish jacobite in french service husband of charless friend la comtesse de routh  montesquieu himself though he knew as we shall show the princes secret was no conspirator  unluckily as we learn from m vians life of the philosopher his successors have been very chary of publishing details of his private existence  it is of course conceivable that helvetius who told hume that his house had sheltered charles is the philosophe mentioned by mademoiselle luci and madame de vasse  but charless proved relations with montesquieu and montesquieus known habit of frequenting the society of his lady neighbours in the convent of st joseph also his intimacy with charless friend bulkeley who attended his deathbed all seem rather to point to the author of lesprit des lois  the philosophes for a moment seem to have expected to find in prince charlie the philosopherking of platos dream  the princes distinguished friends unluckily did not succeed in inspiring him with common sense  on august 16 he defends the conduct of cette home ou tete de fer himself and he writes a few aphorisms maximes dun lome sauvage he aimed at resembling charles xii called dener bash by the turks for his obstinacy a nickname also given by lord marischal to the prince  like balen he was termed the wild by knights whom kings and courts can tame  he writes to the younger waters   to waters junior  ye 21st august 1749  i receive yrs of ye 8th  current with yr two as mentioned and i heve send their answers for avignon plese to enclose in it a credit for fifteen thousand livers to relive my family there at the disposal of stafford and sheridan  i am sorry to be obliged oftener to draw upon you than to remit and cannot help reflection on this occasion on the misery of that poor popish town and all their inhabitants not being worth four hundred louidors  mr b bulkeley mistakes as to my taking amis anything of him on the contrary i am charmed to heve the opinion of everybody particularly them like him as i am shure say nothing but what they think  but as i am so much imbibed in ye english air where my only concerns are i cannot help sometimes differing with ye inhabitants of forain climats  i remain all yours  15000 ff  credit for stafford and sheridan at avignon   newton kept writing meanwhile that cluny can do nothing till winter on account of the sheilings the summer habitations of the pastoral highlanders  there may have been sheilings near the hiding places of the loch arkaig treasure  on september 30 we find charles professing his inebranlable amitie for madame de talmond  he bids his courier stop at luneville as she may be at the court of stanislas there   the results of gorings mission to england may be gleaned from a cypher letter of malloch balhaldie to james  balhaldie had been in london he found the party staunch but frighted out of their wits  the usual names of the official jacobites are given barrymore sir william watkyns wynne and beaufort  but they are all alarmed by lord traquairs silly indiscretion in blabbing to murray of broughton of their concerns wherein he could be of no use  they had summoned balhaldie and complained of the influence of kelly an adviser bequeathed to charles by his old tutor sir thomas sheridan now dead  they saw well that the insurrection sir james harrington was negotiating to be begun at litchfield election and races in september 47 was incouraged and when that failed the insurrection attempted by lallys influence on one wilson a smuggler in sussex which could serve no end save the extinction of the unhappy men concerned in them therefore they had taken pains to prevent any they lamented the last steps the prince had taken here as scarcely reparable  goring had now been with them and they had insisted on the princes procuring a reconciliation with the french court  gorings only business was to say that the prince had parted with kelly lally sir james graeme and oxburgh and the whole and to assure friends in england that he would never more see any one of them  charles was therefore provided by his english friends with 15000l and the kings timid party of men with much to lose won a temporary triumph he sent 21000 livres to his avignon household adding i received yours with a list of my bookes  i find sumne missing of them particularly fra paulo sarpi and boccaccio which are both rare if you find any let me know it   charles was more of a bibliophile than might be guessed from his orthography   on november 22 1749 charles from luneville wrote a long letter to a lady speaking of himself in the third person  all approaches to avignon are guarded to prevent his return thither  despite the guards they assure me that he is in france and not far from the capital  the lieutenant of police has been heard to say by a person who informed me that he knew for certain the prince had come in secret to paris and had been at the house of monsieur lally  the king winks at all this but it is said that m de puysieux and the mistress madame de pompadour are as ill disposed as ever  i know from a good source that 15000l has been sent to the prince from england on condition of his dismissing his household 91   the spelling of this letter is correct and possibly the prince did not write it but copied it out  that louis xv winked at his movements is probable enough secretive as he was the king may have known what he concealed even from his minister de puysieux   on december 19 the prince who cannot have been far from paris sent goring thither to get my big muff and portfeul  i do not know which lady he addressed on december 10 as ladorable avec toute la tendresse possible  on november 28 r jackson writes from england  he saw dr king of st mary hall oxford who had been at lichfield races and had a list of the 275 gentlemen who were there  this mr jackson was going to jamaica to henry dawkins brother of jemmy dawkins a rich and scholarly planter who played a great part later in jacobite affairs  in 1750 february found charles still without a reply to his letter of may 26 in which he made an anonymous appeal for shelter in imperial territories  orders to goring who had been sent to lally bid him take care not to get benighted in the woods and dangerous places  a good deal is said about a marble bust of the prince at which lemoine is working the original probably of the plaster busts sold in autumn in red lion square  newton january 28 thinks cluny wilfully dilatory about sending the loch arkaig treasure and aeneas macdonald the banker one of the seven men of moidart accuses newton kennedy of losing 8001 of the money at newmarket races  in fact young glengarry and archibald cameron had been helping themselves freely to the treasure at this very time whence came endless trouble and recriminations as we shall see 92  on january 25 the prince was embroiled with madame de talmond  he writes obviously in answer to remonstrances  nous nous prometons de suivre en tout les volontes et les arrangemens de notre fidele amie et alliee l p d t nous retirer aux heures quil lui conviendra a la ditte p soit de jour soit de nuit soit de ses etats en foy de quoi nous signons  c  he had begun to bore the capricious lady  important intrigues were in the air  the prince resembled paper sparing pope in his use of scraps of writing material  one piece bears notes both of february and june 1750  on february 16 charles wrote to mr dormer an english jacobite  i order you to go to anvers and there to execute my instructions without delay  goring carried the letter  then comes a despatch of june which will be given under date  concerning the fatal hoard of loch arkaig newton writes thus   tho newton to   march 18 1750  you have on the other side the melancholy confirmation of what i apprehended  dr cameron is no doubt the person here mentioned that carryd away the horses money for he is lately gone to rome as is also young glengery those and several others of them have been very flush of money so that it seems they took care of themselves  c cluny in my opinion is more to be blamed than any of them for if he had a mind to act the honest part he certainly could have given up the whole long since  they will no doubt represent me not in the most advantageous light at rome for attempting to carry out of their country what they had to support them  i hope they will one day or other be obliged to give an acct of this money if so least they shd attempt to impose upon you youl find my receipts to c will exactly answer what i had already the honour of giving you an acct of   again newton writes   tho newtonfrom g waterss letter  april 27 1750  i am honored with yours of the 6th inst and nothing could equal my surprize at the reception of the letter i sent you  i did not expect c cluny was capable of betraying the confidence you had in him and he is the more culpable as i frequently put it in his power to acquit himself of his duty without reproach of any side  only cameron is returned from rome greatly pleased with the reception he met there  i have not seen him but he has bragged of this to many people here since his return  i never owned to any man alive to have been employed in that affair   in spite of newton it is not to be credited that cluny lurking in many perils on ben alder was unfaithful about the treasure  meanwhile young glengarry whose history we give later archibald cameron lochiels brother sir hector maclean and other jacobites were in rome probably to explain their conduct about the loch arkaig treasure to james  he knew nothing about the matter and what he said will find its proper place when we come to investigate the history of young glengarry  the prince at this time corresponded a good deal with mademoiselle luci that fair philosophical recluse who did little commissions for him in paris  on april 4 he wants a list of the books he left in paris and shows a kind heart  pray take care of the young surgeon m le coq and see that he wants for nothing  as the lad gets no money from his relations he may be in need  charles on march 28 writes thus to madame de beauregard which appears to be an alias of madame de talmond   the prince  march 28 1750  a md bauregor  je vois avec chagrin que vous vous tourmentes et mois aussi bien innutillement et en tout sans sens  ou vous voules me servire ou vous ne le voules pas ou vous voules me protege ou non il ny a acune autre alternative en raison qui puis etre  si vous voules me servire il ne faut pas me soutenire toujours que blan blanc est noire dans les chose les plus palpable  et jamais avouer que vous aves tort meme quant vous le santes  si vous ne voules pas me servire il est inutile que je vous parle de ce qui me regarde  si vous voules me protege il ne faut pas me rendre la vie plus malheureuse quil nest  si vous voules mabandoner il faut me le dire en bon francois ou latin  visus solum sic   madame de talmond sheltered the prince both in lorraine and in paris they were unluckily born to make each others lives insupportable  charles wrote this letter probably to madame daiguillon from paris   may 12 1750  la multitude daffaire de toute espece dont jai ete plus que surcharge madame depuis plus de quatre mois chose que votre chancelier a du vous

private affairs may 12 by waterss note of his inability to get a packet of scottish tartan sent by archibald cameron out of the hands of the custom house  it was confiscated as of british manufacture  again on may 18 charles wrote to mademoiselle luci in paris  she is requested de faire avoire une ouvrage de mr fildings auteur de tom jones qui sapel joseph andrews dans sa langue naturelle et la traduction aussi  he also wants tom jones in french and we may infer that he is teaching to some fair pupil the language of fielding  he asks too for a razorcase with four razors a shaving mirror and a strong pocketbook with a lock  his famous chese de post post chaise is to be painted and repaired  business of a graver kind is in view  newton april 24 is to get ready to accompany the prince on a long journey really to england it seems  newton asked for a delay on account of family affairs he was only to be known to the bearer as mr newton of course not his real name  on may 28 charles makes a mote about a mysterious lady really madame de talmond   project  if ye lady abandons me at the last moment to give her the letter here following for ye f k french king and even ye original if she thinks it necessary but with ye greatest secrecy apearing to them already in our confidence that i will quit the country if she does not return to me immediately   drafts of letters to the french king in connection with madame de talmondto be delivered apparently if charles died in england will be given later  to england he was now bent on making his way ye prince is determined to go over at any rate he wrote on a draft of may 3 1750 97  the person who makes the proposal of coming over assures that he will expose nobody but himself supposing the worst  sir charles goring is to send a ship for his brother henry goring to antwerp early in august  to visit mr p of d unknown    and to agree where the arms c may be most conveniently landed the grand affair of l london to be attempted at the same time  there are notes on referring the funds to a free parliament the tory landed interest wished to repudiate the national debt to acquaint particular persons that the k king will r resign which james had no intention of doing  in preparation for the insurrection charles under extreme secrecy deposited 186000 livres livers with waters  he also ordered little silver counters with his effigy as the english government came to know for distribution and he commanded a miniature of himself by le brun with all the orders  this miniature may have been a parting gift to madame de talmond or one of the other protecting ladies adorable or quarrelsome  it is constantly spoken of in the correspondence  the real business in hand is revealed in the following directions for goring  the prince certainly makes a large order on dormer and it is not probable though from the later revelations of james mohr macgregor it is possible that the weapons demanded were actually procured   june 8  letter and directions for goringmr dutton will go directly to anvers and there wait mr bartons arrival and asoon as you have received his directions youl set out to join me in the mean time you will concert with dormer the properest means of procuring the things arms erased i now order him in the strictest secrecy likewise how i could be concealed in case i came to him and the safest way of travelling to that country   for mr dormer  same date  anvers  as you have already offered me by ye bearer mr goring to furnish me what arms necessary for my service i hereby desire you to get me with all ye expedition possible twenty thousand guns baionets ammunition proportioned with four thousand sords and pistols for horces cavalry in one ship which is to be ye first and in ye second six thousand guns without baionets but sufficient amunition and six thouzand brode sords as mr goring has my further directions to you on them affaires leaves me nothing farther to add at present   on june 11 charles remonstrated with madame de talmond  if she is tired of him he will go to le lorain  enfin si vous voulez ma vie il faut changer de tout  on june 27 newton repeated his expressions of suspicion about cluny and spoke of disputes and broils among the scotch as to the seizure of the loch arkaig money  on july 2 charles in cypher asked james for a renewal of his commission as regent  goring or newton was apparently sent at least as far as avignon with this despatch  he travelled as monsieur fritz a german with complicated precautions of secrecy  james sent the warrant to be regent on parchmentit is in the queens library but he added that charles was a continual heartbreak and warned his son not to expect friendship and favours from people while you do all that is necessary to disgust them  he could not in decency see charless envoy august 4  on the following day edgar wrote in a more friendly style for this excellent man was of an amazing loyalty   from james edgar  august 5 1750  rome  your royal highness does me the greatest pleasure in mentioning the desire you have to have the kings head in an intaglio  there is nobody can serve you as well in that respect as i so i send you by the bearers two one on a stone like a ruby but it is a fine granata and hms hair and the first letters of his name are on the inside of it  the other head is on an emerald a big one but not of a fine colour it is only set in lead so you may either set it in a ring a seal or a locket as you please  they are both cut by costanzia and very well done   these intagli would be interesting relics for collectors of such flotsam and jetsam of a ruined dynasty  on august 25 charles answered edgar  he is sorry that his majesty is prevented against the most dutiful of sons  he sends thanks for the engraved stones and the powers of regency  this might well have been jamess last news of charles for he was on his way to london a perilous expedition 101    chapter vthe prince in london and

of september 1750 and why did he run such a terrible risk  though he had ordered great quantities of arms in june no real preparations had been made for a rising  his highlandersglengarry lochgarry archy cameron clanranalddid not know where he was  scotland was not warned  as for england we learn the condition of the jacobite party there from a letter by aeneas macdonald the banker to sir hector macleansir hector whom in his examination he had spoken of as too fond of the bottle 103  aeneas now wrote from boulogne in september 1750 he makes it clear that peace luxury and constitutionalism had eaten the very heart out of the grandsons of the cavaliers  there was grumbling enough at debt taxes a hanoverian king who at this very hour was in hanover  welsh and cheshire squires and london aldermen drank jacobite toasts in private  but says aeneas there are not in england three persons of distinction of the same sentiments as to the method of restoring the royal family some being for one way some for another  they have neither heart nor money for an armed assertion of their ideas  in 1745 sir william watkins wynne who stayed at home in wales had not 200l by him in ready money and money cannot be raised on lands at such moments  yet this very man was believed to have spent 120000l in contested elections  it is very probable that six times as much money has been thrown away upon these electionshe means in the country generallyas would have restored the king  aeneas knew another gentleman who had wasted 40000l in these constitutional diversions  the present scheme he goes on is equally weak  the english jacobites were to seem to side with frederick the prince of wales in opposition and force him when crowned to call a free parliament  that parliament would proclaim a glorious restoration  in fact the english jacobites were devoured by luxury pacific habits and a desire to save their estates by pursuing constitutional methods  these as we shall see charles despised  if a foreign force cannot be landed if landed it would scarcely be opposed then there is no method so good as an attempt such as terloch tearlach made  if there be arms and money  men i am sure he will find enough     one thing you may take for granted that terlochs appearance again would be worth 5000 men and that without him every attempt will be vain and fruitless  aeneas in his examination talked to a different tune as the poor timid banker distrusted and insulted by ferocious chieftains  terloch was only too eager to show himself again money and arms he seems to have procured dargenson says 4000000 francs but why go over secretly to london where he had no fighting partisans there are no traces of a serious organised plan and the prince probably crossed the water partly to see how matters really stood partly from restlessness and the weariness of a tedious solitude in hiding broken only by daily quarrels and reconciliations with the princesse de talmond and other ladies  we find a curious draft of his written on the eve of starting  credentials given ye 1st  sept 1750 to ye p t princesse de talmond  je me flate que smtc sa majeste tres chretien voudra bien avoire tout

the prince actually went to london we know from a memorandum in his own hand  my full powers and commission of regency renewed when i went to england in 1750 and nothing to be said at rome for every

charles did little but espouse the anglican religion  dr king in his anecdotes tells how the prince took the refreshment of tea with him and how his servant detected a resemblance to the busts sold in red lion square  he also appeared at a party at lady primroses much to her alarm 107  he prowled about the tower with colonel brett and thought a gate might be damaged by a petard  his friends including beaufort and westmoreland held a meeting in pall mall to no purpose  the tour had no results except in the harmless region of the fine arts  a medal was struck by charless orders and we have the following information for collectors of jacobite trinkets  the english government never dreaming that the prince was in pall mall was well informed about cheap treasonable jewellery   paris  august 31 1750  the artist who makes the seals with the head of the pretenders eldest son is called le sieur malapert his direction is hereunder he sells them at 3 livres apiece but by the dozen he takes less  it is one tate who got the engraving made on metal from which the artist takes the impression on his composition in imitation of fine stones of all colours  this tate was a jeweller at edinborough where he went into the rebellion and having made his escape has since settled here but has left his wife and family at edinborough he is put upon the list of the french kings bounty for eight hundred livres yearly the same as is allowed to those that had a captains commission in the pretenders service and are fled hither  it is sullivan and ferguson who employ tate to get the 1500 seals done he being a man that does still jewellers business and follows it  the artist has actually done four dozen of seals which are disposed of having but half a dozen left  he expects daily an order for the said quantity moreas there are no letters or inscription about it the artist may always pretend that it is only a fancy head though it is in reality very like the pretenders eldest son 108  oddly enough we find waters sealing with this very intaglio of the prince a letter to edgar in 1750  it is a capital likeness  wise after the event hanbury williams wrote from berlin october 13 1750 that charles was in england in the heart of the kingdom in the county of stafford  by october 20 williams knows that the prince is in suffolk  all this is probably a mere echo of charless actual visit to london reverberated from the french embassy at berlin and arriving at hanbury williams he says through an irishman who knew a lacquey of the french ambassadors  in english official circles no more than this was known  troops were concentrated near stafford after charles had returned to lorraine hume told sir john pringle a story of how charles was in london in 1753 how george ii told the fact to lord holdernesse and how the king expressed his goodhumoured indifference  but lord holdernesse contradicted the tale as we have already observed  if hume meant 1750 by 1733 he was certainly wrong  george was then in hanover  in 1753 i have no proof that charles was in london though young glengarry told james that the prince was on the coast in november 1752  if charles did come to london in 1753 and if george knew it the information came through pickle to henry pelham as will appear later  hume gave the earl marischal as his original authority  the earl was likely to be better informed about events of 17521753 than about those of september 1750  after charless departure from london the english government received information from paris october 5 1750 to the following effect   paris  october 5 1750  it is supposed that the pretenders son keeps at montlhery six leagues from paris at mr lumisdens or at villeneuve st georges at a small distance from town at lord nairns sometimes at sens with col  steward and mr ferguson when at paris at madme la princesse de talmonts or the scotch seminary nobody travels with him but mr goring and a biscayan recommended to him by marshal saxe  the young pretender is disguised in an abbes dress with a black patch upon his eye and his eyebrows blackd  an officer of ogilvies regimt in this service listed lately  an irish priest who belonged to the parish church of s eustache at paris has left his living reckoned worth 80l st a year and is very lately gone to london to be chaplain to the sardinian minister he has carried with him a quantity of coloured glass seals with the pretenders sons effigy as also small heads made of silver gilt about this bigness example to be set in rings as also points for watch cases with the same head and this motto round look love and follow 110  on october 30 walton wrote that james was much troubled by a letter from charles doubtless containing the news of his english failure perhaps notifying his desertion of the catholic faith  on january 15 1751 walton writes that james has confided to the pope that charles is at boulognesurmer which he very possibly was  on january 9 and 22 horace mann reports on the information of cardinal albani that james and the duke of york are ill with grief something extraordinary has happened to the pretenders eldest son he had turned protestant that was all  but cardinal albani withdraws his statement and thinks that nothing unusual has really occurred  in fact charles as we shall see had absolutely vanished for three months  charles returned to france in september 1750 and renewed his amantium irae with madame de talmond  among the stuart papers of 1750 are a number of tiny billets easily concealed and doubtless passed to the lady furtively  si vous ne voulez reine de maroc pas cet faire quelle plaisir mourir de chagrin et de desespoire  aiez de la bonte et de confience pour celui qui vous aime et vous adore passionement  to some english person  ask the channoine where you can by hocks buy hooks and lines for fishing and by a few hocks and foure lines 111  the princess writes  je partirai dimanche comme jai promis au roy de pologne stanislas  je vous embrasse bien tendrement si vous etes tel que vous devez etre a mon egard  she is leaving for commercy  on the reverse the prince has written judi  je comance a ouvrire mes yeux a votre egar madame vous ne voulez pas de mois ce soire malgre votre promes et ma malheureuse situation  the quarrels grew more frequent and more embittered  we have marked his suspicious view of the ladys movements  on september 26 1750 she had not returned and he wrote to her in the following terms   the prince  september 26 1750  je pars madame dans linstant en sorte que vous feriez reflection et retourniez au plus vite tout doit vous engager si vous avez de lamitie pour mois car je ne puis pas me dispenser de vous repeter combien chaque jour de votre absence faira du

luci de ne me pas envoier la moindre chose meme une dilligence come aussi de mon cote je nen veres rien jusqua ce que vous soiez arrive  quant vous partires alors mdll luci vous remettera tout ce quil aura pour mois vous rien de votre cote que votre personne  on the same paper charles announces his intention of going instantly to le lorain  there must have been a great quarrel with madame de talmond outwearied by the exigencies of a prince doomed to a triste solitude after a week of london  on september 30 he announces to waters that there will be no news of him till january 15 1751  for three months he disappears beyond even his agents ken  on october 20 he writes to mademoiselle luci styling himself mademoiselle chevalier and calling madame de talmond madame le nord  the princesse de talmond has left him is threatening him and may ruin him   le october 20 1750  a mll luci  mademoiselle chevalier est tres affligee de voir le peu degard que madame lenord a pour ses interest  la miene du 12 auroit ete la derniere mais cette dame a ecrit une letre en date du 18 a m le lorrain qui a choque cette demoiselle himself et je puis dire avec raison quelle agit come le plus grand de

old waters  adieu mdll  je vous embrace de tout mon cour   on november 7 charles writes again to mademoiselle luci  the princesse de talmond is here la vieille tante  now estranged and perhaps hostile  madame de la bruere is probably the wife of m de la bruere whom montesquieu speaks highly of when in 1749 he was charge daffaires in rome 113   le 7 nov 1750  mdlle lucije suis fort etone

vous embrace de tout mon coeur   these embraces are from the supposed mademoiselle chevalier  there is no reason to suppose a tender passion between charles and the girl who was now his minister of affairs foreign and domestic  but madame de talmond as we shall learn became jealous of mademoiselle luci  his deeper seclusion continues  madame de talmond in the following letter is as before la tante the merchandise is letters for the prince which have reached mademoiselle luci and which she is to return to waters the banker   le 16 nov 1750  a mdll luci  je vous ai ecrit mademoiselle le 7

soieut dans leurs mains que dans les votres  je vous embrasse de tout mon coeur   by november 19 charles is indignant even with mademoiselle luci who has rather tactlessly shown the letter of november 7 to madame de talmond la tante la vieille femme  oh the unworthy prince  charless epistle follows   19th nov  je suis tres surprise mademoiselle de votre lettre du 15 par laquelle vous dites avoire montres a la tante une lettre touchant les affaires de mdlle chevalier cependant la mienne du 7 dont vous maccuses la reception vous marquoit positivement le contraire mr de lisle ne voulant pas quon

soit fait  soiez toujours assuree de ma sincere amitie   charless whole career alas after 1748 was a set of quarrels with his most faithful adherents  this break with his old mistress madame de talmond is only one of a fatal series  with mademoiselle luci he never broke  we shall see the reason for this constancy his correspondence now includes that of john dixon of london a false name for an adherent who has much to say about mr best and mr sadler  the prince was apparently at or near worms his letters went by mayence  on december 30 he sends for lesprit des lois and les amours de mlle fanfiche and other books of diversified character  on decemuber 31 his birthday he wrote to waters the indisposition of those i employ has occasioned this long silence  mr dormer was his chief medium of intelligence with england  commerce with germany is mentioned efforts probably to interest frederick the great  on january 27 1751 mademoiselle luci is informed that la tante has paid probably returned his letters but with an ill grace  cluny sends an account of the loch arkaig money only 12981l is left and of the loyal clans  glengarrys contingent is estimated at 3000 men  in england paxton sir w w wynne is dead  on february 28 1751 charles is somewhat reconciled to his old mistress  je me flatte quen cette nouvelle annee vous vous corrigerez en attendant je suis come je serois toujours avec toutte la tendresse et amitie possible c p  it is of course just possible that from october 1750 to february 1751 charles was in germany trying to form relations with frederick the great  goring under the name of stouf was certainly working in germany  sir charles hanbury williams at berlin wrote on february 6 1751 to the duke of newcastle   hitherto my labours have been in vain  but i think i have at present hit upon a method which may bring the whole to light  and i will here take the liberty humbly to lay my thoughts and proposals before your grace  feldt marshal keith has long had a mistress who is a livonian and who has always had an incredible ascendant over the feldt marshal for it was certainly upon her account that his brother the late lord marshal quitted his house and that they now live separately  about a week ago during feldt marshal keiths present illness the king of prussia ordered that this woman should be immediately sent out of his dominions  upon which she quitted berlin and is certainly gone directly to riga which is the place of her birth  now as i am well persuaded that she was in all the feldt marshals secrets i would humbly submit it to your grace whether it might not be proper for his majesty to order his ministers at the court of petersburgh to make instance to the empress of russia that this woman might be obliged to come to petersburgh where if proper measures were taken with her she may give much light into this and perhaps into other affairs  the reason why i would have her brought to petersburgh is that if she is examined at riga that examination would probably be committed to the care of feldt marshal lasci who commands in chief and constantly resides there and i am afraid would not take quite so much pains to examine into the bottom of an affair of this nature as i could wish     c hanbury williams   it is not hard to interpret the words proper measures as understood in the land of the knout  the mistress of field marshal keith could not be got at she had gone to sweden and this chivalrous proposal failed  the woman was not tortured in russia to discover a prince who was in or near paris 118  at the very moment when williams from berlin was making his manly suggestion lord albemarle from paris february 10 1751 was reporting to his government that charles had been in berlin and had been received by frederick with great civility  the king however did not accede to charless demand for his sisters hand  this report is probably incorrect for charless notes to mademoiselle luci at this time indicate no great absence from the french capital  on february 17 1751 the english government like the police fancied they had a clue  the duke of bedford wrote to lord albemarle his majesty would have your excellency inform m puysieux that you have it now in your power to have the young pretenders motions watched in such a manner as to be able to point out to him where he may be met with and that his majesty doth therefore insist that in conformity to the treaties now subsisting between the two nations he be immediately obliged to leave france     he must be sent by sea either into the ecclesiastical states or to such other country at a distance from france as may render it impossible for him to return with the same facility he did before 119  these hopes of charless arrest were disappointed  on march 4 young waters heard of the prince at the opera ball in paris  he sent the prince a watch from the abbess of english nuns at pontoise  charles was always leaving his watches under his pillow he certainly was not far from paris  he scolded madame de talmond for returning thither march 4 and sent to mademoiselle luci a commission for books such as attilie tragedie athalie and histoire de miss clarisse lettres anglaises richardsons clarissa and la chimie de nicola sic  mademoiselle luci writing on march 5 tells how the philosophe montesquieu their friend has heard a monsieur le fort boast of knowing the princes hidingplace  the philosophe turned the conversation  the prince answers that le fort is tres galant homme but a friend of la tante madame de talmond who must have been blabbing  he was in or near paris for he corresponded constantly with mademoiselle luci  the young lady assures him that some new philosophical books which he had ordered are worthless trash  lhistoire des passions and le spectacle de lhomme are amateur rubbish worse was never printed  the prince now indulged in a new cypher  walsh his financial friend is legrand kennedy is newton as before dormer at antwerp his correspondent with england is mr blunt gorge in england gorge is mr white and so on  owing to the death of frederick prince of wales there was a good deal of correspondence with dixon and miss finescertainly lady primrosewhile dixon may be james dawkins or dr king of st marys hall oxford  on may 16 charles gave goring instructions as to attempting the court of prussia or any other except france after their unworthy proceedings  goring did not set out till june 21 1751  from berlin the poor man was to go to sweden  in april madame de talmond was kind to charles si malheureux et par votre position et par votre caractere mademoiselle luci was extremely ill in may and june indeed till october this led to a curious correspondence in october between her and la vieille tante  madame de talmond was jealous of mademoiselle luci a girl whom one cannot help liking  though out of the due chronological course the letters of these ladies may be cited here   from madame de beauregard madame de talmond to mademoiselle luci  october 19 1751  the obstinacy of your taste for the country mademoiselle in the most abominable weather is only equalled by the persistence of your severity towards me  i have written to you from paris i have written from versailles with equal successnot a word of answer whether you want to imitate or to pay court to our amie the prince i know not but would gladly know that i may yield everything with a good grace let it cost what it will  as a rule it would cost me much nay all to sacrifice your friendship  but i have nothing to contest with old friends who are more lovable than myself  on my side i have only the knowledge and the feeling of your worth which require but discernment and justice  from such kinds of accomplishments as these you are dispensed  so serious a letter might be tedious without being long but it is saddened also by the weary weight of my own spirits  will you kindly give me news of your health and of your return to town  i am sorry that paris does not interest me i am going to fontainebleau at the end of the week   mademoiselle luci replies with dignity   october 22 1751  madamea fever and many other troubles have prevented me from answering the three letters with which you have honoured me  permit me to mingle a few complaints with my thanks  were i capable of the sentiments which you attribute to me i could not deserve your flattering esteem  its expressions i should be compelled to regard merely as an effort of extreme politeness on your side  assuredly madame i am strongly attached to madame your friend the prince for her i would suffer and do everything short of stooping to an act of baseness  if madame you have not found in me virtues which will assure you of this at least trust my faults  my character is not supple  the one thing which makes my frankness endurable is that it renders me incapable of conduct for which i should have to blush believe then madame that i can preserve my friendship for your friend without falling as you suspect into the baseness of paying court to her the prince in spite of the respect which i owe to you   the letters of the ladies in french are copied by the princes hand nor has he improved the orthography  i therefore translate these epistles  on july 10 1751 after a tremendous quarrel with madame de talmond charles wrote out his political reflections  france must apologise to him before he can enter into any measures with her court  i have nothing at heart but the interest of my country and i am always ready to sacrifice everything for it life and rest but the least reflection as to ye point of honour i can never pass over  there is nobody whatsoever i respect more as ye k of prussia not as a k but as i believe him to be a clever man  has he intention to serve me proofs must be given and ye only one convincive is his agreeing to a marriage with his sister and acknowledging me at berlin for what i am  he adds that he will not be a tool like my ansisters  such were charless lonely musings such the hopeless dreams of an exile  he had now entered on his attempt to secure prussian aid and on a fresh chapter of extraordinary political and personal intrigues    chapter viintrigues political and amatory  death of mademoiselle luci 1752    hopes from prussiathe murrays of elibankimprisonment

primrosedeath of mademoiselle lucinovember 10 date of postponed elibank plot danger of dismissing an agent  we have seen that charless hopes in july 1751 were turned towards prussia and sweden  to these courts he had sent goring in june meanwhile a new and strange prospect was opening to him in england on the right bank of tweed just above ashiesteil is the ruined shell of the old tower of elibank the home of the murrays  a famous lady of that family was muckle moud meg whom young harden when caught while driving elibanks kye preferred to the gallows as a bride  in 1751 the owner of the tower on tweed was lord elibank to all appearance a douce learned scots laird the friend of david hume and a customer for the wines of montesquieus vineyards at la brede  he had a younger brother alexander murray and the politics of the pair says horace walpole were of the sort which at once kept the party alive and made it incapable of succeeding  their measures were so taken that they did not go out in the fortyfive yet could have proved their loyalty had charles reached st jamess in triumph walpole calls lord elibank a very prating impertinent jacobite 125  as for the younger brother alexander murray sir walter scott writes in his introduction to redgauntlet a young scotchman of rank is said to have stooped so low as to plot the surprisal of st jamess palace and the assassination of the royal family  this was the elibank plot which we shall elucidate later  in the spring and summer of 1751 alexander murray had lain in newgate on a charge of brawling at the westminster election  he was kept in durance because he would not beg the pardon of the house on his knees  he only kneeled to god he said  he was released by the sheriffs at the close of the session and was escorted by the populace to lord elibanks house in henrietta street  he then crossed to france and in july 1751 dixon dr king thus reports of him to charles  my lady lady montagu or lady primrose says that m murray is most zealously attached to you and that he is upon all occasions ready to obey your commands and to meet you when and where you please     he assures my lady that he can raise five hundred men for your service in and about westminster  these men were to be used in a plot for seizing the royal family in london  this scheme went on simmering blended with intrigues for prussian and swedish help and finally with a plan for a simultaneous rising in the highlands  and this combination was the last effort of jacobitism before the general abandonment of charles by his party  the hopes as regarded prussia were centred in fredericks friend the brother of marshal keith the earl marischal  the earl was by this time an old man  at queen annes death he had held a command in the guards and if he had frankly backed atterbury when the bishop proposed to proclaim king james the history of england might have been altered and the duke of argylls regiment at kensington would have had to fight for the crown 126  the earl missed his chance he fought at shirramuir 1715 and he with his brother later marshal keith was in the unlucky glensheil expedition from spain 1719  that endeavour failed leaving hardly a trace save the ghost of a foreign colonel which haunts the roadside of glensheil from that date the earl was a cheery contented philosophic exile with no high opinion of kings  spain was often his abode where he found as he said his old friend the sun  in 1744 he declined to accompany the prince in a herringboat to scotland  in the forty five he did not cross the channel but as we have seen endeavoured to wring men and money from dargenson  in 1747 the earl then at treviso declined to be charless minister on the score of broken health 127a  charles as we saw vainly asked the earl for a meeting at venice in 1749  indeed charles got nothing from his adherent but a motherofpearl snuffbox with the portrait of the old gentleman 127b  the earl dwelt not always on the best terms with his brother marshal keith at berlin and was treated as a real friend for a marvel by frederick  on july 20 the earl had seen goring at berlin and wrote to charles nothing he said could be done by swedish aid  if sweden moved russia would attack her nor could frederick in his turn assail russia for russia and the empress maria theresa would have him between two fires 127c  frederick now august 1751 took a step decidedly unfriendly as regarded his uncle of england  he sent the earl marischal as his ambassador to the court of versailles  this was precisely as if the united states were to send a banished fenian as their minister to paris  the earl was proscribed for treason in england and as we shall see his house in paris became the centre of truly fenian intrigues  on these the worthy earl was wont to give the opinion of an impartial friend  all this was known to the english government as we shall show through pickle and the knowledge must have strained the relations between george ii and our nephew as horace walpole calls frederick of prussia  the earls household when he left potzdam in august 1751 for paris is thus described by voltaire  you will see a very pretty little turkess whom he carries with him  they took her at the siege of oczakow and made a present of her to our scot who seems to have no great need of her  she is an excellent mussalwoman  her master allows her perfect freedom of conscience  he has also a sort of tartar valet de chambre stepan was his name who has the honour to be a pagan 128a  on october 29 voltaire writes that he has had a letter from the earl in paris  he tells me that his turk girl whom he took to the play to see mahomet voltaires drama was much scandalised  voltaire was to receive less agreeable news from the friend of frederick  some big prussian will box your ears said the earl marischal after voltaires famous quarrel with his royal pupil  the appointment of an attainted rebel to be ambassador at versailles naturally offended england  the duke of newcastle wrote to lord hardwicke  128b  one may easily see the views with which the king of prussia has taken this offensive step  first for the sake of doing an impertinence to the king then to deter us from going on with our negotiations in the empire for the election of a king of the romans and to encourage the jacobite party that we may apprehend disturbances from them if a rupture should ensue in consequence of the measures we are taking abroad  he therefore proposes a subsidy to russia to overawe frederick  at paris yorke remonstrated  hardwicke writes on september 10 1751  i am glad joe ventured to say what he did to m puysieux but joe spoke to no purpose  james was pleased by the earl marischals promotion and presence in paris  charles at first was aggrieved  he wrote  l m coming to paris is a piece of french politics on the one side to bully the people of england on the other hand to hinder our friends from doing the thing by themselves bambouseling them with hopes     they mean to sell us as usual     the doctor dr king is to be informed that goring saw lord marischal but nothing to be got from him  the prince mentions his distress for money and sends compliments to dawkins jemmy dawkins of whom we shall hear plenty  he sends a watch for the lady lady montagu  i venture a guess at lady montagu because dr king tells as a proof of charless avarice that he took money from a lady in paris when he had plenty of his own 130a  now on september 15 1751 charles sent to dormer a receipt for one thousand pounds which he paid me by orders for account of the right honourable vicecountess of montagu signed c p r 130b  again on quitting paris on december 1 1751 he left in a coffer 2250 louidors besides what there is in a little bag above amounting to about 130 guines and od zequins or ducats  these with a big box of books were locked up in the house of the comtesse de vasse rue st dominique faubourg de st germain in which street montesquieu lived  the deposit was restored later to charles by madame la grandemain sister of mademoiselle luci  in truth charles for a prince with an ambition to conquer england was extremely poor and a loyal lady did not throw away her guineas as dr king states on a merely avaricious adventurer  charles august 25 1751 was in correspondence with daniel macnamara esq at the grecian coffee house temple london who later plays a fatal part in the princes career  this is a private interlude  we return to practical politics  no sooner was the earl marischal in paris than charles made advances to the old adherent of his family  he sent goring posthaste to the french capital  goring who already knew the earl writes september 20 1731  my instructions are not to let myself be seen by anybody whatever but your lordship  the earl answers on the same day  if you yourself know any safe way for both of us tell it me  there was a garden belonging to a mousquetaire famous for fruit by pique price beyond it some way  i could go there as out of curiosity to see the garden and meet you tomorrow towards five oclock but if you know a better place let me know it  remember i must go with the footmen and remain in coach as usual so that the garden is best because i can say if it came possibly to be known that it was by chance i met you  an ambassador as sir henry wotton remarked is an honest man sent to lie abroad for his country an observation taken very ill by gentle king jamie 131  goring replied that the garden was too public  the night would be the surest time  goring could wear livery or dress as an abbe  the tuileries when literally dark might serve  on september 23 the earl answers one of my servants knows you since vienna  goring as we know had been in the austrian service  i will go to the tuileries when it begins to grow dark if it does not rain for it would seem too od that i had choose to walk in rain and my footman would suspect and perhaps spye  i shall walk along the step or terrace before the house in the garden 132a  so difficult is it for an ambassador to dabble in treasonable intrigue especially when old and when the weather is wet  let us suppose that goring and the earl met  gorings business was to ask if the earl has leave to disclose the secret that was not in his power to do last time you saw him  i am ready to come myself and meet him where he pleases  meetings were difficult to arrange  we read in the princes hand   to lord m from goring  18th oct 1751  saying he had received an express from the prince with orders to tell him lord m his place of residence and making a suggestion of meeting at waterss house  answer made 18th oct by lord m  you may go to look for lace as a hamborough merchant  i go as recommended to a lace shop by mr waters and shall be there as it grows dark for a pretence of staying some time in the house you may also say you are recommended by waters  mr vignier marchand de doreure rue du route au soleil dor paris   overleaf  18th oct 1751  i shall be glad to see you when you can find a fit place but to know where your friend is is necessary unfit  would waterss house be a good place  would md talmonts mine is not neither can i go privately in a hackney coach my own footman would dogg me here stepan knows you well since vienna  stepan was the tartar valet  it is clear that charles was now near paris and that the ambassador of prussia was in communication with him  what did the english government know of this from their regular agents  on october 9 albemarle wrote from paris that charles was believed to have visited the town  his disguises make it very difficult to discover him  albemarle gives orders to stop a dr kincade at dover and seize his papers  he sends a list of traffickers between england and the prince including lochgarry formerly in the kings service and very well known is now in scotland  the young pretender has travelled through spain and italy in the habit of a dominican fryar he is expected soon at avignon  he was last at berlin and dantzich and has nobody with him but mr goring  this valuable information is marked secret 133a  on october 10 albemarle writes that foley a jacobite is much with the earl marischal  on october 30 dr kincaid had not yet set out but december 1 dr kincaid did start and at dover was culled like a flower  on st andrews day november 30 there was a jacobite meeting at st germains  albemarle had a spy present who was told by sullivan the princes irish friend that charles was expected at st germains by the new year  the earl marischal would have kept st andrews day with them but had to go to versailles  later we learn that no papers were found on dr kincaid  on january 5 1752 albemarle mentions traffickings with ireland  on august 4 1752 mann learns from a spy of some consequence in rome that the prince is in ireland  his household in avignon is broken upwhich by accident is true  something is in agitationvaluable news  the english government it is plain was still in the dark  but matters were going ill for charles  in february 1752 waters respectfully but firmly declined to advance money  charles dismissed in march all his french servants at avignon and sold the coach in which sheridan and strafford were wont to take the air madame de talmond was still jealous of mademoiselle luci  money came in by mere driblets  alexander provided 300l and dixon in england twice sends a humble ten pounds  charles transferred his quarters to the netherlands residing chiefly at ghent where he was known as the chevalier william johnson  the english government remained unenlightened  the duke of newcastle on january 29 1752 had advice that the pretenders son is certainly in silesia and requests sir charles hanbury williams to make inquiries 135  on april 23 1752 when charles was establishing himself at ghent and trying to raise loans in every direction the egregious sir charles hears that the prince is in lithuania with the radzivils on april 27 williams at leipzig is convinced of this and again proposes to waylay and seize the papers of a certain bishop lascaris as he passes through austrian territory on his way to rome  in lithuania the prince might safely have been left  he could do the elector of hanover no harm anywhere except by such fenian enterprises as that which pickle was presently to reveal  the anxious and always helpless curiosity of george ii and his agents about the prince seems especially absurd when they look in the ends of the earth for a man who is in the netherlands  at ghent may 1752 charles to all appearances was much less busied with political conspiracies than with efforts to raise the wind dormer at antwerp often protests against being drawn upon for money which he does not possess and charles treated a certain sum of 200l as if it were the purse of fortunatus and inexhaustible  madame la grandemain writes on may 5 that she cannot assist him and le philosophe montesquieu she says is out of town  on may 12 the prince partly explains the cause of his need of money  he has taken at ghent a preti house and room in it to lodge a friend and he invites dormer to be his guest  the house was near the place de lempereur in la rue des varnsopele   he asks dormer to send two keces of books indeed literature was his most respectable consolation  old waters had died and young waters was requested to be careful of charless portrait by la tour of his marble bousto by lemoine and of his silver sheald  to madame la grandemain he writes in a peremptory style  malgre toute votre repugnance je vous ordonne dexecuter avec toutes les precautions possibles ce dont je vous ai charge  what was this commission  it concerned la demoiselle  you must overcome your repugnance and tell a certain person goring that i cannot see him and that if he wishes to be in my good graces he must show you the best and most efficacious and rapid means of arriving at the end for which i sent him to you  i hope that this letter will not find you in paris  i have little doubt that the repugnances of madame la grandemain were concerned with the bringing of miss walkinshaw to the prince the person who is in danger of losing the princes favour is clearly goring figuring under the name of stouf and at this moment with madame la grandemain in the country  the facts about this miss walkinshaw daughter of john walkinshaw of barowfield have long been obscure  we can now offer her own account of her adventures from the archives of the french foreign office 137  in 1746 according to a memoir presented to the french court in 1774 by miss walkinshaws daughter charlotte the prince first met clementina walkinshaw at the house of her uncle sir hugh paterson near bannockburn  the lady was then aged twenty  she was named after charless mother and was a catholic  the prince conceived a passion for her and obtained from her a promise to follow him wherever providence might lead him if he failed in his attempt  at a date not specified her uncle general graeme obtained for her a nomination as chanoinesse in a chapitre noble of the netherlands  but prince charles was then incognito in the low countries and a person in his confidence sullivan tradition says warmly urged miss walkinshaw to go and join him as she had promised pointing out that in the dreadful state of his affairs nothing could better soothe his regrets than the presence of the lady whom he most loved  moved by her passion and her promise given to a hero admired by all europe miss walkinshaw betook herself to douay  the prince at ghent heard news so interesting to his heart and bade her go to paris where he presently joined her  they renewed their promises and returned to ghent where she took his name johnson was treated and regarded as his wife later travelled with him in germany and afterwards was domiciled with him at liege where she bore a daughter charlotte baptized on october 29 1753 138  so runs the memoir presented to the french court by the princes daughter charlotte in 1774  though no date is assigned miss walkinshaw certainly joined charles in the summer of 1752  madame la grandemain and goring were very properly indisposed to aid in bringing the lady to charles  the prince this replies to the remonstrances of goring stouf   to m stouf  june 6 1752  it is not surprising that i should not care to have one in my family that pretends to give me laws in everything i do you know how you already threatened to quit me if i did not do your will and pleasure what is passed i shall forget provided you continue to do yr duty so that there is nothing to be altered as to what was settled  do not go to lisle but stay at coutray for my farther orders  as to ye little man an agent of charles he need never expect to see me unless he executes ye orders i gave him  i send you 50 louisdors so that you may give ye frenchman what is necessary   the little man is probably beson who was also recalcitrant goring replies in the following very interesting letter  he considered his errand unworthy of a man of honour   from stouf  i did not apprehend the money you sent by dormer was for me but thought as you write in yours to furnish the little man for the journey to cambray and that very reasonably for with what he had of me he could not do it  on his refusing to go i sent it back  he says he has done what lays in his power as sullivans letter testifies that his desires to serve you were sincere for which you abused him in a severe manner  believe me sir such commissions are for the worst of men and such you will find enough for money but they will likewise betray you for more  virtue deserves reward and you treat it ill i can only lament this unfortunate affair which if possible to prevent i would give my life with pleasure  you say nothing is to be altered in regard to the plan  pray sir reflect on lady p primrose who will expect the little man 139 he was introduced to her and told her name  what frights will she and all friends be in when they know you sent him away for fear he should come over to england and betray them  i assure you all honest men will act as we have done and should you propose to all who will enter into yr service to do such work they will rather lose their service than consent  do you believe sir that lrd marischal mr campbell g kelly and others would consent to do it why should you think me less virtuous  my family is as ancient my honour as entire     i from my heart am sorry you do not taste these reasons and must submit to my bad fortune   for as to my going to courtray nobody will know it and if any accident should happen to you by the young ladys means miss walkinshaw i shall be detested and become the horrour of mankind but if you are determined to have her let mr sullivan bring her to you here or any where himself  the little man will carry your letter to him as he has done it already i suppose he wont refuse you  you sent a message for the pistols yourself and as you had not given him the watch he sent it lest he should be accused of a design to keep it  we have no other messages to send since you have forbid us coming near you    for gods sake sir let me have an audience of you i can say more than i can write   thus from the beginning charless friends foreboded danger in his liaison  miss walkinshaw had a sister good mrs catherine walkinshaw the princess dowagers bedchamber woman  lady louisa stuart knew her and described to scott the portly figure with her long lace ruffles her gold snuffbox and her double chin 141 the english jacobites believed that clementina was sent as a spy on charles communicating with her sister in london  in fact pickle was the spy but charless refusal to desert his mistress broke up the party and sealed his ruin  so much goring had anticipated  the lady p referred to as in a fright is lady primrose  an english note of may 1752 represents miss fines as about to go to france where lady p or lady p r actually arrived in june  the prince answered goring thus   the prince to stouf in reply  i hereby order you to go to lisle there to see a certain person in case she has something new to say and let her know that everything is to be as agreed on except that on reflection i think it much better not to send ye french man over for that will avoid any writing and macnamara can be sent to whom one can say by word of mouth many things further  as i told you already nothing is to be chenged on your side and you are to be anywhere in my neiborod for to be ready when wanted     make many kinde compliments from me to her and all her dear family  burn this after reading   charles also wrote to lady p r in a conciliatory manner  goring met the lady at lens  she was indignant at the dismissal of the little frenchman merely because he was no englishman  it would be unjust to refuse that name to one who had served you so faithfully goring was still june 18 at madame la grandemains  the lady in this correspondence may be miss walkinshaw or may be lady primrose probably the latter  indeed it is by no means absolutely certain that the errand which goring considered so dishonourable was connected with miss walkinshaw alone  the elibank plot must have been maturing though no light is thrown on it by the papers of the summer of 1752  did goring regard that plot as wicked or did he object to escorting miss walkinshaw  there were clearly two difficulties  one concerned miss walkinshaw the other lady primrose  she as a jacobite conspirator had been used to seeing the little man a frenchman whom charles threatens to dismiss  if dismissed he would be dangerous  charless hatred and distrust of the french now extended to the little man  it is barely conceivable that miss walkinshaw had left england under lady primroses escort of course under the pretext of going to join her chapter of canonesses in the low countries  if she announced when once in france her desire to go to charles as his mistress lady primroses position would be most painful and goring might well decline to convoy miss walkinshaw  but the political and the amatory plot are here inextricably entangled  as to the wickedness of the elibank plot if goring hesitated over that forsyth in his letters from italy tells a curious tale accepted by lord stanhope charles on some occasion went to england in disguise and was introduced into a room full of conspirators  they proposed some such night attack on the palace as murrays but charles declined to be concerned in it unless the personal safety of george ii and his family was guaranteed  charles certainly always did discountenance schemes of assassination we shall see a later example  but if pickle does not lie in a letter to be cited later lord elibank a most reputable man saw no moral harm in his family plot  was goring more sensitive  all this must be left to the judgment of the reader  in october 1752 a very sad event occurred  madame la grandemain had to announce the death of her sister the prince in a note to a pseudonymous correspondent expresses his concern for poor mademoiselle luci  and so this girl with her girlish mystery and romance passes into the darkness from which she had scarcely emerged carrying our regrets for indeed she is the most sympathetic of the women who in these melancholy years helped or hindered prince charles  as long as i have a bit of bred charles writes to an unknown adherent you know that i am always ready to shere it with a friend  in this generous light we may fancy that mademoiselle luci regarded the homeless exile whom goring was obliged to reprove in such uncourtly strains  madame la grandemain writing on november 5 1752 expresses her inconsolable sorrow for her sisters death and says that she has made arrangements as regards the princes affairs in case of her own decease  the prince on november 10 1752 sends his condolences and this date is well worth remembering  for according to young glengarry in a letter to james cited later november 10 was either the day appointed for the bursting of the elibank plot or was the day on which the date of the explosion was settled  as to that plot the papers of prince charles contain no information  documents so compromising if they ever existed have been destroyed 144    chapter viiyoung glengarry    pickle the spynot james mohr macgregor or drummondpickle was the young chief of glengarryproofs of thishis family historyhis part in

familyhighlanders among the turks  in november 1752 if not earlier a new fountain of information becomes open to us namely the communications made by pickle the spy to the english government  his undated letters to his employers are not always easily attributed to a given month or year but there can be mo mistake in assigning his first dated letter to november 2 1752 145  the spy called pickle was a descendant of somerled and the lords of the isles  in her rollcall of the clans flora macivor summons the macdonalds   o sprung from the kings who in islay held state proud chiefs of glengarry clanranald and sleat combine like three streams from one mountain of snow and resistless in union rush down on the foe   pickle was the heir to the chieftainship of glengarry he was alastair ruadh macdonnell or mackdonnell as he often writes it son of john macdonnell twelfth of glengarry  pickle himself till his fathers death in 1754 is always spoken of as young glengarry we shall trace the steps by which young glengarry the highborn chief of the most important catholic jacobite clan became pickle the treacherous correspondent of the english government  on first reading his letters in the additional mss of the british museum i conceived pickle to be a traitorous servant in the household of some exiled jacobite  i then found him asserting his rank as eldest son of the chief of a great clan and i thought he must be personating his master for i could not believe in such villainy as the treason of a highland chief  next i met allusions to the death of his father and the date september 1 1754 corresponded with that of the decease of old glengarry  presently i observed the suspicions entertained about young glengarry and the denunciation of him in 1754 by mrs cameron the widow of the last jacobite martyr archibald cameron  i also perceived that pickle and young glengarry both invariably spell who as how  next in pickles last extant epistle to the english government 1760 he directs his letters to be sent to alexander macdonnell glengarry fort william  finally i compared pickles handwriting where he gives the name alexander macdonnell with examples of young glengarrys signature in legal documents in the library of edinburgh university  the writing in my opinion was the same in both sets of papers  thus this hideous charge of treachery is not brought heedlessly against a gentleman of ancient loyal and honourable family  young glengarry died unarmed at home on december 23 1761 leaving directions that his political papers should be burned and the present representatives of a distinguished house are not the lineal descendants of a traitor  the grandfather of alastair ruadh macdonnell alias pickle alias roderick randomhe was fond of dr smolletts new novelsalias alexander jeanson that is alastair son of ian was alastair dubh black alister who with his ponderous twohanded sword mowed down two men at every stroke at killiecrankie and also fought at shirramuir  at killiecrankie he lost his brother and his son donald gorm donald of the blue eyes who is said to have slain eighteen of the enemy  at shirramuir when clanranald fell glengarry tossed his bonnet in the air crying in gaelic revenge  revenge  revenge to day and mourning tomorrow  he then led a charge and drove the regular british troops in rout  he received a warrant of a peerage from the king over the water  this hero seems a strange ancestor for a spy and a traitor like pickle  yet we may trace an element of heredity  about 1735 a member of the balhaldie family chief of clan alpin or macgregor wrote the memoirs of the great lochiel published in 1842 for the abbotsford club  balhaldie draws rather in clarendons manner a portrait of the alastair macdonnell of 1689 and of 1715  among other things he writes  most of his actions might well admitt of a double construction and what he appeared generally to be was seldome what he really was     though he was ingaged in every attempt that was made for the restoration of king james and his family yet he managed matters so that he lossed nothing in the event     the concerts and ingagements he entered into with his neighbours    he observed only in so far as suited with his own particular interest but still he had the address to make them bear the blame while he carried the profits and honour  to conclude he was brave loyal and wonderfully sagacious and longsighted and was possessed of a great many shineing qualities blended with a few vices which like patches on a beautifull face seemed to give the greater eclat to his character  pickle it will be discovered inherited the ancestral vices what he appeared generally to be was seldome what he really was his portrait 149a in highland dress displays a handsome fair athletic young chief with a haughty expression  behind him stands a dark dubiouslooking retainer like an evil genius  alastair dubh macdonnell died in 1724 and was succeeded by his son john twelfth of glengarry  this john had by two wives four sons of whom the eldest alastair ruadh was pickle  alastair held a captains commission in the scots brigade in the french service  in march 1744 he and the earl marischal were at gravelines meaning to sail with the futile french expedition from dunkirk  in june 1745 glengarry went to france with a letter from the scotch jacobites bidding charles not to come without adequate french support  old glengarry in january 1745 had disponed his lands to alastair his son for weighty reasons to him known 149b  such deeds were common in the highlands especially before a rising  from this point the movements of young glengarry become rather difficult to trace  if we could believe the information received from rob roys son james mohr macgregor by craigie the lord advocate young glengarry came over to scotland in la doutelle when charles landed in moidart in july 1745 150a  this was not true old glengarry with lord george murray waited on cope at crieff in august when cope marched north  cope writes i saw glengarry the father at crieff with the duke of athol tis said that none of his followers are yet out tho there is some doubt of his youngest son the eldest as glengarry told me is in france 150b  on september 14 forbes of culloden congratulated old glengarry on his return home and regretted that so many of his clan were out under lochgarry a kinsman 150c  old glengarry had written to forbes lamenting the folly of his friends  he like lovat was really sitting on the fence  his clan was out his second son aeneas led it at falkirk  alastair was in france  at the close of 1745 alastair conveying a detachment of the royal scots in french service and a piquet of the irish brigade to scotland was captured on the seas and imprisoned in the tower of london 150d  in january 1746 we find him writing from the tower to waters the banker in paris asking for money  almost at this very time young glengarrys younger brother aeneas who led the clan was accidentally shot in the streets of falkirk by a macdonald of clanranalds regiment  the poor macdonald was executed and the glengarry leader by charless desire was buried in the grave of wallaces companion sir john the graeme as the only worthy restingplace  many macdonalds deserted 151a  after culloden april 1746 an extraordinary event took place in the glengarry family  colonel warren who in october 1746 carried off charles safely to france arrested in scotland macdonell of barrisdale on charges of treason to king james 151b  barrisdale had been taken by the english but was almost instantly released after culloden  one charge against him on the jacobite side was that he had made several gentlemen of glengarrys clan believe that their chief meant to deliver them up to the english  thereon information was laid by the gentlemen against old glengarry old glengarrys letters in favour of the prince were discovered he was seized and was only released from edinburgh castle in october 1749  here then in 1746 were old glengarry in prison young glengarry in the tower and lucas lying in the grave of sir john the graeme though only nineteen aeneas was married and left issue  the family was now in desperate straits and already a sough of treason to the cause was abroad  young glengarry says that he lay in the tower for twentytwo months he was released in july 1747  the rev james leslie writing to defend himself against a charge of treachery paris may 27 1752 quotes a letter undated from glengarry one needs not be a wizard to see that mentioning you was only a feint and the whole was aimed at me 152a  if this like leslies letter was written in 1752 glengarry was then not unsuspected  we shall now see how he turned his coat  on january 22 1748 he writes to james from paris protesting loyalty  but since i arrived here after my tedious confinement in the tower in london i have not mett with any suitable encouragement  glengarry even as pickle constantly complains that his services are not recognised  both sides were ungrateful  in the list of gratuities to the scotch from france glengarry laine gets 1800 livres young glengarry is not mentioned 152b  from amiens september 20 1748 young glengarry again wrote to james  he means to wait any opportunity of going safely to britain on his private affairs  these journeys were usually notified by the exiles their mutual suspicions had to be guarded against  in december young glengarry hoped to succeed to the colonelcy in the scotofrench regiment of albany vacated by the death of the gentle lochiel archibald cameron had also applied for it as locum tenens of his nephew lochiels son a boy of sixteen  james replied through edgar that he was unable to interfere and assist glengarry as he had recommended young lochiel  what follows explains perhaps the circumstance that changed young glengarry into pickle  his majesty is sorry to find you so low in your circumstances and reduced to such straits at present as you mention and he is the more sorry that his own situation as to money matters never being so bad as it now is he is not in a condition to relieve you as he would incline  but his majesty being at the same time desirous to do what depends on him for your satisfaction he upon your request sends you here enclosed a duplicate of your grandfathers warrant to be a peer  you will see that it is signed by h m and i can assure you it is an exact duplicate copie out of the book of entrys of such like papers 153a  it is easy to conceive the feelings and to imagine the florid eloquence of young glengarry when he expected a cheque and got a duplicate copy of a warrant though he had asked for it to be a peerover the water  as he was not without a sense of humour the absurdity of the stuart cause must now have become vividly present to his fancy  he must starve or conform that is take tests and swallow oaths  but it was not necessary that he should sell himself many loyal gentlemen were in his position of poverty but perhaps only james mohr macgregor and samuel cameron vended themselves as glengarry presently did  glengarry loitered in paris  on june 9 1749 he wrote to the cardinal duke of york  he explained that while he was in the tower the court of france had sent him unlimited credit as a highland chief  he understood that he was intended to supply the wants of the poor prisoners several of whom had it not been our timely assistance sir hector maclean was with him had starved  sir hector tells the same tale  from sir james graeme glengarry learned that the duke of york had procured for him this assistance  but now the french war office demanded repayment of the advance and detained four years of his pay in the french service  he cant receive his ordinary supply from home his father being in prison and his lands entirely destroyed  to jamess agent lismore he tells the same story and adds i shall be obliged to leave this country if not relieved 154  later in 1749 we learn from leslie that he accompanied glengarry to london where glengarry did not intend to appear publicly but to have the advice of some counsellors about an act of the privy council against his returning to great britain at this time leslie pledged a gold repeater the property of mrs murray wife of that other traitor murray of broughton  glengarry after selling his sword and shoebuckles to my certain knowledge was reduced to such straits that i pledged the repeater for a small sum to relieve him and wrote to mr murray that i had done so  he pledged it to clanranald  mrs murray was angry for contrary to the usual story that she fled after the prince to france she was living with her husband at this time 155a  here then in july or august 1749 is young glengarry in extreme distress at london  but aeneas macdonald writing to edgar from boulogne on october 12 1751 says i lent young glengarry 50l when he was home in 1744 and i saw him in london just at the time i got out of gaol in 1749 and though in all appearance he had plenty of cash yet he never dreamed of paying aeneas his 50l  nothing could have lost him but falling too soon into the hands of bad counsellors  i regret to say that the pious aeneas macdonald was nearly as bad a traitor as any of these few evil highland gentlemen  his examination in london was held on september 16 1746 155b  herein he regaled his examiners with anecdotes of a tavern keeper at gravelines who threatened to beat the pretenders son and of how he himself made lord sempil drunk to worm his schemes out of him  it is only fair to add that beyond tattle of this kind next to nothing was got out of aeneas who in 1751 demands a jacobite peerage for his family that of kinloch moidart  so much at present for aeneas  if we listen to leslie young glengarry was starving in july or august 1749 if we believe aeneas he had plenty of cash in december of the same year  whence came this change from poverty to affluence  we need not assume it to be certain that glengarrys gold came out of english secret service money  his father had been released from prison in october 1749 and may have had resources  we have already seen too that young glengarry was accused of getting in the winter of 1749 his share of the buried hoard of loch arkaig  lord elcho in paris puts the money taken by young glengarry and lochgarry an honest man at 1200 louis dor  we have heard the laments of thomas newton kennedy who himself is accused of peculation by aeneas macdonald and of losing 800l of the princes money at newmarket 156  we do not know for certain then that young glengarry vended his honour when in london in autumn 1749  that he made overtures to england whether they were accepted or not will soon be made to seem highly probable we return to his own letters  in june 1749 he had written as we saw from paris also to lismore and to the cardinal duke of york on september 23 1749 he again wrote to lismore from boulogne  he says he has been in london as we know from leslie where his friends wished him to conform to the hanoverian interest  this he disdains  he has sent a vassal to the north and finds that the clans are ready to rise  if not relieved from his debt to the french war office he must return to england  he did return in the winter of 1749 and he accompanied his cousin lochgarry a truly loyal man to scotland where he helped himself to some of the hoard of gold  on january 16 1750 he writes to edgar from boulogne reports his scotch journey and adds that he is now sent by the clans to lay their sentiments before james in rome he then declares that archibald cameron has been damping all hearts in the highlands  i have prevented the bad consequences that might ensue from such notions but one thing i could not prevent was his taking 6000 louis dors of the money left in the country by his royal highness which he did without any opposition as he was privy to where the money was laid only cluny macpherson obliged him to give a receipt for it     i am credibly informed he designs to lay this money in the hands of a merchant in dunkirk and enter partners with him     he hopes that james will detain archibald cameron in rome till his own arrival  he protests that it is very disagreeable to him to give this information 157  as we have already seen newton since 1748 had been in england trying to procure the money from cluny  we have seen that archibald cameron young glengarry and others had obtained a large share of the gold in the winter of 1749  charges of dishonesty were made on all sides and we have already narrated how archibald cameron sir hector maclean lochgarry and young glengarry carried themselves and their disputes to rome in the spring of 1750 and how james declined to interfere  the matter he said was personal to the prince  but the following letter of james to charles deserves attention   the king to the prince  march 17 1750  you will remark that at the end of archys paper it is mentioned as if a certain person should have made use of my name in sd and have even produced a letter supposed to be mine to prove that he was acting by commission from me  what there may be in the bottom of all this i know not but i think it necessary you should know that since your return from sd i never either employed or authorized the person or anybody else to carry any commissions on politick affairs to any of the three kingdoms   now this certain person accused by archy archibald cameron of forging a letter from james with a commission to take part of the hidden hoard is young glengarry  in his letter of october 12 1751 aeneas macdonald mentions a report too audacious to be believed that glengarry had counterfeited his majestys signature to gett the money that he gott in scotland  glengarry was very capable of having it happen to him but he accused archibald cameron and the charge still clings to his name  even now cameron is not wholly cleared  on november 21 1753 his uncle ludovic cameron of torcastle wrote to the prince from paris  my nephew dr cameron had the misfortune to take away a round sum of your highnesss money and i was told lately that it was thought i should have shared with him in that base and mean undertaking  i declare on my honour and conscience that i knew nothing of the taking of the money until he told it himself in rome where i happened to be at the time and that i never touched one farthing of it or ever will 159  cluny as well as cameron was this gentlemans nephew  the character of archibald cameron is so deservedly high the praises given to him by horace walpole are so disinterested that any imputation on him lacks credibility  one is inclined to believe that there is a misunderstanding and that what money cameron took was for the princes service  yet we find no proof of this and torcastles letter is difficult to explain on the hypothesis of camerons innocence  glengarry tried to secure himself by a mysterious interview with the king  on may 23 at rome he wrote to edgar  as his majesty comes into town next week and that i cant in your absence have an audience with such safety not choising to confide myself on that particular to any but you i beg youl be so good as contrive if his majesty judges it proper that i have the honour of meeting him in the duskish for a few moments  no doubt glengarry was brought to the secret cellar whence a dark stair led to jamess furtive audience chamber  we must repeat the question was young glengarry while with james in rome actually sold to the english government at this time  we have seen that he was in london in the summer of 1749  on august 2 of that year the duke of cumberland wrote to the duke of bedford who of all men in england is said by jacobite tradition to have most frequently climbed jamess cellar stair  cumberland speaks of the goodness of the intelligence now offered to the government  on my part i bear it witness for i never knew it fail me in the least trifle and have had very material and early notices from it  how far the price may agree with our present saving schemes i dont know but good intelligence ought not to be lightly thrown away 160  was glengarry starving in august 1749 the source of the intelligence which in that month cumberland had already found useful  the first breath of suspicion against glengarry not as a forger or thief these minor charges were in the air but as a traitor is met in an anonymous letter forwarded by john holker to young waters 161  a copy had also been sent to edgar at rome already on november 30 1751 some one sealing with a stags head gorged and a stag under a tree in the shield had written to waters denouncing glengarrys suspected friend leslie the priest as to my private knowledge an arrant rogue  leslie has been in london and is now off to lorraine  he is going to discover if he can have any news of the prince in a country which it is strongly suspected his royal highness has crossed or bordered on more than once  in the later anonymous letter we are told of a regular correspondence between john murray of broughton the traitor and samuel cameron a spy of whom we shall hear again  what surprises people still more is that mr macdonald of glengarrie who says that he is charged with the affaires of his majesty is known to be in great intimacy with murray and to put confidence in one leslie a priest well known for a very infamous character and who im authorised to say imposed upon one of the first personages in england by forging the princes name  the anonymous accusers were blair and holker men known to edgar and waters but not listened to by charles  glengarry according to his anonymous accuser of february 1752 was in london nominally on the kings affaires  on july or as he spells it jully 15 1751 young glengarry wrote from london to james and to edgar  he says to james that the english want a restoration but have lost all martial spirit  to edgar he gave warning that if measures were not promptly taken the loch arkaig hoard would be embezzled to the last sixpence  i must drop the politicall he says he will no longer negotiate for james but my sword will be always drawn amongst the first  the letter to james is printed by browne 162a that to edgar is not printed  and now appears the value of original documents  in the manuscript glengarry spells who as how  in the printed version the spelling is tacitly corrected  now pickle writing to his english employers always spells who as how an eccentricity not marked by me in any other writer of the period  this is a valuable trifle of evidence connecting pickle with young glengarry  in an undated letter to charles certainly of 1751 glengarry announces his approaching marriage with a lady of a very honourable and loyall familie in england after which he will pay his share of the loch arkaig gold  he ends with pious expressions  when at rome he had been an ardent suitor to the cardinal duke for a relick of the precious wood of the holy cross in obtaining which i shall think myself most happy 162b  in 1754 two years after the anonymous denunciation we find a repetition of the charge of treachery against glengarry  on january 25 1754 mrs cameron by that time widow of archibald sends to edgar in rome what she has just told balhaldie about young glengarry  her letter is most amazing  i was telling him balhaldie what character i heard of young glengarry in england where she had vainly thrown herself at the feet of george ii praying for her husbands life  particularly sir duncan campbell of lochnell mrs cameron was a campbell told me and others whom he could trust that in the year 1748 or 1749 i dont remember which as he sir duncan was going out of the house of commons mr henry pelham brother to the duke of newcastle and secretary of state called on him and asked if he knew glengarry  sir duncan answered he knew the old man but not the young  pelham replied it was young glengarry he spoke of for that he came to him offering his most faithful and loyal services to the government in any shape they thought proper as he came from feeling the folly of any further concern with the ungrateful family of stuart to whom he and his family had been too long attached to the absolute ruin of themselves and country  it is difficult to marvel enough at the folly of pelham in thus giving away a secret of the most mortal moment  mrs cameron did not hear lochnells report till after the mischief was wrought the great scheme baffled and her husband traduced betrayed and executed  by january 1754 pickle had done the most of his business as will appear when we come to study his letters  in these henry pelham is always my great friend with him pickle communicates till pelhams death march 1754 and his letters are marked by the duke of newcastle my brothers papers  all this may be called mere circumstantial evidence  the anonymous denouncer may have been prejudiced  mrs camerons evidence is not at firsthand  perhaps other highland gentlemen spelled who as how  leslie was not condemned by his ecclesiastical superiors but sent back to his mission in scotland 164  but pickle writing as pickle describes himself we shall see in terms which apply to young glengarry and to young glengarry alone  and in his last letter 1760 pickle begs that his letters may be addressed to alexander macdonnell of glengarry by fort augustus  it has been absurdly alleged that pickle was james mohr macgregor  in 1760 james mohr had long been dead and at no time was he addressed as alexander macdonnell of glengarry  additional evidence of pickles identity will occur in his communications with his english employers he was not likely to adopt the name of pickle before the publication of smolletts peregrine pickle in 1751 though he may have earlier played his infamous part as spy traitor and informer         note    the family of glengarry  alastair ruadh macdonell alias pickle jeanson roderick random and so forth died as we saw in 1761  he was succeeded by his nephew duncan son of aeneas accidentally shot at falkirk in 1746  duncan was followed by alastair scotts friend it was he who gave maida to sir walter  alastair the last glengarry who held the lands of the house died in january 1828  scott devotes a few lines of his journal to the chief january 21 1828 who shot a grandson of flora macdonald in a duel and disputed with clanranald the supremacy of the macdonalds  scott says he seems to have lived a century too late and to exist in a state of complete law and order like a glengarry of old whose will was law to his sept  warmhearted generous friendly he is beloved by those who knew him    to me he is a treasure     165  he married a daughter of sir william forbes a strong claim on scotts affection  he left sons who died without offspring his daughter helen married cunninghame of balgownie and is represented by her son j alastair erskine cunninghame esq of balgownie  if charles half brother of alastair ruadh pickle who died in america left no offspring the house of glengarry is represented by aeneas ranald westrop macdonnell esq of the scotus branch of glengarry  according to a letter written to the old chevalier in 1751 by will henderson in moidart young scotus had extraordinary adventures after culloden the letter follows  i published it first in the illustrated london news   to the king  from w henderson in moydart  october 5 1750  sirafter making offer to you of my kind compliments i thought it my indispensable duty to inform you that one governor stewart of the isle of lemnos on the coast of ethiopia in ye year 1748 wrot to scotland a letter for stewart of glenbucky concerning donald mcdonell of scothouse younger and john stewart with 20 other prisoners of our countrymen there to see if by moyen of ransome they could be relieved  the substance of the letter as it came with an irish ship this year to clyde is as follows  that donald mcdonell of scothouse younger and first cousin german to john mcdonell of glengarry and with john stewart of acharn and other 20 persons mortally wounded in the battle of culloden were by providence preserved altho without mercy cast aboard of a ship in cromarty bay the very night of the battle and sailed next morning for portsmouth where they were cast again aboard of an indiaman to be carried or transported without doom or law to some of the british plantations but they had the fate to be taken prisoners by a salle rover or a turkish privatir or pirat who after strangling the captain and crew keeped the 22 highlanders in their native garb to be admired by the turks since they never seed their habit nor heard their languadgue befor and as providence would have it the turks and governor stewart came to see the rarysho and being a south country hiland man that went over on the darien expedition and yet extant being but a very young boy when he went off seeing his countrymen spok to them with surprize in their native tong or language and by comoning but a short time in galick found in whoses army they served and how they suffered by the fate of war and disaster after which he ordered them ashoar and mitigated their confinement as far as layd in his power but on them landing by the turks gelosie jealousy they were deprived of all writting instroments for fear they shod give their friends information of the place they were in and so it would probably happen them during life  if john stewart of acharn had not got his remot cousin governor stewart to writt a letter and inclosed one from himself giving particular information of scothouse wishing and begging all frinds concerned to procure written orders from the king of france to his ambassador at constantinopol for to make all intercession for the relesement of the forsaid two gentlemen and other 20 british christians in the king his majestys name or to recommend their condition to his holyness to see if by ransome they might be relived and theyll always be gratefull to their deliverurs to this pious end  i make chuse of you to inform your master whos the capablest person under god to do for them which will with other infinit titles endear you to your fast friends in scotland and especially to your will henderson who lives there 13 years past among the macdonalds of clanranald so i hope youll make use of what i have wrot to the end i intend and god will give the due reward    i remain etc   in fact the younger scotus was not taken prisoner at culloden but remained in the highlands and is mentioned by murray of broughton in his account of his expenditure and of the loch arkaig treasure published by robert chambers as an appendix to his history of the rising of 1745    chapter viiipickle and the elibank plot    the elibank plotgeorge ii to be

salmo ferox  the stuart papers we have said contain no hints as to the elibank plot of november 1752 unless gorings scruples were aroused by it it was suggested and arranged by alexander murray younger brother of lord elibank whom young edgar describes as having a very light head he has drunk deep of the garron garonne 169  with a set of officers in the french service aided by young glengarry who had betrayed the scheme and 400 highlanders murray was to attack st jamess palace and seize the king  if we may believe young glengarry writing to edgar in rome charles was on the coast but not in london  pickles letters to his english employers show that the design was abandoned much to his chagrin  as glengarry he expresses the same regret in a letter to edgar  we now offer pickles letters  he is at boulogne november 2 1752   add  bm  mss 32730  boulogne  november 2 1752  my dear sirmy friends will be most certainly greatly surprised at my silence but i have such reasons that i can clear all at meeting i have been so hurried what with posting what with drinking and other matters of greater weight than they dream of that i have not had a moment as the french says sans

grand papa gwynne vaughan i beg he excuses my not writing  besides it would be both dangerous and precarious as i have not a moment to write but after 12 at night being hurried at all other hours with company  if the credit i demand be sent i will immediately proceed to parisif not i will return directly without a trip to paris i cant come at the bottom of matters  i wish i had the pistoles  i beg youl give my servt any little thing he wants and let him come off by the first ship without faile  let me hear from you upon recet and derect for me simply to this place in french or english  i have told friends here that i expect a considerable remittance from baron kenady newcastle and that how soon i receve it i go for a trip to paris  this admits of no delay my kind respects to grand papa and allways believe me dr sir  your sincere and affte friend  alexr jeanson  to mr william blair at mr brodies in lille street near leister fieldslondon  marked pickle 172   the following letter of november 4 is apparently to henry pelham  if charles was in berlin as pickle says here about august 1752 the stuart papers throw no light on the matter  what we know of fredericks intrigues with the jacobites will find its place in the record of the following year 1753  pickle here confesses that his knowledge of future intrigues is derived from fredericks ambassador at versailles the earl marischal  the letter to pelham follows   bologne  november 4 1752  sirtho i delayd till now aquenting you of my arrival this side of the watter yet i hope you will not attribute my silence either to neglect or forgetfulness of my friends  i mostly pass my time in company of my old aquentences how who have each in theire turn entertaind me handsomely  i am now returning the compliment  notwithstanding my endeavours i have lost sight of 6 goringi took a trip in hopes to meet him at which time i had a long chatt with 69 sir james harrington how who is in top spirits and assures me that very soon a scene will be opend that will astonish most of envoys  whatever may be in this i can for certain assure you that 51 king of prussia will countenance it for three months ago 80 pretenders son was well received there  he has left that part for he was within these twenty days not the distance of thirty leagues from this town  this depend upon and was you to credit all he says it would be justly termd what the french term merveille whatever is in it they keep all very hush from 8 pretender tho i have some reason to believe that 72 sir john graeme was dispatched to him leatly for he disappeard from paris four days ago  whatever tune they intend to play of this battery 66 scotland is not desird to mouve untill his neibour london pulls off the mask  if 0l2d french ministry countenances 80 pretenders son its thro the influence of 51 king of prussia  i have some reason to believe they dow for 80 pretenders son is accompanied by one of that faction  i suspect its 59 count maillebois but i cant be positive untill i go to paris which i think a most necessary chant jaunt in this juncture for if 2 lord marshall has no finger in the piy i lost my host of all  when i am a few days at paris i take a trip sixty leagues farther south to meet 71 sir j graemne or sir james harrington and some other friends when i will be able to judge of matters by my reception from them and 012d french ministry 174 and if the last are concerned i must beg leave not to write upon these topicks for no precaution can prevent a discovery in this country should this be the case and that anything particular cast up i will make the quickest dispatch to lay before you in person all i can learn of these affairsi only wait here for your orders and be assurd whatever they be they will be obeyd with pleasure  i have not had time to write to my worthy old friend gwynne vaughan so i beg youl aquent him that the place he visits ought to be looked after with a watchful eyei doubt not but d b bruce an english official has informd you of his receving a few lines from me by last post in which i aquented him that i was necessitated to thro a way some mony and be at a very considerable expence  i dow not pretend to make a particular demand yet i assure you 200l  st is necessary and i intirely reffer to yourself to diminish or augment only i beg you be convinced that no selfish interesting view occasions my making this demand but only that i would be vext want of cash would disapoint either of us in our expectations since i dow assure you that i dont look upon anything i tuch upon such journeys as solid for it does not long stick in my pockets  i will drop this point being fully perswaded if my correspondence proves anything amusing such bagatelle will not be grudged but if i go forward i beg credit be sent me either upon this place or paris any mony i receve passes for being remitted by the order of baron kenady 175 newcastle  all this is fully submitted to your better judgement only i beg youl be fully perswaded how much i have the honour to remain sir  your most obedient and most humble servt  alexr jeanson  ps  lord strathallan left this a few days ago to meet lord george murray some says at the hague others at his house near claves   pickle   the following undated information appears to have been written by pickle on his return from france early in december  it is amazing to find that if we can believe a spy lord elibank himself was in the plot  the scene between the political economist and the swaggering celt when pickle probably blustered about the weakness of deferring the attack which he had already betrayed may be imagined   information  december 1752  the young pretender about the latter end of september 1752 sent mr murray of elibank for lochgary and doctor archabald cameron they meet him at menin  he informed them that he hoped he had brought matters to such a bearing particularly at the king of prussias court whom he expected in a short time to have a strong alliance withthat he did not desire the highlanders to rise in arms untill general keith was landed in the north of scotland with some swedish troops  he likewise assurd them that some of the greatest weight in england tho formerly great opposers to his family were engaged in this attempt and that he expected to meet with very little opposition  in consequence of this he gave lochgary doctor cameron blairfety robertson of wood streat skalleter mony and sent them to scotland so as to meet several highland gentlemen at the crief market for black cattel  cameron cassifairn and glenevegh were those how who were to carry on the correspondence twixt the southern jakobits and clunie mackpherson  lochgary was after the general meeting at menin with the young pretender for two nights at gent in flanders  i was at boulogne when sir james harrinton gave me directions to go to gent but to my great surprize as i lighted of horseback at furnes was tipt upon the shoulder by one morison charless valet how who desird me to stop for a little at the inn  i was not long there when the young pretender enterd my room the discourse chiefly turnd upon the scheme in england when he repeated the same assurances as to lochgary but in stronger terms and with the adition that the swedes were to embark at gattenburgh gothenburg and that mr murray was sent with commissions for me and full instructions how i was to act in scotland  the young chevalier was so positive of his schemes succeeding that he told me he expected to be in london very soon himself and that he was determind to give the present government no quiet until he succeeded or dyed in the attempt  i came over here to england by his express orders i waited of lord elibank who after the strong assurances of the young pretender surprised me to the greatest degree by telling me that all was put off for some time and that his brother murray had repassd the seas in order to aquent the young pretender of it and from him he was to go streight for paris to lord marishal  its not above nine days since i left the young pretender at furnes  when he was at menin a french gentleman attended him  goren goring has been within these two months twice in england and mr murray three times since he first went over  its not above five days since mr murray left london  probably the landing for england was to be from france as there is 12000 troops in flanders more than the ordinary compliment  this the comon french takes notice off  but i can say nothing of this with certainty  the young chevalier has more than once seen the king of prussia but none other of his court that i ever could learn but general keith  sir john douglas mr charteris 178 and heparn of keith are in the secret  the young chevalier has been in close correspondence with england for a year and a halph past  mr carte the historian has carried frequent messages  they never commit anything to writing  elderman hethcot is a principall manager  the very words the young pretender told me was that all this schemne was laid and transacted by whiggers that no roman catholick was concerned and oblidged me to give my word and honour that i would write nothing concerning him or his plan to rome  after what i said last night this is all that occurs to me for the present  i will lose no time in my transactions and i will take care they will allways be conforme to your directions and as i have throwen myself entirely upon you i am determined to run all hazards upon this occasion which i hope will entittle me to your favour and his majestys protection  dec 1752   pickle of course broke his word and honour about not writing to rome  in april 1753 to anticipate a little he indited the following epistle to edgar  he can have had no motive except that of alarming james by the knowledge that his son had been on the eve of a secret and perilous enterprise in which he was still engaged glengarry here confirms the evidence against himself by allusions to his dangerous illness in the spring of 1753  to this he often refers when he corresponds as pickle with his english employers   mackdonell to edgar  arras  april 5 1753  sir i frequently intended since my coming to this country to renew our former corespondence  but as i had nothing to say worth your notice that i could with prudence comitt to writing i choise rather to be silent than to trouble you with my letters  yet i cant perswad myself to leave this country without returning you many thanks for your former friendship and good offices and at same time assuring you of the great value and estime i allways had and still have for you  i would gladly comunicate to his majesty the leate schemes and those still persuid upon the same fondation  but as i am hopfull that his majesty is fully informed of all that is past and what is now a transacting i will not trouble his majesty with a repetition of facts which i am hopfull he has been informed off from the fountaine head  all i will say is that for my owne parte i will allways make very great difference twixt english promasis and action and am more fully confirmed in this opinion since the tenth of nov last when the day was fixt but when matters come to the puish some frivolous excuses retarded this great and glorious blow thank god the prince did not venture himself then at london 180 tho he was upon the coast ready at a call to put himself at their head  i wish he may not be brought to venture sow far upon the stress laid upon a suden blow to be done by the english we will see if the month of may or june will produce something more effective than novr and i am sorry to aquent you that the sow great stress laid upon those projects is lick to prove fatal to some for lochgary and doctor archibald cameron were sent to the highlands to prepair the clans to be in readiness  thire beeing sent was much against my opinion as i allways ensisted and will allways persist that no stirr should be done there untill the english would be so farr engaged that they could not draw back  i hope his majesty will aprove of my conduct in this  doctor cameron was taken by a party of soldiers in boruder  and is now actually secured in the castel of edinr  loch still remains but what his fate will be is very precarious  the concert in novr was that i was to remain in london as i had above four hundred brave highlanders ready at my call and after matters had broke out there to sett off directly for scotland as no raising would be made amongst the clans without my presence now i beg in laying this before the king youl at same time assure his majesty of my constant resolution to venture my owne person let the consequence be what it will and dow everything that can convince his majesty of my dutifull attachmt to his sacred person and royal cause for which i am ready to venture my all and nothing but the hand i had in those leate and present schemes and the frequent jants i was oblidged to take in consequence has hindered me from beeing settled in a very advantagious and honorable way being affraid that matrimony might incline me to a less active life than my princes affairs now requires  i belive in a few days that i will take a private start to london tho i am still so weake after my leate illness at paris 181 that i am scarse yet able to undergo much fatigue  i have left directions with mr gordon principal of the scots colledge to forward any letters for me to a friend at boulogne how who has a secure way of forwarding by trading ships any letters for me  i will be very glad to hear from you particularly as i expect to return in a few weeks back to france  i have one favour to ask of you and i hope it wont displeace his majesty its that whatever i write upon this topick be neither shown or comunicated to any other person as there are reports that people with you comumicate their intelligence too freely to the court of france which von know may go farther and prove of dangerous consequence  i hope the freedom with which i express myself will be wholly attributed to the warmth of my zeall for the good of the cause and it beg youl forgive the hurry i am in writing this and i rely upon your friendship to excuse the same towards his majesty in case you think proper to lay this hurried scrawle before him for what with the fatigue of posting and other affairs i am so tumbled  i wish with all my heart you may conceve the sincer true and reale sentiments which induced me to write so freely and as the gentilman with whom i send this to paris is just ready to set off i beg youll allow me to conclude and i hope youll not faile to lay me at his majestys and royal emmencys feet and at same time to believe me sir  your most obedient and most humble servt  mackdonell   edgar probably did not reply directly  john gordon of the scots college in paris writes to edgar   paris  19th august  i had the favour of yours of the 17th july in course  i found an opportunity lately to acquaint glengarie of what you wrot me on his account some time ago in answer to his from arras he desires me to thank you for what you say obliging to him and begs youll accept of his best compliments   it will be remarked that pickle who had informed the english government of archy camerons and lochgarrys mission to scotland in september 1752 in his letter to edgar laments archys capture hypocrisy was never carried so far  to cameron and his fate we return later  the stuart papers contain nothing of interest about charles for some time after mademoiselle lucis death and the postponement of the elibank plot  the news of the princes conversion was spread by himself in october 1752  sir james harrison was charged to inform lord denbigh who thought the change the best and happiest thing lady denbigh a most zealous smart woman saw mr hay at sens and received from him some of the princes hair wherewith she would regale three or four of her acquaintances and each of them set in heartform encircled with diamonds 183a  cardinal tencin also heard of the conversion  in january 1753 charles was in paris  his creditors were clamorous and he deplores his sad situation 183b on january 24 he was more in funds thanks to a remittance from rome hanbury williams meanwhile was diligently hunting for him in silesia  on january 17 and february 11 1753 williams wrote long letters from dresden  he had sent an honest fellow of a spy into silesia where the spy got on the tracks of a tall thin fair gentleman a little deaf travelling with a single servant who took coffee with him  the master spoke no german the servant had a little german and the pair were well provided with gold  as charles was a little deaf this enigmatic pair must be the prince and goring hanbury williams was energetic but not well informed 184  by february 18 1753 the excellent williams learned from count bruhl that charles was dead in one of the seaports of france  meanwhile the english government knew though they did not tell williams all that they needed to know through their friend pickle  williams they kept in the dark  in march 1753 charles was trafficking with hussey lieutenant colonel of a regiment stationed in luxembourg  he conceived a plan for sending goring to spain and he put some boxes of his long kept by la grandemain into the hands of waters  he wrote a mutilated letter to alexander murray in flanders and there our information as far as the stuart papers go fails us  but pickle steps in with the following letter  he describes the illness about which as we saw he wrote to edgar in april of this year  here follows his letter   add 32843  17th march 1753  dr siri receved some time ago your kind favour and no doubt youll be greatly surprised at my long silence which nothing could have occasiond but a violent fitt of sickness which began with a stich that seasd me as i was coming from the town of sence in fine it threw me into a violent fever that confind me to my bed twenty days  i was let blood ten times which has so reducd me that i am but in a very weake situation still  this with my long stay here has quite exausted my finances and oblidgd me to contract 300 livres tow of which i am bound to pay in the month of aprile and if i am not suplayd i am for ever undon  i beg youl represent this to grandpapa upon whose friendship i allways relay  the inclosed is for him and i hope to see him soon in person tho i am to make a little tour which will still augment my debts and

to be feared the poor gentleman never quite recovered his health  as usual he is in straits for money  england was already ungrateful  here follows another despatch   add 32843  paris  march 15 1753  dr siri had a long letter leatly from mr cromwell bruce contining in chief tow artickles by way of charge the first complaining of my long silencetother for not keeping a due and regular correspondence   what i beg you assure my mistress of is that had there been any new mode worth her notice invented since i gave her one exact patron of the last the elibank plot i would not have neglected to have sent her due patrons  please aquent my mistress that of leate they have comenced some new fashions in the head dresses very little varying from the former one yet they estime it is a masterpiece in its kind for my part i have but a slight idea of it though they bost the people of the first rank of our country will use it  i would have wrot of this sooner but my illness occasiond my not knowing anything of the matter till very leatly and i was so very ill that it was impossible for me to write as you may see by mr cromwells letter  you may remember dr papa that i was always very desirous that my love intrigues should be secret from all mortalls but those agreed upon and that my letters might be perusd by non but by my mistress and you now if you have people how who were and a few that still are at the helme that dont act honourably i cant be possitive neither will i mention them at this distance beeing myself a little credulous as i have but one under architects word for it  were i to credit some of the managers some of the fundation stones are pleacd upon a very sandy ground but our little thin friend the embassador earl marischal gives it little or no credit it may be but a puff in hopes to create suspicion and make one of each other mistrustfull in consequence of all this the managers have derected our northern friends lochgarry and the clans to keep their posts  i can answer for such as regards me and i beg least the company jacobites make banckrout that you proteck my parte of them  i am now pretty well recoverd of my leate illness tho i have been very much afraid of a relapse having catchd a violent cold at the masquerad ball of lundi gras beeing over perswaded to accompany our worthy friend mr murray to that diversion where i was greatly astonishd to find mr strange prince charles whom i imagind to be all this time in germanie for i took it for granted that he went for berlin when i meet him at furnes  i know not how long his stay was at paris for i was a little pickt that he did not inquire after me during my illness  he left this early tuesday morning and our friend mr murray gave him the convoie for some days and yesterday he

to leave this upon the 18th instant and i stear my course for imperiall flanders   the following communication is undated but from the reference to pickles illness it must be of march or april 1753  in april glengarry informed edgar as we saw that he was going to england from arras  he apparently went over and handed in this intelligence  if he speaks truth the earl marischal criticised the elibank plot as a candid friend  there exists evidence of a spy on a spy who tracked glengarry to the earl marischals house  swemrs m p is a mr swymmer   add 33050  pickle remaind about ten days at boulogne where he was frequently in company with sir j harrington who at that instant knew as little as pickle of the p destination  sir j hartn was much cast down at the grand affairs elibank plot being retarded  he wrote to ld stln strathallan aquenting him therewith for ld stln and young ga glengarry had been sent some time before to sound ld george murray not knowing how he stood affected as he prince charles had once greatly disoblidgd him  s j hartn aquenting them of the disappointment in england stopt further proceedings so they returnd back to boulogne  pickle went streight from boulogne to paris where he was very intimate with ld marischal few days past but pickle was at his lodgings or mrl at pickles  ld mr l was first aquented with the intended insurrection in england by goring who waited of him by his masters charless particular order a person of distinction spoke very seriously to mrl upon this head  pickle does not know how who this was mrl declining to mention names yet he estemd this person as a man of weight and good judgement this person was publick at paris but waited of mrl at nightcarte has been several times over he is trusted and it is by his means chiefly that the p turnd off kelly as mr carte informd the p that persons of note would enter upon no scheme with him whilst that fellow shard his confidence  sir jo  asly  was over and pickle believes he met the p at paris  the pretence of mr swemrs memr of pt traveling abroad with his lady was to settle the english scheme  ld mrl has not seen the p but twice before pickle went over  he never saw him at berlin tho he believed that he had taken several trips to that court  he saw goring twice at berlin  mrl knew nothing of a foreign invation and did not believe there could be any in time of peace  pickle one day asking his opinion of their affairs he answerd that he could say nothing upon the head with certainty he kept his mind to himself that when they askd his opinion he told them he could not judge so well as they since he was quite a stranger to london and to the different posts and manner of placing their guards but that if they executed according to their plan laid before him he doubted not but they might succeed but pickle making some objections as to the veracity of this plan told him that he could not positively contradick them and tell the p that they impost upon him for says he what opinion mr pickle can i entertain of people that proposd that i should abandon my embassy and embark headlong with them what can i answer when they assure me that bdrl sdh gme ele  with others of that party have agreed when once matters break out to declare themselves  but you need not mr pickle be apprehensive you may safely waite the event as you are not desird to make any appearance in scotland untill london and other parts of england pulls off the mask or untill there is a foreign landing this and matters much of the same nature were the ordinary topicks of mrl and pickles conversation  pickle was not above six weeks in france when he was determind to return but was prevented by mry count murray elibanks brother aquenting him that he would soon see the p personally  of this he at once aquented mr cromwell bruce english official and that it was the only thing that detaind him but as pickle in the interim went to sens in his return to paris he was seased with a fluxion de poitrine which had very near tript up his hiells  pickle when he recoverd went to the opera ball here to his great surprise he met the p who received him very kindly and he still insisted upon foreign assistance and the great assurances he had from england and that he expected matters would go well in a very little time he often mentioned foreign assistance by the court of berlins influence from swedland  his conversation with pickle was in general terms  pickle told him that he intended returning to britain  well then says he i hope soon to send you an agreeable message as youl be amongest the very first aquented when matters coms to a crisis  for my parte i hope to have one bold puish for all then after assurances of his friendship he went off and pickle has not seen him since this was upon lundie gras  he left paris that very morning and capt murray gave him the convoy and was absent four days  a few days after this pickle met by meare accident goring going to ld mrl  gor was then upon his way to england where he did not tarry above six days  dkns dawkins went leatly over and brought mony for the p  pickle believes upwards of 4000l st there is few weeks but sir j hartn leeves messages by means of the smugglers  eldermen blastus heth heathcote bn j rnd black with many others are mannagers in the city  if anything is to be attempted its to be executed by a set of resolute daring young fellows laid on by a set of young gentlemen conducted by a few regular officers  if ever any attempt is made its to be a night onset and if they succeed in scaping the guards then all will declare  the p has been tampering with the scots dutch he saw some of them  pickle cant condescent who they were his agents spoke to many of them  no officers are fitter for such attempts as they are both brave and experienced  the p depends upon having many friends in the army there being not a few added to their number by the duke of cumberlands conduct towards many gallant gentlemen and men of property but whatever steps they have been taking to sound or gaine over either officers of the land or sea service they still keep a dead secret  as for br beaufort ld wrd westmoreland sir josps with other of the cohelric choleric and bould pickle is very ready as he is not accustomd to such surnames and titles to forget them but assemblys of that nature are pretty publick members of such meetings cant escape the vigilancy of the ministry  murray when he came over in novr last brought over several manefestos to england with a very ample comission for  glengarry to raise the clans and command in chief untill an expressd generall officer landed and even then the clans were to have a particular commander a highlander this they insisted upon knowing what tools they have been in times past to low country commanders no more experienced than the most ordinary amongest themselves    was pitched upon as the p believed he would readily comploy with any reasonable plan that would be concerted by the commander in chief what pickle asserts as to this will probably be known by others  neith drum heb were pitched upon to try the pulse of d h hamilton and other nobelmen and gentlemen of the south  aberny with some of the excepted skulkers were to manadge and concert matters with the north country lowlanders and menzy of culdre was to be agent betwixt the lowlands and bordering highlands  several were sent to scotland by the p and mony given them in order to prepaire the people    glengarry can fully answer for the highlands for nothing can be transacted there without his knowledge as his clan must begin the play or they can come to no head there  what pickle knows of english schemes he cant be so positive as he was not designed to be an actor upon that stage yet in time he may perhaps be more initiated in those misterys as they now believe that pickle could have a number of highlanders even in london to follow him but whatever may happen you may always rely upon pickles attachment   to be pickt piqued by the princes neglect to inquire about pickles precious health is very characteristic of glengarry  his vanity and pride are alluded to by men of all parties  pickles remarks on charless receipt of 4000l must be erroneous his royal highness was in the very lowest water and could not afford a new suit of clothes for his servant daniel the profet as he once calls him  this we learn from the following letter to avignon   to sheridan and stafford  from the prince  april 10 1753  this is to let you know that as i am extremely necessitous for money it engages me out of economi to send for daniells close which you are to pack up in his own trunc and to send it adresed to mr woulfe to paris but let there be in ye trunc none of daniels papers or anything else except his close   meanwhile on march 20 1753 archy cameron had been arrested  his adventure and his death with the rumours which flew about in society bring us into collision with a great authority that of mr carlyle  if you who have never been in rich cyrene know it better than i who have i much admire your cleverness said the delphian oracle to an inquiring colonist  mr carlyle had never lived in the courts of europe about 1753 none the less he fancied he knew more of them and of their secrets than did their actual inhabitants kings courtiers and diplomatists  we saw that in september 1752 according to pickle prince charles sent archibald cameron and lochgarry to scotland with a mission to his representative cluny macpherson and the clans  the english government knowing this and a great deal more through pickle hanged cameron in june 1753 on no new charge but on the old crime of being out in the fortyfive  sir walter scott was well aware of the circumstances  we have already quoted his remark  the ministers thought it prudent to leave dr camerons new schemes in concealment lest by divulging them they had indicated the channel of communication which it is well known they possessed to all the plots of charles edward  mr carlyle however knew better  after giving a lucid account of the differences which in 17521753 menaced the peaceful relations between england and prussia after charging heavily in favour of his hero frederick mr carlyle refers to archibald cameron  cameron he says was a very mild species of jacobite rebel     i believe he had some vague jacobite errands withal never would have harmed anybody in the rebel way and might with all safety have been let live      but his grace the duke of newcastle and the english had got the strangest notion into their head    what is certain though now well nigh inconceivable it was then in the upper classes and political circles universally believed that this dr cameron was properly an emissary of the king of prussia that camerons errand here was to rally the jacobite embers into a flame     and that frederick would send 15000 men to aid the clans  these ideas of the political circles mr carlyle thinks about as likely as that the cham of tartary had interfered in the bangorian controversy 196a now horace walpole says 196b intelligence had been received some time before through pickle of camerons intended journey to britain with a commission from prussia to offer arms to the disaffected highlanders      that prussia who opened her inhospitable doors to every british rebel should have tampered in such a business was by no means improbable     two sloops were stationed to watch yet cameron landed  writing to mann april 27 1753 horace walpole remarks  what you say you have heard of strange conspiracies fomented by our nephew frederick is not entirely groundless  he adds that cameron has been taken while feeling the ground  information as to fredericks tampering with jacobitism came to the english government not only through pickle but through count kaunitz the austrian minister  on december 30 1753 mr keith wrote to the duke of newcastle from the imperial court  he had thanked count kaunitz for his intelligence and had expressed the wish of george ii for news as to the place of the young pretenders abode  he commented on fredericks ill faith and ambition which could not fail to set the english nation against his interest by showing the dangerous effects of any increase of force or power in a prince capable of such horrid designs 197  as between mr carlyle in 1853 and the diplomatists of europe in 1753 the game is unequal  the upper classes and political circles knew more of their own business than the sage of ecclefechan frederick as walpole said was tampering with the jacobites  he as good as announced his intention of doing so when he sent the earl marischal to paris where however the earl could not wear jamess green ribbon of the thistle  but to frederick the jacobites were mere cards in his game  if england would not meet his views on a vexed question of prussian merchant ships seized by british privateers then he saw that a hand full of jacobite trumps might be useful  the earl marischal had suggested this plan 198a   the earl wrote from paris february 10 1753  the king of england shows his illwill in his pretensions on east frisia in the affairs of the empire and in revoking the guarantee of silesia  your majesty therefore may be pleased to know the strength of the party hostile to him at home in which and in the person of prince edouard charles you may find him plenty to do if he pushes you too far the earl then suggests sending a rich english gentleman to frederick this was mr james dawkins of the over norton family the explorer of palmyra  pickle mentions him as dkns  frederick did not expect a rupture with england but condescended to see the earls friend mr dawkins  on may 7 the earl announces his friends readiness to go to berlin and says that there is a project maturing in england  the leaders are dawkins dr king of oxford homme desprit vif agissant and the earl of westmoreland homme sage prudent dune bonne tete bon citoyen respectable et respecte 198b  they will communicate with frederick through the earl marischal if at all  the prince knows less of the affair than dawkins does  the princes position coupled with an intrepidity which never lets him doubt where he desires causes others to form projects for him which he is always ready to execute  i have no direct communication with him not wishing to know his place of concealment  we correspond through others  frederick may 29 1753 thinks the plot still crude and advises the jacobites to tamper with the british army and navy  it will be for my interest to encourage them in their design underhand and without being observed  you will agree with me that the state of european affairs does not permit me to declare myself openly  if the english throne were vacant a well conceived scheme might succeed under a regency  such is the attitude of frederick  he receives a jacobite envoy he listens to tales of conspiracies against his uncle he offers suggestions he will encourage treason sous main  in fact frederick behaves with his usual cold curious unscrupulous skill  fredericks letters have brought us to may 1753 when archy cameron in the tower of london lay expecting his doom  while kings princes ambassadors statesmen and highland chiefs were shuffling conspiring peeping lying and spying the sole burden of danger fell on archibald cameron lochgarry and cluny  they were in the electors domains their heads were in the lions mouth  we have heard young glengarry accuse both archy cameron and cluny of embezzling the princes money in the loch arkaig hoard but glengarrys accusations can scarcely have been credited by charles otherwise he would not have entrusted the doctor with an important mission  clunys own character except by kennedy and young glengarry is unimpeached and lochgarry bore the stoutest testimony to his honour  the early biography of archibald cameron is interesting  as the youngest son of old lochiel he with his famous brother the gentle lochiel set about reforming the predatory habits of their clan with considerable success  archibald went to glasgow university and read moral philosophy under the ingenious dr hutchinson  he studied medicine in edinburgh and in france then settled in lochaber and married a lady of the clan of campbell  he was remarked for the sweetness of his manners and was so far from being a violent jacobite that he dissuaded his brother lochiel from going to see the prince at his first landing in 1745  this account of his conversion from the gentlemans magazine june 1753 is naif dr cameron was at last brought to engage by the regard due to a benefactor and a brother who was besides his chief as head of his clan and threatened to pistol him if he did not comply  wounded at falkirk the ball was never extracted he served at culloden escaped to france with lochiel was surgeon in his regiment and later in lord ogilivies was guardian of lochiels son and as we know came and went from scotland with lochgarry and young glengarry his last trip to scotland was undertaken in september 1752  of his adventures there in concerting a rising we know nothing  on march 20 he was detected near inversnaid possibly through a scoundrel of his own name and was hunted by a detachment of the inversnaid garrison they were long baffled by children set as sentinels who uttered loud cries as the soldiers approached  at last they caught a boy who had hurt his foot and from him discovered that cameron was in a house in a wood  thence he escaped but was caught among the bushes and carried to edinburgh by blands dragoons  on april 17 he was examined by the council at the cockpit in whitehall  he was condemned on his attainder for being out in 1745 201 and his wife in vain besieged george ii and the royal family with petitions for his life  the scots magazine of may 1753 contains a bold and manly plea for clemency  in an age in which commiseration and beneficence is so very conspicuous among all ranks and on every occasion we have reason to hope that pity resides in that place where it has the highest opportunity of imitating the divine goodness in saving the distressed  they sought for grace at a graceless face  mrs cameron was shut up with her husband to prevent her troubling any of the royal family or nobility with petitions in his favour  on june 8 cameron was hanged and disembowelled but not while alive as was the custom  a london letter of june 9 says he suffered like a brave man a christian and a gentleman     his merit is confessed by all parties and his death can hardly be called untimely as his behaviour rendered his last day worth an age of common life   one crowded hour of glorious life is worth an age without a name   as scott remarks when he lost his hazardous game dr cameron only paid the forfeit which he must have calculated upon  the government knowing that plots against george ii and his family were hatching daily desired to strike terror by severity  but prince charles when in england and scotland more than once pardoned assassins who snapped pistols in his face till his clemency excited the murmurs of his followers and the censures of the cameronians they wrote thus   we reckon it a great vice in charles his foolish pity and lenity in sparing these profane blasphemous red coats that providence put into his hand when by putting then to death this poor land might have been eased of the heavy burden of these vermin of hell 202   cameron was deprived in prison of writing materials but he managed to secure a piece of pencil with which on scraps of paper he wrote his last words to his friends  these were obtained by mrs cameron and are printed in the state trials 203  never was higher testimony borne to man than by cameron to prince charles   as i had the honour from the time of the royal youths setting up his fathers standard to be almost constantly about his person till november 1748    i became more and more captivated with his amiable and princely virtues which are indeed in every instance so eminently great as i want words to describe  i can further affirm and my present situation and that of my dear prince too can leave no room to suspect me of flattery that as i have been his companion in the lowest degree of adversity that ever prince was reduced to so i have beheld him too as it were on the highest pinnacle of glory amidst the continual applauses and i had almost said adorations of the most brilliant court in europe yet he was always the same ever affable and courteous giving constant proofs of his great humanity and of his love for his friends and his country     and as to his courage none that have ever heard of his glorious attempt in 1745 can i should think call it in question   cameron adds that if he himself was engaged in a new plot neither the fear of the worst death their malice could invent nor much less their flattering promises could have extorted any discovery of it from me  he forgives all his enemies murderers and false accusers from the elector of hanover and his bloody son down to samuel cameron the basest of their spies  as to the princes religion cameron says june 1753  i likewise declare on the word of a dying man that the last time i had the honour to see hrh charles prince of wales he told me from his own mouth and bid me assure his friends from him that he was a member of the church of england  who was this samuel cameron who stained by treachery the glorious name of lochiels own clan  on this point the following letter written after archys death casts some light  we have already seen that samuel cameron was accused of being in communication with murray of broughton as also was young glengarry  young edgar in french service writes thus to his uncle jamess secretary from lille  samuel cameron whom archy mentions in the end of his speech is the same that blair and holker wrote to me about when at rome the end of 1751  he has been a constant correspondent of john murrays and all along suspected of being a spy  camerons remarks leave it without a doubt  samuel edgar adds is now a halfpay lieutenant in french service at dunkirk  lord ogilvie and lochiel mean to secure him but lord lewis drummond does not think the evidence sufficient  from the scots magazine of september 1753 we learn that a courtmartial of scottish officers was held on samuel at lille and in april 1754 we are told that after seven months detention he was expelled from france and was condemned to be shot if he returned  his sentence was read to him on board a ship at calais and we meet him no more dr cameron was buried in a vault of the savoy chapel and in 1846 her present majesty with her wellknown sympathy for the brave men who died in the cause of her cousins permitted a descendant of the doctor to erect a monument to his memory  this was destroyed in a fire on july 7 1864 but now a window in stained glass commemorates a brave man a christian and a gentleman  the one stain on camerons memory thrown as on clunys by young glengarry may be reckoned as effaced  whatever really occurred as to the loch arkaig treasure it did not destroy the princes confidence in the last man who laid down his life for the white rose  before archy camerons death young edgar had written thus from lille to old edgar in rome   may 2 1753  we have no account of cameron except by the gazete  it is thought that all the others who have been apprehended either had of the princes money in their hands or that the government expects they can make some discoverys about it i wish with all my heart the gov had got it in the beginning for it has given the greatest stroke to the cause that can be imagined it has divided the different clans more than ever and even those of the same clan and family so that they are ready to destroy and betray one another  altho i have not altered my opinion about mr m murray yet as he may on an occasion be of great use to the cause with the londonersi thought it not amiss to write him a line to let him know the regard you had for him for as i know him to be vastly vain and full of himself i thought this might be a spur to his zeale  so practically closes the fatal history of the loch arkaig treasure cluny later bore back to france it seems the slender remains of the 40000 louis dor  but this accursed gold had set clan against clan kinsman against kinsman had stained honourable names and probably had helped to convert glengarry into pickle  the highlanders yet remember the princes treasure  a few years ago a highland clergyman tells me he was trolling with a long line in loch arkaig  he hooked something heavy which came slowly to hand with no resistance but that of weight  you have caught one of the princes money bags said the boatman when suddenly the reel shrieked and a large salmo ferox sped out into the loch  my friend landed him he weighed fifteen pounds and that is the latest news of prince charless gold    chapter ixde profundis    charles fears for his own safetyearl marischals adviceletter from

charles  on april 15 he wrote to mr giffard the earl marischal in paris  he obviously feared that the intelligence which led to camerons capture might throw light on his own place of residence his friends at least believed that if he were discovered his life would be in danger  he says   to mr giffard earl marischal from p  april 13 1763  i am extremely unnesi by the accident that has hapened to a certain person you now know how much i was against people in that service 208  my antipathi iff possible increses every day which makes me absolutely determined whatever hapens never to aproch

meaning charles had moved to cologne and notified the fact to stouf goring  goring replied   from stouf  paris  may 8 1753  the message delivered to you by mr cambell has been falsely represented to you or not rightly understood the noble person mr cambell mentions to have sent you a positive message to leave gand and retire to cologne denies to have sent you any positive message at all on that account  he was indeed very anxious for your safety and of opinion that since the taking of mr cameron your person ran an inevitable danger if you staid where you then were and gave as his opinion only that the dominions of the elector of cologne and the palatinate appeared to be the safest by reason of those princes being in interests opposite to the court of hanover but was very far from saying you would be safe there or indeed anywhere  how is it possible a man of his sense could think much less a prince like you who have so many powerfull enemies that any place could guard you from them  no sir he is of opinion that nothing can save your life but by yr taking just measures and prudent precautions to hyde yourself from them  these are the sentiments of the noble person you mention in yours of the 29th whose name i do not put on paper he having desired me never to do it till he gave me leave  he told me further that it would be more for your interest he should not know as yet where you were and bid me advise you to have a care how you walked out of town near the rhine for in your taking such walks it would be easy for five or six men to seise your person and put you in a boat and carry you to holland who have territories but one quarter of an hour distant from ye town       the elibank game can be played by two or more and princes have been kidnapped in our own day  the earl marischal thought charless life in danger from the english  on may 5 young edgar noted the safe return of lochgarry from scotland  charles went to coblentz but was anxious to return to ghent  in june he tried frankfortonthemaine  his letters to la grandemain show him in correspondence with m st germain whether the general or the famous deathless charlatan does not appear  in july he took a house in liege  he asks dormer for newspapers  i am a sedentary man  ye gazetes is en amusement to me  on august 12 he desires an interview with g glengarry and here is pickles account of the interview   before pickle set out for france he writt to loch gairy now lieut col of lord oglebys regiment in garrison at air to meet him at calais  upon pickles arrivall at calais he met loch gairy there and it was agreed between them that loch gairy should next morning set out to notify pickles arrivall to the young pretender and that pickle should move forward to see sir james harrington at simer  near bulloighn and from thence to come to ternan in about a week to meet loch gairy  soon after pickle arrived at ternan loch gairy came to him and told him the youth prince charles would be there next morning and he came accordingly without any servant having with him only a french gentleman who has servd in the army but has of late travelld about with the young pretender loch gairy left them at ternan and set out for air  soon after the young pretender the french gentleman and pickle set out for paris the young pretender being disguisd with a capouch  the young pretender shewd pickle loch gairys report of his late expedition with dr cameron to scotland and also the list hereunto annexd of the numbers of the disaffected clans that doctor cameron and he had engaged in the highlands and also an extract of a memorial or scheme sent over to the pretender from some of his friends in england  the pretender seemd fond of loch gairys paper he said that he had been of late hunted from place to place all over flanders by a jew sent out of england to watch him  the pretender talked very freely with pickle of affairs but did not seem to like the scheme sent him out of england about the parliament that it would be very expensive and that he expected no good from the parliament that loch gairy was trusted by him with most of his motions and how to send to him that he has been a rambling from one place to another about flanders generally from near brussells towards sens and on the borders of france down towards air except some small excursions he made once he went to hamburgh  he told pickle that another rising in scotland would not do untill a war broke out in the north in that case he expected great things from sweden would be done for him by giving him men arms and ammunition  when pickle talkd to him of the king of prussia he said he expected nothing thence as the king of prussia is governd by his interest or resentment onlythat he had sent mr goring to sweden where he had found he had many friends that goring had also been at berlin to propose a match for the young pretender with the king of prussias sister and that he had since sent for sir john graham to berlin to make the same proposals that they were both answerd very civilly that it was not a proper time but they had no encouragement to speak further upon the subjectthe pretender said that he beleivd he had many friends in england but that he had no fighting friends the best service his friends in england could do him at present was to supply him with moneythe night they arrivd at paris the pretender went to a bagniopickle thinks it is calld gains bagno and from thence to sir john graemes house as pickle believes but where he went or how long he staid at paris he does not know  the pretender said he should now get quit of the jew as he intended going to lorain he askd pickle if he would go with him  pickle says that sir john graeme sir james harrington and goring and loch gairy are the pretenders chief confidents and agents and know of his motions from place to place that goring is now ill having been lately cut for a fistula  pickle kept himself as private as he could at paris went no where but to lord marshalls and once to wait upon madame pier cour monsr dargensons mistress who offerd to recommend him to monsr dargenson if he inclind to return to the french service 213 pickle believes monsr dargenson and monsr paris mont martell are the pretenders chiefest friends at the court of france he says that mrs walkingshaw is now at paris big with child that the pretender keeps her well and seems to be very fond of herhe told pickle that he hath seen the paper that was in lord marshalls hands no 2 which lord marshall returnd to sir john graeme declaring that he would not meddle whatever his brother marshal keith might do that lord marshall would receive no papers from little people  pickle believes that the paper was given to lord marshall by mr swimmer or a knight that has lately been abroad who is now in parliament pickle has been told that the pension lately given to the cardinal out of the abbey of st aman twas for the young pretenders behoof and that mr obrien commonly calld lord lismore and mr edgar are the chief people about the old pretender at romepickle says that all the disaffected people that come over from france call upon sir james harrington near bulloign but the young pretender has a correspondence with england by means of one dormer a merchant at antwerp who pickle believes is brother to a lord dormer   pickle of course forwarded to the english government a copy of lochgarrys report and list of clans  these follow  partly extracted from loch gairys memorial to the pretender after his return from scotland 1749 or 1750  it is the greatest consequence to your rh not to delay much longer making at attempt in scotland  otherwise it will be hardly possible to bring the clans to any head it would be no difficult matter at this instant to engage them once more to draw their swords  because besides their natural attachment to your rh there is most undoubtedly such a spirit of revenge still subsisting amongst the clans who sufferd and such a general discontent amongst the others who have been scandalously slighted by the government that if made a right use of before it extinguishes must unavoidably produce great and good effects  in the present situation of your rh it is evident that the most simple scheme and that in which the whole plan is seen at once is most proper for your rh to take in hand  it is without doubt that london would be the most proper place for the first scene of action because it is the fountain and source of power riches and influence but the eye of the government is so watchfull at the fountain head that one cant easily comprehend what they the jacobites can be able to shew against six thousand of the best troops in britain which can be brought together against them upon the first alarm  that england will do nothing or rather can do nothing without a foreign force or an appearance in scotland such as was in 45  in either of these cases there is all the reason to believe that england would do wonders  but am afraid its impossible for your rh to procure any foreign assistance in the present situation of europe therefore the following proposals are most humbly submitted to your rh  that your rh emply such persons as will be judgd most proper to negotiate a sum of money at paris london and madrid which is very practicable to be accomplishd by known and skilfull persons the sum may be supposd to be 200000l to be directly remitted to one centrical place suppose paris this money to be lodgd in the hands of mons de montmartell who can easily remitt any sum as demanded to any trading town in europe  sufficient quantity of arms ammunition etc to be purchasd which can be done in some of the hans towns in the north which can be done without giving any umbrage supposing them bought for some plantation which is now a common transaction especially in these towns  two stout ships to be purchasd which is so common a transaction in trade more so now than ever so much that i am told it might even be done at london the ships is absolutely necessary to batter down the small forts on the western coast of the highlands which your rh knows greatly annoyd us in 45 and prevented several clans joining with their whole strength  when every thing is ready your rh to pitch upon a competent number of choice officers of whom there are plenty both in france holland germany and spain all scots or of scots extraction eminent for their loyalty and military capacity your rh to land where you landed before or rather in lochanuie your rh will have an army by the management and influence of yourself and by their concertion already agreed upon with me before you are twenty days landed of at least six thousand men and there is actually but six batallions of foot and two regiments of dragoons in scotland and your rh can have 2000 good men ere you are eight and forty hours landed  if the enemy take the field they will make but a feint resistance against such a resolute determined set of men  your rh has all advantages over the regular troops in scotland you can always attack them and force them to battle without ever being forct but when its judgd advantageousthis is certain you can move your army across the country in three or four days which will take the regular troops as many weeks  you can make them starve and rot with cold and fluxes and make them dwindle away to nothing if they were triple your number and without striking a stroak if we take the advantage the countrey and climate affordsthe renownd king robert bruce sir william wallace and the late marquis of montrose of which your rh is a perfect model made always use of this advantage with infallible success against their enemys  it is a truth not disputed by any who knows the nature of the affair that if your rh had obligd the regular forces in scotland in 1746 to make one other winter campain without giving then battle than which nothing was more easy two thirds of them at least had been destroyed whilst ten such campains would have only more and more invigorated our rhs army  if this project be not long delayed and that your rh persists in putting it into execution you will in all human probability drive your enemys before you like a parcel of sheep  there follows   a list of the clans given by loch gairy to the pretender in consequence of their agreement with him  your rh arriving with money arms and a few choice officers will find the following clans ready to join this computation of them being very moderate and most of them have been always ready to join the r strd under the most palpable disadvantages  the mackdonells as matters stand at present by young g glengarrys concurrence only       2600  by g interest the bearer lochgarry can answer for the mackleans at least         700  there is little doubt but the mackkenzies would all join g as related to the most considerable gentlemen of this clan and the bearer can answer for at least     900  the bearer having sounded several gentlemen of the name of macleod over whom g as being nearly connected has great influence the bearer can answer for at least    450  the bearer answers for the mackinnans mackleods of rasaat least      300  the bearer answers for the chisolms    200  the bearer answers for the robertsons    250  camerons    500  stuart of alpin    250  mcneals of barra    150  mackphersons    350  mcintoshes    350  frazers    400  mackgregors    200  athol men at least    500  out of brodulbin     300  duke of gordons interest glenlivat and strathdon at least    500  mdugalls mcnobbs and mclouchlins    250  the bearer has tamperd with the grants and if properly managed at least    500  good men     9660   besides the great dependance on the low countreys and of other clans that in all probability will join your rh the above mentioned clans have not lost a thousand men during the transactions of 45 and 46 and by consequence are most certainly as numerous as they were then and for the reasons already given they are readier and more capable for action at present than they were in 45  one reason in particular is worth your rhs observation that since the end of the late war there has been by an exact computation between six and seven thousand men reformd out of the british and dutch service most of whom were of the loyal clans and are now at home   we have provisionally dated this communication of pickles in august or september when charles wished to see g  a date is given by the reference to miss walkinshaws condition  her child born in paris was baptized at liege in october 1753  so far according to pickle charles seemed very fond of her  this did not last  it may be observed that lochgarrys memorial shows how great was the influence of young glengarry  nearly 5000 men await his word  and young glengarry as pickle was sending the memorial to henry pelham  on his return to london pickle gave the following information in part a repetition of what he had already stated       pickle since he has been in england generally heard of the young pretender by lochgary who requested him by directions from the young pretender to make the last trip that he went upon to france the intent of which was to communicate to pickle the scheme that he lochgarry and dr cameron had concerted in the highlands and to offer him some arms to be landed at different times upon any part of his estate that he should appoint but which pickle absolutely refusd to consent to as he might be ruind by a discovery and which could hardly be avoided as the country was so full of troops and nobody as yet knowing in what manner the forfeited estates would be settledpickle believes that some friends of p charles of lorraine in hainault often harbour the young pretender and favor him in his ramblesthat at the court of france monsr dargenson 219 is his chief friend in the ministry that monsr puysieux was his enemy as was also monsr st contest who is a creature of puysieux  pickle looks upon the duke of richlieu and all that are related to the family of lorraine to be friends of the pretenders that monsr paris montmartell is the pretenders great friend and told pickle he would contrive to raise 200000l for his service upon a proper occasion  pickle was told by the pretender himself that madame pompadour was not his friend for that she had been gaind over by considerable sums of money from england and had taken offence at him for his slighting two billetts that had been sent by her to him which he had done for fear of giving umbrage to the queen of france and her relations as to the french king pickle has had no opportunity of knowing much of his disposition but does not look upon him as a well wisher to the pretenders cause unless it be at any time to serve his own purpose  as to the king of prussia pickle can say but little about him having never been employd in that quarter and knows no more than what he has been told by the young pretender which was that he had sent collonel goring to berlin to ask the k of prussias sister in marriage that goring had been received very cooly and had had no favourable answer that he afterwards had sent sir john graeme whose reception was better and that he soon went himself to berlin where he was well received but the affair of the marriage was declind that the k of prussia advised him to withdraw himself privately from berlin and retire to silesia and to keep himself conceald for some time in some convent there  that the k of prussia told the pretender he would assist him in procuring him six thousand swedes from gottenburgh with the collusion of the court of france but pickle understood that this was to take place in the event only of a war breaking out  pickle since his return to england has been but once at a club in the city where they drink very hard but at which upon account of the expence he cannot be as frequently as he would wish to be nor can he afford to keep company with people of condition at this end of the town  the jacobites in england dont choose to communicate any of their schemes to any of the irish or scots from the latter of whom all that they desire is a rising upon a proper occasionthat he does not personally know much of the heads of the party in englandonly as he has seen lists of their names in the pretenders and ld marishalls handssuch as he knows of them would certainly introduce him to others were he in a condition of defraying the expence that this would be attended with which he is not being already endebted to several people in this town and has hitherto had no more than his bare expences of going backwards and forwards for these three years past       it is needless to say that this piece deepens the evidence connecting pickle with glengarry  poor james mohr had no estates and no seaboard whereon to land arms  at the close of the letter in autumn 1753 pickle speaks of his three years service  he had therefore been a spy since 1750 when he was in rome  now james mohr off and on had been a spy since 1745 at least  we may now pursue the course of intrigues with prussia  frederick on june 6 1753 the day before camerons execution wrote to the earl marischal  he wished that jemmy dawkinss affair was better organised  but in my present situation with the king of england and considering his action against me it would be for the good of my service that you should secretly aid by your good advice these people the dawkins conspirators 222a  so the cham of tartary does interfere in the bangorian controversy despite mr carlyle  it is easy to imagine how this cautious encouragement sous main would be exaggerated in the inflamed hopes of exiles  the earl marischal had in fact despatched dawkins to berlin on may 7 not letting him know that frederick had consented to his coming 222b  dawkins was to communicate his ideas to marshal keith  the earl did not believe in a scheme proposed by dawkins and was convinced that foreign assistance was necessary  this could only come from prussia sweden france or spain  prussia has no ships but few are needed and merchant vessels could be obtained  the earl would advise no prussian movement without the concurrence of france  but france is unlikely to assent and sweden is divided by party hatreds  he doubts if france was ever well disposed to the house of stuart  the spanish have got the ships and got the men but are hampered by engagements with austria and savoy  frederick saw dawkins at berlin but did not think his plans well organised  he preferred in fact to await events and to keep up jacobite hopes by vague encouragement  on june 16 1753 frederick writes to his agent michell in london  he does not believe that england will go to war with him for a matter of 150000 crowns which they refuse to pay to my subjects on account of captures made by english privateers  but though the english king can do me much harm i can pay him back by means which perhaps he knows nothing of and does not yet believe in     i command you to button yourself up on this head de vous tenir tout boutonne because these people must not see my cards nor know what in certain events i am determined to do 223  he was determined to use the jacobites if he broke with england  on august 25 1753 frederick wrote to klinggraeffen at vienna that the english ministry was now of milder mood but in september relations were perilous again  on july 4 1753 the earl told marshal keith that a warrant was out against dawkins 224a  in fact to anticipate dates a little the english government knew a good deal about jemmy dawkins the explorer of palmyra and envoy to his prussian majesty  albemarle writes from paris to lord holdernesse december 12 1753  224b  as yet my suspicions of an underhand favourer of their cause being come from england and addressing himself to the late lord marshall can only fall on one person and that is mr dawkins who has a considerable property in one of our settlements in the west indies this is the gentleman who travelled in syria with mr bouverie since dead and mr wood who is now with the duke of bridgewater and who are publishing an account of their view of the antiquities of palmeyra  mr dawkins came from england to paris early the last spring 1753 and was almost constantly with the late lord marshall he used sometimes to come to my house too  in may he obtained a pass from this court to go to berlin by the late lord marshalls means as i have the greatest reason to believe for he never applied to me to ask for any such nor ever mentioned to me his intention of taking that journey and by a mistake monsr de st contest put that pass into my hands as it was for an englishman which i have kept and send it enclosed to your lordship  but whether mr dawkins never knew that it had been delivered to me or was ashamed to ask it of me as it had not been obtained through my channell or was afraid of my questioning him about it or about his journey i cannot say however he went away without it not long after its date which is the 2d of may  and he returned from thence to compiegne the latter end of july which was a few days before the court left that place  since that he went to england where i believe he now is having had the superintendency of the publication of the work above mentioned on palmyra  mr dawkins as well as his uncle who lives in oxfordshire near chipping norton is warmly attached to the pretenders interest which with the circumstances i have related of him which agree with most of those hinted at in your lordships letter particularly as to times are very plausible grounds of my mistrusts of him  i shall make the strictest inquiries concerning him as he is the only person of note either british or irish who to my knowledge came here from england about the time your lordship mentionswho frequented assiduously the late lord marshall attainted but alive who passed from thence to berlinand in short whose declared principles in the jacobite cause and whose abilities made him capable of the commission he may be supposed to be engaged in  i shall not be less attentive to get all the intelligence i can of any other person under this description who may at any time frequent the late lord marshall and to give your lordship an exact account of what shall come to my knowledge  if on your lordships part you could come at any further discovery concerning mr dawkins i hope you will inform me of so much of it as may be of any service to me in my inquiries  the extreme caution and prudence with which your lordship informs me the late lord marshall conducts himself for fear of risking the secret will i apprehend make it impossible for me to penetrate into the instruction he may be charged with in this respect from his master or how far he is intrusted with his prussian majestys intentions  i have not the least doubt of the late lord marshalls being in correspondence with the pretenders elder son who was lately as i was informed some time after he left it at the abbaye of s amand not far from lisle which is most convenient for him his brother the cardinal being as i am assured abbot of that monastery  as for the lady described under the character of la bonne amie de monsieur de cambrai that is mrs obrian whose husband is by the pretenders favour the mock earl of lismore a follower of his fortunes and supposed to have a considerable share in his confidence   from the same  paris  tuesday december 18 1753      i must take this opportunity to rectify a small mistake in my last letter relating to the abbaye of st amand of which i had been informed that the pretenders younger son the cardinal was abbot it is the abbaye of aucline of which he is commendatory and which is at much about the same distance from lille as the other  it is the more probable that the pretenders elder son was there last autumn as he might take that opportunity of seeing the princess of rohan a relation of the prince of soubise an ancient flame of his who went to lille at the time of the encampment in flanders under that princes command   apparently the warrant against jemmy dawkins was not executed  we shall meet him again  meanwhile there were comings and goings between goring and the earl marischal in july 1753  in september goring was ill and one beson was the princes messenger july 2 september 5 1753  on september 5 charles made a memorandum for besons message to the earl marischal  i will neither leave this place nor quit ye l the lady miss walkinshaw  i will not trust myself to any k or p  i will never go to paris nor any of the french dominions  the rest is confused illspelled jottings about money which beson had failed to procure in london 227  on september 12 charles scrawls a despairing kind of note to goring he writes another underscored dismissing his avignon household that is my papist servants  my mistress has behaved so unworthily that she has put me out of patience and as she is a papist too i discard her also     daniel is charged to conduct her to paris  this was on november 12  on october 29 miss walkinshaws child charlotte had been baptized at liege  charless condition was evil he knew he was being tracked he knew not by whom  hope deferred as to prussia made his heart sick  moreover on august 19 1752 goring had written from paris that he was paralysed on one side pickle says that his malady was a fistula  goring expressed anxiety as to charless treatment of an invalided servant  you should know by what i have often expressed to you charles answered on november 3 that iff i had but one lofe of bred i would share it with you  the little money that i have deposed on my good friends hands you know was at your orders and you would have been much in ye rong to have let yourself ever want in ye least  again on november 12 he writes to goring   to mr stouf  november 12  i am extremely concerned for yr health and you cannot do me a greater cervice than in taking care of yrself for i am not able to spare any of my true friends   dr king as we have said accuses charles of avarice  charles ii in exile would not he says have left a friend in want  though distressed for money the prince does not display a niggardly temper in these letters to goring  he had to defray the expenses of many retainers he intended to dismiss his popish servants his household at avignon and to part with dumont  we shall read gorings remonstrances  but the affair of daniels close proves how hardly charles was pressed  on december 16 1752 he indulged in a few books including wood and dawkinss ruins of palmyra a stately folio  one extraordinary note he made at this time  a marque to be put on ye child iff i part with it  the future bonny lass of albanie was to be marked like a kelt returned to the river in spring  i am pushed to ye last point and so wont be cagioled any more  he collected his treasures left with mittie the surgeon of stanislas at luneville  among these was a couteau de chasse with a doublebarrelled pistol in a handle of jade  dargenson reports that the prince was seen selling his pistols to an armourer in paris  who can wonder if he lost temper and sought easy oblivion in wine    chapter xjames mohr macgregor    another spyrob roys son james mohr

 this highland gentleman with his courage his sentiment and his ingrained falseness is known to the readers of mr stevensons catriona though unacquainted with the documents which we shall cite mr stevenson divined james mohr with the assured certainty of genius from first to last james was a valiant plausible conscienceless heartless liar with a keen feeling for the point of honour and a truly celtic passion of affection for his native hand  as early at least as the spring of 1745 james mohr while posing as a jacobite was in relations with the law officers of the crown in scotland 231a  jamess desire then was to obtain a commission in a highland regiment and as much ready money as possible  either he was dissatisfied with his pay as a spy or he expected better things from the jacobites for after arranging his evidence to suit his schemes he took up arms for the prince  he captured with a handful of men the fortress of inversnaid he fell severely wounded at prestonpans and called out as he lay on the ground my lads i am not dead  by god  i shall see if any of you does not do his duty though he fought at culloden james appears to have patched up a peace with the government and probably eked out a livelihood by cattlestealing and spying till on december 8 1750 he helped his brother robin to abduct a young widow of some property 231b  soon after he was arrested tried and lodged first in the tolbooth next for more security in edinburgh castle  on november 16 1752 james by aid of his daughter mr stevensons catriona escaped from the castle disguised as a cobbler 232a  it has often been said that the government connived at jamess escape if so they acted rather meanly in sentencing two lieutenants of his guard to be broke the sergeant reduced to a private man and the porter to be whipped 232b  the adventures of james after his escape are narrated by a writer in blackwoods magazine for december 1817  this writer was probably a macgregor and possessed some of jamess familiar epistles overcoming a fond desire to see once more his native hills and his dear ones fourteen in all james on leaving edinburgh castle bent his course towards the border  in a dark night on a cumberland moor he met the famed billy marshall the gipsy  mr marshall apologising for the poverty of his temporary abode remarked that he would be better housed when some illwill which he had got in galloway for setting fire to a stackyard would blow over  three days later billy despatched james in a fishing boat from whitehaven whence he reached the isle of man  he then made for ireland and my next information about james occurs in a letter of balhaldie dated august 10 1753 to the king over the water 232c  balhaldies letter to rome partly in cypher runs thus and is creditable to jamess invention  james drummond macgregor rob roys son came here some days agoe and informed me that having made his escape from scotland by ireland he was addressed to some namesakes of his there who acquainted him that the clan macgregor were very numerous in that country under different names the greatest bodies of them living together in little towns and villages opposite to the scottish coast  they had left scotland some one hundred and fifty years before when their clan was proscribed  james never saw men more zealously loyal and clanish better looked or seemingly more intrepid and hardy     no macgregors in the scotch highlands are more willing or ready to joyn their clan in your majestys service than they were and for that end to transport 3000 of their name and followers to the coast of argileshyre  they will only require twentyfour hours to transport themselves in whirries of their own even in face of the enemys fleet of which they are not affrayed    the king in answer september 11 1753 expressed a tempered pleasure in mr macgregors information which he said might interest the prince  on september 6 1753 lord strathallan writing to edgar from boulogne vouches only for jamess courage  as to anything else i would be sorry to answer for him as he had but an indifferent character as to real honesty  on september 20 james mohr in paris wrote to the prince anxious to know where he was and to communicate important news from ireland  probably james got no reply for on october 18 1753 lord holdernesse wrote from whitehall to lord albemarle english ambassador in paris a letter marked very secret acknowledging a note of lord albemarles  mr macgregor had visited lord albemarle on october 8th and 10th with offers of information  lord holdernesse therefore sends a safe conduct for macgregors return 234  we now give macgregors letter of october 12 1733 to lord albemarle setting forth his sad case and honourably patriotic designs   ms  add 32733  paris  october 12 1753  mr james drummond  my lordtho i have not the honour to be much acquainted with your lordship i presume to give you the trouble of this to acquaint your lordship that by a false information i was taken prisoner in scotland in november 1751 and by the speat spite that a certain faction in dundas scotland had at me was trayd by the justiciary court at edinburgh when i had brought plenty of exculpation which might free any person whatever of what was alledged against me yet such a jurie as at dundas was given me thought proper to give in a special verdict finding some parts of the layable libel proven and in other parts found it not proven  it was thought by my friends that i would undergo the sentence of banishment which made me make my escape from edinburgh castle in novr 1752 and since was forced to come to france for my safety  i always had in my vew if possable to be concerned in governments service 235 and for that purpose thought it necessar ever since i came to france to be as much as possable in company with the pretenders friends so far as now i think i can be one useful subject to my king and country upon giving me proper incouragement  in the first place i think its in my power to bring allan breack stewart the suposd murdrer of colin campbell of glenouir late factor of the forfet estate of ardsheal to england and to deliver him in safe custody so as he may be brought to justice and in that event i think the delivering of the said murderer merits the getting of a remission from his majesty the king especially as i was not guilty of any acts of treason since the year 1746 and providing your lordship procures my remission upon delivering the said murderer i hereby promise to discover a very grand plott on footing against the government which is more effectually carried on than any ever since the family of stewart was put off the throne of britain and besides to do all the services that lays in my power to the government  only with this provision that i shall be received into the governments service and that i shall have such reward as my service shall meritt i am willing if your lordship shall think it agreeable to go to england privily and carry the murderer allan breck alongest with me and deliver him at dover to the military and after waite on such of the kings friends as your lordship shall appoint  if your lordship think this agreeable i should wish general campbell would be one of those present as he knows me and my family and besides that i think to have some credit with the general which i cannot expect with those whom i never had the honour to know  either the general or lieutt colln john crawford of poulteneys regiment would be very agreeable to me as i know both of these would trust me much and at the same time i could be more free to them than to any others there  your lordship may depend on the motive that induces me to make this offer at present to you in the governments name is both honourable and just 236 so that i hope no other constructions will be put on it and for your lordships further satisfaction i say nothing in this letter but what i am determined to perform and as much more as in my power layes with that and that all i have said is trueth and i shall answer to god  jas drummond   james was sent over to england and we now offer the results of his examination in london on november 6 1753  the following document deals with the earlier part of mr macgregors appalling revelations and describes his own conduct on landing in france after a tour in the isle of man and ireland in december 1752  that he communicated his irish mares nest to charles as he says he did is very improbable  like sir francis clavering as described by the chevalier strong james mohr would rather he than not  however he certainly gave a version of his legend to the old chevalier in rome   extract of the examination of mr james drummond  that about the 8th of may following vizt may 1753  he mr d did set out for france and arrived at boulogne on the 16th where he met with lord strathalane and as he mr d was asking after the young pretender his lordship told him that he had seen a letter from him the young pretender lately to sir james harrington at which time he the young pretender was lodged at an abbes house about a league and half from lisle whereupon he mr d communicated to his lordship in the presence of capt wm drummond and mr charles boyde the commission with which he was charged  that thereupon his lordship undertook to wait upon the young pretender with the irish proposal and advised him mr d to go and stay at bergue till he lord strathalane came to him there  that on the 20th june following his lordship wrote him mr d a letter which is hereunto annexed to this effectthat he lord strathalane had laid mr savages proposal before the young pretender who desired that he mr d would repair to paris and that he had sent him mr d a bill upon mr waters the banker to pay his charges 238  that he mr d did accordingly go to paris and that upon his arrival there he first waited upon mr gordon principal of the scots college but that nothing particular passed there  nb there is not one word in any of mr drummonds papers of his the princes intending to go to berlin  official note   nobody of course can believe a word that james mohr ever said but his disclosures in the following full report of his examination could only have been made by a person pretty deep in jacobite plans for example balhaldie chief of the macgregors did really live at bievre as james mohr says  there was in edinburgh at this time a certain john macfarlane ws whose pretty wife in 1716 shot dead an english captain nobody ever knew why  she fled to the swintons of swinton who concealed her in their house  one day sir walter scotts aunt margaret then a child of eight residing at swinton stayed at home when the family went to church  peeping into a forbidden parlour she saw there a lovely lady who fondled her bade her speak only to her mother and vanished while the little girl looked out of the window  this appearance was mrs macfarlane who shot captain cayley and was now lying perdue at swinton  now in 1753 the pretty ladys husband mr macfarlane was agent in scotland for balhaldie  to him balhaldie wrote frequently on business sent him also a most curious toy a tortoiseshell snuff box containing in a secret receptacle a portrait of king james viii  letters of his in april 1753 show that james mohr was so far right balhaldie was living at bievre in a glen three leagues from paris and was amusing himself by the peaceful art of making loyal snuffboxes in tortoiseshell 239  as to bievre then james mohr was right  he may or may not have lied in the following paper when he says that the prince was coming over with lord marischal to the balhaldie faction of jacobites who were more in touch with the french court than his own associates mr trant of whom james mohr speaks was really with the prince as pickle also asserts and as the stuart papers prove  probably he was akin to olive trant a pretty intriguer of 1715 mentioned by bolingbroke in his famous letter to wyndham  as to ireland james mohr really did take it on his way to france though his promises in the name of the people of fingal are irish moonshine  were arms as james mohr says lodged in clanranalds country moidart  pickle refused to let them be landed in knoydart his own country and thought nothing of the kind could be done without his knowledge james mohr may really have had news of arms landed at the house of tough on the forth near stirling where they would be very convenient  pickle i conceive was not trusted by clanranald and cameron he had traduced  if james mohr by accident speaks the truth in the following information more was done by lochgarry and cameron than pickle wotted of during the autumn of 1752 and the spring of 1753  the arms may have been those ordered by charles in 1750  here is james mohrs confession made in london november 6 1753 240   that in june 1753 the pretenders son wrote to mr mcgregor of bolheldies in a most sincere manner that he wanted he should undertake his service as formerly  bolheldies refused to undertake anything for him till such time as he was reconciled with his father and make acknowledgements for his misconduct to the king of france and then that he was willing to enter upon his affairs only in concert with the earl of mareschal and none other for that he could not trust any about him  upon which the pretenders son wrote him a second time assuring bolheldies that he would be entirely advised by him and at the same time that he expected no see him soon when things would be concerted to his satisfaction 241  about the middle of september the pretenders son arrived in paris in company with one mr trent trant and fleetwood two english gentlemen who carried him from south of avignon probably a lie and when they came thro avignon he was called mr trents cousin and thereafter upon all their journey till they landed at paris during his stay at paris he stayed at mr john waters house immediately upon his arrival at paris bolheldies was sent for who stayd with him only that night  the next day he went to baivre bievre where he lives two leagues south of paris  how soon bolheldies went home he sent express to mr butler the king of frances master of the horse and also a great favorite  mr butler came upon a sunday morning to baivre and about 3 oclock in the afternoon the earl of marischal sent an express to bolheldies and after receipt of this express mr butler went off to versailles that evening bolheldies told me that now he hoped the prince as he called him would be advised by his best friends for that he seems to have a full view of what folly he had committed by being advised and misled by a parcel of such fools as has been about him since the year 1745  but now providing he would stand firm to his promise to stand by the earl of mareschal and his advice that he hoped his affairs might soon be brought on a right footing he added further that he was still afraid of his breaking thro concert that he was so headstrong how soon he saw the least appearance of success that he might come to ruin his whole affairs as he did when he stole away to scotland in the year 1745 by the advice of john murray callie kelly sheridan and such other fools  i then told bolheldies that he had been at great pains to get the restoration of the family stuart brought about and that tho he succeeded he might be very ill rewarded in the event and he and his clan probably on the first discontent be ruined as that family had done formerly to gratify others for that it seems he had forgot that very family in king charless time persecuted the whole of his clan in a most violent manner 242 and i added farther that the whole of his clan would be much better pleased if he did but procure liberty from the government to return home and live the remainder of his days among his friends  bolheldies assured me that he was willing to go home providing he had the least consent from the government only he would not chuse to be put under any restrictions than to live as a peaceable subject  he added further that he was so much afraid of the pretenders son being so ill to manage and also that the irish would break thro secret that he could heartily wish not to be concerned could he but fall on a method to get clear of it but at present that he had engaged to enter upon some business with the earl of mareschal and especially about those proposals from ireland which he thought very probable if matters were carried on by people of sense that knew how to manage for that all this affair depended on keeping the government ignorant of what was doing  four days after this there was a meeting held two leagues south from baivre by the pretenders son earl of mareschal bolheldies mr butler mr gordon principal of the scots college mr trent and fleetwood and some other english gentlemen whom bolheldies did not inform me of  when bolheldies returned home he told me the irish proposals were accepted of and for that purpose that there were some persons to be sent both to scotland and ireland and that i was appointed to be one of those for ireland to transact the affairs with the people of fingal especially as mr savage had desired that if any should be sent that i would be the person intrusted in their affair  243 that col and capt browne capt bagget were to be sent along with mr mcdiarmid  bolheldies also said that he was afraid he would be obliged to take a trip to england some time in winter for that some certain great men there would trust none other to enter on business with them as lord sempil was dead but that if he could help it he did not incline to go  that those that were to be appointed to go to scotland were entirely referd to him and mr gordon the principal  the management of the scots affairs is entirely referd to stirling of kear mr murray of abercarney mr smith and sr hugh paterson uncle of miss walkinshaw  that mr charles has promised to manage the duke of hamilton and friends    bolheldies assured me that any that pleased to join from france would not be hindered  and that there was a method fallen upon to get two ships of war as also plenty of arms and ammunition which would be sent by the ships to both ireland and scotland  that the irish propose to raise 14000 men  and in two days time to have them embarked in wherries from dublin rush skeddish and drogheda and from thence transported in six hours to north wales or in twentyfour hours to scotland either of which as the service required providing always that the 2 ships of war were sent to escort them as also arms and ammunition and money  that it was proposed by both the earl of mareschal and bolheldies that 11000 should land in north wales and 3000 in campbelltown of kentyre in argyleshire for that those in argyleshire that were well affected to their cause would have a good opportunity to rise by leading 3000 irish  that mcdonald of largye has proposed that there will rise from that end of argyleshire 2500 men including the duke of hamiltons men from arran to wit the mcdonalds of largye the mcneils mcalisters lamonds and mclawchlans with what sr james campbell of auchinbreck can rise and those from campbelltown to march to the head of argyleshire and to perthshire where they were to be joind by the north country clans which with the irish and those from argyleshire was computed to be near 14000 men and to be commanded by the earl of mareschal and lord george murray 245  bolheldies assured me    that the pretenders son made a proposal to his father to resign the crown in his favor  it was refused and it was desired of him not to make any further proposals of that kind bolheldies was desired to go to rome to expostulate with the pretender which he begged to be excused for that it was contrary to his opinion and that he did not approve of the proposal would never desire the old gentleman to resign  he told me that this proposal proceeded from the english as the young pretender had owned that he was protestant     it consists with my knowledge that there were lodged in clanronalds country 9000 stands of arms under the care of ronald mcdonald brother to the late kinloch moydart mr mcdonald of glenaladale and the baillie of egg and kept still by them in as good order as possible  that one john mcdonald who is my own cousin german and is also cousin german to glenaladale met with me in the braes of argyleshire in march last james was not in scotland at that date when he told me that if there was an invasion that they had plenty of arms and told the way and manner they had then preserved  but immediately before they were lodged in their hands that dr cameron had taken away without orders 250 stands  that they might be got in order in six days time by very few hands for that they had sustained very little damage  its certain some little pains might find them out     bolheldies assured me that sr john graham was sent by the young pretenders orders to deliver capt ogelvie 8000 swords which had lain at berlin  since the last affair that he was to deliver them to capt ogelvie at or near dunkirk concealed into wine hogsheads and that capt ogelvie was to land them at airth in the frith of forth and to get them conveyed to the house of tough where they were to remain under the charge of mr charles smith whose son is married to the heiress of tough  the house of tough is two miles above stirling  i also saw mr binglie under master of the horse sent by mr butler and met at bolheldies house by young sheridan who is always with the young pretender 246     that the irish proposal sent by me was thus  in way to france i came to the isle of man where i had occasion to meet one mr patrick savage to whom i was recommended by a friend in scotland this mr savage is an irishman and was in scotland some time before i had seen him  he was informed by sir archibald stewart of castlemilk near greenock that sir archibald had seen dr cameron in stirlingshire who told him that he hoped the restoration would happen soon for that preparations were a making for it and that he had been sent to scotland to transact some affairs for that purpose mr savage told me in the year 1745 if the pretenders son had sent but the least notice to ireland that he might have got 10000 or 12000 men for that they at that time had formed a scheme for that purpose expecting to have had a message     mr savage assured me that there were two lords concerned who put it out of his power to let their names be known till i came with a commission from the young pretender and then that they would frankly see me and take me to their houses to make up matters       the pleased reader will observe that mr macgregors irish myth though here sadly curtailed has swollen to huge proportions since he communicated his tale of long lost macgregors to the old chevalier in august  whether the prince was really turning to balhaldie and official jacobitism or not is matter of doubt  mr macgregors information having been swallowed and digested by lord holdernesse pickle was appealed to for confirmation  we have seem his unfriendly report of mr macgregors character as a spy mistrusted by both sides  but among other precautions an english official suggested the following   that if its thought proper mr  pickle clearly should be sent to ireland forthwith to know the whole of those concerned in the irish plot of the people of fingal that he could have a trusty in company sent from the secretary who would undergo any borrowed name and was to be companion in the affair to mr  pickle that particularly those lords should be known as also such of the people of connaght as could be discovered  that mr  pickle is willing to undertake whatever in his power lays to shew the zeal wherewith he is inclined to serve the government but that he will not chuse to go to ireland unless a court trusty is sent with him who will be eye witness to his transactions with the irish as mr   pickle will tell that he the english companion is a trusty sent by the pretenders son   i detect pickle under mr  because later he was sent in a precisely similar manner into scotland accompanied by a court trusty or secret service man named bruce who under the style of cromwell sent in reports along with those despatched by pickle himself  whether pickle really went to ireland to verify mr macgregors legends or not i am unable to say  the following note of his december 13 1753 suggests that he went either on that or a similar errand   add 32730  grandpapain consequence of what past at our last meeting i have wrot to my correspondent fixing the time and place of meeting and at leatest i ought seet off the 20th pray then when and where are we to meet  if not soon i must undow what i have begun  excuse my anxiety and believe me most sincerely with great estime and affection  your most oblidged humble servt  pickle 13th december 1753 to the honble quin vaughan at his house in golden square   here james mohr macgregor slips out of our narrative  he was suspected by balhaldie of having the misfortune to be a doubledyed scoundrel  this impression mr macgregors letters to his dear chief were not quite able to destroy  the letters dunkirk april 6 and may 1 1754 are published in blackwoods magazine for december 1817  james tells balhaldie that he had visited england and had endeavoured to deliver alan breck the murderer of glenure to the government and to make interest for his own brother robin oig  but robin was hanged for abducting the heiress of edenbelly and alan breck escaped from james mohr with the spolia opima including four snuffboxes made perhaps by balhaldie himself in england james mohr informs balhaldie he was offered handsome bread in the government service as a spy  but he replied i was born in the character of a gentleman and he could only serve as a gentleman of honour  james in fact had sold himself too cheap and had done the devils work without the devils wages  probably the falsehood of his irish myth was discovered by pickle and he was dismissed  jamess last letter to balhaldie is of september 25 1754 paris and he prays for a loan of the pipes that he may play some melancholy tunes and then poor james mohr macgregor died a heartbroken exile  his innocent friend in blackwoods magazine asks our approbation for jamess noble highland independence and sense of honour  there was another spy name unknown whose information about the prince in 1753 was full and minute whether accurate or not  it is written in french 250  about the end of june 1753 charles according to this informer passed three months at luneville he came from prussia and left in september for paris  thence charles went to poland and prussia then to strasbourg back to paris thence to liege and thence to scotland  prussia and denmark were next visited and paris again in january 1754  as a rule charles was in scotland or liege collecting an army of deserters  this valuable news reached the duke of newcastle on october 30 1754  as to the irish plot reported by james mohr i found among the papers of the late comte dalbanie a letter from an irish gentleman containing record of a family tradition  charles it was said had passed some time near the giants causeway  the date was uncertain the authority was vague and there is no other confirmation of james mohrs preposterous inventions 251    chapter xia man undone   1754

charles and the destruction of the jacobite party in england  the death of henry pelham in march the general election which followed the various discontents of the time and a recrudescence of jacobite sentiment gave them hopes only to be blighted  charles no longer as before reports my health is perfect  the princes habits had become intolerable to his friends  the spleen as he calls it had marked him for its own  his vigorous body needed air and exercise unable to obtain these it is probable that he sought the refuge of despair  years earlier he had told mademoiselle luci that the princesse de talmond would not let him leave the house  now he scarcely ventured to take a walk  his mistress was obviously on ill terms with his most faithful adherents the loyal goring abandoned his ungrateful service the earl marischal bade him farewell his english partisans withdrew their support and their supplies  the end had come  the following chapter is written with regret  readers of dickens remember the prolonged degradation of the young hero of bleak house through hope deferred and the delays of a chancery suit similar causes contributed to the final wreck of charles  the thought of a restoration was his chancery suit  a letter of november 1753 written by the prince in french is a mere hysterical outcry of impatience  i suffocate he exclaims as if in a fever of unrest he had indulged in hopes from france from spain from prussia from a highland rising from a london conspiracy  every hope had deceived him every prince had betrayed him and now he proved false to himself to his original nature and to his friends  the venerable lord pitsligo writing during the scotch campaign of 1745 said  i had occasion to discover the princes humanity i ought to say tenderness  this is giving myself no great airs for he shows the same disposition to everybody  now all is changed and a character naturally tender and pitiful has become careless of others and even cruel  the connection with miss walkinshaw was the chief occasion of many troubles  on january 14 1754 young edgar wrote from aisse to his uncle in rome saying that clementina walkinshaw has got in with the prince borne two children to him probably only one and got an extreme ascendant over him  the kings friends in england are firmly persuaded of this being true and are vastly uneasy at it especially as his sister is about fredericks widow the dowager princess of wales and has but an indifferent character  this story gives me very great concern and if true must be attended with bad consequences whether she truly be honest or not 254  the fact was that being now accompanied by a mistress and a child charles was easily traced  his personal freedom if not his life was endangered and if he were taken and his papers searched his correspondents would be in peril  on january 4 1754 dormer wrote warning the prince that a young gentleman in hiding with a mistress and child was being sought for at liege and expressing alarm for himself and his comrades  dormer also reproached charles for impatiently urging his adherents to instant action  goring as stouf wrote the following explicit letter from paris on january 13 1754  as we shall see he had been forbidden by the french government to come within fifty leagues of the capital and the bastille gaped for him if he was discovered  goring it will be remarked warns charles that his party are weary of his demands for money  what did he do with it  his wardrobe as an inventory shows was scanty no longer was he a dandy  seventeen shirts six collars three suits of clothes three pocket handkerchiefs were the chief of his effects  he did not give much in charity to poor adherents as goring bitterly observes  we learn that the english insist on the dismissal of miss walkinshaw  to discard dumont as charles proposed was to provide england with an informer  the heads of english gentlemen would be at the mercy of the executioners of archy cameron  to turn adrift charless catholic servants was impolitic cruel and deeply ungrateful  this is the burden of gorings necessary but very uncourtly epistle probably written from la grandemains house   you say you are determined to know from your professed friends what you are to depend on  i wish it may answer your desires you are master sir to take what steps you please i shall not take upon me to contradict you i shall only lay before you what i hear and see if it can be of any service to you i shall have done my duty in letting you know your true interest if you think it such  in the first place i find they the english adherents were surprized and mortifyed to see the little man beson arrive with a message from you only to desire money so soon after the sum you received from the gentlemen i conducted to you and some things have been said on the head not much to the advancement of any scheme for your service secondly they sent me a paper by sir james harrington of which what follows is a copy word for word  sir your friends mistress is loudly and publickly talked off and all friends look on it as a very dangerous and imprudent step and conclude reasonably that no corespondance is to be had in that quarter without risk of discovery for we have no opinion in england of female politicians or of such womens secrecy in general  you are yourself much blamed for not informing our friends at first that they might take the alarum and stop any present or future transactions with such a person  what we now expect from you is to let us know if our persuasion can prevail to get rid of her  for gods sake sir what shall i say or do i am at my wits end the greif i have for it augments my illness and i can only wish a speedy end to my life  to make it still worse you discard dumont he is a man i have little regard for his conduct has been bad but he has kept your secret now sir to be discarded in such a manner he will certainly complain to murray and others it will come to your friends ears if he does not go to england and tell them himself he knows mac 256 mead and d dawkins what will our friends think of you sir for taking so little care of their lives and fortunes by putting a man in dispair who has it in his power to ruin them and who is not so ignorant as not to know the government will well reward him  nay he can do more  he can find you out yourself or put your enemies in a way to do it which will be a very unfortunate adventure  as for me it is in his power to have me put into the bastille when he pleases  perhaps he may not do this but sure it is too dangerous to try whether he will or no they must be men of very tryed virtue who will suffer poverty and misery when they have a way to prevent it so easy too and when they think they only revenge themselves of ingratitude for you will always find that men generally think their services are too little rewarded and when discarded as he will be if you dont recall ye sentence what rage will make him do i shall not answer for  if sir you continue in mind to have him sent off i must first advise those gentlemen the english adherents that they may take propper measures to put themselves in safety by leaving the country or other methods as they shall like best  now sir whether such a step as this will not tend more to diminish than augment your credit in england i leave you to determine i only beg of you sir to give me timely notice that i may get out of the way of that horrid bastille and put our friends on their guard i cannot but lament my poor friend colonel h who must be undone by it  ld m marischal thinks it too dangerous a tryall of that mans honour  for my part i shall not presume to give my own opinion only beg of you once again that we may have time to shift for ourselves  i am obliged to you sir for your most gracious concern for my health the doctors have advised me to take the air as much as my weakness will permit are much against confinement and would certainly advise me against the bastille as very contrary to my distemper  i have one thing more to lay before you of greatest consequence you order all your catholick servants to be discarded consider sir the thing well on both sides first the good that it will produce on the one side and the ill it may produce on the other it may indeed please some few biggotted protestants for all religions have their biggots but may it not disgust the great number of ye people to see you discard faithfull men for some of them went through all dangers with you in scotland upon account of their religionwithout the least provision made for them  your saying sir that necessity obliges you to do it will look a little strange to those people who send you money and know how far you can do good with it  i assure you sir if you did necessary acts of generosity now and then that people may see plainly that you have a real tenderness for those that suffer for you you would be the richer for it more people would send money than now do and they that have sent would send more when they saw so good use made of it  i have been hard put to it when i have been praising your good qualities to some of our friends they have desired me to produce one single instance of any one man you have had the compassion to relieve with the tenderness a king owes to a faithfull subject who has served him with the risk of his life and fortune 259  now sir another greater misfortune may happen from sending off these servants in so distinguishing a manner you will plese to remember that in the course of your affairs the protestants employ the papists the papists join with the protestants in sending you money and in everything that can hasten your restoration they are a great body of men and if they should once have reason to believe they should be harder used under your government than they are under the usurper self preservation would oblige them to maintain the usurper on the throne and be assured if they take this once in their heads they have it in their power to undoe you  a man of sense and great riches as well as birth a great friend of yours talking with me some time past of your royal qualities note this man is a most bigotted protestant was observing the happyness all ranks of men would have under your reign he considered you sir as father to the whole nation that no one set of men would be oppressed papists presbyterians quakers anabaptists antitrinitarians zwinglians and forty more that he named though they differ in their creed under so great and good a prince as you would all join to love and respect you that he was sure you would make no distinction between any of them but let your royal bounty diffuse itself equally on all  he said further that for you to disgust any of them as they all together compose the body so disgusting any one set of men was as if a man in full vigour of health should cut off one of his leggs or arms  he concluded with saying he was sure you was too prudent to do anything of that kind to summ up all he said that he looked on you as a prince divested of passions that the misfortunes and hardships you had undergone had undoubtedly softened your great mind so far as to be sensible of the misfortunes of others for which reason he would do all that lay in his power to serve you these reflections sir really are what creates you the love of your people in general and gains you more friends than yr royal birth  observe sir what will be the event of your discarding these poor men all of them diserving better treatment from you  they will come to paris begging all their way and show the whole town english french and strangers an example of your cruelty their religion being all their offence do you think sir your protestants will believe you the better protestant for it  if you do i am affraid you will find yourself mistaken it will be a handle for your enemies to represent you a hippocrite in your religion and cruel in your nature and show the world what those who serve you are to expect  now sir do as you think fitt but let me beg of you to give such comitions to somebody else as i never could be the author of any such advice so i am incapable of acting in an affair that will do you sir infinite prejudice and cover me with dishonour and am besides these considerations grown so infirm that i beg your rh will be graciously pleased to give me leave to retire     i may have been mistaken in some things which i hope you will pardon i do not write this as my own opinion but really to get your affairs in a true light    i sware to the great god that what i write is truth for gods sake sir have compassion on yourself    you say you will take your party alas sir they will coldly let you take it dont let your spleen get the better of your prudence and judgement     one reflection more on what you mention about ye papist servants may not the keeping publickly in employment ye two papist gentlemen sheridan and stafford do more harm than turning away three or four papist footmen who can by their low situation have no manner of influence over your affairs    one of the papist footmen is besides a relation 261 of the poor man who was lately hanged    when all this comes to be publick it will much injure your carackter to summ up all these commissions you give me give me such affliction as will certainly end my life they are surely calculated by you for that very reason     i once more beg you will graciously please to permit me to retire i will let my family know that my bad health only is the reason and i dont doubt they will maintain me  charles might have been expected to answer this very frank letter in a fury of anger  he kept his temper and replied thus   the prince to stouf  january 18 1754  siri received yours of ye 13th current and am resolved not to discard any of my cervants that is to say for ye present     it is necessary also you should send as soon as possible 300l to be remitted to stafford and sheridan    you may give out of that sum morisons wages for half a year    my compliments to sir j harrington assuring him of my friendship and when you are able remit to him fifty louis dors    it is true i sent to e england six months ago for money but it was not for ye money alone that served only for a pretext however i was extremely scandalized not to have received any since i thought fit to call for it it is strenge such proceeding  people should i think well know that if it was only money that i had at hart i would not act as i have done and will do untill i compass ye prosperity of my country which allways shall be my only studdy  but you know that without money one can do nothing and in my situation the more can be had ye better  i have received nothing since ye profet daniel but mistress ps hundred pounds given to woulfe  i forgot to mention fifty pounds sterling to be given to kely     i am glad you have taken my pelise for nothing can do you more good than to keep yourself warm 263   goring answered on february 26  the english he said would not send a farthing if charles persisted in his sentiments about their duty his repeated despatch of messengers only caused annoyance and alarm they expect a prince who will take advice and rule according to law and not one that thinks his will is sufficient  charles replied as follows   prince to stouf  march 6 1754  i received yours tother day and am sory to find by it yr bad state of health  you are telling me about laws i am shure no one is more willing to submit to ye laws of my country than myself and i have ye vanity to say i know a little of them    all what i want is a definitive answer and it is much fearer fairer to say yes or no than to keep one in suspence which hinders that distressed person of taking other measures that might make him perhaps gain his lawsute  however i shall neither medle or make in it untill i here from you again which i hope will be soon for my friend has lost all patience and so have i to see him linger so long  i wish with all my heart it may mend   at this time pickle was not idle  he wrote to gwynne vaughan from london on february 25 1754  he was going over to paris to extract information from the earl marischal  he signs roderick random and incidentally throws light on his private tastes and morals  his correspondent was apparently an old man worthy old vaughan pickle calls him later  he often addresses him as grandpapa  in this letter he ministers to mr vaughans senile vices   add 32734  monday  london  february 25 1754  dr siri have apointed a meeting with mr alexander lochgarry from whom i recevd a verbal message by a friend now in town that came over by caron mariston that i am desird by monsr st sebastian young pretender to go streight to venice ld marshal to settle for this summer every thing relative to his amours with mrs strenge the highlands and that when we have settled that point that he is to meet me upon my return from venice ld marshal in imperial flanders where he is soon expected     every thing lays now upon the carpet and if i go privately to venice ld marshal i will be at the bottom of the most minute transactions without going to venice ld marshal i can dow little or nothing and i give you my word of honour that i reservd out of the last mony not 10l st but at any rate i cross the watter to save my own credit with our merchants the jacobites and if i am suplayd here without which i can dow nothing i am certain to learn what cant be obtained through any other chanel  i recevd by old caron mariston two extraordinary patez which surprisingly answer pompadours intentions 265  i have trayd the experiment and as i found it so effective i have sent one of them by a carrier that left this saturday last in the morning and how who arrives at bath tomorrow tuesday 26th instant its simply adrest to you at bath it operates in the same lively manner upon the faire sex as it does on ours  the lord have mercy upon the lassies at bath  the patez was sent by the wiltshire carrier how who seets up at the inn on the market place at bath derected to the honble quine vaughan  i have had several bucks this day dining upon the relicks of your sister pattez which is all the apologie i make for this hurried scrawle  i wait your answer with impatience but allwaies believe me with great sincerity and estimemy dr sir  your most affte oblidged humble servt  roderick random   from france when he arrived there pickle wrote to gwynne vaughan as follows   add 32735  aprile  monday 8  1754  4 oclock  dear siri am still in such agitation after fourteen hours passage and sitting up with our friends alexr lochgarry and agent mcdonald how who luckly meet me here that i am scarse able to put pen to paper  i must here confess the difficultys i labour under since the loss of my worthy great friend henry pelham recently dead on whose word i wholly relayd  but now every thing comes far short of my expectations  i am now to aquent you that alexr lochgarry meet me here by order to desire my proceeding to venice ld marshal as every thing without that trip will be imperfect all i can say at this distance and in so precarious a situation is that i find they play mrs strange the highlanders hard and fast they expect a large quantity of the very best brasile snuff the clans from hir to balance which severl gross of good sparkling champagne arms is to be smuggled over for hir ladyships use  the whole accounts of our tobacco and wine trade jacobite schemes i am told are to be laid before me by my friend at venice ld marshal but this being a chant jaunt i cant complay with without a certain suplay i must beg if this proposal be found agreeable that i have ane imediate pointed answer  but if when i leave venice ld marshal i go to meet st sebastien the young pretender the remittance must be more considerable that the sume i mentiond whilest you were at bath     yours most affly  alexr pickle  to mr tamas jones at mr chelburns a chimmist in scherwood street golden square london   pickle wrote again from france on april 11 267  his letter follows   dr siri hope my last to you upon landing came safe to hand  i will be very uneasy untill you accknowledge the recet of it  tho you cant expect an explicite or regular corespondence from me least our smuguling secret correspondence so severely punishd in this country should be any ways discoverd  mr davis sir james harrington was here for a few hours last night the particulars i reffer till meeting  great expectations from the norwegian fir trade sweden which merchants here think will turn out to good account by offering them ane ample charter to open a free trade but davis sir james harrington is not well versd in this business but i believe my friend at venice ld marshal is  i am certain that mr oliver king of spain and his principal factors would harken to any proposals of st sebastiens the young pretender upon this topick mr davis sir james harrington is of opinion that a quantity of best mettle buttons parliament men 268 could be readly and cheaply purchasd  mr johnson london will make considerable advances but i believe this cant arrive in time for the market as aplication has not yet been made to monsr la force paris mont martell  i think i can easily divert them from this as i can convince st sebastien young pretender in case i see him that they would leave him in the lurch  this proposal comes from your side the watter  i find mrs strange highlanders will readly except of any offer from rosenberge king of sweden as that negotiant can easily evade paying duty for any wine he sends hir  i can answer for mrs stranges highlanders conduct as it will wholly depend upon me to promote or discourage this branch of trade  but i cant be answerable for other branches of our trade as my knowledge in them depends upon others  i will drop this subject till meeting and if then all my burdens are dischargd and done otherwise for according to my former friends intentions and if satisfactory nothing will be neglected in the power of dr grand papa  your oblidged affte humble servant  alexr pickle  11 aprile 1754  ps  i cant conclude without declaring once for all that i shant walk but in the old course that is not to act now with any other but mr kenady the duke of newcastle and yourself the moment any other comes in play i drop all business but nothing essential can be done without going to venice lord marshal  to mr tamas jones at mr chelburns a chymist in scherwood street golden square london   to exaggerate his own importance pickle gave here a glowing account of the princes prospects  these were really of the most gloomy character  a letter forwarded by dormer march 18 had proved that he was tracked down in liege by the english government  he tried lorraine but found no refuge and was in paris on april 14 when he wrote to the earl marischal  he thought of settling in orleans and asked for advice  but goring now broke with him for ever on the strength apparently of a verbal dismissal sent in anger by charles who believed or affected to believe that goring was responsible for the discovery of his retreat  goring wrote in these terms   stouf to charles  may 5 1754  it is now five years since i had ye honour of waiting on you in a particular manner having made your interest my only study neglecting everything that regarded myself  the people i have negotiated your business with will do me the justice to own what you seem to deny that i have honourably acquitted myself of my charge i do not now or ever did desire to be a burthen on you but i thank god i leave you in a greater affluence of money than i found you which though not out of my own purse has been owing to my industry and trouble not to mention the dangers i have run to effect it all i desire now of you for my services is that you will be so gracious as to discharge me from your service not being able to be of further use to you yourself having put it out of my power what i ernestly beg of you since you let me know that you cannot support me further is to give me at least what i think my services may justly claim viz a gracious demission with which i will retire and try in some obscure corner of ye world to gain the favour of god who will i hope be more just to me than you have been though i despair of ever serving him so well as i have done you  my prayers and wishes shall ever attend you and since i am able to do you no more good i will never do you any harm but remain most faithfully yours  stouf   charles answered angrily   may 10 1754  siri have yrs of ye 5th may directed for his royal highness the prince of wales  signed stouf  i shoud think since the begining was write id est ye superficial superscription the signing might accompani it but brisons sur les bagatelles i must speke french to you since i am affraid you understand no other language for my part i am true english and want of no equivocations or mental resarvations  will you serve me or not will you obey me have you any other interest  say yes or no i shall be yr friend iff you will serve me iff you have anybody preferable to me to serve let me alone have you ye interest of yr contre at hart or a particular one for my part i have but one god and one country and untill i compas ye prosperity of my poor cuntry shall never be at rest or let any stone unturned to compas my ends   goring answered and here his part of the correspondence closes   stouf to the prince  may 16  i recd ye most gracious letter you honoured me with dated ye 10th of this present and must beg your pardon if i do not rightly understand ye contents first it is so different from ye orders you were pleased to send me by mr obrien who by your command told it to mittie 271 who communicated it to me as well as i can remember in these words or to this purpose that you would neither see me or write to me neither would you send me any money to carry me out of this town paris  this very town i am as you well know by a special order from the king of france under severe penalties never to approach nearer than fifty leagues for no other crime than adhering to you when abandoned by every body this very town that was witness to my zeal and fidelity to you at the utmost hazzard of my life is the very place where you abandoned me to my ill fortune without one penny of money to get out of the reach of the lettre de cachet or to subsist here any longer in case i could keep myself hid  you conceive very well sir ye terrible situation i was in had i not found a friend who touched at my misfortunes supplied me for my present necessities and i know no reason for the ill usage i have now twice received from you but that i have served you too well  your friends on the other side of the water at least those who not long since were so can and will when necessary testifye with what zeal and integrity i have negotiated your affairs with them and persons of undoubted worth on this side the water have been witness to my conduct here and when i examine my own breast i have i thank god nothing to reproach myself with nobody has been discovered by any misconduct of mine nobody taken up or even suspected by ye government of having any correspondence with you whether this has been owing to experience or chance i leave you sir to determine here are sir no equivocations or mental reservations i have i may justly say the reputation of a man of honour which i will carry with me to ye grave  in spite of malice and detraction no good man ever did nor do i believe ever will tax me with having done an ill thing and what bad men and women say of me is quite indifferent 273  you say sir you will be my friend if i will serve you and obey you  i have sir served and obeyed you in everything that was just at the hazard very often of my life and to the intire destruction of my health must i then sir begin again to try to gain your favour  i am affraid sir what five years service has not done five hundred years will not attain to  i have twice sir been turned off like a common footman with most opprobrious language without money or cloaths  as i am a bad courtier and cant help speaking truth i am very sure it would not be long before i experienced a third time your friendship for me if i was unadvized enough to make the tryall  no sir princes are never friends it would be too much to expect it but i did believe till now that they had humanity enough to reward good services and when a man had served to the utmost of his power not to try to cast dishonour on him to save the charges of giving him a recompense  secure in my innocence and content with a small fortune having no ambition nor indeed ever had any but of seeing my prince great and good i with your leave sir small retire and spend the rest of my life in serving god and wishing you all prosperity since i unfortuneately cannot be for the future of any use to you  stouf   charles now invited the lord marischal to communicate with him through a fresh channel as goring was for ever alienated  but the earl replied in a tone of severe censure  he defended goring  he rebuked charles for not attending to english remonstrances about miss walkinshaw and accused him of threatening to publish the names of his english adherents  charles answered whoever told you i gave such a message to ed as you mention has told you a damned lie god forgive them  i would not do the least hurt to my greatest enemy were he in my power much less to any one that professes to be mine he had already said my heart is broke enough without that you should finish it 274  this was practically the end of the jacobite party  goring went to berlin and presently died in prussian service  the scottish adherents in the following year made a formal remonstrance in writing but the end had come  pickle may 11 reported the quarrel with lord marischal to his employers  lord albemarle may 29 mentioned his hopes of catching charles by aid of his tailor  this failed but charles was so hard driven that he communicated to walsh his intention to retreat over the spanish frontier  after various wanderings he settled with miss walkinshaw in basle where he gave himself out for am english physician in search of health  there are some curious notes by charles dated november 26 1754 among them is this   cambel  his plot  ye poison and my forbiding instantly by cameron   had mr campbell selected by goring as a model of probity proposed to poison the elector  not once only or twice perhaps had the prince refused to sanction schemes of assassination  we need

was born on the princes birthnight waned and paled the sun of pickles fortunes climbed the zenith he came into his estates by old glengarrys death in september 1754 while deprived of the contributions of the cocoa tree club charles fell back on his last resource the poor remains of the loch arkaig treasure  on september 4 1754 being in great straits he summoned cluny to paris bidding him bring over all the effects whatsoever that i left in your hands also whatever money you can come at  clunys history was curious  the culloden papers prove that when charles landed in moidart cluny had recently taken the oaths to the hanoverian government  he corresponded with the lord president duncan forbes of culloden and was as loyal to george ii as possible  but on august 29 1745 lady cluny informed culloden that her lord had been captured by the princes men  a month later however cluny had not yet parted with his commission in a highland regiment 277a  hopes were still entertained of his deserting the prince for if cluny could have an independent company to guard us from thieves its what i know he desires above all things 277b cluny however continued faithful to the jacobite party  like lord george murray he was a whig in august a partisan of the stuarts in september  they had these gentlemen a short way with oaths thus expressed by one of their own poets      let not the abjuration    impose upon our nation restrict our hands whilst he commands    through false imagination    for oaths which are imposed    can never be supposed to bind a man say what they can    while justice is opposed   acting on these principles cluny joined in the march to derby and was distinguished in the fight at clifton  after culloden he stayed in scotland by charless desire dwelling in his famous cage on ben alder so well described by mr stevenson in kidnapped  the loyalty of his clan was beyond praise  a gentleman of clan vourich whose grandfather fought at culloden gives me the following anecdote  the soldiers were one day hard on clunys tracks and they seized a clansman whom they compelled to act as guide  he pretended an innocence bordering on idiotcy and affected to be specially pleased with the drum a thing of which he could not even conceive the use to humour him they slung the drum over his shoulders  presently he thumped it violently  cluny heard the warning and escaped while the innocence of the crafty gillie was so well feigned that he was not even punished  cluny came over to france in the autumn of 1754 with what amount of treasure he could collect  in later days a very poor exile he gave a most eloquent tribute to charless merits  in deliberations he found him ready and his opinions generally best in their execution firm and in secrecy impenetrable his humanity and consideration showd itself in strong light even to his enemies    in application and fatigues none could exceed him 278  while charles retired in 1755 with miss walkinshaw to basle where he passed for an english physician in search of health pickle was not idle  he had sent in a sheet of notes in april 1754  colonel buck was lately in england he brought pickle a fine gold stuffbox from the young pretender which pickle showed me that is to the official who received his statement  in later years the family of glengarry may have been innocently proud of the princes gift pickle added that there could be no rising in scotland without the macdonnells  he is sure that he shall have the first notice of anything of the kind and he is sure that the young pretender would attempt nothing without him  at the french court pickle only knew the financier paris montmartell and dargenson not the bete but his brother through dargensons mistress madame de pierrecourt pickle wishes to be admitted to an audience and so do i writes an english official as he grows troublesome and i dont care to have any correspondence with him or any other northern    to this report is appended an appeal of pickles  he asks for a regular annuity of 500l being out of pocket by his chants highland for jaunts  pickle never got the money so ungrateful are governments  on may 11 pickle congratulated his employers on having made charles remove his quarters  he adds that charles and lord marischal have quarrelled  about this time after henry pelhams death in march 1754 pickle favoured his employers with a copy of an english memorial to charles  it was purely political the prince was advised to purchase seats in parliament for his friends  but in may charles had neither friends nor money and he never cared for the constitutional measures recommended  on september 1 1754 old glengarry died and pickle accompanied by a court trusty went north to look after his private affairs for he was now chief of the macdonnells 280a  he wrote from edinburgh on september 14  pickle wants money as usual and brags as usual he tells us that spain had recently supplied charles with money  the young lochgarry of whom he speaks is lochgarrys son who took service with england  the old lochgarry threw his dirk after the youth adding a curse on lochgarry house as long as it sheltered a servant of the hanoverian usurper  family legend avers that the house was henceforth haunted by a rapping and knocking ghost which made the place untenable 280b  part of pickles letter follows   add 32736  edinburgh  september 14 1754  dr siri have heard fully from lochgary who acquaints me that the young pretenders affairs take a very good turn and that he has lately sent two expresses to lochgary earnestly intreating a meeting with pickle and upon lochgarys acquainting him of the great distance pickle was off he commanded lochgary to a rendezvous and he set out to meet me the 4th instant and is actually now with me i shall very soon have a particular account of the present plan of operation  i have now the ball at my foot and may give it what tune i please as i am to be allowed largely if i fairly enter in co partnership  the french king is in a very peaceable humour but very ready to take fire if the jacobites renew their address which the young pretender assures him of and he will the readier bestirr himself as the english jacobites hourly torment him  troops scotch and irish are daily offered to be smuggled over but i have positively yet refused to admit any  the king of spain has lately promised to add greatly to the young pretenders patrimony and english contributors are not wanting on their parts 281  i suspect that my letters of late to my friends abroad are stopt pray enquire for i think it very unfair dealings  i am in a few weeks to go north to put some order to my affairs  i should have been put to the greatest inconveniency if 21 had not lent his friendly assistance but as i have been greatly out of pocket by the jants i took for mr pelham i shant be in condition to continue trade if i am not soon enabled to pay off the debts then contracted  i have said on former occasions so much upon this head to no effect that i must now be more explicit and i beg your friendly assistance in properly representing it to the duke of newcastle  if he thinks that my services of which i have given convincing proofs will answer to his advancing directly eight hundred pounds which is the least that can clear the debts of my former jants and fix me to the certain payment yearly of five hundred at two several terms he may command anything in my power upon all occasions  i am sorry to be forced to this explanation in which i always expected to be prevented  i am so far from thinking this extravagant that i am perswaded it will save them as many thousands by discarding that swarm of videts which never was in the least trusted  if the duke of newcastles constituent was acquainted with this i daresay he would esteem the demand reasonable considering what he throws away upon others of no interest or power on either side     ps  pray let me not be denied the arms i wanted and i hope in case of accidents youll take care of young lochgary   now comes a letter of the court trusty who accompanied pickle to scotland a spy upon a spy  the trustys real name was bruce and what with pickles pride and general blands distrust he was in a very unpleasant quandary   add 32737  october 10 1754  dr siri have only to acquaint you since my last that by my keeping company with pickle the general has upon several occasions expressed himself very oddly of me all which might have been prevented by a hint to him  you must perceive what a pleasant pickle i am in it is really hard that i should suffer for doing my duty pickle has promised to write to you this night if he neglects it i cannot help it  i have done what i judged right by him  i have all the reason in the world to think he will be advised by me but he now finds his situation altered and as such must be managed accordingly you know him well all therefore i shall say is that he is naturally proud and his fathers death makes him no less so  i wrot you long ago for advice whether i should go north with him or not to which you made me no return  this day he told me that he leaves this on monday and insisted for my following him  i did not positively promise waiting to see if you write me next post which if you dont i will follow him which i hope youll approve of as i will be the more able to judge of his affairs  i shall not remain long with him after which you shall have a faithful report  the general is best judge of the part he has acted tho i could have wished he had acted otherwise for the interest of the common cause but it does not become me to prescribe rules  i wish he had got a hint  i find the army people here are piqud that i should have pickles ear so much for they all push to make up to him thinking to make something of him  i know the governor of fort augustus is wrot to to try his hand upon him when he goes north but he is determined to keep at a distance from them and to keep in the hands he is now in and i am perswaded he can and will prove usefull but there is a particular way of doing it which you know is the way of the generality benorth tay  your own  cromwell 284  edinburgh  october 10 1754   pickle now writes again from edinburgh on october 10 1754  he wants money and as becomes a highland chief takes a high tone  he has been in service as a spy for four yearsthat is since autumn 1750  he asks for 500l a year and for that will do anything honourable  young lochgarry is not well received he wished to enter the english army and pickle is refused a fowlingpiece to shoot his own grouse because he has not qualified or taken the oaths  this of course pickle could not do as he had in his capacity of spy to keep on terms with prince charles  did young lochgarry know pickle to be a traitor  when i waited says pickle of general bland he did not receve me as i expected haughtly refusd the use of a fulsie fusil without i should qualifie  i smiling answerd if that was the case i had then a right without his permission but that he could not take it amiss that i debard all under his comand the pleasure of hunting upon my grounds or of any firing which they cant have without my permission so that i thought favours were reciprocall  oddly enough we have external testimony to the arrogance of pickle now a little highland prince among his own clan  on december 13 1754 the governor of fort augustus colonel trapaud wrote to dundas of arniston the lord advocate   glengarry has behaved among his clan since his fathers death with the utmost arrogance insolence and pride  on his first arrival to this country he went to knoydart and there took the advantage of his poor ignorant tenants to oblige them to give up all their wadsetts and accept of common interest for their money which they all agreed to  on his return to invergarry he called a meeting of all his friends and tennants in glengarry told them what the knoydart people had done threw them a paper and desired they might all voluntarily sign it else he would oblige them by law but most of the principal wadsetters mortgageholders refused on which he ordered them out of his presence     he has declared that no peat out of his estate should come to this fort     his whole behaviour has greatly alienated the affections of his once dearly beloved followers  i shall take all opportunities of improving this happy spirit of rebellion against so great a chieftain which may in time be productive of some public good 285   pickle was not only a traitor but a bully and an oppressor  thus pickle in addition to his other failings was the very worst type of bad landlord according to the governor of fort augustus  we return to the fortunes of the prince  the opening of 1755 found charles still in concealment probably at basle  he could only profess to james his determination never to go astray from honour and duty march 12 1755  james pertinently replied do you rightly understand the extensive sense of honour and duty  war clouds were gathering  france and england were at issue in america africa and india  braddocks disaster occurred he was defeated and slain by an indian ambush  both nations were preparing for strife the occasion seemed good for fishing in troubled waters dargenson notes that it is a fair opportunity to make use of charles  now we scrape acquaintance with a new spy oliver macallester an irish jacobite adventurer 286  macallester after a long prelude tells us that his private affairs brought him to dunkirk in 1755  on returning to london he was apprehended at sheerness an ungrateful caitiff having laid information to the effect that our injured hero had some connection with the ministers of the french court or was upon some dangerous enterprize  he was examined at the secretary of states office lord hollands was released and returned to dunkirk uncompensated for all this disturbance  here he abode on his private business living much in the company of the ranting lord clancarty  lord clare comte de thomond of the house of macnamara was also in dunkirk at the time and attached himself to the engaging macallester whom he invited to paris  our fleet was then unofficially harassing that of france in america  meanwhile france negotiated the secret treaty with austria while frederick joined hands with england  dunkirk began to wear a very warlike aspect in despite of treaties which bound france to keep it dismantled  je savais que nous avions triche avec les anglais says dargenson  the fortifications were being secretly reconstructed  dargenson adds that now is the moment to give an asylum to the wandering prince charles  the duchesse daiguillon a great friend of the prince tells me that some days ago while she was absent from her house at ruel an illdressed stranger came and waited for her till five in the morning  her servants recognised the prince 287  the duchesse daiguillon walpole says letters iv 390 used to wear a miniature of prince charles in a bracelet  on the reverse was a head of our lord  people did not understand the connection so madame de rochefort said the same motto serves for both my kingdom is not of this world  but charles had not been illdressed in these old days  as early as april 23 1755 m ruvigny de cosne from paris wrote to sir thomas robinson to the effect that charless proposals to the french court in case of war with england had been declined  an abbe carraccioli was being employed as a spy on the prince 288  pickle also came into play  we offer a report of his information given in london on april 23 1755  he knew that charles had been at fontainebleau since preparations for war began and describes his false nose and other disguises  charles was acquainted with the marechal de saxe and may have got the notion of the nose from that warrior  here follows pickle as condensed by mr roberts   add 32854  april 24 1755  mr roberts had a meeting last night with the scotch gentleman called pickle  the young pretender he says has an admirable genius for skulking and is provided with so many disguises that it is not so much to be wondered at that he has hitherto escaped unobserved sometimes he wears a long false hose which they call nez a la saxe because marshal saxe used to give such to his spies whom he employed  at other times he blackens his eye brows and beard and wears a black wig by which alteration his most intimate acquaintance could scarce know him  and in these dresses he has mixed often in the companies of english gentlemen travelling thro flanders without being suspected  pickle promises to discover whatever shall come to his knowledge that may be worth knowing he can be most serviceable he says by residing in scotland for no applications can be made to any of the jacobites there from abroad but he must receive early notice of them being now by his fathers death at the head of a great clan of his name but he is ready to cross the sea whenever it should be thought it worth the while to send him  which he himself is not otherwise desirous of doing as he declares that those journies have cost him hitherto double the money that he has received  he hopes to have something given him to make up this deficiency and if he could have a fixed yearly allowance he will do everything that lies in his power to deserve it  he insists upon an inviolable secrecy without which his opportunities of sending useful intelligences will be lost   pickle does not come on the public scene again for a whole year except in the following undated report where he speaks of glengarry himself in the third person  his account of an envoy sent to make proposals to charles like those made to the prince of orange in 1688 is an error  perhaps pickle was not trusted  the envoy from scotland to charles only proposed as we shall see that he should forswear sack and live cleanly and like a gentleman   add 32861  dear siri am hopeful you nor friends will take it ill that i take the freedom to acquaint you that my patience is quite worn out by hankering upon the same subject for these years past and still remaining in suspence without ever coming to a point  i beg leave to assure you that you may do it to othersbut let my inclinations be ever so strong my intentions ever so upright my situation will not allow me to remain longer upon this precarious footing and as i never heard from you in any manner of way i might readily take umbrage at your long silence and from thence naturally conclude it was intended to drop me  but as i am not of a suspicious temper and judge of others candour by my own and that i always have the highest opinion of yours and to convince you of mine i shant hesitate to acquaint you that i would have wrot sooner but that i waited the result of a gentilmans journey how at this present juncture has the eyes of this part of the country fixt upon himi mean glengary into whose confidence i have greatly insinuated myself  this gentilman is returnd home within these few days from a great tour round several parts of the highlands and had concourse of people from several clans to wait of him  but this youll hear from military channels readly before mine and what follows take it as i was informed in the greatest confidence by this gentilman  this country has been twice tampered with since i have been upon this utstation invergarry and i find it was referd to glengary as the clans thought he had a better motion of french policy of which they seem to be greatly diffident  the offers being verbal and the bearer being non of the greatest consequence it was prorogd upon which the greatest anxiety has been since exprest to have glengary tother side at a conference that he in the name of the clans should demand his owne terms  i am for certain informd that a gentilman of distinction from england went over about two months ago with signatures credentials and assurances much of the same nature as that formerly sent to the prince of orange only the number mentiond by this person did not amount above sixty  i know nothing of the persons names but this from good authority i had for certain told me and that they offerd to advance a very considerable sum of mony  it was in consequence of this that proposals were made here  prudence will not admitt of my enlarging further upon this subject as i am at so great a distance i must beg leave to drop it       on may 20 1755 james wrote to the prince  he had heard of an interview between charles and the duc de richelieu and that you had not been much pleased with your conversation with him  james greatly prefers a peaceful restoration but in the event of war would not decline foreign aid  the conduct of charles he complains makes it impossible for him to treat with friendly powers  he is left in the dark and dare not stir for fear of making a false movement 292a  on july 10 1755 ruvigny de cosne is baffled by charless secrecy and is hunting for traces of miss walkinshaw  on july 23 1755 ruvigny de cosne hears that charles has been with cluny in paris  on august 16 he hears of charles at parma  now charles on august 15 was really negotiating with his adherents whose memorial written at his request is in the stuart papers 292b  they assure him that he is eyed in his family  if he continues obstinate it would but too much confirm the impudent and villainous aspersions of mr ds james pawkins which it seems had nearly killed sir charles goring henry gorings brother with real grief  dawkins had represented the prince as entirely abandoned to an irregular debauched life even to excess which brought his health and even his life daily in danger leaving him in some degree devoid of reason obstinate ungrateful unforgiving and revengeful for the very smallest offence  in brief dawkins had described charles as utterly impossibleall thoughts of him must be for ever laid asideand dawkins backed his opinion by citing that of henry goring  the memorialists therefore adjure charles to reform  their candid document is signed cmp obviously cluny macpherson and hp probably sir hugh paterson clementina walkinshaws uncle  now there is no reason for disputing this evidence none for doubting the honesty of mr dawkins in his despairing account of charles  he was young wealthy adventurous a scholar  in the preface to their joint work on palmyra robert woodthe wellknown archaeologist author of a book on homer which drew wolf on to his more famous theoryspeaks of mr dawkins in high terms of praise he gets the name of a good fellow in jacobite correspondence as early as 1748 writing from berne on may 28 1756 arthur villettes quotes the earl marischal then governor of neufchatel for frederick as making strictures like those of dawkins on the prince  at this time the earl was preparing to gain his pardon from george ii and spoke of charles with the utmost horror and detestation  his life since 1744 had been one continued scene of falsehood ingratitude and villainy and his fathers was little better  as regards james this is absurd his letters are those of a heartbroken but kind and honourable parent and prince  villettes then cites the earls account of the mission from scotland august 1755 urging reform on charles through the lips of cluny  the actual envoy from scotland cited here is probably not cluny but his cosignatory hp and he is said to have met charles at basle and to have been utterly disgusted by his reception 293  now the earl had a private pique at charles ever since he refused to sail to scotland with the prince in a herringboat in 1744  he had also been estranged by charless treatment of goring in 1754 moreover he was playing for a pardon  we might conceivably discount the lord marischal and dr kings censures in his anecdotes for the bitterness of renegades is proverbial  but we cannot but listen to dawkins and the loyal henry goring  by 1754 the prince it is not to be denied was impossible  honourable men like the old laird of gask bishop forbes lord nairne and andrew lumisden later his secretary were still true to a prince no longer true to himself  even lumisden he was to drive from him he could keep nobody about him but the unwearied stuart a servant of his own name  the play was played out honour and all was lost  there is unhappily no escape from this conclusion  charles declined to listen to the deputation headed by cluny in august 1755  a secretary must have penned his reply it is well spelled and is grammatical  some unworthy people have had the insolence to attack my character     conscious of my conduct i despise their low malice     i have long desired a churchman at your hands to attend me but my expectations have hitherto been disappointed  soon he returned to the mass as we learn from macallester  he was ill and poor 294  he finally dismissed his servants including a companion of his highland wanderings  he recommends morrison his valet as a good man to shave and coif his father  the poor fellows wandered to rome and were sent back to france with money  here is sir horace manns letter about these honest lads   florence  december 20 1755      my correspondent at rome having given me previous notice of the departure from thence of some livery servants belonging to the pretenders eldest son and that they were to pass through tuscany i found means to set two english men to watch for their arrival who pretending to be their friends insinuated themselves so well into their company as to pass the whole evening with them  they were five in number and all scotch  the names of three were stuart mackdonnel and mackenzy  they were dressed alike in the pretenders livery and said they had been with his son in scotland upon which the people i employed asked where he was  they answered only that they were going to avignon and should soon know and in their merriment drank the health of the boy that is lost and cannot be found upon which one of them answered that he would soon be found another reproved him and made signs to him to hold his tongue  they seemed to be in awe of each other  there was not much to be got out of the highlanders a race of men who can drink and hold their tongues  on january 30 1756 walton from florence reported that charles was to be taken up by louis xv to play un role fort distingue andto marry a daughter of france 296a  on january 31 mann had the latest french couriers word for it that charles was in paris but walton added that james denied this  pickle came to london april 2 1756 but only to dun for money  not the smallest artickle has been performed of what was expected and at first promised  pickle was useless now in scotland and remained unsalaried so ungrateful are kings  the centre of jacobite interest now was france  in the testament politique du marechal duc de belleisle 1762 it is asserted that charles was offered the leadership of the attack on minorca april 1756 and that he declined saying the english will do me justice if they think fit but i will no longer serve as a mere scarecrow epouvantail  in january 1756 however knyphausen writing to frederick from paris discredited the idea that france meant to employ the prince 296b  turn we to mr macallester for more minute indications  macallester was now acting as led captain and henchman to the one eyed lord clancarty who began to rail in good set terms against all and sundry  for his own purposes for just and powerful reasons macallester kept a journal of these libellous remarks obviously for use against clancarty  living at that noblemans table macallester played his favourite part of spy for the mere love of the profession he writes  tuesday january 11 1757when we had drunk hard after supper he broke out saying by god dear mac ill tell you a secret you dont know there is not a greater scoundrel on the face of the earth than that same prince he is in his heart a coward and a poltroon would rather live in a garret with some scotch thieves to drink and smoak than serve me or any of those who have lost our estates for his family and himself     he is so great a scoundrel that he will lie even when drunk  a time when all other mens hearts are most open and will speak the truth or what they think     he damned himself if he did not love an irish drummer better than any of the breed  the prince has no more religion said this pious enthusiast than one of my coachhorses     he asked me if i knew jemmy dawkins  i said i did not  he could give you an account of them said he but lord marischal has given the true character of the prince and certified under his hand to the people of england what a scoundrel he is 297     the prince had the canaille of scotland to assist him thieves robbers and the like      the prince had confided to clancarty the english jacobites desire that he would put away miss walkinshaw  the prince swearing said he would not put away a cat to please such fellows but as lord clancarty never opened his mouth without a curse his evidence is not valuable  on march 8 hearing that lochgarry was in the neighbourhood clancarty called him a thief and a cowstealer and bade the footman lock up the plate  the brave lochgarry however came to dinner as being unaware of his lordships sentiments  enough of the elegant conversation of this oneeyed slovenly irish nobleman whom we later find passing his christmas with prince charles 298  mr macallester now made two new friends the adventurous dumont and a mr lewis  in july 1757 lewis and macallester went to paris and were much with lord clare de thomond  in december lord clancarty came hunting for our spy raging like a madman after macallester much to that heros discomposure for being as silly as he was base he had let out the secret of his clancarty elegant extracts  his lordship in fact accused macallester of showing all his letters to lord clare whom clancarty hated  he then gave macallester the lie and next apologised in fact he behaved like sir francis clavering  before publishing his book macallester tried to blackmail clancarty his lordship is now secretly and fully advertised that this matter is going to the press and indeed it was matter to make the irish peer uncomfortable in france where he had consistently reviled the king  it is probable that macallester was now engaged in the french secret police  he admits that he acted as a mouton or prison spy and gives a dreadful account of the horrors of galbanon where men lay in the dark and dirt for half a lifetime  macallester next proses endlessly on the alleged jesuit connection with damiens attack on lous xv and insists that the jesuits nobody knows why meant to assassinate prince charles  he was in very little danger from jesuits    chapter xiiithe last hope  1759    charles asks louis for moneyidea of employing him in 1757letter from frederickchances in

regiment of macdonaldsspy or colonelsigns his real namealexander macdonnell of glengarrydeath of picklehis services recognised  after the fatal 10th of december 1748 charles had entertained a bitter hatred of france though he was always careful to blame the ministers of louis not the king himself  he even refused a french pension but this was an attitude which he could not maintain  in 1756 july 1 he actually wrote to louis asking for money  monsieur mon frere et cousin he said  with the whole of europe i admire your virtues    and the benefits with which you daily load your subjects    since 1744 when i left rome i have run many risks encountered many perils and endured many vicissitudes of fortune unaided by those from whom i had the right to expect assistance unsuccoured even by my father  in truth such of his subjects as espoused my cause have given me many proofs of zeal and of good will but since open war broke out between france and england i have not the same support  i know not what destiny prepares for me but i shall put it to the touch  for this purpose then he needs money  if i knew a prince more virtuous than you to him i would appeal  whether louis was goodnatured and gave some money for charles to ohagarty and elliot his envoys does not appear 301  in these dispositions charles hoped much from the french project of invading england in 1759  though he never wholly despaired and was soliciting louis xvi even in the dawn of the revolution we may call the invasion of 1759 his last faint chance  hints had been thrown out of employing him in 1757  frederick then wrote from dresden to mitchell the english ambassador at berlin   i want to let you know that yesterday a person of distinguished rank told me that a friend of his at court under promise of the utmost secrecy told him this  the french intend to make a diversion in ireland in spring  they will disembark at cork and at waterford they are negotiating with the young pretender to put himself at the head of the expedition but he will do nothing unless the courts of vienna and st petersburg guarantee the proposals made to him by france 302a   charles in fact was deeply distrustful of all french offers  as we small see he later declined to embark with any expedition for scotland or ireland  he would go with troops destined for london and with no others  the year 1759 was spent in playing the game of intrigue  the french minister the duc de choiseul was or affected to be friendly friendly too were the old marechal de belleisle and the princesse de ligne  louis sent vaguely affectionate messages  in rome james was reconciled and indulged in a gleam of hope  charless agents were elliot alexander murray who i think is usually styled campbell holker goodwin clancarty and mackenzie douglas  this man whose real name was mackenzie had been a jesuit and is said to have acted as a spy in the dutch service he had also been first the secret and then the avowed envoy of louis xv to st petersburg in 17551756  on his second visit he was accompanied by the notorious chevalier deon 302b  as early as january 2 1759 murray i think the letters are unsigned assures charles of the friendship of the french court  the king ellis will lend 30000l  on january 8 murray writes and a funnier letter of veiled meanings never was penned   january 8  i arrived on saturday morning i immediately calld at mr cambels not finding him went to mr mansfield and delivered in the pills you sent him    i met cambel at 10 oclock delivered him his pills and drank a serious bottle of burdeaux    delivered a pill to harrison who with tears of tenderness in his eyes said from the bottom of his heart woud do anything in his power to serve that magnanimous bourton the prince he brought me along to mr budsons who after he had swallowed the pill came and made me a low reverence and desired me to assure bourton of his respect   what the pills were we can only guess but their effects are entertaining  charles at this time was at bouillon the home of his cousin the duc de bouillon and he made the president thibault there the guardian of his child for miss walkinshaw did not carry off her daughter to paris till july 1760 303  murray or campbell kept besieging choiseul belleisle and the prince de soubise with appeals in favour of charles  we have heard how the prince used to treat madame de pompadour burning her billets unanswered  now his mood was altered  his agent writes   february 19  campbell i send copy of letter to prince de soubise  i am convinced you will not delay in writting to madame la marquise de pompadour and thereby show her that your politeness and gallantry are not enferiour to your other superior qualifications notwithstanding that you have lived for these ten years past in a manner shut up from the world  it will be absolutely necessary that you inclosed it to the p of s soubise who has given up the command of ye army in germany in order to conduct the expedition against england   charles answered in this submissive fashion   prince to murray  february 24  rien ne me flatterai plus que dassurer de bouche mad l m de p de lestime et de la consideration la plus parfaitte  vous scavez mes sentiments pour elle je les ay aussy explique a le p de soubise et je ne dessirres rien tant que trouver les occasions de lui la prouver   he also tried to justify his past conduct to mr orry his father especially as regarded lord george murray  he declared that in the futile attempt at a night surprise at nairn before culloden clanranalds regiment did encounter cumberlands sentries and found that the attempt was feasible had lord george not retreated contrary to his orders  the obstinate selfwill of charles displayed itself in thwarting all arrangements attempted by the french for employing him in their projected invasion of england  they expected a diversion to be made in their favour by his adherents but he persistently refused to be landed either in scotland or ireland  he was partly justified  the french as dargenson admits had no idea even in 1745 of making him king of the three kingdoms  to establish him at holyrood or in dublin and so to create and perpetuate disunion in great britain was their policy as far as they had a policy  we may think that charles was in no position to refuse any assistance but his reply to cardinal tencin point de partage tout ou rien was at least patriotic  the dutch correspondent of the scots magazine writing on may 22 1759 said that a french expedition for scotland was ready and that charles was to sail with it but the prince would not lend himself to this scheme  all through the summer he had his agents elliot holker and clancarty at dunkirk rouen and boulogne  they reported on the french preparations but writes charles on july 22 i am not in their secret  he corresponded with the duc de choiseul and the marechal de belleisle but they confined themselves to general assurances of friendship  it is impossible for the duc de choiseul to tell you the kings secret as you would not tell him yours wrote an anonymous correspondent apparently alexander murray  charles prepared manifestoes for the press and was urged from england to include certain arranged words in them to be taken as a sign that he was actually landed  these words of course were to be kept a dead secret  the english jacobites had no intention of appearing in arms to aid a french invading force if charles was not in the midst of it  alexander murray wrote suggestions for charless declaration  he was to be very strong on the habeas corpus act and murray ruefully recalled his own long imprisonment by order of the house of commons  he wished also to repudiate the national debt but charles must not propose this  a free parliament must take the burden of the deed  the landed interest cant be made easy by any other method than by paying that prodigious load by a sponge  in a dutch caricature of perkins triumph 1745 charles is represented driving in a coach over the bodies of holders of consols  it is difficult now to believe that repudiation was the chief aim of the honest squires who toasted the king over the water  in august murray reported that choiseul said nothing should be done except with and for the prince  the manuscript letterbook of andrew lumisden jamess secretary since edgars death and brotherinlaw of sir robert strange the engraver illustrates charless intentions 306  on august 12 1759 lumisden is in correspondence with murray  the prince to lumisdens great delight wants his company  already in 1759 lumisden had been on secret expeditions to paris germany austria and venice  macallester informs us that sullivan who had been in scotland with charles in 1745 received a command in the french army mustering at brest  he also tells a long dull story of charless incognito in paris at this time  how he lived over a butchers shop in the rue de la boucherie seldom went out except at night and was recognised at mass by a woman who had attended miss walkinshaws daughter  finally the prince went to brest in disguise damning the marshals old boots the boots of the marechal de belleisle which it seems were always stuffed full of projects  barbier supposes in his memoires that charles was to go with thurot who was to attack scotland while conflans invaded england  but charles would not hear of leaving with thurot and his tiny squadron which committed some petty larcenies on the coast of the west highlands  the prince was now warned against clancarty of the one eye who was bragging and lying and showing his letters in the taverns of dunkirk  the old feud of scotch and irish jacobites went merrily on macallester called murray a cardsharper and was himself lodged in prison on a lettre de cachet  murray wrote of the irish their bulls and stupidity one can forgive but the villainy and falsity of their hearts is unpardonable  scotch and irish bickerings a great cause of the ruin in 1745 broke out again on the slightest gleam of hope  holker sent a curious account of the boats for embarking horses on the expedition  these he illustrated by a diagram on the back of the five of diamonds a movable slip cut in the card gave an idea of the mechanism  the king of france on august 27 sent friendly messages by belleisle but could not be explicit  elliot reported that clancarty would stick at no lyes to bring about his schemes  on september 5 came an anonymous warning against murray who is not trusted by the french ministry  on september 28 laurence oliphant of gask sent verses in praise of charles written by madame de montagu the lady who lent him 1000l years before  on october 8 murray still reports the attachment of choiseul and belleisle  he adds that neither his brother lord elibank nor any other scotch jacobite will stir if an invasion of scotland is undertaken without a landing in england  on october 21 he declares that conflans has orders to attack the english fleet lying off havre  the sailing of thurot is also announced  i cannot comprehend the object of so small an embarkation  as late as october 26 charles was still left in the dark as to the intentions of france  then obviously while charles was waiting for orders came the fatal news in a hurried note  conflans beaten his ship the soleil royal and the heros stranded at croisic  seven ships are come in  ten are flying at sea  brave admiral hawke had routed conflans in quiberon bay  afflavit deus and scattered the fleet of france with the last hope of charles  yet hope never dies in the hearts of exiles as is proved by the following curious letter from murray   it is impossible to be certain as to the sincerity of choiseul the split in the jacobite party is only too clearly indicated   from campbell probably murray  december 10  i delivered your letter this evening and had a long conference with both the ministers  mr choiseul assured me upon his word of honour that your rh should be informd in time before the departure of mr de gouillon 309a so that you might go with that embarquement if you thought proper upon which i interrupted him and told him if they were destined for the kingdom of ireland that it would be to no manner of purpose for i was certain you would not go and that you had at all times expressly ordered me to tell them so he continued his conversation and said you should be equally informed when the p of s 309b embarked  i answered as to every project for england that you would not ballance one moment but that you would not nor could not in honour enter into any other project but that of going to london and if once master of that city both ireland and scotland would fall of course as that town was the fountain of all the riches he then hinted that guillions embarkment was not for ireland and talked of scotland  i then told him of the message you had received from my brother elibank and the other leading men of the party in that country that not a man of consequence would stir unless the debarkment was made at the same time in england and that every person who pretended the contrary ought to be regarded as the enemy of your rh as well as of france  he then told me that in case you did not choose to go with mr de guillion that it would be necessary to send one with a declaration in your name i told him i could make no answers to that proposition as i had never heard you talk of declarations of any sort before you was landed in england and that you had settled all that matter with your friends in england and scotland  he assured me that the intentions of the king and his ministers were unalterable as to their fixed resolution to serve you but that they met with difficulties in regard to the transports and flatbottomed boats which retarded the affair longer than they imagined and that though they had already spent twenty four million every thing was not yet ready  this is as near as i can recollect the purport of his conversation excepting desiring to see him before my return to your rh  i afterwards saw your good friend the marcel belleisle who told me that every thing that depended upon his department was ready and said pretty near what mr de choiseul had told concerning the delays of the transports seventeen of which they yet wanted  he assured me it was the thing on earth he desired the most to see you established upon the throne of your ancestors and that he would with plesure give you his left arm rather than it should not succeed  i am perfectly convinced of the sincere intention of the king and ministers and that nothing but the interposition of heaven can prevent your success  i have not yet seen the p of s soubise but shall tomorrow your cousin bethune is greatly attached to you and has done you great justice in destroying the villanous lyes and aspersions of some of your false subjects clancarty who by a pretended zeal for you got access to the ministers and have had the impudence to present memorials as absurd and ridiculous as their great quality and immense fortunes they have lost by being attached to your family i flatter myself you will very soon be convinced of all their infamous low schemes   meanwhile in all probability pickle was waiting to see how matters would fall out  if conflans beat hawke and if thurot landed in the western highlands then pickle would have rallied to the old flag tandem triumphans and welcomed gloriously his royal highness the prince of wales  then the despised warrant of a peerage would have come forth and lord glengarry i conceive would have hurried to seize the duke of newcastles papers many of which were of extreme personal interest to himself  but matters chanced otherwise so pickle wrote his last extant letter to the english government   add 32902  my lord the duke of newcastleas i am confident your grace will be at a lose to find out your present corespondent it will i believe suffice to recall to mind pickle how who some time ago had a conference with the young gentilman whom honest old vaughan brought once to clermont to waite of yr grace  i find he still retains the same ardent inclination to serve his king and country yet at same time he bitterly complains that he has been neglected and nothing done for him of what was promisd him in the strongest terms and which he believes had been strickly performd had your most worthy brother his great friend and patron survivd till now he desires me aquent your grace that upon a late criticall juncture november 1759 he was prepairing to take post for london to lay affaires of the greatest moment before his majesty but the suden blow given the enemy by admiral hack hawke keept him back for that time  but now that he finds that they are still projecting to execute their first frustrated schem 312 there present plan of operation differing in nothing from the first but in what regards north britain  he has certain information of this by verbal expresses writting beeing absolutely dischargd for fear of discovery  he desires me aquent your grace of this that you may lay the whole before his majesty  if his majestys enemys should once more faile in their favourite scheme of envasion this young gentilman glengarry intends to make offer of raising a regiment of as good men as ever was levied in north britain if he gets the rank of full colonell the nomenation of his officers and suitable levie mony  he can be of infinite service in either capacity mentioned in this letter spy or colonel that his majesty is graciously pleasd to employ him  he begs that this may not be delayd to be laid before the king as things may soon turn out very serious  he makes a point with your grace that this be communicated to no mortall but his majesty and he is willing to forfite all pretensions to the royall favour if his services at this criticall juncture does not meritt his majestys aprobation  if your grace calls upon him at this time as he was out of pocket upon further chants it will be necessary to remit him a bill payable at sight for whatever little sum is judgd proper for the present untill he gives proof of his attachment to the best of sovereigns and of his reale zeale for the service of his king and country against a most treacherous and perfidious enemy  i have now done my duty my lord reffering the whole manadgement to your grace and i beg youl pardon the freedom i have taken as i have the honour to remain at all times  my lord your graces most obedient and most oblidged humble servt  pickle  february 19 1760  mack make mention of pickle  his majesty will remember mr pelham did upon former affairs of great consequence  directionto alexander mackdonell of glengary by foraugustus fort augustus   pickle as he remarks in one of his artless letters is not of a suspicious temper but judges of others candour by his own  he now carries this honourable freedom so far as to give his own noble name and address  habemus confitentem reum  persons more suspicious and less candid will believe that pickle in november 1759 was standing to win on both colours  his readiness to sell a regiment of macdonnells to fight for king george is very worthy of a highland chief of pickles kind  on december 23 1761 alastair macdonnell of glengarry died and pickle died with him  he had practically ceased to be useful the world was anticipating burnss advice   adore the rising sun and leave a man undone    to his fate   we have unmasked a character of a kind never popular  yet in the government of the world pickle served england well  but for him there might have been another highland rising and more fire and bloodshed  but for him the royal family might have perished in a nocturnal brawl  only one man archibald cameron died through pickles treasons  the prince with whom he drank and whom he betrayed had become hopeless and worthless  the world knows little of its greatest benefactors and pickle did good by stealth  now his shade may or may not blush to find it fame and to be placed above murray of broughton beside menteith and assynt

natural close  of charles we need say little more  macallester represents him as hanging about the coasts of england in 17611762 looking out for favourable landingplaces or sending his valet stuart to scour paris in search of miss walkinshaw  that luckless lady fled from charles at bouillon to paris in july 1760 with her daughter and found refuge in a convent  as lord elcho reports her conversation charles was wont to beat her cruelly  for general circulation she averred that she and james merely wished her daughter to be properly educated 316  charles in fact picked a new quarrel with france on the score of his daughter  louis refused to make miss walkinshaw now styled countess of albertroff resign her child to charless keeping  he was very fond of children and macallester who hated him declares that when hiding in the highlands he would amuse himself by playing with the baby of a shepherds wife  none the less his habits made him no proper guardian of his own little girl 317  in 1762 young oliphant of gask who visited the prince at bouillon reports that he will have nothing to do with france till his daughter is restored to him  he held moodily aloof and then the peace came  lumisden complains that burton the prince is intractable  he sulked at bouillon where he hunted in the forests  here is a sad and tender admonition from murray whose remonstrances were more softly conveyed than those of goring   thursday  when i have the honour of being with you i am miserable upon seeing you take so little care of a health which is so precious to every honest man but more so to me in particular because i know you and therefore cant help loving honouring and esteeming you but alass what service can my zeal and attachment be to my dear master unless he lays down a plan and system and follows it such as his subjects and all mankind will and must approve of   young gask repeats the same melancholy tale  charles was hopeless for some inscrutable reason he was true to stafford who had aided his secret flight from rome in 1744 and to sheridan supporting them at avignon  old mr misfortunate king james died at rome it 1766 he never saw his dearest carluccio after the prince stole out of the city full of hope in 1744    a fairy prince with happy eyes and lighterfooted than the fox   james expired without the least convulsion or agony says lumisden but with his usual mild serenity in his countenance     he seemed rather to be asleep than dead  a proscribed exile from his cradle james was true to faith and honour  what other defeated and fugitive adventurer ever sent money to the hostile general for the peasants who had suffered from the necessities of war  on january 23 1766 lumisden met charles on his way to rome  his legs and feet were considerably swelled by the fatigue of the journey  in other respects he enjoys perfect health and charms every one who approaches him  the prince was miraculously preserved when his coach was overturned on a precipice near bologna some jewels and family relics had not been returned by cluny and there were difficulties about sending a messenger for them  these occupy much of lumisdens correspondence  charles met only with mortifications at rome  the pope dared not treat him on a royal footing  in april 1766 our old friend lochgarry took service with portugal  charles sent congratulations and doubts not your son will be ready to draw the sword in his just cause  the sword remained undrawn  charles had now but an income of 47000 livres he amused himself as he might with shooting and playing the french horn  he never forgave miss walkinshaw whom his brother the cardinal maintained poorly enough  lumisden writes to the lady july 14 1766  no one knows the kings temper better than you do  he has never so far as i can discover mentioned your name  nor do i believe that he either knows where you are nor how you are maintained  his passion must still greatly cool before any application can be made to him in your behalf  a report was circulated that charles was secretly married to miss walkinshaw  on february 16 1767 lumisden wrote to waters on the dismal consequences of such a rumour and by the duke of yorks desire bade waters obtain a denial from the lady  on march 11 the duke received miss walkinshaws formal affidavit that no marriage existed  it has entirely relieved him from the uneasiness the villainous report naturally gave him  on january 5 1768 lumisden had to tell miss walkinshaw that his royal highness insists you shall always remain in a monastery  lumisden was always courteous to miss walkinshaw  of her daughter he writes  may she ever possess in the highest degree those elegant charms of body and mind which you so justly and assiduously cultivate     did the king know that i had wrote to you he would never pardon me  on december 20 1768 charles had broken with lumisden and the rest of his suite  our behaviour towards him was that of faithful subjects and servants jealous at all times to preserve his honour and reputation  they had in brief declined to accompany charles in his carriage when his condition demanded seclusion  lumisden writes december 8 1767 his royal highness the duke of york thanked us for our behaviour in the strongest terms  we need follow no further the story of a consummated degradation charles threw off one by one on grounds of baseless suspicion lord george murray kelly to please lord marischal goring and now drove from him his most attached servants  he never suspected glengarry  but neither time nor despair nor charless own fallen self could kill the loyalty of scotland  bishop forbes far away heard of his crowning folly andblamed lumisden and his companion hay of restalrig  when charles on good friday 1772

miss walkinshaws daughter he had no child  the time has not come to tell the whole strange tale of john stolberg sobieski stuart and charles edward stuart if indeed that tale can ever be told 321  nor does space permit an investigation of charless married life of his wifes elopement with alfieri and of the last comparatively peaceful years in the society of a daughter who soon followed him to the tomb  the stories about that daughters marriage to a swedish baron roehenstart and about their son merit no attention  in the french foreign office archives is a wild plan for marrying the lady charlotte stuart to a stuartany stuart and raising their unborn sons standard in the american colonies  that an offer was made from america to charles himself in 1778 was stated by scott to washington irving on the authority of a document in the stuart papers at windsor  that paper could not be found for lord stanhope nor have i succeeded in finding it  the latest scottish honour done to the king was burnss birthday ode of 1787 and his song for the bonny lass o albany   this lovely maids of royal blood    that ruled albions kingdoms three but oh alas for her bonnie face    they hae wrangd the

was visited by horace walpole in 1765  he found her in charitable apartments in the luxembourg and he tripped over cats and stools and other things in the twilight of a bedroom hung with pictures of saints and sobieskis  at last and very late the hour of her conversion had been granted by st francois xavier to the prayers of her husband  we think of the baroness bernstein in her latest days as we

mohr macgregor though pickle began to communicate with the english government while james was a prisoner in edinburgh castle and continued to do so for years after jamess death it is plain that he is in error and that the transactions need a fresh examination  mr murray rose in the article cited does not indicate the provenance of the documents which he publishes  when used in this work they are copied from the originals in the british museum among the papers of the pelham administration  the transcripts have been for several years in my hands but i desire to acknowledge mr murray roses
