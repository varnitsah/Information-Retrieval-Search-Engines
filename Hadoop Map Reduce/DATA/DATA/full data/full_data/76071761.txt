76071761	heinemanns colonial library of popular fiction        the white peacock     by d h lawrence   a book of real distinction both of style and thought many of the descriptive passages have an almost lyrical charm and the characterisation is generally speaking deft and lifelike the white peacock is a book not only worth reading but worth reckoning with for we are inclined to think the

  i stood watching the shadowy fish slide through the gloom of the millpond they were grey descendants of the silvery things that had darted away from the monks in the young days when the valley was lusty the whole place was gathered in the musing of old age the thickpiled trees on the far shore were too dark and sober to dally with the sun the weeds stood crowded and motionless not even a little wind flickered the willows of the islets the water lay softly intensely still only the thin stream falling through the millrace murmured to itself of the tumult of life which had once quickened the valley  i was almost startled into the water from my perch on the alder roots by a voice saying  well what is there to look at my friend was a young farmer stoutly built brown eyed with a naturally fair skin burned dark and freckled in patches he laughed seeing me start and looked down at me with lazy curiosity  i was thinking the place seemed old brooding over its past  he looked at me with a lazy indulgent smile and lay down on his back on the bank saying its all right for a doss—here  your life is nothing else but a doss i shall laugh when somebody jerks you awake i replied  he smiled comfortably and put his hands over his eyes because of the light  why shall you laugh he drawled  because youll be amusing said i  we were silent for a long time when he rolled over and began to poke with his finger in the bank  i thought he said in his leisurely fashion there was some cause for all this buzzing  i looked and saw that he had poked out an old papery nest of those pretty field bees which seem to have dipped their tails into bright amber dust some agitated insects ran round the cluster of eggs most of which were empty now the crowns gone a few young bees staggered about in uncertain flight before they could gather power to wing away in a strong course he watched the little ones that ran in and out among the shadows of the grass hither and thither in consternation  come here—come here he said imprisoning one poor little bee under a grass stalk while with another stalk he loosened the folded blue wings  dont tease the little beggar i said  it doesnt hurt him—i wanted to see if it was because he couldnt spread his wings that he couldnt fly there he goes—no he doesnt lets try another  leave them alone said i let them run in the sun theyre only just out of the shells dont torment them into flight  he persisted however and broke the wing of the next  oh dear—pity said he and he crushed the little thing between his fingers then he examined the eggs and pulled out some silk from round the dead larva and investigated it all in a desultory manner asking of me all i knew about the insects when he had finished he flung the clustered eggs into the water and rose pulling out his watch from the depth of his breeches pocket  i thought it was about dinnertime said he smiling at me i always know when its about twelve are you coming in  im coming down at any rate said i as we passed along the pond bank and over the plankbridge that crossed the brow of the falling sluice the bankside where the grey orchard twisted its trees was a steep declivity long and sharp dropping down to the garden  the stones of the large house were burdened with ivy and honeysuckle and the great lilacbush that had once guarded the porch now almost blocked the doorway we passed out of the front garden into the farmyard and walked along the brick path to the back door  shut the gate will you he said to me over his shoulder as he passed on first  we went through the large scullery into the kitchen the servantgirl was just hurriedly snatching the tablecloth out of the table drawer and his mother a quaint little woman with big brown eyes was hovering round the wide fireplace with a fork  dinner not ready said he with a shade of resentment  no george replied his mother apologetically it isnt the fire wouldnt burn a bit you shall have it in a few minutes though  he dropped on the sofa and began to read a novel i wanted to go but his mother insisted on my staying  dont go she pleaded emily will be so glad if you stay—and father will im sure sit down now  i sat down on a rush chair by the long window that looked out into the yard as he was reading and as it took all his mothers powers to watch the potatoes boil and the meat roast i was left to my thoughts george indifferent to all claims continued to read it was very annoying to watch him pulling his brown moustache and reading indolently while the dog rubbed against his leggings and against the knee of his old ridingbreeches he would not even be at the trouble to play with trips ears he was so content with his novel and his moustache round and round twirled his thick fingers and the muscles of his bare arm moved slightly under the redbrown skin the little square window above him filtered a green light from the foliage of the great horsechestnut outside and the glimmer fell on his dark hair and trembled across the plates which annie was reaching down from the rack and across the face of the tall clock the kitchen was very big the table looked lonely and the chairs mourned darkly for the lost companionship of the sofa the chimney was a black cavern away at the back and the inglenook seats shut in another little compartment ruddy with firelight where the mother hovered it was rather a desolate kitchen such a bare expanse of uneven grey flagstones such faraway dark corners and sober furniture the only gay things were the chintz coverings of the sofa and the armchair cushions bright red in the bare sombre room some might smile at the old clock adorned as it was with remarkable and vivid poultry in me it only provoked wonder and contemplation  in a little while we heard the scraping of heavy boots outside and the father entered he was a big burly farmer with his halfbald head sprinkled with crisp little curls  hullo cyril he said cheerfully youve not forsaken us then and turning to his son  have you many more rows in the coppice close  finished replied george continuing to read  thats all right—youve got on with em the rabbits has bitten them turnips down mother  i expect so replied his wife whose soul was in the saucepans at last she deemed the potatoes cooked and went out with the steaming pan  the dinner was set on the table and the father began to carve george looked over his book to survey the fare then read until his plate was handed him the maid sat at her little table near the window and we began the meal there came the treading of four feet along the brick path and a little girl entered followed by her grownup sister the childs long brown hair was tossed wildly back beneath her sailor hat she flung aside this article of her attire and sat down to dinner talking endlessly to her mother the elder sister a girl of about twentyone gave me a smile and a bright look from her brown eyes and went to wash her hands then she came and sat down and looked disconsolately at the underdone beef on her plate  i do hate this raw meat she said  good for you replied her brother who was eating industriously give you some muscle to wallop the nippers  she pushed it aside and began to eat the vegetables her brother recharged his plate and continued to eat  well our george i do think you might pass a body that gravy said mollie the younger sister in injured tones  certainly he replied wont you have the joint as well  no retorted the young lady of twelve i dont expect youve done with it yet  clever he exclaimed across a mouthful  do you think so said the elder sister emily sarcastically  yes he replied complacently youve made her as sharp as yourself i see since youve had her in standard six ill try a potato mother if you can find one thats done  well george they seem mixed im sure that was done that i tried there—they are mixed—look at this one its soft enough im sure they were boiling long enough  dont explain and apologise to him said emily irritably  perhaps the kids were too much for her this morning he said calmly to nobody in particular  no chimed in mollie she knocked a lad across his nose and made it bleed  little wretch said emily swallowing with difficulty im glad i did some of my lads belong to—to——  to the devil suggested george but she would not accept it from him  her father sat laughing her mother with distress in her eyes looked at her daughter who hung her head and made patterns on the tablecloth with her finger  are they worse than the last lot asked the mother softly fearfully  no—nothing extra was the curt answer  she merely felt like bashing em said george calling as he looked at the sugar bowl and at his pudding  fetch some more sugar annie  the maid rose from her little table in the corner and the mother also hurried to the cupboard emily trifled with her dinner and said bitterly to him  i only wish you had a taste of teaching it would cure your selfsatisfaction  pf he replied contemptuously i could easily bleed the noses of a handful of kids  you wouldnt sit there bleating like a fatted calf she continued  this speech so tickled mollie that she went off into a burst of laughter much to the terror of her mother who stood up in trembling apprehension lest she should choke  you made a joke emily he said looking at his younger sisters contortions  emily was too impatient to speak to him further and left the table soon the two men went back to the fallow to the turnips and i walked along the path with the girls as they were going to school  he irritates me in everything he does and says burst out emily with much heat  hes a pig sometimes said i  he is she insisted he irritates me past bearing with his grand knowall way and his heavy smartness—i cant beat it and the way mother humbles herself to him——  it makes you wild said i  wild she echoed her voice vibrating with nervous passion we walked on in silence till she asked  have you brought me those verses of yours  no—im so sorry—ive forgotten them again as a matter of fact ive sent them away  but you promised me  you know what my promises are im as irresponsible as a puff of wind  she frowned with impatience and her disappointment was greater than necessary when i left her at the corner of the lane i felt a sting of her deep reproach in my mind i always felt the reproach when she had gone  i ran over the little bright brook that came from the weedy bottom pond the steppingstones were white in the sun and the water slid sleepily among them one or two butterflies indistinguishable against the blue sky trifled from flower to flower and led me up the hill across the field where the hot sunshine stood as in a bowl and i was entering the caverns of the wood where the oaks bowed over and saved us a grateful shade within everything was so still and cool that my steps hung heavily along the path the bracken held out arms to me and the bosom of the wood was full of sweetness but i journeyed on spurred by the attacks of an army of flies which kept up a guerrilla warfare round my head till i had passed the black rhododendron bushes in the garden where they left me scenting no doubt rebeccas pots of vinegar and sugar  the low red house with its roof discoloured and sunken dozed in sunlight and slept profoundly in the shade thrown by the massive maples encroaching from the wood  there was no one in the diningroom but i could hear the whirr of a sewingmachine coming from the little study a sound as of some great vindictive insect buzzing about now louder now softer now settling then came a jingling of four or five keys at the bottom of the keyboard of the drawingroom piano continuing till the whole range had been covered in little leaps as if some very fat frog had jumped from end to end  that must be mother dusting the drawingroom i thought the unaccustomed sound of the old piano startled me the vocal chords behind the green silk bosom—you only discovered it was not a bronze silk bosom by poking a fold aside—had become as thin and tuneless as a dried old womans age had yellowed the teeth of my mothers little piano and shrunken its spindle legs poor old thing it could but screech in answer to letties fingers flying across it in scorn so the prim brown lips were always closed save to admit the duster  now however the little old maidish piano began to sing a tinkling victorian melody and i fancied it must be some demure little woman with curls like bunches of hops on either side of her face who was touching it the coy little tune teased me with old sensations but my memory would give me no assistance as i stood trying to fix my vague feelings rebecca came in to remove the cloth from the table  who is playing beck i asked  your mother cyril  but she never plays i thought she couldnt  ah replied rebecca you forget when you was a little thing sitting playing against her frock with the prayerbook and she singing to you you cant remember her when her curls was long like a piece of brown silk you cant remember her when she used to play and sing before lettie came and your father was——  rebecca turned and left the room i went and peeped in the drawingroom mother sat before the little brown piano with her plump rather stiff fingers moving across the keys a faint smile on her lips at that moment lettie came flying past me and flung her arms round mothers neck kissing her and saying  oh my dear fancy my dear playing the piano oh little woman we never knew you could  nor can i replied mother laughing disengaging herself i only wondered if i could just strum out this old tune i learned it when i was quite a girl on this piano it was a cracked one then the only one i had  but play again dearie do play again it was like the clinking of lustre glasses and you look so quaint at the piano do play my dear pleaded lettie  nay said my mother the touch of the old keys on my fingers is making me sentimental—you wouldnt like to see me reduced to the tears of old age  old age scolded lettie kissing her again you are young enough to play little romances tell us about it mother  about what child  when you used to play  before my fingers were stiff with fifty odd years where have you been cyril that you werent in to dinner  only down to strelley mill said i  of course said mother coldly  why of course i asked  and you came away as soon as em went to school said lettie  i did said i  they were cross with me these two women after i had swallowed my little resentment i said  they would have me stay to dinner  my mother vouchsafed no reply  and has the great george found a girl yet asked lettie  no i replied he never will at this rate nobody will ever be good enough for him  im sure i dont know what you can find in any of them to take you there so much said my mother  dont be so mean mater i answered nettled you know i like them  i know you like her said my mother sarcastically as for him—hes an unlicked cub what can you expect when his mother has spoiled him as she has but i wonder you are so interested in licking him my mother sniffed contemptuously  he is rather good looking said lettie with a smile  you could make a man of him i am sure i said bowing satirically to her  i am not interested she replied also satirical  then she tossed her head and all the fine hairs that were free from bonds made a mist of yellow light in the sun  what frock shall i wear mater she asked  nay dont ask me replied her mother  i think ill wear the heliotrope—though this sun will fade it she said pensively she was tall nearly six feet in height but slenderly formed her hair was yellow tending towards a dun brown she had beautiful eyes and brows but not a nice nose her hands were very beautiful  where are you going i asked  she did not answer me  to tempests i said she did not reply  well i dont know what you can see in him i continued  indeed said she hes as good as most folk—— then we both began to laugh  not she continued blushing that i think anything about him im merely going for a game of tennis are you coming  what shall you say if i agree i asked  oh she tossed her head we shall all be very pleased im sure  ooray said i with fine irony  she laughed at me blushed and ran upstairs  half an hour afterwards she popped her head in the study to bid me goodbye wishing to see if i appreciated her she was so charming in her fresh linen frock and flowered hat that i could not but be proud of her she expected me to follow her to the window for from between the great purple rhododendrons she waved me a lace mitten then glinted on like a flower moving brightly through the green hazels her path lay through the wood in the opposite direction from strelley mill down the red drive across the treescattered space to the highroad this road ran along the end of our lakelet nethermere for about a quarter of a mile nethermere is the lowest in a chain of three ponds the other two are the upper and lower mill ponds at strelley this is the largest and most charming piece of water a mile long and about a quarter of a mile in width our wood runs down to the waters edge on the opposite side on a hill beyond the farthest corner of the lake stands highclose it looks across the water at us in woodside with one eye as it were while our cottage casts a sidelong glance back again at the proud house and peeps coyly through the trees  i could see lettie like a distant sail stealing along the waters edge her parasol flowing above she turned through the wicket under the pine clump climbed the steep field and was enfolded again in the trees beside highclose  leslie was sprawled on a campchair under a copper beech on the lawn his cigar glowing he watched the ash grow strange and grey in the warm daylight and he felt sorry for poor nell wycherley whom he had driven that morning to the station for would she not be frightfully cut up as the train whirled her further and further away these girls are so daft with a fellow but she was a nice little thing—hed get marie to write to her  at this point he caught sight of a parasol fluttering along the drive and immediately he fell into a deep sleep with just a tiny slit in his slumber to allow him to see lettie approach she finding her watchman ungallantly asleep and his cigar instead of his lamp untrimmed broke off a twig of syringa whose ivory buds had not yet burst with luscious scent i know not how the end of his nose tickled in anticipation before she tickled him in reality but he kept bravely still until the petals swept him then starting from his sleep he exclaimed lettie i was dreaming of kisses  on the bridge of your nose laughed she—but whose were the kisses  who produced the sensation he smiled  since i only tapped your nose you should dream of——  go on said he expectantly  of doctor slop she replied smiling to herself as she closed her parasol  i do not know the gentleman he said afraid that she was laughing at him  no—your nose is quite classic she answered giving him one of those brief intimate glances with which women flatter men so cleverly he radiated with pleasure           chapter ii     dangling the apple   the longdrawn booming of the wind in the wood and the sobbing and moaning in the maples and oaks near the house had made lettie restless she did not want to go anywhere she did not want to do anything so she insisted on my just going out with her as far as the edge of the water we crossed the tangle of fern and bracken bramble and wild raspberry canes that spread in the open space before the house and we went down the grassy slope to the edge of nethermere the wind whipped up noisy little wavelets and the cluck and clatter of these among the pebbles the swish of the rushes and the freshening of the breeze against our faces roused us  the tall meadowsweet was in bud along the tiny beach and we walked kneedeep among it watching the foamy race of the ripples and the whitening of the willows on the far shore at the place where nethermere narrows to the upper end and receives the brook from strelley the wood sweeps down and stands with its feet washed round with waters we broke our way along the shore crushing the sharpscented wild mint whose odour checks the breath and examining here and there among the marshy places ragged nests of waterfowl now deserted some slim young lapwings started at our approach and sped lightly from us their necks outstretched in straining fear of that which could not hurt them one two fled cheeping into cover of the wood almost instantly they coursed back again to where we stood to dart off from us at an angle in an ecstasy of bewilderment and terror  what has frightened the crazy little things asked lettie  i dont know theyve cheek enough sometimes then they go whining skelping off from a fancy as if they had a snake under their wings  lettie however paid small attention to my eloquence she pushed aside an elder bush which graciously showered down upon her myriad crumbs from its flowers like slices of bread and bathed her in a medicinal scent i followed her taking my dose and was startled to hear her sudden oh cyril  on the bank before us lay a black cat both hindpaws torn and bloody in a trap it had no doubt been bounding forward after its prey when it was caught it was gaunt and wild no wonder it frightened the poor lapwings into cheeping hysteria it glared at us fiercely growling low  how cruel—oh how cruel cried lettie shuddering  i wrapped my cap and letties scarf over my hands and bent to open the trap the cat struck with her teeth tearing the cloth convulsively when it was free it sprang away with one bound and fell panting watching us  i wrapped the creature in my jacket and picked her up murmuring  poor mrs nickie ben—we always prophesied it of you  what will you do with it asked lettie  it is one of the strelley mill cats said i and so ill take her home  the poor animal moved and murmured and i carried her but we brought her home they stared on seeing me enter the kitchen coatless carrying a strange bundle while lettie followed me  i have brought poor mrs nickie ben said i unfolding my burden  oh what a shame cried emily putting out her hand to touch the cat but drawing quickly back like the peewits  this is how they all go said the mother  i wish keepers had to sit two or three days with their bare ankles in a trap said mollie in vindictive tones  we laid the poor brute on the rug and gave it warm milk it drank very little being too feeble mollie full of anger fetched mr nickie ben another fine black cat to survey his crippled mate mr nickie ben looked shrugged his sleek shoulders and walked away with high steps there was a general feminine outcry on masculine callousness  george came in for hot water he exclaimed in surprise on seeing us and his eyes became animated  look at mrs nickie ben cried mollie he dropped on his knees on the rug and lifted the wounded paws  broken said he  how awful said emily shuddering violently and leaving the room  both i asked  only one—look  you are hurting her cried lettie  its no good said he  mollie and the mother hurried out of the kitchen into the parlour  what are you going to do asked lettie  put her out of her misery he replied taking up the poor cat we followed him into the barn  the quickest way said he is to swing her round and knock her head against the wall  you make me sick exclaimed lettie  ill drown her then he said with a smile we watched him morbidly as he took a length of twine and fastened a noose round the animals neck and near it an iron goose he kept a long piece of cord attached to the goose  youre not coming are you said he lettie looked at him she had grown rather white  itll make you sick he said she did not answer but followed him across the yard to the garden on the bank of the lower millpond he turned again to us and said  now for it—you are chief mourners as neither of us replied he smiled and dropped the poor writhing cat into the water saying goodbye mrs nickie ben  we waited on the bank some time he eyed us curiously  cyril said lettie quietly isnt it cruel—isnt it awful  i had nothing to say  do you mean me asked george  not you in particular—everything if we move the blood rises in our heelprints  he looked at her seriously with dark eyes  i had to drown her out of mercy said he fastening the cord he held to an ashpole then he went to get a spade and with it he dug a grave in the old black earth  if said he the poor old cat had made a prettier corpse youd have thrown violets on her  he had struck the spade into the ground and hauled up the cat and the iron goose  well he said surveying the hideous object havent her good looks gone she was a fine cat  bury it and have done lettie replied  he did so asking shall you have bad dreams after it  dreams do not trouble me she answered turning away  we went indoors into the parlour where emily sat by a window biting her finger the room was long and not very high there was a great rough beam across the ceiling on the mantelpiece and in the fireplace and over the piano were wild flowers and fresh leaves plentifully scattered the room was cool with the scent of the woods  has he done it asked emily—and did you watch him if i had seen it i should have hated the sight of him and id rather have touched a maggot than him  i shouldnt be particularly pleased if he touched me said lettie  there is something so loathsome about callousness and brutality said emily he fills me with disgust  does he said lettie smiling coldly she went across to the old piano hes only healthy hes never been sick not anyway yet she sat down and played at random letting the numbed notes fall like dead leaves from the haughty ancient piano  emily and i talked on by the window about books and people she was intensely serious and generally succeeded in reducing me to the same state  after a while when the milking and feeding were finished george came in lettie was still playing the piano he asked her why she didnt play something with a tune in it and this caused her to turn round in her chair to give him a withering answer his appearance however scattered her words like startled birds he had come straight from washing in the scullery to the parlour and he stood behind letties chair unconcernedly wiping the moisture from his arms his sleeves were rolled up to the shoulder and his shirt was opened wide at the breast lettie was somewhat taken aback by the sight of him standing with legs apart dressed in dirty leggings and boots and breeches torn at the knee naked at the breast and arms  why dont you play something with a tune in it he repeated rubbing the towel over his shoulders beneath the shirt  a tune she echoed watching the swelling of his arms as he moved them and the rise and fall of his breasts wonderfully solid and white then having curiously examined the sudden meeting of the sunhot skin with the white flesh in his throat her eyes met his and she turned again to the piano while the colour grew in her ears mercifully sheltered by a profusion of bright curls  what shall i play she asked fingering the keys somewhat confusedly  he dragged out a book of songs from a little heap of music and set it before her  which do you want to sing she asked thrilling a little as she felt his arms so near her  anything you like  a love song she said  if you like—yes a love song—— he laughed with clumsy insinuation that made the girl writhe  she did not answer but began to play sullivans tit willow he had a passable bass voice not of any great depth and he sang with gusto then she gave him drink to me only with thine eyes at the end she turned and asked him if he liked the words he replied that he thought them rather daft but he looked at her with glowing brown eyes as if in hesitating challenge  thats because you have no wine in your eyes to pledge with she replied answering his challenge with a blue blaze of her eyes then her eyelashes drooped on to her cheek he laughed with a faint ring of consciousness and asked her how could she know  because she said slowly looking up at him with pretended scorn because theres no change in your eyes when i look at you i always think people who are worth much talk with their eyes thats why you are forced to respect many quite uneducated people their eyes are so eloquent and full of knowledge she had continued to look at him as she spoke—watching his faint appreciation of her upturned face and her hair where the light was always tangled watching his brief selfexamination to see if he could feel any truth in her words watching till he broke into a little laugh which was rather more awkward and less satisfied than usual then she turned away smiling also  theres nothing in this book nice to sing she said turning over the leaves discontentedly i found her a volume and she sang should he upbraid she had a fine soprano voice and the song delighted him he moved nearer to her and when at the finish she looked round with a flashing mischievous air she found him pledging her with wonderful eyes  you like that said she with the air of superior knowledge as if dear me all one had to do was to turn over to the right page of the vast volume of ones soul to suit these people  i do he answered emphatically thus acknowledging her triumph  id rather dance and sing round wrinkled care than carefully shut the door on him while i slept in the chimney wouldnt you she asked  he laughed and began to consider what she meant before he replied  as you do she added  what he asked  keep half your senses asleep—half alive  do i he asked  of course you do—bosbovis an ox you are like a stalled ox food and comfort no more dont you love comfort she smiled  dont you he replied smiling shamefaced  of course come and turn over for me while i play this piece well ill nod when you must turn—bring a chair  she began to play a romance of schuberts he leaned nearer to her to take hold of the leaf of music she felt her loose hair touch his face and turned to him a quick laughing glance while she played at the end of the page she nodded but he was oblivious yes she said suddenly impatient and he tried to get the leaf over she quickly pushed his hand aside turned the page herself and continued playing  sorry said he blushing actually  dont bother she said continuing to play without observing him when she had finished  there she said now tell me how you felt while i was playing  oh—a fool—he replied covered with confusion  im glad to hear it she said—but i didnt mean that i meant how did the music make you feel  i dont know—whether—it made me feel anything he replied deliberately pondering over his answer as usual  i tell you she declared youre either asleep or stupid did you really see nothing in the music but what did you think about  he laughed—and thought awhile—and laughed again  why he admitted laughing and trying to tell the exact truth i thought how pretty your hands are—and what they are like to touch—and i thought it was a new experience to feel somebodys hair tickling my cheek when he had finished his deliberate account she gave his hand a little knock and left him saying  you are worse and worse  she came across the room to the couch where i was sitting talking to emily and put her arm around my neck  isnt it time to go home pat she asked  half past eight—quite early said i  but i believe—i think i ought to be home now she said  dont go said he  why i asked  stay to supper urged emily  but i believe—— she hesitated  she has another fish to fry i said  i am not sure—— she hesitated again then she flashed into sudden wrath exclaiming dont be so mean and nasty cyril  were you going somewhere asked george humbly  why—no she said blushing  then stay to supper—will you he begged she laughed and yielded we went into the kitchen mr saxton was sitting reading trip the big bull terrier lay at his feet pretending to sleep mr nickie ben reposed calmly on the sofa mrs saxton and mollie were just going to bed we bade them goodnight and sat down annie the servant had gone home so emily prepared the supper  nobody can touch that piano like you said mr saxton to lettie beaming upon her with admiration and deference he was proud of the stately mumbling old thing and used to say that it was full of music for those that liked to ask for it lettie laughed and said that so few folks ever tried it that her honour was not great  what do you think of our georges singing asked the father proudly but with a deprecating laugh at the end  i tell him when hes in love hell sing quite well she said  when hes in love echoed the father laughing aloud very pleased  yes she said when he finds out something he wants and cant have  george thought about it and he laughed also  emily who was laying the table said there is hardly any water in the pippin george  oh dash he exclaimed ive taken my boots off  its not a very big job to put them on again said his sister  why couldnt annie fetch it—whats she here for he said angrily  emily looked at us tossed her head and turned her back on him  ill go ill go after supper said the father in a comforting tone  after supper laughed emily  george got up and shuffled out he had to go into the spinney near the house to a well and being warm disliked turning out  we had just sat down to supper when trip rushed barking to the door be quiet ordered the father thinking of those in bed and he followed the dog  it was leslie he wanted lettie to go home with him at once this she refused to do so he came indoors and was persuaded to sit down at table he swallowed a morsel of bread and cheese and a cup of coffee talking to lettie of a garden party which was going to be arranged at highclose for the following week  what is it for then interrupted mr saxton  for echoed leslie  is it for the missionaries or the unemployed or something explained mr saxton  its a gardenparty not a bazaar said leslie  oh—a private affair i thought it would be some church matter of your mothers shes very big at the church isnt she  she is interested in the church—yes said leslie then proceeding to explain to lettie that he was arranging a tennis tournament in which she was to take part at this point he became aware that he was monopolising the conversation and turned to george just as the latter was taking a piece of cheese from his knife with his teeth asking  do you play tennis mr saxton—i know miss saxton does not  no said george working the piece of cheese into his cheek i never learned any ladies accomplishments  leslie turned to emily who had nervously been pushing two plates over a stain in the cloth and who was very startled when she found herself addressed  my mother would be so glad if you would come to the party miss saxton  i cannot i shall be at school thanks very much  ah—its very good of you said the father beaming but george smiled contemptuously  when supper was over leslie looked at lettie to inform her that he was ready to go she however refused to see his look but talked brightly to mr saxton who was delighted george flattered joined in the talk with gusto then leslies angry silence began to tell on us all after a dull lapse george lifted his head and said to his father  oh i shouldnt be surprised if that little red heifer calved tonight  letties eyes flashed with a sparkle of amusement at this thrust  no assented the father i thought so myself  after a moments silence george continued deliberately i felt her gristles——  george said emily sharply  we will go said leslie  george looked up sideways at lettie and his black eyes were full of sardonic mischief  lend me a shawl will you emily said lettie i brought nothing and i think the wind is cold  emily however regretted that she had no shawl and so lettie must needs wear a black coat over her summer dress it fitted so absurdly that we all laughed but leslie was very angry that she should appear ludicrous before them he showed her all the polite attentions possible fastened the neck of her coat with his pearl scarfpin refusing the pin emily discovered after some search then we sallied forth  when we were outside he offered lettie his arm with an air of injured dignity she refused it and he began to remonstrate  i consider you ought to have been home as you promised  pardon me she replied but i did not promise  but you knew i was coming said he  well—you found me she retorted  yes he assented i did find you flirting with a common fellow he sneered  well she returned he did—it is true—call a heifer a heifer  and i should think you liked it he said  i didnt mind she said with galling negligence  i thought your taste was more refined he replied sarcastically but i suppose you thought it romantic  very ruddy dark and really thrilling eyes said she  i hate to hear a girl talk rot said leslie he himself had crisp hair of the ginger class  but i mean it she insisted aggravating his anger  leslie was angry im glad he amuses you  of course im not hard to please she said pointedly he was stung to the quick  then theres some comfort in knowing i dont please you he said coldly  oh but you do you amuse me also she said  after that he would not speak preferring i suppose not to amuse her  lettie took my arm and with her disengaged hand held her skirts above the wet grass when he had left us at the end of the riding in the wood lettie said  what an infant he is  a bit of an ass i admitted  but really she said hes more agreeable on the whole than—than my taurus  your bull i repeated laughing           chapter iii     a vendor of visions   the sunday following letties visit to the mill leslie came up in the morning admirably dressed and perfected by a grand air i showed him into the dark drawingroom and left him ordinarily he would have wandered to the stairs and sat there calling to lettie today he was silent i carried the news of his arrival to my sister who was pinning on her brooch  and how is the dear boy she asked i have not inquired said i she laughed and loitered about till it was time to set off for church before she came downstairs then she also assumed the grand air and bowed to him with a beautiful bow he was somewhat taken aback and had nothing to say she rustled across the room to the window where the white geraniums grew magnificently i must adorn myself she said  it was leslies custom to bring her flowers as he had not done so this day she was piqued he hated the scent and chalky whiteness of the geraniums so she smiled at him as she pinned them into the bosom of her dress saying they are very fine are they not he muttered that they were mother came downstairs greeted him warmly and asked him if he would take her to church  if you will allow me said he  you are modest today laughed mother  today he repeated  i hate modesty in a young man said mother—come we shall be late lettie wore the geraniums all day—till evening she brought alice gall home to tea and bade me bring up mon taureau when his farm work was over  the day had been hot and close the sun was reddening in the west as we leaped across the lesser brook the evening scents began to awake and wander unseen through the still air an occasional yellow sunbeam would slant through the thick roof of leaves and cling passionately to the orange clusters of mountainash berries the trees were silent drawing together to sleep only a few pink orchids stood palely by the path looking wistfully out at the ranks of redpurple bugle whose last flowers glowing from the top of the bronze column yearned darkly for the sun  we sauntered on in silence not breaking the first hush of the woodlands as we drew near home we heard a murmur from among the trees from the lovers seat where a great tree had fallen and remained mossed and covered with fragile growth there a crooked bough made a beautiful seat for two  fancy being in love and making a row in such a twilight said i as we continued our way but when we came opposite the fallen tree we saw no lovers there but a man sleeping and muttering through his sleep the cap had fallen from his grizzled hair and his head leaned back against a profusion of the little wild geraniums that decorated the dead bough so delicately the mans clothing was good but slovenly and neglected his face was pale and worn with sickness and dissipation as he slept his grey beard wagged and his loose unlovely mouth moved in indistinct speech he was acting over again some part of his life and his features twitched during the unnatural sleep he would give a little groan gruesome to hear and then talk to some woman his features twitched as if with pain and he moaned slightly  the lips opened in a grimace showing the yellow teeth behind the beard then he began again talking in his throat thickly so that we could only tell part of what he said it was very unpleasant i wondered how we should end it suddenly through the gloom of the twilighthaunted woods came the scream of a rabbit caught by a weasel the man awoke with a sharp ah—he looked round in consternation then sinking down again wearily said i was dreaming again  you dont seem to have nice dreams said george  the man winced then looking at us said almost sneering  and who are you  we did not answer but waited for him to move he sat still looking at us  so he said at last wearily i do dream i do i do he sighed heavily then he added sarcastically were you interested  no said i but you are out of your way surely which road did you want  you want me to clear out he said  well i said laughing in deprecation i dont mind your dreaming but this is not the way to anywhere  where may you be going then he asked  i home i replied with dignity  you are a beardsall he queried eyeing me with bloodshot eyes  i am i replied with more dignity wondering who the fellow could be  he sat a few moments looking at me it was getting dark in the wood then he took up an ebony stick with a gold head and rose the stick seemed to catch at my imagination i watched it curiously as we walked with the old man along the path to the gate we went with him into the open road when we reached the clear sky where the light from the west fell full on our faces he turned again and looked at us closely his mouth opened sharply as if he would speak but he stopped himself and only said goodbye—goodbye  shall you be all right i asked seeing him totter  yes—all right—goodbye lad  he walked away feebly into the darkness we saw the lights of a vehicle on the highroad after a while we heard the bang of a door and a cab rattled away  well—whoevers he said george laughing  do you know said i its made me feel a bit rotten  ay he laughed turning up the end of the exclamation with indulgent surprise  we went back home deciding to say nothing to the women they were sitting in the window seat watching for us mother and alice and lettie  you have been a long time said lettie weve watched the sun go down—it set splendidly—look—the rim of the hill is smouldering yet what have you been doing  waiting till your taurus finished work  now be quiet she said hastily and—turning to him you have come to sing hymns  anything you like he replied  how nice of you george exclaimed alice ironically she was a short plump girl pale with daring rebellious eyes her mother was a wyld a family famous either for shocking lawlessness or for extreme uprightness alice with an admirable father and a mother who loved her husband passionately was wild and lawless on the surface but at heart very upright and amenable my mother and she were fast friends and lettie had a good deal of sympathy with her but lettie generally deplored alices outrageous behaviour though she relished it—if superior friends were not present most men enjoyed alice in company but they fought shy of being alone with her  would you say the same to me she asked  it depends what youd answer he said laughingly  oh youre so bloomin cautious id rather have a tack in my shoe than a cautious man wouldnt you lettie  well—it depends how far i had to walk was letties reply—but if i hadnt to limp too far——  alice turned away from lettie whom she often found rather irritating  you do look glum sybil she said to me did somebody want to kiss you  i laughed—on the wrong side understanding her malicious feminine reference—and answered  if they had i should have looked happy  dear boy smile now then—and she tipped me under the chin i drew away  oh gum—we are solemn whats the matter with you georgy—say something—else isll begin to feel nervous  what shall i say he asked shifting his feet and resting his elbows on his knees oh lor she cried in great impatience he did not help her but sat clasping his hands smiling on one side of his face he was nervous he looked at the pictures the ornaments and everything in the room lettie got up to settle some flowers on the mantelpiece and he scrutinised her closely she was dressed in some blue foulard stuff with lace at the throat and lace cuffs to the elbow she was tall and supple her hair had a curling fluffiness very charming he was no taller than she and looked shorter being strongly built he too had a grace of his own but not as he sat stiffly on a horsehair chair she was elegant in her movements  after a little while mother called us in to supper  come said lettie to him take me in to supper  he rose feeling very awkward  give me your arm said she to tease him he did so and flushed under his tan afraid of her round arm half hidden by lace which lay among his sleeve  when we were seated she flourished her spoon and asked him what he would have he hesitated looked at the strange dishes and said he would have some cheese they insisted on his eating new complicated meats  im sure you like tantafflins dont you georgie said alice in her mocking fashion he was not sure he could not analyse the flavours he felt confused and bewildered even through his sense of taste alice begged him to have salad  no thanks said he i dont like it  oh george she said how can you say so when im offering it you  well—ive only had it once said he and that was when i was working with flint and he gave us fat bacon and bits of lettuce soaked in vinegar—ave a bit more salit he kept saying but id had enough  but all our lettuce said alice with a wink is as sweet as a nut no vinegar about our lettuce george laughed in much confusion at her pun on my sisters name  i believe you he said with pompous gallantry  think of that cried alice our georgie believes me oh i am so so pleased  he smiled painfully his hand was resting on the table the thumb tucked tight under the fingers his knuckles white as he nervously gripped his thumb at last supper was finished and he picked up his serviette from the floor and began to fold it lettie also seemed ill at ease she had teased him till the sense of his awkwardness had become uncomfortable now she felt sorry and a trifle repentant so she went to the piano as she always did to dispel her moods when she was angry she played tender fragments of tschaïkowsky when she was miserable mozart now she played handel in a manner that suggested the plains of heaven in the long notes and in the little trills as if she were waltzing up the ladder of jacobs dream like the damsels in blakes pictures i often told her she flattered herself scandalously through the piano but generally she pretended not to understand me and occasionally she surprised me by a sudden rush of tears to her eyes for georges sake she played gounods ave maria knowing that the sentiment of the chant would appeal to him and make him sad forgetful of the petty evils of this life i smiled as i watched the cheap spell working when she had finished her fingers lay motionless for a minute on the keys then she spun round and looked him straight in the eyes giving promise of a smile but she glanced down at her knee  you are tired of music she said  no he replied shaking his head  like it better than salad she asked with a flash of raillery  he looked up at her with a sudden smile but did not reply he was not handsome his features were too often in a heavy repose but when he looked up and smiled unexpectedly he flooded her with an access of tenderness  then youll have a little more said she and she turned again to the piano she played soft wistful morsels then suddenly broke off in the midst of one sentimental plaint and left the piano dropping into a low chair by the fire there she sat and looked at him he was conscious that her eyes were fixed on him but he dared not look back at her so he pulled his moustache  you are only a boy after all she said to him quietly then he turned and asked her why  it is a boy that you are she repeated leaning back in her chair and smiling lazily at him  i never thought so he replied seriously  really she said chuckling  no said he trying to recall his previous impressions  she laughed heartily saying  youre growing up  how he asked  growing up she repeated still laughing  but im sure i was never boyish said he  im teaching you said she and when youre boyish youll be a very decent man a mere man darent be a boy for fear of tumbling off his manly dignity and then hed be a fool poor thing  he laughed and sat still to think about it as was his way  do you like pictures she asked suddenly being tired of looking at him  better than anything he replied  except dinner and a warm hearth and a lazy evening she said  he looked at her suddenly hardening at her insult and biting his lips at the taste of this humiliation she repented and smiled her plaintive regret to him  ill show you some she said rising and going out of the room he felt he was nearer her she returned carrying a pile of great books  jove—youre pretty strong said he  you are charming in your compliment she said  he glanced at her to see if she were mocking  thats the highest you could say of me isnt it she insisted  is it he asked unwilling to compromise himself  for sure she answered—and then laying the books on the table i know how a man will compliment me by the way he looks at me—she kneeled before the fire some look at my hair some watch the rise and fall of my breathing some look at my neck and a few—not you among them—look me in the eyes for my thoughts to you im a fine specimen strong pretty strong you primitive man  he sat twisting his fingers she was very contrary  bring your chair up she said sitting down at the table and opening a book she talked to him of each picture insisting on hearing his opinion sometimes he disagreed with her and would not be persuaded at such times she was piqued  if said she an ancient briton in his skins came and contradicted me as you do wouldnt you tell him not to make an ass of himself  i dont know said he  then you ought to she replied you know nothing  how is it you ask me then he said  she began to laugh  why—thats a pertinent question i think you might be rather nice you know  thank you he said smiling ironically  oh she said i know you think youre perfect but youre not youre very annoying  yes exclaimed alice who had entered the room again dressed ready to depart hes so blooming slow great whizz who wants fellows to carry cold dinners shouldnt you like to shake him lettie  i dont feel concerned enough replied the other calmly  did you ever carry a boiled pudding georgy asked alice with innocent interest punching me slyly  me—why—what makes you ask he replied quite at a loss  oh i only wondered if your people needed any indigestion mixture—pa mixes it—11 ½ a bottle  i dont see—— he began  ta—ta old boy ill give you time to think about it goodnight lettie absence makes the heart grow fonder—georgy—of someone else farewell come along sybil love the moon is shining—goodnight all goodnight  i escorted her home while they continued to look at the pictures he was a romanticist he liked copley fielding cattermole and birket foster he could see nothing whatsoever in girtin or david cox they fell out decidedly over george clausen  but said lettie he is a real realist he makes common things beautiful he sees the mystery and magnificence that envelops us even when we work menially i do know and i can speak if i hoed in the fields beside you—— this was a very new idea for him almost a shock to his imagination and she talked unheeded the picture under discussion was a watercolour—hoeing by clausen  youd be just that colour in the sunset she said thus bringing him back to the subject and if you looked at the ground youd find there was a sense of warm gold fire in it and once youd perceived the colour it would strengthen till youd see nothing else you are blind you are only halfborn you are gross with good living and heavy sleeping you are a piano which will only play a dozen common notes sunset is nothing to you—it merely happens anywhere oh but you make me feel as if id like to make you suffer if youd ever been sick if youd ever been born into a home where there was something oppressed you and you couldnt understand if ever youd believed or even doubted you might have been a man by now you never grow up like bulbs which spend all summer getting fat and fleshy but never wakening the germ of a flower as for me the flower is born in me but it wants bringing forth things dont flower if theyre overfed you have to suffer before you blossom in this life when death is just touching a plant it forces it into a passion of flowering you wonder how i have touched death you dont know theres always a sense of death in this home i believe my mother hated my father before i was born that was death in her veins for me before i was born it makes a difference——  as he sat listening his eyes grew wide and his lips were parted like a child who feels the tale but does not understand the words she looking away from herself at last saw him began to laugh gently and patted his hand saying  oh my dear heart are you bewildered how amiable of you to listen to me—there isnt any meaning in it all—there isnt really  but said he why do you say it  oh the question she laughed let us go back to our muttons were gazing at each other like two dazed images  they turned on chatting casually till george suddenly exclaimed there  it was maurice griffinhagens idyll  what of it she asked gradually flushing she remembered her own enthusiasm over the picture  wouldnt it be fine he exclaimed looking at her with glowing eyes his teeth showing white in a smile that was not amusement  what she asked dropping her head in confusion  that—a girl like that—half afraid—and passion he lit up curiously  she may well be half afraid when the barbarian comes out in his glory skins and all  but dont you like it he asked  she shrugged her shoulders saying make love to the next girl you meet and by the time the poppies redden the field shell hang in your arms shell have need to be more than half afraid wont she  she played with the leaves of the book and did not look at him  but he faltered his eyes glowing it would be—rather——  dont sweet lad dont she cried laughing  but i shouldnt— he insisted i dont know whether i should like any girl i know to——  precious sir galahad she said in a mock caressing voice and stroking his cheek with her finger you ought to have been a monk—a martyr a carthusian  he laughed taking no notice he was breathlessly quivering under the new sensation of heavy unappeased fire in his breast and in the muscles of his arms he glanced at her bosom and shivered  are you studying just how to play the part she asked  no—but—— he tried to look at her but failed he shrank laughing and dropped his head  what she asked with vibrant curiosity  having become a few degrees calmer he looked up at her now his eyes wide and vivid with a declaration that made her shrink back as if flame had leaped towards her face she bent down her head and picked at her dress  didnt you know the picture before she said in a low toneless voice  he shut his eyes and shrank with shame  no ive never seen it before he said  im surprised she said it is a very common one  is it he answered and this makebelief conversation fell she looked up and found his eyes they gazed at each other for a moment before they hid their faces again it was a torture to each of them to look thus nakedly at the other a dazzled shrinking pain that they forced themselves to undergo for a moment that they might the moment after tremble with a fierce sensation that filled their veins with fluid fiery electricity she sought almost in panic for something to say  i believe its in liverpool the picture she contrived to say  he dared not kill this conversation he was too selfconscious he forced himself to reply i didnt know there was a gallery in liverpool  oh yes a very good one she said  their eyes met in the briefest flash of a glance then both turned their faces aside thus averted one from the other they made talk at last she rose gathered the books together and carried them off at the door she turned she must steal another keen moment are you admiring my strength she asked her pose was fine with her head thrown back the roundness of her throat ran finely down to the bosom which swelled above the pile of books held by her straight arms he looked at her their lips smiled curiously she put back her throat as if she were drinking they felt the blood beating madly in their necks then suddenly breaking into a slight trembling she turned round and left the room  while she was out he sat twisting his moustache she came back along the hall talking madly to herself in french having been much impressed by sarah bernhardts dame aux camelias and adrienne lecouvreur lettie had caught something of the weird tone of this great actress and her raillery and mockery came out in little wild waves she laughed at him and at herself and at men in general and at love in particular whatever he said to her she answered in the same mad clatter of french speaking high and harshly the sound was strange and uncomfortable there was a painful perplexity in his brow such as i often perceived afterwards a sense of something hurting something he could not understand  well well well well she exclaimed at last we must be mad sometimes or we should be getting aged hein  i wish i could understand he said plaintively  poor dear she laughed how sober he is and will you really go they will think weve given you no supper you look so sad  i have supped—full—— he began his eyes dancing with a smile as he ventured upon a quotation he was very much excited  of horrors she cried completing it now that is worse than anything i have given you  is it he replied and they smiled at each other  far worse she answered they waited in suspense for some moments he looked at her  goodbye she said holding out her hand her voice was full of insurgent tenderness he looked at her again his eyes flickering then he took her hand she pressed his fingers holding them a little while then ashamed of her display of feeling she looked down he had a deep cut across his thumb  what a gash she exclaimed shivering and clinging a little tighter to his fingers before she released them he gave a little laugh  does it hurt you she asked very gently  he laughed again—no he said softly as if his thumb were not worthy of consideration  they smiled again at each other and with a blind movement he broke the spell and was gone           chapter iv        the father   autumn set in and the red dahlias which kept the warm light alive in their bosoms so late into the evening died in the night and the morning had nothing but brown balls of rottenness to show  they called me as i passed the postoffice door in eberwich one evening and they gave me a letter for my mother the distorted sprawling handwriting perplexed me with a dim uneasiness i put the letter away and forgot it i remembered it later in the evening when i wished to recall something to interest my mother she looked at the handwriting and began hastily and nervously to tear open the envelope she held it away from her in the light of the lamp and with eyes drawn half closed tried to scan it so i found her spectacles but she did not speak her thanks and her hand trembled she read the short letter quickly then she sat down and read it again and continued to look at it  what is it mother i asked  she did not answer but continued staring at the letter i went up to her and put my hand on her shoulder feeling very uncomfortable she took no notice of me beginning to murmur poor frank—poor frank that was my fathers name  but what is it mother—tell me whats the matter  she turned and looked at me as if i were a stranger she got up and began to walk about the room then she left the room and i heard her go out of the house  the letter had fallen on to the floor i picked it up the handwriting was very broken the address gave a village some few miles away the date was three days before  my dear lettice  you will want to know i am gone i can hardly last a day or two—my kidneys are nearly gone  i came over one day i didnt see you but i saw the girl by the window and i had a few words with the lad he never knew and he felt nothing i think the girl might have done if you knew how awfully lonely i am lettice—how awfully i have been you might feel sorry  i have saved what i could to pay you back i have had the worst of it lettice and im glad the end has come i have had the worst of it     goodbye—for ever—your husband        frank beardsall  i was numbed by this letter of my fathers with almost agonised effort i strove to recall him but i knew that my image of a tall handsome dark man with pale grey eyes was made up from my mothers few words and from a portrait i had once seen  the marriage had been unhappy my father was of frivolous rather vulgar character but plausible having a good deal of charm he was a liar without notion of honesty and he had deceived my mother thoroughly one after another she discovered his mean dishonesties and deceits and her soul revolted from him and because the illusion of him had broken into a thousand vulgar fragments she turned away with the scorn of a woman who finds her romance has been a trumpery tale when he left her for other pleasures—lettie being a baby of three years while i was five—she rejoiced bitterly she had heard of him indirectly—and of him nothing good although he prospered—but he had never come to see her or written to her in all the eighteen years  in a while my mother came in she sat down pleating up the hem of her black apron and smoothing it out again  you know she said he had a right to the children and ive kept them all the time  he could have come said i  i set them against him i have kept them from him and he wanted them i ought to be by him now—i ought to have taken you to him long ago  but how could you when you knew nothing of him  he would have come—he wanted to come—i have felt it for years but i kept him away i know i have kept him away i have felt it and he has poor frank—hell see his mistakes now he would not have been as cruel as i have been——  nay mother it is only the shock that makes you say so  this makes me know i have felt in myself a long time that he was suffering i have had the feeling of him in me i knew yes i did know he wanted me and you i felt it i have had the feeling of him upon me this last three months especially    i have been cruel to him  well—well go to him now shall we i said  tomorrow—tomorrow she replied noticing me really for the first time i go in the morning  and ill go with you  yes—in the morning lettie has her party to chatsworth—dont tell her—we wont tell her  no said i  shortly after my mother went upstairs lettie came in rather late from highclose leslie did not come in in the morning they were going with a motor party into matloch and chatsworth and she was excited and did not observe anything  after all mother and i could not set out until the warm tempered afternoon the air was full of a soft yellowness when we stepped down from the train at cossethay my mother insisted on walking the long two miles to the village we went slowly along the road lingering over the little red flowers in the high hedgebottom up the hillside we were reluctant to come to our destination as we came in sight of the little grey tower of the church we heard the sound of braying brassy music before us filling a little croft the wakes was in full swing  some wooden horses careered gaily round and the swingboats leaped into the mild blue sky we sat upon the stile my mother and i and watched there were booths and cocoanut shies and roundabouts scattered in the small field groups of children moved quietly from attraction to attraction a deeply tanned man came across the field swinging two dripping buckets of water women looked from the doors of their brilliant caravans and lean dogs rose lazily and settled down again under the steps the fair moved slowly for all its noise a stout lady with a husky masculine voice invited the excited children into her peep show a swarthy man stood with his thin legs astride on the platform of the roundabouts and sloping backwards his mouth distended with a row of fingers he whistled astonishingly to the coarse row of the organ and his whistling sounded clear like the flight of a wild goose high over the chimney tops as he was carried round and round a little fat man with an ugly swelling on his chest stood screaming from a filthy booth to a crowd of urchins bidding them challenge a big stolid young man who stood with folded arms his fists pushing out his biceps on being asked if he would undertake any of these prospective challenges this young man nodded not having yet attained a talking stage—yes he would take two at a time screamed the little fat man with the big excrescence on his chest pointing at the cowering lads and girls further off punchs quaint voice could be heard when the cocoanut man ceased grinding out screeches from his rattle the cocoanut man was wroth for these youngsters would not risk a penny shy and the rattle yelled like a fiend a little girl came along to look at us daintily licking an icecream sandwich we were uninteresting however so she passed on to stare at the caravans  we had almost gathered courage to cross the wakes when the cracked bell of the church sent its note falling over the babble  one—two—three—had it really sounded three then it rang on a lower bell—one—two—three a passing bell for a man i looked at my mother—she turned away from me  the organ flared on—the husky woman came forward to make another appeal then there was a lull the man with the lump on his chest had gone inside the rag to spar with the solid fellow the cocoanut man had gone to the three tunns in fury and a brazen girl of seventeen or so was in charge of the nuts the horses careered round carrying two frightened boys  suddenly the quick throbbing note of the low bell struck again through the din i listened—but could not keep count one two three four—for the third time that great lad had determined to go on the horses and they had started while his foot was on the step and he had been foiled—eight nine ten—no wonder that whistling man had such a big adams apple—i wondered if it hurt his neck when he talked being so pointed—nineteen twenty—the girl was licking more icecream with precious tiny licks—twentyfive twentysix—i wondered if i did count to twentysix mechanically at this point i gave it up and watched for lord tennysons bald head to come spinning round on the painted rim of the roundabouts followed by a redfaced lord roberts and a villainous looking disraeli  fiftyone—— said my mother come—come along  we hurried through the fair towards the church towards a garden where the last red sentinels looked out from the top of the hollyhock spires the garden was a tousled mass of faded pink chrysanthemums and weakeyed michaelmas daisies and spectre stalks of hollyhock it belonged to a low dark house which crouched behind a screen of yews we walked along to the front the blinds were down and in one room we could see the stale light of candles burning  is this yew cottage asked my mother of a curious lad  its mrs mays replied the boy  does she live alone i asked  she ad french carlin—but hes dead—an shes letten th candles ter keep th owd lad offn im  we went to the house and knocked  an ye come about him hoarsely whispered a bent old woman looking up with very blue eyes nodding her old head with its velvet net significantly towards the inner room  yes—— said my mother we had a letter  ay poor fellow—hes gone missis and the old lady shook her head then she looked at us curiously leaned forward and putting her withered old hand on my mothers arm her hand with its dark blue veins she whispered in confidence and the candles as gone out twice e wor a funny feller very funny  i must come in and settle things—i am his nearest relative said my mother trembling  yes—i must a dozed for when i looked up it wor black darkness missis i dursnt sit up wi im no more an many a one ive laid out eh but his sufferins missis—poor feller—eh missis—she lifted her ancient hands and looked up at my mother with her eyes so intensely blue  do you know where he kept his papers asked my mother  yis i axed father burns about it he said we mun pray for im i bought him candles out o my own pocket he wor a rum feller he wor and again she shook her grey head mournfully my mother took a step forward  did ye want to see im asked the old woman with half timid questioning  yes replied my mother with a vigorous nod she perceived now that the old lady was deaf  we followed the woman into the kitchen a long low room dark with drawn blinds  sit ye down said the old lady in the same low tone as if she were speaking to herself  ye are his sister appen  my mother shook her head  oh—his brothers wife persisted the old lady  we shook our heads  only a cousin she guessed and looked at us appealingly i nodded assent  sit ye there a minute she said and trotted off she banged the door and jarred a chair as she went when she returned she set down a bottle and two glasses with a thump on the table in front of us her thin skinny wrist seemed hardly capable of carrying the bottle  its one as hed only just begun of—ave a drop to keep ye up—do now poor thing she said pushing the bottle to my mother and hurrying off returning with the sugar and the kettle we refused  e wont want it no more poor feller—an its good missis he allers drank it good ay—an e adnt a drop the last three days poor man poor feller not a drop come now itll stay ye come now we refused  ts in there she whispered pointing to a closed door in a dark corner of the gloomy kitchen i stumbled up a little step and went plunging against a rickety table on which was a candle in a tall brass candlestick over went the candle and it rolled on the floor and the brass holder fell with much clanging  eh—eh dear—lord dear—heart dear—heart wailed the old woman she hastened trembling round to the other side of the bed and relit the extinguished candle at the taper which was still burning as she returned the light glowed on her old wrinkled face and on the burnished knobs of the dark mahogany bedstead while a stream of wax dripped down on to the floor by the glimmering light of the two tapers we could see the outlined form under the counterpane she turned back the hem and began to make painful wailing sounds my heart was beating heavily and i felt choked i did not want to look—but i must it was the man i had seen in the woods—with the puffiness gone from his face i felt the great wild pity and a sense of terror and a sense of horror and a sense of awful littleness and loneliness among a great empty space i felt beyond myself as if i were a mere fleck drifting unconsciously through the dark then i felt my mothers arm round my shoulders and she cried pitifully oh my son my son  i shivered and came back to myself there were no tears in my mothers face only a great pleading never mind mother—never mind i said incoherently  she rose and covered the face again and went round to the old lady and held her still and stayed her little wailings the woman wiped from her cheeks the few tears of old age and pushed her grey hair smooth under the velvet network  where are all his things asked mother  eh said the old lady lifting up her ear  are all his things here repeated mother in a louder tone  here—the woman waved her hand round the room it contained the great mahogany bedstead naked of hangings a desk and an oak chest and two or three mahogany chairs i couldnt get him upstairs hes only been here about a three week  wheres the key to the desk said my mother loudly in the womans ear  yes she replied—its his desk she looked at us perplexed and doubtful fearing she had misunderstood us this was dreadful  key i shouted where is the key  her old face was full of trouble as she shook her head i took it that she did not know  where are his clothes clothes i repeated pointing to my coat she understood and muttered ill fetch em ye  we should have followed her as she hurried upstairs through a door near the head of the bed had we not heard a heavy footstep in the kitchen and a voice saying is the old lady going to drink with the devil hullo mrs may come and drink with me we heard the tinkle of the liquor poured into a glass and almost immediately the light tap of the empty tumbler on the table  ill see what the old girls up to he said and the heavy tread came towards us like me he stumbled at the little step but escaped collision with the table  damn that fools step he said heartily it was the doctor—for he kept his hat on his head and did not hesitate to stroll about the house he was a big burly redfaced man  i beg your pardon he said observing my mother my mother bowed  mrs beardsall he asked taking off his hat  my mother bowed  i posted a letter to you you are a relative of his—of poor old carlins—he nodded sideways towards the bed  the nearest said my mother  poor fellow—he was a bit stranded comes of being a bachelor maam  i was very much surprised to hear from him said my mother  yes i guess hes not been much of a one for writing to his friends hes had a bad time lately you have to pay some time or other we bring them on ourselves—silly devils as we are—i beg your pardon  there was a moment of silence during which the doctor sighed and then began to whistle softly  well—we might be more comfortable if we had the blind up he said letting daylight in among the glimmer of the tapers as he spoke  at any rate he said you wont have any trouble settling up—no debts or anything of that i believe theres a bit to leave—so its not so bad poor devil—he was very down at the last but we have to pay at one end or the other what on earth is the old girl after he asked looking up at the raftered ceiling which was rumbling and thundering with the old ladys violent rummaging  we wanted the key of his desk said my mother  oh—i can find you that—and the will he told me where they were and to give them you when you came he seemed to think a lot of you perhaps he might ha done better for himself——  here we heard the heavy tread of the old lady coming downstairs the doctor went to the foot of the stairs  hello now—be careful he bawled the poor old woman did as he expected and trod on the braces of the trousers she was trailing and came crashing into his arms he set her tenderly down saying not hurt are you—no and he smiled at her and shook his head  eh doctor—eh doctor—bless ye im thankful yeve come yell see to em now will ye  yes— he nodded in his bluff winning way and hurrying into the kitchen he mixed her a glass of whisky and brought one for himself saying to her there you are—twas a nasty shaking for you  the poor old woman sat in a chair by the open door of the staircase the pile of clothing tumbled about her feet she looked round pitifully at us and at the daylight struggling among the candle light making a ghostly gleam on the bed where the rigid figure lay unmoved her hand trembled so that she could scarcely hold her glass  the doctor gave us the keys and we rifled the desk and the drawers sorting out all the papers the doctor sat sipping and talking to us all the time  yes he said hes only been here about two years felt himself beginning to break up then i think hed been a long time abroad they always called him frenchy the doctor sipped and reflected and sipped again ay—hed run the rig in his day—used to dream dreadfully good thing the old woman was so deaf awful when a man gives himself away in his sleep played the deuce with him knowing it sip sip sip—and more reflections—and another glass to be mixed  but he was a jolly decent fellow—generous openhanded the folks didnt like him because they couldnt get to the bottom of him they always hate a thing they cant fathom he was close theres no mistake—save when he was asleep sometimes the doctor looked at his glass and sighed  however—we shall miss him—shant we mrs may he bawled suddenly startling us making us glance at the bed  he lit his pipe and puffed voluminously in order to obscure the attraction of his glass meanwhile we examined the papers there were very few letters—one or two addressed to paris there were many bills and receipts and notes—business all business  there was hardly a trace of sentiment among all the litter my mother sorted out such papers as she considered valuable the others letters and missives which she glanced at cursorily and put aside she took into the kitchen and burned she seemed afraid to find out too much  the doctor continued to colour his tobacco smoke with a few pensive words  ay he said there are two ways you can burn your lamp with a big draught and itll flare away till the oils gone then itll stink and smoke itself out or you can keep it trim on the kitchen table dirty your fingers occasionally trimming it up and itll last a long time and sink out mildly here he turned to his glass and finding it empty was awakened to reality  anything i can do madam he asked  no thank you  ay i dont suppose theres much to settle nor many tears to shed—when a fellow spends his years an his prime on the lord knows who you cant expect those that remember him young to feel his loss too keenly hed had his fling in his day though maam ay—must ha had some rich times no lasting satisfaction in it though—always wanting craving theres nothing like marrying—youve got your dish before you then and youve got to eat it he lapsed again into reflection from which he did not rouse till we had locked up the desk burned the useless papers put the others into my pockets and the black bag and were standing ready to depart then the doctor looked up suddenly and said  but what about the funeral  then he noticed the weariness of my mothers look and he jumped up and quickly seized his hat saying  come across to my wife and have a cup of tea buried in these dam holes a fellow gets such a boor do come—my little wife is lonely—come just to see her  my mother smiled and thanked him we turned to go my mother hesitated in her walk on the threshold of the room she glanced round at the bed but she went on  outside in the fresh air of the fading afternoon i could not believe it was true it was not true that sad colourless face with grey beard wavering in the yellow candlelight it was a lie—that wooden bedstead that deaf woman they were fading phrases of the untruth that yellow blaze of little sunflowers was true and the shadow from the sundial on the warm old almshouses—that was real the heavy afternoon sunlight came round us warm and reviving we shivered and the untruth went out of our veins and we were no longer chilled  the doctors house stood sweetly among the beech trees and at the iron fence in front of the little lawn a woman was talking to a beautiful jersey cow that pushed its dark nose through the fence from the field beyond she was a little dark woman with vivid colouring she rubbed the nose of the delicate animal peeped right into the dark eyes and talked in a lovable scottish speech talked as a mother talks softly to her child  when she turned round in surprise to greet us there was still the softness of a rich affection in her eyes she gave us tea and scones and apply jelly and all the time we listened with delight to her voice which was musical as bees humming in the lime trees though she said nothing significant we listened to her attentively  her husband was merry and kind she glanced at him with quick glances of apprehension and her eyes avoided him he in his merry frank way chaffed her and praised her extravagantly and teased her again then he became a trifle uneasy i think she was afraid he had been drinking i think she was shaken with horror when she found him tipsy and bewildered and terrified when she saw him drunk they had no children i noticed he ceased to joke when she became a little constrained he glanced at her often and looked somewhat pitiful when she avoided his looks and he grew uneasy and i could see he wanted to go away  i had better go with you to see the vicar then he said to me and we left the room whose windows looked south over the meadows the room where dainty little watercolours and beautiful bits of embroidery and empty flower vases and two dirty novels from the town library and the closed piano and the odd cups and the chipped spout of the teapot causing stains on the cloth—all told one story  we went to the joiners and ordered the coffin and the doctor had a glass of whisky on it the graveyard fees were paid and the doctor sealed the engagement with a drop of brandy the vicars port completed the doctors joviality and we went home  this time the disquiet in the little womans dark eyes could not dispel the doctors merriment he rattled away and she nervously twisted her wedding ring he insisted on driving us to the station in spite of our alarm  but you will be quite safe with him said his wife in her caressing highland speech when she shook hands at parting i noticed the hardness of the little palm—and i have always hated an old black alpaca dress  it is such a long way home from the station at eberwich we rode part way in the bus then we walked it is a very long way for my mother when her steps are heavy with trouble  rebecca was out by the rhododendrons looking for us she hurried to us all solicitous and asked mother if she had had tea  but youll do with another cup she said and ran back into the house  she came into the diningroom to take my mothers bonnet and coat she wanted us to talk she was distressed on my mothers behalf she noticed the blackness that lay under her eyes and she fidgeted about unwilling to ask anything yet uneasy and anxious to know  lettie has been home she said  and gone back again asked mother  she only came to change her dress she put the green poplin on she wondered where youd gone  what did you tell her  i said youd just gone out a bit she said she was glad she was as lively as a squirrel  rebecca looked wistfully at my mother at length the latter said  hes dead rebecca i have seen him  now thank god for that—no more need to worry over him  well—he died all alone rebecca—all alone  he died as youve lived said becky with some asperity  but ive had the children ive had the children—we wont tell lettie rebecca  no m rebecca left the room  you and lettie will have the money said mother to me there was a sum of four thousand pounds or so it was left to my mother or in default to lettie and me  well mother—if its ours its yours  there was silence for some minutes then she said you might have had a father——  were thankful we hadnt mother you spared us that  but how can you tell said my mother  i can i replied and i am thankful to you  if ever you feel scorn for one who is near you rising in your throat try and be generous my lad  well—— said i  yes she replied well say no more sometime you must tell lettie—you tell her  i did tell her a week or so afterwards  who knows she asked her face hardening  mother becky and ourselves  nobody else  no  then its a good thing he is out of the way if he was such a nuisance to mother where is she  upstairs  lettie ran to her           chapter v     the scent of blood   the death of the man who was our father changed our lives it was not that we suffered a great grief the chief trouble was the unanswered crying of failure but we were changed in our feelings and in our relations there was a new consciousness a new carefulness  we had lived between the woods and the water all our lives lettie and i and she had sought the bright notes in everything she seemed to hear the water laughing and the leaves tittering and giggling like young girls the aspen fluttered like the draperies of a flirt and the sound of the woodpigeons was almost foolish in its sentimentality  lately however she had noticed again the cruel pitiful crying of a hedgehog caught in a gin and she had noticed the traps for the fierce little murderers traps walled in with a small fence of fir and baited with the guts of a killed rabbit  on an afternoon a short time after our visit to cossethay lettie sat in the window seat the sun clung to her hair and kissed her with passionate splashes of colour brought from the vermilion dying creeper outside the sun loved lettie and was loath to leave her she looked out over nethermere to highclose vague in the september mist had it not been for the scarlet light on her face i should have thought her look was sad and serious she nestled up to the window and leaned her head against the wooden shaft gradually she drooped into sleep then she became wonderfully childish again—it was the girl of seventeen sleeping there with her full pouting lips slightly apart and the breath coming lightly i felt the old feeling of responsibility i must protect her and take care of her  there was a crunch of the gravel it was leslie coming he lifted his hat to her thinking she was looking he had that fine lithe physique suggestive of much animal vigour his person was exceedingly attractive one watched him move about and felt pleasure his face was less pleasing than his person he was not handsome his eyebrows were too light his nose was large and ugly and his forehead though high and fair was without dignity but he had a frank goodnatured expression and a fine wholesome laugh  he wondered why she did not move as he came nearer he saw then he winked at me and came in he tiptoed across the room to look at her the sweet carelessness of her attitude the appealing halfpitiful girlishness of her face touched his responsive heart and he leaned forward and kissed her cheek where already was a crimson stain of sunshine  she roused half out of her sleep with a little petulant oh as an awakened child he sat down behind her and gently drew her head against him looking down at her with a tender soothing smile i thought she was going to fall asleep thus but her eyelids quivered and her eyes beneath them flickered into consciousness  leslie—oh—let me go she exclaimed pushing him away he loosed her and rose looking at her reproachfully she shook her dress and went quickly to the mirror to arrange her hair  you are mean she exclaimed looking very flushed vexed and dishevelled  he laughed indulgently saying you shouldnt go to sleep then and look so pretty who could help  it is not nice she said frowning with irritation  we are not nice—are we i thought we were proud of our unconventionality why shouldnt i kiss you  because it is a question of me not of you alone  dear me you are in a way  mother is coming  is she you had better tell her  mother was very fond of leslie  well sir she said why are you frowning  he broke into a laugh  lettie is scolding me for kissing her when she was playing sleeping beauty  the conceit of the boy to play prince said my mother  oh but it appears i was sadly out of character he said ruefully  lettie laughed and forgave him  well he said looking at her and smiling i came to ask you to go out  it is a lovely afternoon said mother  she glanced at him and said  i feel dreadfully lazy  never mind he replied youll wake up go and put your hat on  he sounded impatient she looked at him  he seemed to be smiling peculiarly  she lowered her eyes and went out of the room  shell come all right he said to himself and to me she likes to play you on a string  she must have heard him when she came in again drawing on her gloves she said quietly  you come as well pat  he swung round and stared at her in angry amazement  i had rather stay and finish this sketch i said feeling uncomfortable  no but do come theres a dear she took the brush from my hand and drew me from my chair the blood flushed into his cheeks he went quietly into the hall and brought my cap  all right he said angrily women like to fancy themselves napoleons  they do dear iron duke they do she mocked  yet theres a waterloo in all their histories he said since she had supplied him with the idea  say peterloo my general say peterloo  ay peterloo he replied with a splendid curl of the lip—easy conquests  he came he saw he conquered lettie recited  are you coming he said getting more angry  when you bid me she replied taking my arm  we went through the wood and through the dishevelled borderland to the high road through the borderland that should have been parklike but which was shaggy with loose grass and yellow molehills ragged with gorse and bramble and briar with wandering old thorntrees and a queer clump of scotch firs  on the highway the leaves were falling and they chattered under our steps the water was mild and blue and the corn stood drowsily in stook  we climbed the hill behind highclose and walked on along the upland looking across towards the hills of arid derbyshire and seeing them not because it was autumn we came in sight of the headstocks of the pit at selsby and of the ugly village standing blank and naked on the brow of the hill  lettie was in very high spirits she laughed and joked continually she picked bunches of hips and stuck them in her dress having got a thorn in her finger from a spray of blackberries she went to leslie to have it squeezed out we were all quite gay as we turned off the high road and went along the bridle path with the woods on our right the high strelley hills shutting in our small valley in front and the fields and the common to the left about half way down the lane we heard the slurr of the scythestone on the scythe lettie went to the hedge to see it was george mowing the oats on the steep hillside where the machine could not go his father was tying up the corn into sheaves  straightening his back mr saxton saw us and called to us to come and help we pushed through a gap in the hedge and went up to him  now then said the father to me take that coat off and to lettie have you brought us a drink no—come that sounds bad going a walk i guess you see what it is to get fat and he pulled a wry face as he bent over to tie the corn he was a man beautifully ruddy and burly in the prime of life  show me ill do some said lettie  nay he answered gently it would scratch your wrists and break your stays hark at my hands—he rubbed them together—like sandpaper  george had his back to us and had not noticed us he continued to mow leslie watched him  thats a fine movement he exclaimed  yes replied the father rising very red in the face from the tying and our george enjoys a bit o mowing it puts you in fine condition when you get over the first stiffness  we moved across to the standing corn the sun being mild george had thrown off his hat and his black hair was moist and twisted into confused halfcurls firmly planted he swung with a beautiful rhythm from the waist on the hip of his belted breeches hung the scythestone his shirt faded almost white was torn just above the belt and showed the muscles of his back playing like lights upon the white sand of a brook there was something exceedingly attractive in the rhythmic body  i spoke to him and he turned round he looked straight at lettie with a flashing betraying smile he was remarkably handsome he tried to say some words of greeting then he bent down and gathered an armful of corn and deliberately bound it up  like him lettie had found nothing to say leslie however remarked  i should think mowing is a nice exercise  it is he replied and continued as leslie picked up the scythe but it will make you sweat and your hands will be sore  leslie tossed his head a little threw off his coat and said briefly  how do you do it without waiting for a reply he proceeded george said nothing but turned to lettie  you are picturesque she said a trifle awkwardly quite fit for an idyll  and you he said  she shrugged her shoulders laughed and turned to pick up a scarlet pimpernel  how do you bind the corn she asked  he took some long straws cleaned them and showed her the way to hold them instead of attending she looked at his hands big hard inflamed by the snaith of the scythe  i dont think i could do it she said  no he replied quietly and watched leslie mowing the latter who was wonderfully ready at everything was doing fairly well but he had not the invincible sweep of the other nor did he make the same crisp crunching music  i bet hell sweat said george  dont you she replied  a bit—but im not dressed up  do you know she said suddenly your arms tempt me to touch them they are such a fine brown colour and they look so hard  he held out one arm to her she hesitated then she swiftly put her finger tips on the smooth brown muscle and drew them along quickly she hid her hand into the folds of her skirt blushing  he laughed a low quiet laugh at once pleasant and startling to hear  i wish i could work here she said looking away at the standing corn and the dim blue woods he followed her look and laughed quietly with indulgent resignation  i do she said emphatically  you feel so fine he said pushing his hand through his open shirt front and gently rubbing the muscles of his side its a pleasure to work or to stand still its a pleasure to yourself—your own physique  she looked at him full at his physical beauty as if he were some great firm bud of life  leslie came up wiping his brow  jove said he i do perspire  george picked up his coat and helped him into it saying  you may take a chill  its a jolly nice form of exercise said he  george who had been feeling one finger tip now took out his penknife and proceeded to dig a thorn from his hand  what a hide you must have said leslie  lettie said nothing but she recoiled slightly  the father glad of an excuse to straighten his back and to chat came to us  youd soon had enough he said laughing to leslie  george startled us with a sudden holloa we turned and saw a rabbit which had burst from the corn go coursing through the hedge dodging and bounding the sheaves the standing corn was a patch along the hillside some fifty paces in length and ten or so in width  i didnt think thered have been any in said the father picking up a short rake and going to the low wall of the corn we all followed  watch said the father if you see the heads of the corn shake  we prowled round the patch of corn  hold look out shouted the father excitedly and immediately after a rabbit broke from the cover  ay—ay—ay was the shout turn him—turn him we set off full pelt the bewildered little brute scared by leslies wild running and crying turned from its course and dodged across the hill threading its terrified course through the maze of lying sheaves spurting on in a painful zigzag now bounding over an untied bundle of corn now swerving from the sound of a shout the little wretch was hard pressed george rushed upon it it darted into some fallen corn but he had seen it and had fallen on it in an instant he was up again and the little creature was dangling from his hand  we returned panting sweating our eyes flashing to the edge of the standing corn i heard lettie calling and turning round saw emily and the two children entering the field as they passed from school  theres another shouted leslie  i saw the oattops quiver here here i yelled the animal leaped out and made for the hedge george and leslie who were on that side dashed off turned him and he coursed back our way i headed him off to the father who swept in pursuit for a short distance but who was too heavy for the work the little beast made towards the gate but this time mollie with her hat in her hand and her hair flying whirled upon him and she and the little fragile lad sent him back again the rabbit was getting tired it dodged the sheaves badly running towards the top hedge i went after it if i could have let myself fall on it i could have caught it but this was impossible to me and i merely prevented its dashing through the hole into safety it raced along the hedge bottom george tore after it as he was upon it it darted into the hedge he fell flat and shot his hand into the gap but it had escaped he lay there panting in great sobs and looking at me with eyes in which excitement and exhaustion struggled like flickering light and darkness when he could speak he said why didnt you fall on top of it  i couldnt said i  we returned again the two children were peering into the thick corn also we thought there was nothing more george began to mow as i walked round i caught sight of a rabbit skulking near the bottom corner of the patch its ears lay pressed against its back i could see the palpitation of the heart under the brown fur and i could see the shining dark eyes looking at me i felt no pity for it but still i could not actually hurt it i beckoned to the father he ran up and aimed a blow with the rake there was a sharp little cry which sent a hot pain through me as if i had been cut but the rabbit ran out and instantly i forgot the cry and gave pursuit fairly feeling my fingers stiffen to choke it it was all lame leslie was upon it in a moment and he almost pulled its head off in his excitement to kill it  i looked up the girls were at the gate just turning away  there are no more said the father  at that instant mary shouted  theres one down this hole  the hole was too small for george to get his hand in so we dug it out with the rake handle the stick went savagely down the hole and there came a squeak  mice said george and as he said it the mother slid out somebody knocked her on the back and the hole was opened out little mice seemed to swarm everywhere it was like killing insects we counted nine little ones lying dead  poor brute said george looking at the mother what a job she must have had rearing that lot he picked her up handled her curiously and with pity then he said well i may as well finish this tonight  his father took another scythe from off the hedge and together they soon laid the proud quivering heads low leslie and i tied up as they mowed and soon all was finished  the beautiful day was flushing to die over in the west the mist was gathering bluer the intense stillness was broken by the rhythmic hum of the engines at the distant coalmine as they drew up the last bantles of men as we walked across the fields the tubes of stubble tinkled like dulcimers the scent of the corn began to rise gently the last cry of the pheasants came from the wood and the little clouds of birds were gone  i carried a scythe and we walked pleasantly weary down the hill towards the farm the children had gone home with the rabbits  when we reached the mill we found the girls just rising from the table emily began to carry away the used pots and to set clean ones for us she merely glanced at us and said her formal greeting lettie picked up a book that lay in the ingle seat and went to the window george dropped into a chair he had flung off his coat and had pushed back his hair he rested his great brown arms on the table and was silent for a moment  running like that he said to me passing his hand over his eyes makes you more tired than a whole days work i dont think i shall do it again  the sports exciting while it lasts said leslie  it does you more harm than the rabbits do us good said mrs saxton  oh i dont know mother drawled her son its a couple of shillings  and a couple of days off your life  what be that he replied taking a piece of bread and butter and biting a large piece from it  pour us a drop of tea he said to emily  i dont know that i shall wait on such brutes she replied relenting and flourishing the teapot  oh said he taking another piece of bread and butter im not all alone in my savageness this time  men are all brutes said lettie hotly without looking up from her book  you can tame us said leslie in mighty good humour  she did not reply george began in that deliberate voice that so annoyed emily  it does make you mad though to touch the fur and not be able to grab him—he laughed quietly  emily moved off in disgust lettie opened her mouth sharply to speak but remained silent  i dont know said leslie when it comes to killing it goes against the stomach  if you can run said george you should be able to run to death when your bloods up you dont hang half way  i think a man is horrible said lettie who can tear the head off a little mite of a thing like a rabbit after running it in torture over a field  when he is nothing but a barbarian to begin with—— said emily  if you began to run yourself—youd be the same said george  why women are cruel enough said leslie with a glance at lettie yes he continued theyre cruel enough in their way—another look and a comical little smile  well said george whats the good finicking if you feel like doing a thing—youd better do it  unless you havent courage said emily bitingly  he looked up at her with dark eyes suddenly full of anger  but said lettie—she could not hold herself from asking dont you think its brutal now—that you do think—isnt it degrading and mean to run the poor little things down  perhaps it is he replied but it wasnt an hour ago  you have no feeling she said bitterly  he laughed deprecatingly but said nothing  we finished tea in silence lettie reading emily moving about the house george got up and went out at the end a moment or two after we heard him across the yard with the milkbuckets singing the ash grove  he doesnt care a scrap for anything said emily with accumulated bitterness lettie looked out of the window across the yard thinking she looked very glum  after a while we went out also before the light faded altogether from the pond emily took us into the lower garden to get some ripe plums the old garden was very low the soil was black the cornbind and goosegrass were clutching at the ancient gooseberry bushes which sprawled by the paths the garden was not very productive save of weeds and perhaps tremendous lank artichokes or swollen marrows but at the bottom where the end of the farm buildings rose high and grey there was a plumtree which had been crucified to the wall and which had broken away and leaned forward from bondage now under the boughs were hidden great mistbloomed crimson treasures splendid globes i shook the old ragged trunk green with even the fresh gum dulled over and the treasures fell heavily thudding down among the immense rhubarb leaves below the girls laughed and we divided the spoil and turned back to the yard we went down to the edge of the garden which skirted the bottom pond a pool chained in a heavy growth of weeds it was moving with rats the father had said the rushes were thick below us opposite the great bank fronted us with orchard trees climbing it like a hillside the lower pond received the overflow from the upper by a tunnel from the deep black sluice  two rats ran into the black culvert at our approach we sat on some piled mossy stones to watch the rats came out again ran a little way stopped ran again listened were reassured and slid about freely dragging their long naked tails soon six or seven grey beasts were playing round the mouth of the culvert in the gloom they sat and wiped their sharp faces stroking their whiskers then one would give a little rush and a little squirm of excitement and would jump vertically into the air alighting on four feet running sliding into the black shadow one dropped with an ugly plop into the water and swam toward us the hoary imp his sharp snout and his wicked little eyes moving at us lettie shuddered i threw a stone into the dead pool and frightened them all but we had frightened ourselves more so we hurried away and stamped our feet in relief on the free pavement of the yard  leslie was looking for us he had been inspecting the yard and the stock under mr saxtons supervision  were you running away from me he asked  no she replied i have been to fetch you a plum look and she showed him two in a leaf  they are too pretty to eat said he  you have not tasted yet she laughed  come he said offering her his arm let us go up to the water she took his arm  it was a splendid evening with the light all thick and yellow lying on the smooth pond lettie made him lift her on to a leaning bough of willow he sat with his head resting against her skirts emily and i moved on we heard him murmur something and her voice reply gently caressingly  no—let us be still—it is all so still—i love it best of all now  emily and i talked sitting at the base of the alders a little way on after an excitement and in the evening especially in autumn one is inclined to be sad and sentimental we had forgotten that the darkness was weaving i heard in the little distance leslies voice begin to murmur like a flying beetle that comes not too near then away down in the yard george began singing the old song i sowed the seeds of love  this interrupted the flight of leslies voice and as the singing came nearer the hum of low words ceased we went forward to meet george leslie sat up clasping his knees and did not speak george came near saying  the moon is going to rise  let me get down said lettie lifting her hands to him to help her he mistaking her wish put his hands under her arms and set her gently down as one would a child leslie got up quickly and seemed to hold himself separate resenting the intrusion  i thought you were all four together said george quietly lettie turned quickly at the apology  so we were so we are—five now is it there the moon will rise  yes—i like to see it come over the wood it lifts slowly up to stare at you i always think it wants to know something and i always think i have something to answer only i dont know what it is said emily  where the sky was pale in the east over the rim of wood came the forehead of the yellow moon we stood and watched in silence then as the great disc nearly full lifted and looked straight upon us we were washed off our feet in a vague sea of moonlight we stood with the light like water on our faces lettie was glad a little bit exalted emily was passionately troubled her lips were parted almost beseeching leslie was frowning oblivious and george was thinking and the terrible immense moonbeams braided through his feeling at length leslie said softly mistakenly  come along dear—and he took her arm  she let him lead her along the bank of the pond and across the plank over the sluice  do you know she said as we were carefully descending the steep bank of the orchard i feel as if i wanted to laugh or dance—something rather outrageous  surely not like that now leslie replied in a low voice feeling really hurt  i do though i will race you to the bottom  no no dear he held her back when he came to the wicket leading on to the front lawns he said something to her softly as he held the gate  i think he wanted to utter his half finished proposal and so bind her  she broke free and observing the long lawn which lay in grey shadow between the eastern and western glows she cried  polka—a polka—one can dance a polka when the grass is smooth and short—even if there are some fallen leaves yes yes—how jolly  she held out her hand to leslie but it was too great a shock to his mood so she called to me and there was a shade of anxiety in her voice lest after all she should be caught in the toils of the nights sentiment  pat—youll dance with me—leslie hates a polka i danced with her i do not know the time when i could not polka—it seems innate in ones feet to dance that dance we went flying round hissing through the dead leaves the night the low hung yellow moon the pallor of the west the blue cloud of evening overhead went round and through the fantastic branches of the old laburnum spinning a little madness you cannot tire lettie her feet are wings that beat the air when at last i stayed her she laughed as fresh as ever as she bound her hair  there she said to leslie in tones of extreme satisfaction that was lovely do you come and dance now  not a polka said he sadly feeling the poetry in his heart insulted by the jigging measure  but one cannot dance anything else on wet grass and through shuffling dead leaves you george  emily says i jump he replied  come on—come on—and in a moment they were bounding across the grass after a few steps she fell in with him and they spun round the grass it was true he leaped sprang with large strides carrying her with him it was a tremendous irresistible dancing emily and i must join making an inner ring now and again there was a sense of something white flying near and wild rustle of draperies and a swish of disturbed leaves as they whirled past us long after we were tired they danced on  at the end he looked big erect nerved with triumph and she was exhilarated like a bacchante  have you finished leslie asked  she knew she was safe from his question that day  yes she panted you should have danced give me my hat please do i look very disgraceful  he took her hat and gave it to her  disgraceful he repeated  oh you are solemn tonight what is it  yes what is it he repeated ironically  it must be the moon now is my hat straight tell me now—youre not looking then put it level now then why your hands are quite cold and mine so hot i feel so impish and she laughed  there—now im ready do you notice those little chrysanthemums trying to smell sadly when the old moon is laughing and winking through those boughs what business have they with their sadness she took a handful of petals and flung them into the air there—if they sigh they ask for sorrow—i like things to wink and look wild           chapter vi     the education of george   as i have said strelley mill lies at the north end of the long nethermere valley on the northern slopes lay its pasture and arable lands the shaggy common now closed and part of the estate covered the western slope and the cultivated land was bounded on the east by the sharp dip of the brook course a thread of woodland broadening into a spinney and ending at the upper pond beyond this on the east rose the sharp wild grassy hillside scattered with old trees ruinous with the gaunt ragged bones of old hedgerows grown into thorn trees along the rim of the hills beginning in the northwest were dark woodlands which swept round east and south till they raced down in riot to the very edge of southern nethermere surrounding our house from the eastern hill crest looking straight across you could see the spire of selsby church and a few roofs and the headstocks of the pit  so on three sides the farm was skirted by woods the dens of rabbits and the common held another warren  now the squire of the estate head of an ancient once even famous but now decayed house loved his rabbits unlike the family fortunes the family tree flourished amazingly sherwood could show nothing comparable its ramifications were stupendous it was more like a banyan than a british oak how was the good squire to nourish himself and his lady his name his tradition and his thirteen lusty branches on his meagre estates an evil fortune discovered to him that he could sell each of his rabbits those bits of furry vermin for a shilling or thereabouts in nottingham since which time the noble family subsisted by rabbits  farms were gnawed away corn and sweet grass departed from the face of the hills cattle grew lean unable to eat the defiled herbage then the farm became the home of a keeper and the country was silent with no sound of cattle no clink of horses no barking of lusty dogs  but the squire loved his rabbits he defended them against the snares of the despairing farmer protected them with gun and notices to quit how he glowed with thankfulness as he saw the dishevelled hillside heave when the gnawing hosts moved on  are they not quails and manna said he to his sporting guest early one monday morning as the high meadow broke into life at the sound of his gun quails and manna—in this wilderness  they are by jove assented the sporting guest as he took another gun while the saturnine keeper smiled grimly  meanwhile strelley mill began to suffer under this gangrene it was the outpost in the wilderness it was an understood thing that none of the squires tenants had a gun  well said the squire to mr saxton you have the land for next to nothing—next to nothing—at a rent really absurd surely the little that the rabbits eat——  its not a little—come and look for yourself replied the farmer the squire made a gesture of impatience  what do you want he inquired  will you wire me off was the repeated request  wire is—what does halkett say—so much per yard—and it would come to—what did halkett tell me now—but a large sum no i cant do it  well i cant live like this  have another glass of whisky yes yes i want another glass myself and i cant drink alone—so if i am to enjoy my glass—thats it now surely you exaggerate a little its not so bad  i cant go on like it im sure  well well see about compensation—well see ill have a talk with halkett and ill come down and have a look at you we all find a pinch somewhere—its nothing but humanitys heritage      ——   i was born in september and love it best of all the months there is no heat no hurry no thirst and weariness in corn harvest as there is in the hay if the season is late as is usual with us then midseptember sees the corn still standing in stook the mornings come slowly the earth is like a woman married and fading she does not leap up with a laugh for the first fresh kiss of dawn but slowly quietly unexpectantly lies watching the waking of each new day the blue mist like memory in the eyes of a neglected wife never goes from the wooded hill and only at noon creeps from the near hedges there is no bird to put a song in the throat of morning only the crows voice speaks during the day perhaps there is the regular breathing hush of the scythe—even the fretful jar of the mowing machine but next day in the morning all is still again the lying corn is wet and when you have bound it and lift the heavy sheaf to make the stook the tresses of oats wreathe round each other and droop mournfully  as i worked with my friend through the still mornings we talked endlessly i would give him the gist of what i knew of chemistry and botany and psychology day after day i told him what the professors had told me of life of sex and its origins of schopenhauer and william james we had been friends for years and he was accustomed to my talk but this autumn fruited the first crop of intimacy between us i talked a great deal of poetry to him and of rudimentary metaphysics he was very good stuff he had hardly a single dogma save that of pleasing himself religion was nothing to him so he heard all i had to say with an open mind and understood the drift of things very rapidly and quickly made these ideas part of himself  we tramped down to dinner with only the clinging warmth of the sunshine for a coat in this still enfolding weather a quiet companionship is very grateful autumn creeps through everything the little damsons in the pudding taste of september and are fragrant with memory the voices of those at table are softer and more reminiscent than at haytime  afternoon is all warm and golden oat sheaves are lighter they whisper to each other as they freely embrace the long stout stubble tinkles as the foot brushes over it the scent of the straw is sweet when the poor bleached sheaves are lifted out of the hedge a spray of nodding wild raspberries is disclosed with belated berries ready to drop among the damp grass lush blackberries may be discovered then one notices that the last bell hangs from the ragged spire of foxglove the talk is of people an odd book of ones hopes—and the future of canada where work is strenuous but not life where the plains are wide and one is not lapped in a soft valley like an apple that falls in a secluded orchard the mist steals over the face of the warm afternoon the tyingup is all finished and it only remains to rear up the fallen bundles into shocks the sun sinks into a golden glow in the west the gold turns to red the red darkens like a fire burning low the sun disappears behind the bank of milky mist purple like the pale bloom on blue plums and we put on our coats and go home      ——   in the evening when the milking was finished and all the things fed then we went out to look at the snares we wandered on across the stream and up the wild hillside our feet rattled through black patches of devilsbit scabius we skirted a swim of thistledown which glistened when the moon touched it we stumbled on through wet coarse grass over soft molehills and black rabbitholes the hills and woods cast shadows the pools of mist in the valleys gathered the moonbeams in cold shivery light  we came to an old farm that stood on the level brow of the hill the woods swept away from it leaving a great clearing of what was once cultivated land the handsome chimneys of the house silhouetted against a light sky drew my admiration i noticed that there was no light or glow in any window though the house had only the width of one room and though the night was only at eight oclock we looked at the long impressive front several of the windows had been bricked in giving a pitiful impression of blindness the places where the plaster had fallen off the walls showed blacker in the shadow we pushed open the gate and as we walked down the path weeds and dead plants brushed our ankles we looked in at a window the room was lighted also by a window from the other side through which the moonlight streamed on to the flagged floor dirty littered with paper and wisps of straw the hearth lay in the light with all its distress of grey ashes and piled cinders of burnt paper and a childs headless doll charred and pitiful on the borderline of shadow lay a round fur cap—a gamekeepers cap i blamed the moonlight for entering the desolate room the darkness alone was decent and reticent i hated the little roses on the illuminated piece of wallpaper i hated that fireside  with farmers instinct george turned to the outhouse the cowyard startled me it was a forest of the tallest nettles i have ever seen—nettles far taller than my six feet the air was soddened with the dank scent of nettles as i followed george along the obscure brick path i felt my flesh creep but the buildings when we entered them were in splendid condition they had been restored within a small number of years they were welltimbered neat and cosy here and there we saw feathers bits of animal wreckage even the remnants of a cat which we hastily examined by the light of a match as we entered the stable there was an ugly noise and three great rats half rushed at us and threatened us with their vicious teeth i shuddered and hurried back stumbling over a bucket rotten with rust and so filled with weeds that i thought it part of the jungle there was a silence made horrible by the faint noises that rats and flying bats give out the place was bare of any vestige of corn or straw or hay only choked with a growth of abnormal weeds when i found myself free in the orchard i could not stop shivering there were no apples to be seen overhead between us and the clear sky either the birds had caused them to fall when the rabbits had devoured them or someone had gathered the crop  this said george bitterly is what the mill will come to  after your time i said  my time—my time i shall never have a time and i shouldnt be surprised if fathers time isnt short—with rabbits and one thing and another as it is we depend on the milkround and on the carting which i do for the council you cant call it farming were a miserable mixture of farmer milkman greengrocer and carting contractor its a shabby business  you have to live i retorted  yes—but its rotten and father wont move—and he wont change his methods  well—what about you  me what should i change for—im comfortable at home as for my future it can look after itself so long as nobody depends on me  laissez faire said i smiling  this is no laissez faire he replied glancing round this is pulling the nipple out of your lips and letting the milk run away sour look there  through the thin veil of moonlit mist that slid over the hillside we could see an army of rabbits bunched up or hopping a few paces forward feeding  we set off at a swinging pace down the hill scattering the hosts as we approached the fence that bounded the mill fields he exclaimed hullo—and hurried forward i followed him and observed the dark figure of a man rise from the hedge it was a gamekeeper he pretended to be examining his gun as we came up he greeted us with a calm goodevenin  george replied by investigating the little gap in the hedge  ill trouble you for that snare he said  will yer answered annable a broad burly blackfaced fellow an i should like ter know what youre doin on th wrong side th edge  you can see what were doing—hand over my snare—and the rabbit said george angrily  what rabbit said annable turning sarcastically to me  you know well enough—an you can hand it over—or—— george replied  or what spit it out the sound wont kill me—the man grinned with contempt  hand over here said george stepping up to the man in a rage  now dont said the keeper standing stock still and looking unmovedly at the proximity of george  youd better get off home—both you an im youll get neither snare nor rabbit—see  we will see said george and he made a sudden move to get hold of the mans coat instantly he went staggering back with a heavy blow under the left ear  damn brute i ejaculated bruising my knuckles against the fellows jaw then i too found myself sitting dazedly on the grass watching the great skirts of his velveteens flinging round him as if he had been a demon as he strode away i got up pressing my chest where i had been struck george was lying in the hedgebottom i turned him over and rubbed his temples and shook the drenched grass on his face he opened his eyes and looked at me dazed then he drew his breath quickly and put his hand to his head  he—he nearly stunned me he said  the devil i answered  i wasnt ready  no  did he knock me down  ay—me too  he was silent for some time sitting limply then he pressed his hand against the back of his head saying my head does sing he tried to get up but failed good god—being knocked into this state by a damned keeper  come on i said lets see if we cant get indoors  no he said quickly we neednt tell them—dont let them know  i sat thinking of the pain in my own chest and wishing i could remember hearing annables jaw smash and wishing that my knuckles were more bruised than they were—though that was bad enough i got up and helped george to rise he swayed almost pulling me over but in a while he could walk unevenly  am i he said covered with clay and stuff  not much i replied troubled by the shame and confusion with which he spoke  get it off he said standing still to be cleaned  i did my best then we walked about the fields for a time gloomy silent and sore  suddenly as we went by the pondside we were startled by great swishing black shadows that swept just above our heads the swans were flying up for shelter now that a cold wind had begun to fret nethermere they swung down on to the glassy millpond shaking the moonlight in flecks across the deep shadows the night rang with the clacking of their wings on the water the stillness and calm were broken the moonlight was furrowed and scattered and broken the swans as they sailed into shadow were dim haunting spectres the wind found us shivering  dont—you wont say anything he asked as i was leaving him  no  nothing at all—not to anybody  no  goodnight      ——   about the end of september our countryside was alarmed by the harrying of sheep by strange dogs one morning the squire going the round of his fields as was his custom to his grief and horror found two of his sheep torn and dead in the hedgebottom and the rest huddled in a corner swaying about in terror smeared with blood the squire did not recover his spirits for days  there was a report of two grey wolvish dogs the squires keeper had heard yelping in the fields of dr collins of the abbey about dawn three sheep lay soaked in blood when the labourer went to tend the flocks  then the farmers took alarm lord of the white house farm intended to put his sheep in pen with his dogs in charge it was saturday however and the lads ran off to the little travelling theatre that had halted at westwold while they sat openmouthed in the theatre gloriously nicknamed the bloodtub watching heroes die with much writhing and heaving and struggling up to say a word and collapsing without having said it six of their silly sheep were slaughtered in the field at every house it was enquired of the dog nowhere had one been loose  mr saxton had some thirty sheep on the common george determined that the easiest thing was for him to sleep out with them he built a shelter of hurdles interlaced with brushwood and in the sunny afternoon we collected piles of bracken browning to the ruddy winterbrown now he slept there for a week but that week aged his mother like a year she was out in the cold morning twilight watching with her apron over her head for his approach she did not rest with the thought of him out on the common  therefore on saturday night he brought down his rugs and took up gyp to watch in his stead for some time we sat looking at the stars over the dark hills now and then a sheep coughed or a rabbit rustled beneath the brambles and gyp whined the mist crept over the gorsebushes and the webs on the brambles were white—the devil throws his net over the blackberries as soon as septembers back is turned they say  i saw two fellows go by with bags and nets said george as we sat looking out of his little shelter  poachers said i did you speak to them  no—they didnt see me i was dropping asleep when a rabbit rushed under the blanket all of a shiver and a whippet dog after it i gave the whippet a punch in the neck and he yelped off the rabbit stopped with me quite a long time—then it went  how did you feel  i didnt care i dont care much what happens just now father could get along without me and mother has the children i think i shall emigrate  why didnt you before  oh i dont know there are a lot of little comforts and interests at home that one would miss besides you feel somebody in your own countryside and youre nothing in a foreign part i expect  but youre going  what is there to stop here for the valley is all running wild and unprofitable youve no freedom for thinking of what the other folks think of you and everything round you keeps the same and so you cant change yourself—because everything you look at brings up the same old feeling and stops you from feeling fresh things and what is there thats worth anything—whats worth having in my life  i thought said i your comfort was worth having  he sat still and did not answer  whats shaken you out of your nest i asked  i dont know ive not felt the same since that row with annable and lettie said to me here you cant live as you like—in any way or circumstance youre like a bit out of those coloured marble mosaics in the hall you have to fit in your own set fit into your own pattern because youre put there from the first but you dont want to be like a fixed bit of a mosaic—you want to fuse into life and melt and mix with the rest of folk to have some things burned out of you—— she was downright serious  well you need not believe her when did you see her  she came down on wednesday when i was getting the apples in the morning she climbed a tree with me and there was a wind that was why i was getting all the apples and it rocked us me right up at the top she sitting half way down holding the basket i asked her didnt she think that free kind of life was the best and that was how she answered me  you should have contradicted her  it seemed true i never thought of it being wrong in fact  come—that sounds bad  no—i thought she looked down on us—on our way of life i thought she meant i was like a toad in a hole  you should have shown her different  how could i when i could see no different  it strikes me youre in love  he laughed at the idea saying no but it is rotten to find that there isnt a single thing you have to be proud of  this is a new tune for you  he pulled the grass moodily  and when do you think of going  oh—i dont know—ive said nothing to mother not yet—at any rate not till spring  not till something has happened said i  what he asked  something decisive  i dont know what can happen—unless the squire turns us out  no i said  he did not speak  you should make things happen said i  dont make me feel a worse fool cyril he replied despairingly  gyp whined and jumped tugging her chain to follow us the grey blurs among the blackness of the bushes were resting sheep a chill dim mist crept along the ground  but for all that cyril he said to have her laugh at you across the table to hear her sing as she moved about before you are washed at night when the fires warm and youre tired to have her sit by you on the hearth seat close and soft     in spain i said in spain  he took no notice but turned suddenly laughing  do you know when i was stooking up lifting the sheaves it felt like having your arm round a girl it was quite a sudden sensation  youd better take care said i youll mesh yourself in the silk of dreams and then——  he laughed not having heard my words  the time seems to go like lightning—thinking he confessed—i seem to sweep the mornings up in a handful  oh lord said i why dont you scheme forgetting what you want instead of dreaming fulfilments  well he replied if it was a fine dream wouldnt you want to go on dreaming and with that he finished and i went home  i sat at my window looking out trying to get things straight mist rose and wreathed round nethermere like ghosts meeting and embracing sadly i thought of the time when my friend should not follow the harrow on our own snug valley side and when letties room next mine should be closed to hide its emptiness not its joy my heart clung passionately to the hollow which held us all how could i bear that it should be desolate i wondered what lettie would do  in the morning i was up early when daybreak came with a shiver through the woods i went out while the moon still shone sickly in the west the world shrank from the morning it was then that the last of the summer things died the wood was dark—and smelt damp and heavy with autumn on the paths the leaves lay clogged  as i came near the farm i heard the yelling of dogs running i reached the common and saw the sheep huddled and scattered in groups something leaped round them george burst into sight pursuing directly there was the bang bang of a gun i picked up a heavy piece of sandstone and ran forwards three sheep scattered wildly before me in the dim light i saw their grey shadows move among the gorse bushes then a dog leaped and i flung my stone with all my might i hit there came a highpitched howling yelp of pain i saw the brute make off and went after him dodging the prickly bushes leaping the trailing brambles the gunshots rang out again and i heard the men shouting with excitement my dog was out of sight but i followed still slanting down the hill in a field ahead i saw someone running leaping the low hedge i pursued and overtook emily who was hurrying as fast as she could through the wet grass there was another gunshot and great shouting emily glanced round saw me and started  its gone to the quarries she panted we walked on without saying a word skirting the spinney we followed the brook course and came at last to the quarry fence the old excavations were filled now with trees the steep walls twenty feet deep in places were packed with loose stones and trailed with hanging brambles we climbed down the steep bank of the brook and entered the quarries by the bed of the stream under the groves of ash and oak a pale primrose still lingered glimmering wanly beside the hidden water emily found a smear of blood on a beautiful trail of yellow convolvulus we followed the tracks on to the open where the brook flowed on the hard rock bed and the stony floor of the quarry was only a tangle of gorse and bramble and honeysuckle  take a good stone said i and we pressed on where the grove in the great excavation darkened again and the brook slid secretly under the arms of the bushes and the hair of the long grass we beat the cover almost to the road i thought the brute had escaped and i pulled a bunch of mountainash berries and stood tapping them against my knee i was startled by a snarl and a little scream running forward i came upon one of the old horseshoe lime kilns that stood at the head of the quarry there in the mouth of one of the kilns emily was kneeling on the dog her hands buried in the hair of its throat pushing back its head the little jerks of the brutes body were the spasms of death already the eyes were turning inward and the upper lip was drawn from the teeth by pain  good lord emily but he is dead exclaimed  has he hurt you i drew her away she shuddered violently and seemed to feel a horror of herself  no—no she said looking at herself with blood all on her skirt where she had knelt on the wound which i had given the dog and pressed the broken rib into the chest there was a trickle of blood on her arm  did he bite you i asked anxious  no—oh no—i just peeped in and he jumped but he had no strength and i hit him back with my stone and i lost my balance and fell on him  let me wash your arm  oh she exclaimed isnt it horrible oh i think it is so awful  what said i busy bathing her arm in the cold water of the brook  this—this whole brutal affair  it ought to be cauterised said i looking at a score on her arm from the dogs tooth  that scratch—thats nothing can you get that off my skirt—i feel hateful to myself  i washed her skirt with my handkerchief as well as i could saying  let me just sear it for you we can go to the kennels do—you ought—i dont feel safe otherwise  really she said glancing up at me a smile coming into her fine dark eyes  yes—come along  ha ha she laughed you look so serious  i took her arm and drew her away she linked her arm in mine and leaned on me  it is just like lorna doone she said as if she enjoyed it  but you will let me do it said i referring to the cauterising  you make me but i shall feel—ugh i darent think of it get me some of those berries  i plucked a few bunches of guelderrose fruits transparent ruby berries she stroked them softly against her lips and cheek caressing them then she murmured to herself  i have always wanted to put red berries in my hair  the shawl she had been wearing was thrown across her shoulders and her head was bare and her black hair soft and short and ecstatic tumbled wildly into loose light curls she thrust the stalks of the berries under her combs her hair was not heavy or long enough to have held them then with the ruby bunches glowing through the black mist of curls she looked up at me brightly with wide eyes i looked at her and felt the smile winning into her eyes then i turned and dragged a trail of goldenleaved convolvulus from the hedge and i twisted it into a coronet for her  there said i youre crowned  she put back her head and the low laughter shook in her throat  what she asked putting all the courage and recklessness she had into the question and in her soul trembling  not chloë not bacchante you have always got your soul in your eyes such an earnest troublesome soul  the laughter faded at once and her great seriousness looked out again at me pleading  you are like burnejones damsels troublesome shadows are always crowding across your eyes and you cherish them you think the flesh of the apple is nothing nothing you only care for the eternal pips why dont you snatch your apple and eat it and throw the core away  she looked at me sadly not understanding but believing that i in my wisdom spoke truth as she always believed when i lost her in a maze of words she stooped down and the chaplet fell from her hair and only one bunch of berries remained the ground around us was strewn with the fourlipped burrs of beechnuts and the quaint little nutpyramids were scattered among the ruddy fallen leaves emily gathered a few nuts  i love beechnuts she said but they make me long for my childhood again till i could almost cry out to go out for beechnuts before breakfast to thread them for necklaces before supper—to be the envy of the others at school next day there was as much pleasure in a beech necklace then as there is in the whole autumn now—and no sadness there are no more unmixed joys after you have grown up she kept her face to the ground as she spoke and she continued to gather the fruits  do you find any with nuts in i asked  not many—here—here are two three you have them no—i dont care about them  i stripped one of its horny brown coat and gave it to her she opened her mouth slightly to take it looking up into my eyes some people instead of bringing with them clouds of glory trail clouds of sorrow they are born with the gift of sorrow sorrows they proclaim alone are real the veiled grey angels of sorrow work out slowly the beautiful shapes sorrow is beauty and the supreme blessedness you read it in their eyes and in the tones of their voices emily had the gift of sorrow it fascinated me but it drove me to rebellion  we followed the soft smoothbitten turf road under the old beeches the hillside fell away dishevelled with thistles and coarse grass soon we were in sight of the kennels the red old kennels which had been the scene of so much animation in the time of lord byron they were empty now overgrown with weeds the barred windows of the cottages were grey with dust there was no need now to protect the windows from cattle dog or man one of the three houses was inhabited clear water trickled through a wooden runnel into a great stone trough outside near the door  come here said i to emily let me fasten the back of your dress  is it undone she asked looking quickly over her shoulder and blushing  as i was engaged in my task a girl came out of the cottage with a black kettle and a teacup she was so surprised to see me thus occupied that she forgot her own duty and stood openmouthed  sr ann sr ann called a voice from inside are ter goin ter come in an shut that door  sarah ann hastily poured a few cupfuls of water into the kettle then she put down both utensils and stood holding her bare arms to warm them her chief garment consisted of a skirt with grey bodice and red flannel skirt very much torn her black hair hung in wild tails on to her shoulders  we must go in here said i approaching the girl she however hastily seized the kettle and ran indoors with an oh mother  a woman came to the door one breast was bare and hung over her blouse which like a dressingjacket fell loose over her skirt her fading redbrown hair was all frowsy from the bed in the folds of her skirt clung a swarthy urchin with a shockingly short shirt he stared at us with big black eyes the only portion of his face undecorated with egg and jam the womans blue eyes questioned us languidly i told her our errand  come in—come in she said but dunna look at th ouse th childers not been long up go in billy wi nowt on  we entered taking the forgotten kettle lid the kitchen was large but scantily furnished save indeed for children the eldest a girl of twelve or so was standing toasting a piece of bacon with one hand and holding back her nightdress in the other as the toast hand got scorched she transferred the bacon to the other gave the hot fingers a lick to cool them and then held back her nightdress again her auburn hair hung in heavy coils down her gown a boy sat on the steel fender catching the dropping fat on a piece of bread one two three four five six drops and he quickly bit off the tasty corner and resumed the task with the other hand when we entered he tried to draw his shirt over his knees which caused the fat to fall wasted a fat baby evidently laid down from the breast lay kicking on the squab purple in the face while another lad was pushing bread and butter into its mouth the mother swept to the sofa poked out the bread and butter pushed her finger into the babys throat lifted the child up punched its back and was highly relieved when it began to yell then she administered a few sound spanks to the naked buttocks of the crammer he began to howl but stopped suddenly on seeing us laughing on the sackcloth which served as hearth rug sat a beautiful child washing the face of a wooden doll with tea and wiping it on her nightgown at the table an infant in a high chair sat sucking a piece of bacon till the grease ran down his swarthy arms oozing through his fingers an old lad stood in the big armchair whose back was hung with a calfskin and was industriously pouring the dregs of the teacups into a basin of milk the mother whisked away the milk and made a rush for the urchin the baby hanging over her arm the while  i could half kill thee she said but he had slid under the table—and sat serenely unconcerned  could you—i asked when the mother had put her bonny baby again to her breast—could you lend me a knitting needle  our sr ann wheers thy knittin needles asked the woman wincing at the same time and putting her hand to the mouth of the sucking child catching my eye she said  you wouldnt credit how he bites es nobbut two teeth but they like six needles she drew her brows together and pursed her lips saying to the child naughty lad naughty lad tha shanna hae it no not if ter bites thy mother like that  the family interest was now divided between us and the private concerns in process when we entered—save however that the bacon sucker had sucked on stolidly immovable all the time  our sam wheers my knittin thas ad it cried sr ann after a little search  a e na replied sam from under the table  yes tha as said the mother giving a blind prod under the table with her foot  a e na then persisted sam  the mother suggested various possible places of discovery and at last the knitting was found at the back of the table drawer among forks and old wooden skewers  i an ter tell yer wheer ivrythink is said the mother in mild reproach sr ann however gave no heed to her parent her heart was torn for her knitting the fruit of her labours it was a red woollen cuff for the winter a corkscrew was bored through the web and the ball of red wool was bristling with skewers  its a thee our sam she wailed i know its a thee an thy a b c  samuel under the table croaked out in a voice of fierce monotony     p is for porkypine whose bristles so strong    kill the bold lion by pricking is tongue  the mother began to shake with quiet laughter  his father learnt him that—made it all up she whispered proudly to us—and to him  tell us what b is sam  shonna grunted sam  go on theres a duckie an ill ma e a treacle puddin  today asked sr ann eagerly  go on sam my duck persisted the mother  tha as na got no treacle said sam conclusively  the needle was in the fire the children stood about watching  will you do it yourself i asked emily  i she exclaimed with wide eyes of astonishment and she shook her head emphatically  then i must i took out the needle holding it in my handkerchief i took her hand and examined the wound but when she saw the hot glow of the needle she snatched away her hand and looked into my eyes laughing in a halfhysterical fear and shame i was very serious very insistent she yielded me her hand again biting her lips in imagination of the pain and looking at me while my eyes were looking into hers she had courage when i was forced to pay attention to my cauterising she glanced down and with a sharp ah ending in a little laugh she put her hands behind her and looked again up at me with wide brown eyes all quivering with apprehension and a little shame and a laughter that held much pleading  one of the children began to cry  it is no good said i throwing the fast cooling needle on to the hearth  i gave the girls all the pennies i had—then i offered sam who had crept out of the shelter of the table a sixpence  shonna ae that he said turning from the small coin  well—i have no more pennies so nothing will be your share  i gave the other boy a rickety knife i had in my pocket sam looked fiercely at me eager for revenge he picked up the porkypine quill by the hot end he dropped it with a shout of rage and seizing a cup off the table flung it at the fortunate jack it smashed against the fireplace the mother grabbed at sam but he was gone a girl a little girl wailed oh thats my rosey mug—my rosey mug we fled from the scene of confusion emily had hardly noticed it her thoughts were of herself and of me  i am an awful coward said she humbly  but i cant help it—— she looked beseechingly  never mind said i  all my flesh seems to jump from it you dont know how i feel  well—never mind  i couldnt help it not for my life  i wonder said i if anything could possibly disturb that young baconsucker he didnt even look round at the smash  no said she biting the tip of her finger moodily  further conversation was interrupted by howls from the rear looking round we saw sam careering after us over the closebitten turf howling scorn and derision at us rabbittail rabbittail he cried his bare little legs twinkling and his little shirt fluttering in the cold morning air fortunately at last he trod on a thistle or a thorn for when we looked round again to see why he was silent he was capering on one leg holding his wounded foot in his hands           chapter vii     lettie pulls down the small gold grapes   during the falling of the leaves lettie was very wilful she uttered many banalities concerning men and love and marriage she taunted leslie and thwarted his wishes at last he stayed away from her she had been several times down to the mill but because she fancied they were very familiar receiving her on to their rough plane like one of themselves she stayed away since the death of our father she had been restless since inheriting her little fortune she had become proud scornful difficult to please difficult to please in every circumstance she who had always been so rippling in thoughtless life sat down in the window sill to think and her strong teeth bit at her handkerchief till it was torn in holes she would say nothing to me she read all things that dealt with modern women  one afternoon lettie walked over to eberwich leslie had not been to see us for a fortnight it was a grey dree afternoon the wind drifted a clammy fog across the hills and the roads were black and deep with mud the trees in the wood slouched sulkily it was a day to be shut out and ignored if possible i heaped up the fire and went to draw the curtains and make perfect the room then i saw lettie coming along the path quickly very erect when she came in her colour was high  tea not laid she said briefly  rebecca has just brought in the lamp said i  lettie took off her coat and furs and flung them on the couch she went to the mirror lifted her hair all curled by the fog and stared haughtily at herself then she swung round looked at the bare table and rang the bell  it was so rare a thing for us to ring the bell from the diningroom that rebecca went first to the outer door then she came in the room saying  did you ring  i thought tea would have been ready said lettie coldly rebecca looked at me and at her and replied  it is but halfpast four i can bring it in  mother came down hearing the clink of the teacups  well she said to lettie who was unlacing her boots and did you find it a pleasant walk  except for the mud was the reply  ah i guess you wished you had stayed at home what a state for your boots—and your skirts too i know here let me take them into the kitchen  let rebecca take them said lettie—but mother was out of the room  when mother had poured out the tea we sat silently at table it was on the tip of our tongues to ask lettie what ailed her but we were experienced and we refrained after a while she said  do you know i met leslie tempest  oh said mother tentatively did he come along with you  he did not look at me  oh exclaimed mother and it was speaking volumes then after a moment she resumed  perhaps he did not see you  or was it a stony britisher i asked  he saw me declared lettie or he wouldnt have made such a babyish show of being delighted with margaret raymond  it may have been no show—he still may not have seen you  i felt at once that he had i could see his animation was extravagant he need not have troubled himself i was not going to run after him  you seem very cross said i  indeed i am not but he knew i had to walk all this way home and he could take up margaret who has only half the distance  was he driving  in the dogcart she cut her toast into strips viciously we waited patiently  it was mean of him wasnt it mother  well my girl you have treated him badly  what a baby what a mean manly baby men are great infants  and girls said mother do not know what they want  a grownup quality i added  nevertheless said lettie he is a mean fop and i detest him  she rose and sorted out some stitchery lettie never stitched unless she were in a bad humour mother smiled at me sighed and proceeded to mr gladstone for comfort her breviary and missal were morleys life of gladstone  i had to take a letter to highclose to mrs tempest—from my mother concerning a bazaar in process at the church i will bring leslie back with me said i to myself  the night was black and hateful the lamps by the road from eberwich ended at nethermere their yellow blur on the water made the cold wet inferno of the night more ugly  leslie and marie were both in the library—half a library half a business office used also as a lounge room being cosy leslie lay in a great armchair by the fire immune among clouds of blue smoke marie was perched on the steps a great volume on her knee leslie got up in his cloud shook hands greeted me curtly and vanished again marie smiled me a quaint vexed smile saying  oh cyril im so glad youve come im so worried and leslie says hes not a pastry cook though im sure i dont want him to be one only he need not be a bear  whats the matter  she frowned gave the big volume a little smack and said  why i do so much want to make some of those spanish tartlets of your mothers that are so delicious and of course mabel knows nothing of them and theyre not in my cookery book and ive looked through page upon page of the encyclopedia right through spain and theres nothing yet and there are fifty pages more and leslie wont help me though ive got a headache because hes frabous about something she looked at me in comical despair  do you want them for the bazaar  yes—for tomorrow cook has done the rest but i had fairly set my heart on these dont you think they are lovely  exquisitely lovely suppose i go and ask mother  if you would but no oh no you cant make all that journey this terrible night we are simply besieged by mud the men are both out—william has gone to meet father—and mother has sent george to carry some things to the vicarage i cant ask one of the girls on a night like this i shall have to let it go—and the cranberry tarts too—it cannot be helped i am so miserable  ask leslie said i  he is too cross she replied looking at him  he did not deign a remark  will you leslie  what  go across to woodside for me  what for  a recipe do theres a dear boy  where are the men  they are both engaged—they are out  send a girl then  at night like this who would go  cissy  i shall not ask her isnt he mean cyril men are mean  i will come back said i there is nothing at home to do mother is reading and lettie is stitching the weather disagrees with her as it does with leslie  but it is not fair—— she said looking at me softly then she put away the great book and climbed down  wont you go leslie she said laying her hand on his shoulder  women he said rising as if reluctantly theres no end to their wants and their caprices  i thought he would go said she warmly she ran to fetch his overcoat he put one arm slowly in the sleeve and then the other but he would not lift the coat on to his shoulders  well she said struggling on tiptoe you are a great creature cant you get it on naughty child  give her a chair to stand on he said  she shook the collar of the coat sharply but he stood like a sheep impassive  leslie you are too bad i cant get it on you stupid boy  i took the coat and jerked it on  there she said giving him his cap now dont be long  what a damned dirty night said he when we were out  it is said i  the town anywheres better than this hell of a country  ha how did you enjoy yourself  he began a long history of three days in the metropolis i listened and heard little i heard more plainly the cry of some night birds over nethermere and the peevish wailing yarling cry of some beast in the wood i was thankful to slam the door behind me to stand in the light of the hall  leslie exclaimed mother i am glad to see you  thank you he said turning to lettie who sat with her lap full of work her head busily bent  you see i cant get up she said giving him her hand adorned as it was by the thimble how nice of you to come we did not know you were back  but he exclaimed then he stopped  i suppose you enjoyed yourself she went on calmly  immensely thanks  snap snap snap went her needle through the new stuff then without looking up she said  yes no doubt you have the air of a man who has been enjoying himself  how do you mean  a kind of guilty—or shall i say embarrassed—look dont you notice it mother  i do said my mother  i suppose it means we may not ask him questions lettie concluded always very busily sewing  he laughed she had broken her cotton and was trying to thread the needle again  what have you been doing this miserable weather he enquired awkwardly  oh we have sat at home desolate ever of thee im fooondly dreeaming—and so on havent we mother  well said mother i dont know we imagined him all sorts of lions up there  what a shame we may not ask him to roar his old roars over for us said lettie  what are they like he asked  how should i know like a sucking dove to judge from your present voice a monstrous little voice  he laughed uncomfortably  she went on sewing suddenly beginning to sing to herself     pussy cat pussy cat where have you been    ive been up to london to see the fine queen    pussy cat pussy cat what did you there——    i frightened a little mouse under a stair  i suppose she added that may be so poor mouse—but i guess shes none the worse you did not see the queen though  she was not in london he replied sarcastically  you dont—— she said taking two pins from between her teeth i suppose you dont mean by that she was in eberwich—your queen  i dont know where she was he answered angrily  oh she said very sweetly i thought perhaps you had met her in eberwich when did you come back  last night he replied  oh—why didnt you come and see us before  ive been at the offices all day  ive been up to eberwich she said innocently  have you  yes and i feel so cross because of it i thought i might see you i felt as if you were at home  she stitched a little and glanced up secretly to watch his face redden then she continued innocently  yes—i felt you had come back it is funny how one has a feeling occasionally that someone is near when it is someone one has a sympathy with she continued to stitch then she took a pin from her bosom and fixed her work all without the least suspicion of guile  i thought i might meet you when i was out—— another pause another fixing a pin to be taken from her lips—but i didnt  i was at the office till rather late he said quickly  she stitched away calmly provokingly  she took the pin from her mouth again fixed down a fold of stuff and said softly  you little liar  mother had gone out of the room for her recipe book  he sat on his chair dumb with mortification she stitched swiftly and unerringly there was silence for some moments then he spoke  i did not know you wanted me for the pleasure of plucking this crow he said  i wanted you she exclaimed looking up for the first time who said i wanted you  no one if you didnt want me i may as well go  the sound of stitching alone broke the silence for some moments then she said deliberately  what made you think i wanted you  i dont care a damn whether you wanted me or whether you didnt  it seems to upset you and dont use bad language it is the privilege of those near and dear to one  thats why you begin it i suppose  i cannot remember—— she said loftily  he laughed sarcastically  well—if youre so beastly cut up about it——  he put this tentatively expecting the soft answer but she refused to speak and went on stitching he fidgeted about twisted his cap uncomfortably and sighed at last he said  well—you—have we done then  she had the vast superiority in that she was engaged in ostentatious work she could fix the cloth regard it quizzically rearrange it settle down and begin to sew before she replied this humbled him at last she said  i thought so this afternoon  but good god lettie cant you drop it  and then—the question startled him  why—forget it he replied  well—she spoke softly gently he answered to the call like an eager hound he crossed quickly to her side as she sat sewing and said in a low voice  you do care something for me dont you lettie  well—it was modulated kindly a sort of promise of assent  you have treated me rottenly you know havent you you know i—well i care a good bit  it is a queer way of showing it her voice was now a gentle reproof the sweetest of surrenders and forgiveness he leaned forward took her face in his hands and kissed her murmuring  you are a little tease  she laid her sewing in her lap and looked up    the next day sunday broke wet and dreary breakfast was late and about ten oclock we stood at the window looking upon the impossibility of our going to church  there was a driving drizzle of rain like a dirty curtain before the landscape the nasturtium leaves by the garden walk had gone rotten in a frost and the gay green discs had given place to the first black flags of winter hung on flaccid stalks pinched at the neck the grass plot was strewn with fallen leaves wet and brilliant scarlet splashes of virginia creeper golden drift from the limes ruddy brown shawls under the beeches and away back in the corner the black mat of maple leaves heavy soddened they ought to have been a vivid lemon colour occasionally one of these great black leaves would loose its hold and zigzag down staggering in the dance of death  there now said lettie suddenly  i looked up in time to see a crow close his wings and clutch the topmost bough of an old grey holly tree on the edge of the clearing he flapped again recovered his balance and folded himself up in black resignation to the detestable weather  why has the old wretch settled just over our noses said lettie petulantly just to blot the promise of a sorrow  yours or mine i asked  he is looking at me i declare  you can see the wicked pupil of his eye at this distance i insinuated  well she replied determined to take this omen unto herself i saw him first     one for sorrow two for joy    three for a letter four for a boy    five for silver six for gold    and seven for a secret never told  —you may bet hes only a messenger in advance therell be three more shortly and youll have your four said i comforting  do you know she said it is very funny but whenever ive particularly noticed one crow ive had some sorrow or other  and when you notice four i asked  you should have heard old mrs wagstaffe was her reply she declares an old crow croaked in their apple tree every day for a week before jerry got drowned  great sorrow for her i remarked  oh but she wept abundantly i felt like weeping too but somehow i laughed she hoped he had gone to heaven—but—im sick of that word but—it is always tangling ones thoughts  but jerry i insisted  oh she lifted up her forehead and the tears dripped off her nose he must have been an old nuisance syb i cant understand why women marry such men i felt downright glad to think of the drunken old wretch toppling into the canal out of the way  she pulled the thick curtain across the window and nestled down in it resting her cheek against the edge protecting herself from the cold window pane the wet grey wind shook the half naked trees whose leaves dripped and shone sullenly even the trunks were blackened trickling with the rain which drove persistently  whirled down the sky like black maple leaves caught up aloft came two more crows they swept down and clung hold of the trees in front of the house staying near the old forerunner lettie watched them half amused half melancholy one bird was carried past he swerved round and began to battle up the wind rising higher and rowing laboriously against the driving wet current  here comes your fourth said i  she did not answer but continued to watch the bird wrestled heroically but the wind pushed him aside tilted him caught under his broad wings and bore him down he swept in level flight down the stream outspread and still as if fixed in despair i grieved for him sadly two of his fellows rose and were carried away after him like souls hunting for a body to inhabit and despairing only the first ghoul was left on the withered silvergrey skeleton of the holly  he wont even say nevermore i remarked  he has more sense replied lettie she looked a trifle lugubrious then she continued better say nevermore than evermore  why i asked  oh i dont know fancy this evermore  she had been sure in her own soul that leslie would come—now she began to doubt—things were very perplexing  the bell in the kitchen jangled she jumped up i went and opened the door he came in she gave him one bright look of satisfaction he saw it and understood  helen has got some people over—i have been awfully rude to leave them now he said quietly  what a dreadful day said mother  oh fearful your face is red lettie what have you been doing  looking into the fire  what did you see  the pictures wouldnt come plain—nothing  he laughed we were silent for some time  you were expecting me he murmured  yes—i knew youd come  they were left alone he came up to her and put his arm around her as she stood with her elbow on the mantelpiece  you do want me he pleaded softly  yes she murmured  he held her in his arms and kissed her repeatedly again and again till she was out of breath and put up her hand and gently pushed her face away  you are a cold little lover—you are a shy bird he said laughing into her eyes he saw her tears rise swimming on her lids but not falling  why my love my darling—why—he put his face to hers and took the tear on his cheek  i know you love me he said gently all tenderness  do you know he murmured i can positively feel the tears rising up from my heart and throat they are quite painful gathering my love there—you can do anything with me  they were silent for some time after a while a rather long while she came upstairs and found mother—and at the end of some minutes i heard my mother go to him  i sat by my window and watched the low clouds reel and stagger past it seemed as if everything were being swept along—i myself seemed to have lost my substance to have become detached from concrete things and the firm trodden pavement of everyday life onward always onward not knowing where nor why the wind the clouds the rain and the birds and the leaves everything whirling along—why  all this time the old crow sat motionless though the clouds tumbled and were rent and piled though the trees bent and the windowpane shivered with running water then i found it had ceased to rain that there was a sickly yellow gleam of sunlight brightening on some great elmleaves near at hand till they looked like ripe lemons hanging the crow looked at me—i was certain he looked at me  what do you think of it all i asked him  he eyed me with contempt great featherless half winged bird as i was incomprehensible contemptible but awful i believe he hated me  but said i if a raven could answer why wont you  he looked wearily away nevertheless my gaze disquieted him he turned uneasily he rose waved his wings as if for flight poised then settled defiantly down again  you are no good said i you wont help even with a word  he sat stolidly unconcerned then i heard the lapwings in the meadow crying crying they seemed to seek the storm yet to rail at it they wheeled in the wind yet never ceased to complain of it they enjoyed the struggle and lamented it in wild lament through which came a sound of exultation all the lapwings cried cried the same tale bitter bitter the struggle—for nothing nothing nothing—and all the time they swung about on their broad wings revelling  there said i to the crow they try it and find it bitter but they wouldnt like to miss it to sit still like you you old corpse  he could not endure this he rose in defiance flapped his wings and launched off uttering one caw of sinister foreboding he was soon whirled away  i discovered that i was very cold so i went downstairs  twisting a curl round his finger one of those loose curls that always dance free from the captured hair leslie said  look how fond your hair is of me look how it twines round my finger do you know your hair—the light in it is like—oh—buttercups in the sun  it is like me—it wont be kept in bounds she replied  shame if it were—like this it brushes my face—so—and sets me tingling like music  behave now be still and ill tell you what sort of music you make  oh—well—tell me  like the calling of throstles and blackies in the evening frightening the pale little woodanemones till they run panting and swaying right up to our wall like the ringing of bluebells when the bees are at them like hippomenes outofbreath laughing because hed won  he kissed her with rapturous admiration  marriage music sir she added  what golden apples did i throw he asked lightly  what she exclaimed half mocking  this atalanta he replied looking lovingly upon her this atalanta—i believe she just lagged at last on purpose  you have it she cried laughing submitting to his caresses it was you—the apples of your firm heels—the apples of your eyes—the apples eve bit—that won me—hein  that was it—you are clever you are rare and ive won won the ripe apples of your cheeks and your breasts and your very fists—they cant stop me—and—and—all your roundness and warmness and softness—ive won you lettie  she nodded wickedly saying  all those—those—yes  all—she admits it—everything  oh—but let me breathe did you claim everything  yes and you gave it me  not yet everything though  every atom  but—now you look——  did i look aside  with the inward eye suppose now we were two angels——  oh dear—a sloppy angel  well—dont interrupt now—suppose i were one—like the blessed damosel  with a warm bosom——  dont be foolish now—i a blessed damosel and you kicking the brown beech leaves below thinking——  what are you driving at  would you be thinking—thoughts like prayers  what on earth do you ask that for oh—i think id be cursing—eh  no—saying fragrant prayers—that your thin soul might mount up——  hang thin souls lettie im not one of your souly sort i cant stand preraphaelities you—youre not a burnejonesess—youre an albert moore i think theres more in the warm touch of a soft body than in a prayer ill pray with kisses  and when you cant  ill wait till prayertime again by jove id rather feel my arms full of you id rather touch that red mouth—you grudger—than sing hymns with you in any heaven  im afraid youll never sing hymns with me in heaven  well—i have you here—yes i have you now  our life is but a fading dawn  liar—well you called me besides i dont care carpe diem my rosebud my fawn theres a nice carmen about a fawn time to leave its mother and venture into a warm embrace poor old horace—ive forgotten him  then poor old horace  ha ha—well i shant forget you whats that queer look in your eyes  what is it  nay—you tell me you are such a tease theres no getting to the bottom of you  you can fathom the depth of a kiss——  i will—i will——  after a while he asked  when shall we be properly engaged lettie  oh wait till christmas—till i am twentyone  nearly three months why on earth——  it will make no difference i shall be able to choose thee of my own free choice then  but three months  i shall consider thee engaged—it doesnt matter about other people  i thought we should be married in three months  ah—married in haste—— but what will your mother say  say oh shell say its the first wise thing ive done youll make a fine wife lettie able to entertain and all that  you will flutter brilliantly  we will  no—youll be the moth—ill paint your wings—gaudy featherdust then when you lose your coloured dust when you fly too near the light or when you play dodge with a butterfly net—away goes my part—you cant fly—i—alas poor me what becomes of the featherdust when the moth brushes his wings against a butterfly net  what are you making so many words about you dont know now do you  no—that i dont  then just be comfortable let me look at myself in your eyes  narcissus narcissus—do you see yourself well does the image flatter you—or is it a troubled stream distorting your fair lineaments  i cant see anything—only feel you looking—you are laughing at me—what have you behind there—what joke  i—im thinking youre just like narcissus—a sweet beautiful youth  be serious—do  it would be dangerous youd die of it and i—i should——  what  be just like i am now—serious  he looked proudly thinking she referred to the earnestness of her love      ——   in the wood the wind rumbled and roared hoarsely overhead but not a breath stirred among the saddened bracken an occasional raindrop was shaken out of the trees i slipped on the wet paths black bars striped the grey treetrunks where water had trickled down the bracken was overthrown its yellow ranks broken i slid down the steep path to the gate out of the wood  armies of cloud marched in rank across the sky heavily laden almost brushing the gorse on the common the wind was cold and disheartening the ground sobbed at every step the brook was full swirling along hurrying talking to itself in absorbed intent tones the clouds darkened i felt the rain careless of the mud i ran and burst into the farm kitchen  the children were painting and they immediately claimed my help  emily—and george—are in the front room said the mother quietly for it was sunday afternoon i satisfied the little ones i said a few words to the mother and sat down to take off my clogs  in the parlour the father big and comfortable was sleeping in an armchair emily was writing at the table—she hurriedly hid her papers when i entered george was sitting by the fire reading he looked up as i entered and i loved him when he looked up at me and as he lingered on his quiet hullo his eyes were beautifully eloquent—as eloquent as a kiss  we talked in subdued murmurs because the father was asleep opulently asleep his tanned face as still as a brown pear against the wall the clock itself went slowly with languid throbs we gathered round the fire and talked quietly about nothing—blissful merely in the sound of our voices a murmured soothing sound—a grateful dispassionate love trio  at last george rose put down his book—looked at his father—and went out  in the barn there was a sound of the pulper crunching the turnips the crisp strips of turnip sprinkled quietly down onto a heap of gold which grew beneath the pulper the smell of pulped turnips keen and sweet brings back to me the feeling of many winter nights when frozen hoofprints crunch in the yard and orion is in the south when a friendship was at its mystical best  pulping on sunday i exclaimed  father didnt do it yesterday its his work and i didnt notice it you know—father often forgets—he doesnt like to have to work in the afternoon now  the cattle stirred in their stalls the chains rattled round the posts a cow coughed noisily when george had finished pulping and it was quiet enough for talk just as he was spreading the first layers of chop and turnip and meal—in ran emily with her hair in silken twining confusion her eyes glowing—to bid us go in to tea before the milking was begun it was the custom to milk before tea on sunday—but george abandoned it without demur—his father willed it so and his father was master not to be questioned on farm matters however one disagreed  the last day in october had been dreary enough the night could not come too early we had tea by lamplight merrily with the father radiating comfort as the lamp shone yellow light sunday tea was imperfect without a visitor with me they always declared it was perfect i loved to hear them say so i smiled rejoicing quietly into my teacup when the father said  it seems proper to have cyril here at sunday tea it seems natural  he was most loath to break the delightful bond of the lamplit teatable he looked up with a halfappealing glance when george at last pushed back his chair and said he supposed hed better make a start  ay said the father in a mild conciliatory tone ill be out in a minute  the lamp hung against the barnwall softly illuminating the lower part of the building where bits of hay and white dust lay in the hollows between the bricks where the curled chips of turnip scattered orange gleams over the earthen floor the lofty roof with its swallows nests under the tiles was deep in shadow and the corners were full of darkness hiding half hiding the hay the chopper the bins the light shone along the passages before the stalls glistening on the moist noses of the cattle and on the whitewash of the walls  george was very cheerful but i wanted to tell him my message when he had finished the feeding and had at last sat down to milk i said  i told you leslie tempest was at our house when i came away  he sat with the bucket between his knees his hands at the cows udder about to begin to milk he looked up a question at me  they are practically engaged now i said  he did not turn his eyes away but he ceased to look at me as one who is listening for a faroff noise he sat with his eyes fixed then he bent his head and leaned it against the side of the cow as if he would begin to milk but he did not the cow looked round and stirred uneasily he began to draw the milk and then to milk mechanically i watched the movement of his hands listening to the rhythmic clang of the jets of milk on the bucket as a relief after a while the movement of his hands became slower thoughtful—then stopped  she has really said yes  i nodded  and what does your mother say  she is pleased  he began to milk again the cow stirred uneasily shifting her legs he looked at her angrily and went on milking then quite upset she shifted again and swung her tail in his face  stand still he shouted striking her on the haunch she seemed to cower like a beaten woman he swore at her and continued to milk she did not yield much that night she was very restive he took the stool from beneath him and gave her a good blow i heard the stool knock on her prominent hip bone after that she stood still but her milk soon ceased to flow  when he stood up he paused before he went to the next beast and i thought he was going to talk but just then the father came along with his bucket he looked in the shed and laughing in his mature pleasant way said  so youre an onlooker today cyril—i thought youd have milked a cow or two for me by now  nay said i sunday is a day of rest—and milking makes your hands ache  you only want a bit more practice he said joking in his ripe fashion why george is that all youve got from julia  it is  hm—shes soon going dry julia old lady dont go and turn skinny  when he had gone and the shed was still the air seemed colder i heard his goodhumoured stand over old lass from the other shed and the drumbeats of the first jets of milk on the pail  he has a comfortable time said george looking savage i laughed he still waited  you really expected lettie to have him i said  i suppose so he replied then shed made up her mind to it it didnt matter—what she wanted—at the bottom  you said i  if it hadnt been that he was a prize—with a ticket—shed have had——  you said i  she was afraid—look how she turned and kept away——  from you said i  i should like to squeeze her till she screamed  you should have gripped her before and kept her said i  she—shes like a woman like a cat—running to comforts—she strikes a bargain women are all tradesmen  dont generalise its no good  shes like a prostitute——  its banal i believe she loves him  he started and looked at me queerly he looked quite childish in his doubt and perplexity  she what——  loves him—honestly  shed a loved me better he muttered and turned to his milking i left him and went to talk to his father when the latters four beasts were finished georges light still shone in the other shed  i went and found him at the fifth the last cow when at length he had finished he put down his pail and going over to poor julia stood scratching her back and her poll and her nose looking into her big startled eye and murmuring she was afraid she jerked her head giving him a good blow on the cheek with her horn  you cant understand them he said sadly rubbing his face and looking at me with his dark serious eyes  i never knew i couldnt understand them i never thought about it——till but you know cyril she led me on  i laughed at his rueful appearance        chapter viii     the riot of christmas  for some weeks during the latter part of november and the beginning of december i was kept indoors by a cold at last came a frost which cleared the air and dried the mud on the second saturday before christmas the world was transformed tall silver and pearlgrey trees rose pale against a dimblue sky like trees in some rare pale paradise the whole woodland was as if petrified in marble and silver and snow the hollyleaves and long leaves of the rhododendron were rimmed and spangled with delicate tracery  when the night came clear and bright with a moon among the hoarfrost i rebelled against confinement and the house no longer the mists and dank weather made the home dear tonight even the glare of the distant little iron works was not visible for the low clouds were gone and pale stars blinked from beyond the moon  lettie was staying with me leslie was in london again she tried to remonstrate in a sisterly fashion when i said i would go out  only down to the mill said i then she hesitated a while—said she would come too i suppose i looked at her curiously for she said  oh—if you would rather go alone——  come—come—yes come said i smiling to myself  lettie was in her old animated mood she ran leaping over rough places laughing talking to herself in french we came to the mill gyp did not bark i opened the outer door and we crept softly into the great dark scullery peeping into the kitchen through the crack of the door  the mother sat by the hearth where was a big bath half full of soapy water and at her feet warming his bare legs at the fire was david who had just been bathed the mother was gently rubbing his fine fair hair into a cloud mollie was combing out her brown curls sitting by her father who in the fireseat was reading aloud in a hearty voice with quaint precision at the table sat emily and george she was quickly picking over a pile of little yellow raisins and he slowly with his head sunk was stoning the large raisins david kept reaching forward to play with the sleepy cat—interrupting his mothers rubbing there was no sound but the voice of the father full of zest i am afraid they were not all listening carefully i clicked the latch and entered  lettie exclaimed george  cyril cried emily  cyril ooray shouted david  hullo cyril said mollie  six large brown eyes round with surprise welcomed me they overwhelmed me with questions and made much of us at length they were settled and quiet again  yes i am a stranger said lettie who had taken off her hat and furs and coat but you do not expect me often do you i may come at times eh  we are only too glad replied the mother nothing all day long but the sound of the sluice—and mists and rotten leaves i am thankful to hear a fresh voice  is cyril really better lettie asked emily softly  hes a spoiled boy—i believe he keeps a little bit ill so that we can cade him let me help you—let me peel the apples—yes yes—i will  she went to the table and occupied one side with her applepeeling george had not spoken to her so she said  i wont help you—george because i dont like to feel my fingers so sticky and because i love to see you so domesticated  youll enjoy the sight a long time then for these things are numberless  you should eat one now and then—i always do  if i ate one i should eat the lot  then you may give me your one  he passed her a handful without speaking  that is too many your mother is looking let me just finish this apple there ive not broken the peel  she stood up holding up a long curling strip of peel  how many times must i swing it mrs saxton  three times—but its not all hallows eve  never mind look—— she carefully swung the long band of green peel over her head three times letting it fall the third the cat pounced on it but mollie swept him off again  what is it cried lettie blushing  g said the father winking and laughing—the mother looked daggers at him  it isnt nothink said david naïvely forgetting his confusion at being in the presence of a lady in his shirt mollie remarked in her cool way  it might be a hess—if you couldnt write  or an l i added lettie looked over at me imperiously and i was angry  what do you say emily she asked  nay said emily its only you can see the right letter  tell us whats the right letter said george to her  i exclaimed lettie who can look into the seeds of time  those who have set em and watched em sprout said i  she flung the peel into the fire laughing a short laugh and went on with her work  mrs saxton leaned over to her daughter and said softly so that he should not hear that george was pulling the flesh out of the raisins  george said emily sharply youre leaving nothing but the husks  he too was angry  and he would fain fill his belly with the husks that the swine did eat he said quietly taking a handful of the fruit he had picked and putting some in his mouth emily snatched away the basin  it is too bad she said  here said lettie handing him an apple she had peeled you may have an apple greedy boy  he took it and looked at it then a malicious smile twinkled round his eyes—as he said  if you give me the apple to whom will you give the peel  the swine she said as if she only understood his first reference to the prodigal son he put the apple on the table  dont you want it she said  mother he said comically as if jesting she is offering me the apple like eve  like a flash she snatched the apple from him hid it in her skirts a moment looking at him with dilated eyes and then she flung it at the fire she missed and the father leaned forward and picked it off the hob saying  the pigs may as well have it you were slow george—when a lady offers you a thing you dont have to make mouths  a ce quil parait she cried laughing now at her ease boisterously  is she making love emily asked the father laughing suggestively  she says it too fast for me said emily  george was leaning back in his chair his hands in his breeches pockets  we shall have to finish his raisins after all emily said lettie brightly look what a lazy animal he is  he likes his comfort said emily with irony  the picture of content—solid healthy easymoving content—— continued lettie as he sat thus with his head thrown back against the end of the ingleseat coatless his red neck seen in repose he did indeed look remarkably comfortable  i shall never fret my fat away he said stolidly  no—you and i—we are not like cyril we do not burn our bodies in our heads—or our hearts do we  we have it in common said he looking at her indifferently beneath his lashes as his head was tilted back  lettie went on with the paring and coring of her apples—then she took the raisins meanwhile emily was making the house ring as she chopped the suet in a wooden bowl the children were ready for bed they kissed us all goodnight—save george at last they were gone accompanied by their mother emily put down her chopper and sighed that her arm was aching so i relieved her the chopping went on for a long time while the father read lettie worked and george sat tilted back looking on when at length the mincemeat was finished we were all out of work lettie helped to clear away—sat down—talked a little with effort—jumped up and said  oh im too excited to sit still—its so near christmas—let us play at something  a dance said emily  a dance—a dance  he suddenly sat straight and got up  come on he said  he kicked off his slippers regardless of the holes in his stocking feet and put away the chairs he held out his arm to her—she came with a laugh and away they went dancing over the great flagged kitchen at an incredible speed her light flying steps followed his leaps you could hear the quick light tap of her toes more plainly than the thud of his stockinged feet emily and i joined in emilys movements are naturally slow but we danced at great speed i was hot and perspiring and she was panting when i put her in a chair but they whirled on in the dance on and on till i was giddy till the father laughing cried that they should stop but george continued the dance her hair was shaken loose and fell in a great coil down her back her feet began to drag you could hear a light slur on the floor she was panting—i could see her lips murmur to him begging him to stop he was laughing with open mouth holding her tight at last her feet trailed he lifted her clasping her tightly and danced twice round the room with her thus then he fell with a crash on the sofa pulling her beside him his eyes glowed like coals he was panting in sobs and his hair was wet and glistening she lay back on the sofa with his arm still around her not moving she was quite overcome her hair was wild about her face emily was anxious the father said with a shade of inquietude  youve overdone it—it is very foolish  when at last she recovered her breath and her life she got up and laughing in a queer way began to put up her hair she went into the scullery where were the brush and combs and emily followed with a candle when she returned ordered once more with a little pallor succeeding the flush and with a great black stain of sweat on her leathern belt where his hand had held her he looked up at her from his position on the sofa with a peculiar glance of triumph smiling  you great brute she said but her voice was not as harsh as her words he gave a deep sigh sat up and laughed quietly  another he said  will you dance with me  at your pleasure  come then—a minuet  dont know it  nevertheless you must dance it come along  he reared up and walked to her side she put him through the steps even dragging him round the waltz it was very ridiculous when it was finished she bowed him to his seat and wiping her hands on her handkerchief because his shirt where her hand had rested on his shoulders was moist she thanked him  i hope you enjoyed it he said  ever so much she replied  you made me look a fool—so no doubt you did  do you think you could look a fool why you are ironical ca marche in other words you have come on but it is a sweet dance  he looked at her lowered his eyelids and said nothing  ah well she laughed some are bred for the minuet and some for——  —less tomfoolery he answered  ah—you call it tomfoolery because you cannot do it myself i like it—so——  and i cant do it  could you did you you are not built that way  sort of clarence macfadden he said lighting a pipe as if the conversation did not interest him  yes—what ages since we sang that     clarence macfadden he wanted to dance    but his feet were not gaited that way     i remember we sang it after one corn harvest—we had a fine time i never thought of you before as clarence it is very funny by the way—will you come to our party at christmas  when whos coming  the twentysixth—oh—only the old people—alice—tom smith—fanny—those from highclose  and what will you do  sing charades—dance a little—anything you like  polka  and minuets—and valetas come and dance a valeta cyril  she made me take her through a valeta a minuet a mazurka and she danced elegantly but with a little of carmens ostentation—her dash and devilry when we had finished the father said  very pretty—very pretty indeed they do look nice dont they george i wish i was young  as i am—— said george laughing bitterly  show me how to do them—some time cyril said emily in her pleading way which displeased lettie so much  why dont you ask me said the latter quickly  well—but you are not often here  i am here now come—— and she waved emily imperiously to the attempt  lettie as i have said is tall approaching six feet she is lissome but firmly moulded by nature graceful in her poise and harmonious movement are revealed the subtle sympathies of her artists soul the other is shorter much heavier in her every motion you can see the extravagance of her emotional nature she quivers with feeling emotion conquers and carries havoc through her for she has not a strong intellect nor a heart of light humour her nature is brooding and defenceless she knows herself powerless in the tumult of her feelings and adds to her misfortunes a profound mistrust of herself  as they danced together lettie and emily they showed in striking contrast my sisters ease and beautiful poetic movement was exquisite the other could not control her movements but repeated the same error again and again she gripped letties hand fiercely and glanced up with eyes full of humiliation and terror of her continued failure and passionate trembling hopeless desire to succeed to show her to explain made matters worse as soon as she trembled on the brink of an action the terror of not being able to perform it properly blinded her and she was conscious of nothing but that she must do something—in a turmoil at last lettie ceased to talk and merely swung her through the dances haphazard this way succeeded better so long as emily need not think about her actions she had a large free grace and the swing and rhythm and time were imparted through her senses rather than through her intelligence  it was time for supper the mother came down for a while and we talked quietly at random lettie did not utter a word about her engagement not a suggestion she made it seem as if things were just as before although i am sure she had discovered that i had told george she intended that we should play as if ignorant of her bond  after supper when we were ready to go home lettie said to him  by the way—you must send us some mistletoe for the party—with plenty of berries you know are there many berries on your mistletoe this year  i do not know—i have never looked we will go and see—if you like george answered but will you come out into the cold he pulled on his boots and his coat and twisted a scarf round his neck the young moon had gone it was very dark—the liquid stars wavered the great night filled us with awe lettie caught hold of my arm and held it tightly he passed on in front to open the gates we went down into the front garden over the turf bridge where the sluice rushed coldly under on to the broad slope of the bank we could just distinguish the gnarled old appletrees leaning about us we bent our heads to avoid the boughs and followed george he hesitated a moment saying  let me see—i think they are there—the two trees with mistletoe on  we again followed silently  yes he said here they are  we went close and peered into the old trees we could just see the dark bush of the mistletoe between the boughs of the tree lettie began to laugh  have we come to count the berries she said i cant even see the mistletoe  she leaned forwards and upwards to pierce the darkness he also straining to look felt her breath on his cheek and turning saw the pallor of her face close to his and felt the dark glow of her eyes he caught her in his arms and held her mouth in a kiss then when he released her he turned away saying something incoherent about going to fetch the lantern to look she remained with her back towards me and pretended to be feeling among the mistletoe for the berries soon i saw the swing of the hurricane lamp below  he is bringing the lantern said i  when he came up he said and his voice was strange and subdued  now we can see what its like  he went near and held up the lamp so that it illuminated both their faces and the fantastic boughs of the trees and the weird bush of mistletoe sparsely pearled with berries instead of looking at the berries they looked into each others eyes his lids flickered and he flushed in the yellow light of the lamp looking warm and handsome he looked upwards in confusion and said there are plenty of berries  as a matter of fact there were very few  she too looked up and murmured her assent the light seemed to hold them as in a globe in another world apart from the night in which i stood he put up his hand and broke off a sprig of mistletoe with berries and offered it to her they looked into each others eyes again she put the mistletoe among her furs looking down at her bosom they remained still in the centre of light with the lamp uplifted the red and black scarf wrapped loosely round his neck gave him a luxurious generous look he lowered the lamp and said affecting to speak naturally  yes—there is plenty this year  you will give me some she replied turning away and finally breaking the spell  when shall i cut it—he strode beside her swinging the lamp as we went down the bank to go home he came as far as the brooks without saying another word then he bade us goodnight when he had lighted her over the steppingstones she did not take my arm as we walked home  during the next two weeks we were busy preparing for christmas ranging the woods for the reddest holly and pulling the gleaming ivybunches from the trees from the farms around came the cruel yelling of pigs and in the evening later was a scent of porkpies faroff on the highway could be heard the sharp trot of ponies hastening with christmas goods  there the carts of the hucksters dashed by to the expectant villagers triumphant with great bunches of light foreign mistletoe gay with oranges peeping through the boxes and scarlet intrusion of apples and wild confusion of cold dead poultry the hucksters waved their whips triumphantly the little ponies rattled bravely under the sycamores towards christmas  in the late afternoon of the 24th when dust was rising under the hazel brake i was walking with lettie all among the mesh of twigs overhead was tangled a dark red sky the boles of the trees grew denser—almost blue  tramping down the riding we met two boys fifteen or sixteen years old their clothes were largely patched with tough cotton moleskin scarves were knotted round their throats and in their pockets rolled tin bottles full of tea and the white knobs of their knotted snapbags  why said lettie are you going to work on christmas eve  it looks like it dont it said the elder  and what time will you be coming back  about alf past töw  christmas morning  youll be able to look out for the herald angels and the star said i  theyd think we was two dirty little uns said the younger lad laughing  theyll appen a done before we get up ter th top added the elder boy— an theyll none venture down th shaft  if they did put in the other youd hae ter bath em after id gie em a bit o my pasty  come on said the elder sulkily  they tramped off slurring their heavy boots  merry christmas i called after them  in th mornin replied the elder  same to you said the younger and he began to sing with a tinge of bravado     in the fields with their flocks abiding    they lay on the dewy ground——  fancy said lettie those boys are working for me  we were all going to the party at highclose i happened to go into the kitchen about half past seven the lamp was turned low and rebecca sat in the shadows on the table in the light of the lamp i saw a glass vase with five or six very beautiful christmas roses  hullo becka whos sent you these said i  theyre not sent replied rebecca from the depth of the shadow with suspicion of tears in her voice  why i never saw them in the garden  perhaps not but ive watched them these three weeks and kept them under glass  for christmas they are beauties i thought some one must have sent them to you  its little as as ever been sent me replied rebecca an less as will be  why—whats the matter  nothing whom i to have anything the matter nobody—nor ever was nor ever will be and im getting old as well  somethings upset you becky  what does it matter if it has what are my feelings a bunch o falderol flowers as a gardener clips off wi never a thought is preferred before mine as ive fettled after this threeweek i can sit at home to keep my flowers company—nobody wants em  i remembered that lettie was wearing hothouse flowers she was excited and full of the idea of the party at highclose i could imagine her quick oh no thank you rebecca i have had a spray sent to me——  never mind becky said i she is excited tonight  an im easy forgotten  so are we all becky—tant mieux  at highclose lettie made a stir among the little belles of the countryside she was decidedly the most distinguished she was brilliant moving as if in a drama leslie was enraptured ostentatious in his admiration proud of being so well infatuated they looked into each others eyes when they met both triumphant excited blazing arch looks at one another lettie was enjoying her public demonstration immensely it exhilarated her into quite a vivid love for him he was magnificent in response meanwhile the honoured lady of the house pompous and ample sat aside with my mother conferring her patronage on the latter amiable little woman who smiled sardonically and watched lettie it was a splendid party it was brilliant it was dazzling  i danced with several ladies and honourably kissed each under the mistletoe—except that two of them kissed me first it was all done in a most correct manner  you wolf said miss wookey archly i believe you are a wolf—a veritable rôdeur des femmes—and you look such a lamb too—such a dear  even my bleat reminds you of marys pet  but you are not my pet—at least—it is well that my golaud doesnt hear you——  if he is so very big—— said i  he is really hes beefy ive engaged myself to him somehow or other one never knows how one does those things do they  i couldnt speak from experience said i  cruel man i suppose i felt christmasy and id just been reading maeterlinck—and he really is big  who i asked  oh—he of course my golaud i cant help admiring men who are a bit avoirdupoisy it is unfortunate they cant dance  perhaps fortunate said i  i can see you hate him pity i didnt think to ask him if he danced—before——  would it have influenced you very much  well—of course—one can be free to dance all the more with the really nice men whom one never marries  why not  oh—you can only marry one——  of course  there he is—hes coming for me oh frank you leave me to the tender mercies of the world at large i thought youd forgotten me dear  i thought the same replied her golaud a great fat fellow with a childish bare face he smiled awesomely and one never knew what he meant to say  we drove home in the early christmas morning lettie warmly wrapped in her cloak had had a little stroll with her lover in the shrubbery she was still brilliant flashing in her movements he as he bade her goodbye was almost beautiful in his grace and his low musical tone i nearly loved him myself she was very fond towards him as we came to the gate where the private road branched from the highway we heard john say thank you—and looking out saw our two boys returning from the pit they were very grotesque in the dark night as the lamplight fell on them showing them grimy flecked with bits of snow they shouted merrily their good wishes lettie leaned out and waved to them and they cried ooray christmas came in with their acclamations           chapter ix     lettie comes of age   lettie was twentyone on the day after christmas she woke me in the morning with cries of dismay there was a great fall of snow multiplying the cold morning light startling the slowfooted twilight the lake was black like the open eyes of a corpse the woods were black like the beard on the face of a corpse a rabbit bobbed out and floundered in much consternation little birds settled into the depth and rose in a dusty whirr much terrified at the universal treachery of the earth the snow was eighteen inches deep and drifted in places  they will never come lamented lettie for it was the day of her party  at any rate—leslie will said i  one she exclaimed  that one is all isnt it said i and for sure george will come though ive not seen him this fortnight hes not been in one night they say for a fortnight  why not  i cannot say  lettie went away to ask rebecca for the fiftieth time if she thought they would come at any rate the extra womanhelp came  it was not more than ten oclock when leslie arrived ruddy with shining eyes laughing like a boy there was much stamping in the porch and knocking of leggings with his stick and crying of lettie from the kitchen to know who had come and loud cheery answers from the porch bidding her come and see she came and greeted him with effusion  ha my little woman he said kissing her i declare you are a woman look at yourself in the glass now—— she did so—what do you see he asked laughing  you—mighty gay looking at me  ah but look at yourself there i declare youre more afraid of your own eyes than of mine arent you  i am she said and he kissed her with rapture  its your birthday he said  i know she replied  so do i you promised me something  what she asked  here—see if you like it—he gave her a little case she opened it and instinctively slipped the ring on her finger he made a movement of pleasure she looked up laughing breathlessly at him  now said he in tones of finality  ah she exclaimed in a strange thrilled voice  he caught her in his arms  after a while when they could talk rationally again she said  do you think they will come to my party  i hope not—by heaven  but—oh yes we have made all preparations  what does that matter ten thousand folks here today——  not ten thousand—only five or six i shall be wild if they cant come  you want them  we have asked them—and everything is ready—and i do want us to have a party one day  but today—damn it all lettie  but i did want my party today dont you think theyll come  they wont if theyve any sense  you might help me—— she pouted  well ill be— and youve set your mind on having a houseful of people today  you know how we look forward to it—my party at any rate—i know tom smith will come—and im almost sure emily saxton will  he bit his moustache angrily and said at last  then i suppose id better send john round for the lot  it wouldnt be much trouble would it  no trouble at all  do you know she said twisting the ring on her finger it makes me feel as if i tied something round my finger to remember by it somehow remains in my consciousness all the time  at any rate said he i have got you  after dinner when we were alone lettie sat at the table nervously fingering her ring  it is pretty mother isnt it she said a trifle pathetically  yes very pretty i have always liked leslie replied my mother  but it feels so heavy—it fidgets me i should like to take it off  you are like me i never could wear rings i hated my wedding ring for months  did you mother  i longed to take it off and put it away but after a while i got used to it  im glad this isnt a wedding ring  leslie says it is as good said i  ah well yes but still it is different— she put the jewels round under her finger and looked at the plain gold band—then she twisted it back quickly saying  im glad its not—not yet i begin to feel a woman little mother—i feel grown up today  my mother got up suddenly and went and kissed lettie fervently  let me kiss my girl goodbye she said and her voice was muffled with tears lettie clung to my mother and sobbed a few quiet sobs hidden in her bosom then she lifted her face which was wet with tears and kissed my mother murmuring  no mother—no—o—  about three oclock the carriage came with leslie and marie both lettie and i were upstairs and i heard marie come tripping up to my sister  oh lettie he is in such a state of excitement you never knew he took me with him to buy it—let me see it on i think its awfully lovely here let me help you to do your hair—all in those little rolls—it will look charming youve really got beautiful hair—theres so much life in it—its a pity to twist it into a coil as you do i wish my hair were a bit longer—though really its all the better for this fashion—dont you like it—its so chic—i think these little puffs are just fascinating—it is rather long for them—but it will look ravishing really my eyes and eyebrows and eyelashes are my best features dont you think  marie the delightful charming little creature twittered on i went downstairs  leslie started when i entered the room but seeing only me he leaned forward again resting his arms on his knees looking in the fire  what the dickens is she doing he asked  dressing  then we may keep on waiting isnt it a deuced nuisance these people coming  well we generally have a good time  oh—its all very well—were not in the same boat you and me  fact said i laughing  by jove cyril you dont know what it is to be in love i never thought—i couldnt ha believed i should be like it all the time when it isnt at the top of your blood its at the bottom—the girl the girl  he stared into the fire  it seems pressing you pressing you on never leaves you alone a moment  again he lapsed into reflection  then all at once you remember how she kissed you and all your blood jumps afire  he mused again for awhile—or rather he seemed fiercely to con over his sensations  you know he said i dont think she feels for me as i do for her  would you want her to said i  i dont know perhaps not—but—still i dont think she feels——  at this he lighted a cigarette to soothe his excited feelings and there was silence for some time then the girls came down we could hear their light chatter lettie entered the room he jumped up and surveyed her she was dressed in soft creamy silken stuff her neck was quite bare her hair was as marie promised fascinating she was laughing nervously she grew warm like a blossom in the sunshine in the glow of his admiration he went forward and kissed her  you are splendid he said  she only laughed for answer he drew her away to the great armchair and made her sit in it beside him she was indulgent and he radiant he took her hand and looked at it and at his ring which she wore  it looks all right he murmured  anything would she replied  what do they mean—sapphires and diamonds—for i dont know  nor do i blue for hope because speranza in fairy queen had a blue gown—and diamonds for—the crystalline clearness of my nature  its glitter and hardness you mean—you are a hard little mistress but why hope  why—no reason whatever like most things no thats not right hope oh—blindfolded—hugging a silly harp with no strings i wonder why she didnt drop her harp framework over the edge of the globe and take the handkerchief off her eyes and have a look round but of course she was a woman—and a mans woman do you know i believe most women can sneak a look down their noses from underneath the handkerchief of hope theyve tied over their eyes they could take the whole muffler off—but they dont do it the dears  i dont believe you know what youre talking about and im sure i dont sapphires reminded me of your eyes—and—isnt it blue that kept the faith i remember something about it  here said she pulling off the ring you ought to wear it yourself faithful one to keep me in constant mind  keep it on keep it on it holds you faster than that fair damsel tied to a tree in millais picture—i believe its millais  she sat shaking with laughter  what a comparison wholl be the brave knight to rescue me—discreetly—from behind  ah he answered it doesnt matter you dont want rescuing do you  not yet she replied teasing him  they continued to talk half nonsense making themselves eloquent by quick looks and gestures and communion of warm closeness the ironical tones went out of letties voice and they made love  marie drew me away into the dining room to leave them alone    marie is a charming little maid whose appearance is neatness whose face is confident little goodness her hair is dark and lies low upon her neck in wavy coils she does not affect the fashion in coiffure and generally is a little behind the fashion in dress indeed she is a halfopened bud of a matron conservative full of proprieties and of gentle indulgence she now smiled at me with a warm delight in the romance upon which she had just shed her grace but her demureness allowed nothing to be said she glanced round the room and out of the window and observed  i always love woodside it is restful—there is something about it—oh—assuring—really—it comforts one—ive been reading maxim gorky  you shouldnt said i  dadda reads them—but i dont like them—i shall read no more i like woodside—it makes you feel—really at home—it soothes one like the old wood does it seems right—life is proper here—not ulcery——  just healthy living flesh said i  no i dont mean that because one feels—oh as if the world were old and good not old and bad  young and undisciplined and mad said i  no—but here you and lettie and leslie and me—it is so nice for us and it seems so natural and good woodside is so old and so sweet and serene—it does reassure one  yes said i we just live nothing abnormal nothing cruel and extravagant—just natural—like doves in a dovecote  oh—doves—they are so—so mushy  they are dear little birds doves you look like one yourself with the black band round your neck you a turtledove and lettie a woodpigeon  lettie is splendid isnt she what a swing she has—what a mastery i wish i had her strength—she just marches straight through in the right way—i think shes fine  i laughed to see her so enthusiastic in her admiration of my sister marie is such a gentle serious little soul she went to the window i kissed her and pulled two berries off the mistletoe i made her a nest in the heavy curtains and she sat there looking out on the snow  it is lovely she said reflectively people must be ill when they write like maxim gorky  they live in town said i  yes—but then look at hardy—life seems so terrible—it isnt is it  if you dont feel it it isnt—if you dont see it i dont see it for myself  its lovely enough for heaven  eskimos heaven perhaps and were the angels eh and im an archangel  no youre a vain frivolous man is that— what is that moving through the trees  somebody coming said i  it was a big burly fellow moving curiously through the bushes  doesnt he walk funnily exclaimed marie he did when he came near enough we saw he was straddled upon indian snowshoes marie peeped and laughed and peeped and hid again in the curtains laughing he was very red and looked very hot as he hauled the great meshes shuffling over the snow his body rolled most comically i went to the door and admitted him while marie stood stroking her face with her hands to smooth away the traces of her laughter  he grasped my hand in a very large and heavy glove with which he then wiped his perspiring brow  well beardsall old man he said and hows things god im not alf hot fine idea though—— he showed me his snowshoes  ripping aint they ive come like an indian brave—— he rolled his rs and lengthened out his ahs tremendously—brraave  couldnt resist it though he continued remember your party last year—girls turned up on the warpath eh he pursed up his childish lips and rubbed his fat chin  having removed his coat and the white wrap which protected his collar not to mention the snowflakes which rebecca took almost as an insult to herself—he seated his fat hot body on a chair and proceeded to take off his gaiters and his boots then he donned his dancing pumps and i led him upstairs  lord i skimmed here like a swallow he continued—and i looked at his corpulence  never met a soul though theyve had a snowplough down the road i saw the marks of a cart up the drive so i guessed the tempests were here so letties put her nose in tempests nosebag—leaves nobody a chance that—some women have rum taste—only theyre like ravens they go for the gilding—dont blame em—only it leaves nobody a chance madie howitts coming i suppose  i ventured something about the snow  shell come he said if its up to the neck her mother saw me go past  he proceeded with his toilet i told him that leslie had sent the carriage for alice and madie he slapped his fat legs and exclaimed  miss gall—i smell sulphur beardsall old boy theres fun in the wind madie and the coy little tempest and—— he hissed a line of a musichall song through his teeth  during all this he had straightened his cream and lavender waistcoat  little pink of a girl worked it for me—a real juicy little peach—chipped somehow or other—he had arranged his white bow—he had drawn forth two rings one a great signet the other gorgeous with diamonds and had adjusted them on his fat white fingers he had run his fingers delicately through his hair which rippled backwards a trifle tawdrily—being fine and somewhat sapless he had produced a box containing a cream carnation with suitable greenery he had flicked himself with a silk handkerchief and had dusted his patentleather shoes lastly he had pursed up his lips and surveyed himself with great satisfaction in the mirror then he was ready to be presented  couldnt forget today lettie wouldnt have let old pluto and all the bunch of em keep me away i skimmed here like a brraave on my snowshoes like hiawatha coming to minnehaha  ah—that was famine said marie softly and this is a feast a gorgeous feast miss tempest he said bowing to marie who laughed  you have brought some music asked mother  wish i was orpheus he said uttering his words with exaggerated enunciation a trick he had caught from his singing i suppose  i see youre in full feather tempest is she kind as she is fair  who  will pursed up his smooth sensuous face that looked as if it had never needed shaving lettie went out with marie hearing the bell ring  shes an houri exclaimed william gad im almost done for shes a lotusblossom—but is that your ring shes wearing tempest  keep off said leslie  and dont be a fool said i  oh oooh drawled will so we must look the other way le bel homme sans merci  he sighed profoundly and ran his fingers through his hair keeping one eye on himself in the mirror as he did so then he adjusted his rings and went to the piano at first he only splashed about brilliantly then he sorted the music and took a volume of tchaikowskys songs he began the long opening of one song was unsatisfied and found another a serenade of don juan then at last he began to sing  his voice is a beautiful tenor softer more mellow less strong and brassy than leslies now it was raised that it might be heard upstairs as the melting gush poured forth the door opened william softened his tones and sang dolce but he did not glance round  rapture—choir of angels exclaimed alice clasping her hands and gazing up at the lintel of the door like a sainted virgin  persephone—europa—— murmured madie at her side getting tangled in her mythology  alice pressed her clasped hands against her bosom in ecstasy as the notes rose higher  hold me madie or i shall rush to extinction in the arms of this siren she clung to madie the song finished and will turned round  take it calmly miss gall he said i hope youre not hit too badly  oh—how can you say take it calmly—how can the savage beast be calm  im sorry for you said will  you are the cause of my trouble dear boy replied alice  i never thought youd come said madie  skimmed here like an indian brraave said will like hiawatha towards minnehaha i knew you were coming  you know simpered madie it gave me quite a flutter when i heard the piano it is a year since i saw you how did you get here  i came on snowshoes said he real indian—came from canada—theyre just ripping  oh—aww do go and put them on and show us—do—do perform for us billy dear cried alice  out in the cold and driving sleet—no fear said he and he turned to talk to madie alice sat chatting with mother soon tom smith came and took a seat next to marie and sat quietly looking over his spectacles with his sharp brown eyes full of scorn for william full of misgiving for leslie and lettie  shortly after george and emily came in they were rather nervous when they had changed their clogs and emily had taken off her brownpaper leggings and he his leather ones they were not anxious to go into the drawing room i was surprised—and so was emily—to see that he had put on dancing shoes  emily ruddy from the cold air was wearing a wine coloured dress which suited her luxurious beauty georges clothes were well made—it was a point on which he was particular being somewhat selfconscious he wore a jacket and a dark bow the other men were in evening dress  we took them into the drawingroom where the lamp was not lighted and the glow of the fire was becoming evident in the dusk we had taken up the carpet—the floor was all polished—and some of the furniture was taken away—so that the room looked large and ample  there was general hand shaking and the newcomers were seated near the fire first mother talked to them—then the candles were lighted at the piano and will played to us he is an exquisite pianist full of refinement and poetry it is astonishing and it is a fact mother went out to attend to the tea and after a while lettie crossed over to emily and george and drawing up a low chair sat down to talk to them leslie stood in the window bay looking out on the lawn where the snow grew bluer and bluer and the sky almost purple  lettie put her hands on emilys lap and said softly look—do you like it  what engaged exclaimed emily  i am of age you see said lettie  it is a beauty isnt it let me try it on will you yes ive never had a ring there it wont go over my knuckle—no—i thought not arent my hands red—its the cold—yes its too small for me i do like it  george sat watching the play of the four hands in his sisters lap two hands moving so white and fascinating in the twilight the other two rather red with rather large bones looking so nervous almost hysterical the ring played between the four hands giving an occasional flash from the twilight or candlelight  you must congratulate me she said in a very low voice and two of us knew she spoke to him  as yes said emily i do  and you she said turning to him who was silent  what do you want me to say he asked  say what you like  sometime when ive thought about it  cold dinners laughed lettie awaking alices old sarcasm at his slowness  what he exclaimed looking up suddenly at her taunt she knew she was playing false she put the ring on her finger and went across the room to leslie laying her arm over his shoulder and leaning her head against him murmuring softly to him he poor fellow was delighted with her for she did not display her fondness often  we went in to tea the yellow shaded lamp shone softly over the table where christmas roses spread wide open among some darkcoloured leaves where the china and silver and the coloured dishes shone delightfully we were all very gay and bright who could be otherwise seated round a welllaid table with young company and the snow outside george felt awkward when he noticed his hands over the table but for the rest we enjoyed ourselves exceedingly  the conversation veered inevitably to marriage  but what have you to say about it mr smith asked little marie  nothing yet replied he in his peculiar grating voice my marriage is in the unanalysed solution of the future—when ive done the analysis ill tell you  but what do you think about it—  do you remember lettie said will bancroft that little redhaired girl who was in our year at college she has just married old craven out of physics department  i wish her joy of it said lettie wasnt she an old flame of yours  among the rest he replied smiling dont you remember you were one of them you had your day  what a joke that was exclaimed lettie we used to go in the arboretum at dinnertime you lasted half one autumn do you remember when we gave a concert you and i and frank wishaw in the small lecture theatre  when the prinny was such an old buck flattering you continued will and that night wishaw took you to the station—sent old gettim for a cab and saw you in large as life—never was such a thing before old wishaw won you with that cab didnt he  oh how i swelled cried lettie there were you all at the top of the steps gazing with admiration but frank wishaw was not a nice fellow though he played the violin beautifully i never liked his eyes—  no added will he didnt last long did he—though long enough to oust me we had a giddy ripping time in coll didnt we  it was not bad said lettie rather foolish im afraid i wasted my three years  i think said leslie smiling you improved the shining hours to great purpose  it pleased him to think what a flirt she had been since the flirting had been harmless and only added to the glory of his final conquest george felt very much left out during these reminiscences    when we had finished tea we adjourned to the drawingroom it was in darkness save for the fire light the mistletoe had been discovered and was being appreciated  georgie sybil sybil georgie come and kiss me cried alice  will went forward to do her the honour she ran to me saying get away you fat fool—keep on your own preserves now georgie dear come and kiss me cause you havent got nobody else but me no y ave nt do you want to run away like georgyporgy applepie shant cry sure i shant if you are ugly  she took him and kissed him on either cheek saying softly you shant be so serious old boy—buck up theres a good fellow  we lighted the lamp and charades were proposed leslie and lettie will and madie and alice went out to play the first scene was an elopement to gretna green—with alice a maid servant a part that she played wonderfully well as a caricature it was very noisy and extremely funny leslie was in high spirits it was remarkable to observe that as he became more animated more abundantly energetic lettie became quieter the second scene which they were playing as excited melodrama she turned into small tragedy with her bitterness they went out and lettie blew us kisses from the doorway  doesnt she act well exclaimed marie speaking to tom  quite realistic said he  she could always play a part well said mother  i should think said emily she could take a role in life and play up to it  i believe she could mother answered there would only be intervals when she would see herself in a mirror acting  and what then said marie  she would feel desperate and wait till the fit passed off replied my mother smiling significantly  the players came in again lettie kept her part subordinate leslie played with brilliance it was rather startling how he excelled the applause was loud—but we could not guess the word then they laughed and told us we clamoured for more  do go dear said lettie to leslie and i will be helping to arrange the room for the dances i want to watch you—i am rather tired—it is so exciting—emily will take my place  they went marie and tom and mother and i played bridge in one corner lettie said she wanted to show george some new pictures and they bent over a portfolio for some time then she bade him help her to clear the room for the dances  well you have had time to think she said to him  a short time he replied what shall i say  tell me what youve been thinking  well—about you—— he answered smiling foolishly  what about me she asked venturesome  about you how you were at college he replied  oh i had a good time i had plenty of boys i liked them all till i found there was nothing in them then they tired me  poor boys he said laughing were they all alike  all alike she replied and they are still  pity he said smiling its hard lines on you  why she asked  it leaves you nobody to care for—— he replied  how very sarcastic you are you make one reservation  do i he answered smiling but you fire sharp into the air and then say were all blank cartridges—except one of course  you she queried ironically—oh you would forever hang fire  cold dinners he quoted in bitterness but you knew i loved you you knew well enough  past tense she replied thanks—make it perfect next time  its you who hang fire—its you who make me he said  and so from the retort circumstantial to the retort direct she replied smiling  you see—you put me off he insisted growing excited for reply she held out her hand and showed him the ring she smiled very quietly he stared at her with darkening anger  will you gather the rugs and stools together and put them in that corner she said  he turned away to do so but he looked back again and said in low passionate tones  you never counted me i was a figure naught in the counting all along  see—there is a chair that will be in the way she replied calmly but she flushed and bowed her head she turned away and he dragged an armful of rugs into a corner  when the actors came in lettie was moving a vase of flowers while they played she sat looking on smiling clapping her hands when it was finished leslie came and whispered to her whereon she kissed him unobserved delighting and exhilarating him more than ever then they went out to prepare the next act  george did not return to her till she called him to help her her colour was high in her cheeks  how do you know you did not count she said nervously unable to resist the temptation to play this forbidden game  he laughed and for a moment could not find any reply  i do he said you knew you could have me any day so you didnt care  then were behaving in quite the traditional fashion she answered with irony  but you know he said you began it you played with me and showed me heaps of things—and those mornings—when i was binding corn and when i was gathering the apples and when i was finishing the strawstack—you came then—i can never forget those mornings—things will never be the same—you have awakened my life—i imagine things that i couldnt have done  ah—i am very sorry i am so sorry  dont be—dont say so but what of me  what she asked rather startled he smiled again he felt the situation and was a trifle dramatic though deadly in earnest  well said he you start me off—then leave me at a loose end what am i going to do  you are a man she replied  he laughed what does that mean he said contemptuously  you can go on—which way you like she answered  oh well he said well see  dont you think so she asked rather anxious  i dont know—well see he replied  they went out with some things in the hall she turned to him with a break in her voice saying oh i am so sorry—i am so sorry  he said very low and soft—never mind—never mind  she heard the laughter of those preparing the charade she drew away and went in the drawing room saying aloud  now i think everything is ready—we can sit down now  after the actors had played the last charade leslie came and claimed her  now madam—are you glad to have me back  that i am she said dont leave me again will you  i wont he replied drawing her beside him i have left my handkerchief in the diningroom he continued and they went out together  mother gave me permission for the men to smoke  you know said marie to tom i am surprised that a scientist should smoke isnt it a waste of time  come and light me he said  nay she replied let science light you  science does—ah but science is nothing without a girl to set it going—yes—come on—now dont burn my precious nose  poor george cried alice does he want a ministering angel  he was half lying in a big arm chair  i do he replied come on be my box of soothing ointment my matches are all loose  ill strike it on my heel eh now rouse up or i shall have to sit on your knee to reach you  poor dear—he shall beluxurious and the dauntless girl perched on his knee  what if i singe your whiskers—would you send an armada aw—aw—pretty—you do look sweet—doesnt he suck prettily  do you envy me he asked smiling whimsically  ra—ther  shame to debar you he said almost with tenderness  smoke with me  he offered her the cigarette from his lips she was surprised and exceedingly excited by his tender tone she took the cigarette  ill make a heifer—like mrs daws she said  dont call yourself a cow he said  nasty thing—let me go she exclaimed  no—you fit me—dont go he replied holding her  then you must have growed oh—what great hands—let go lettie come and pinch him  whats the matter asked my sister  he wont let me go  hell be tired first lettie answered  alice was released but she did not move she sat with wrinkled forehead trying his cigarette she blew out little tiny whiffs of smoke and thought about it she sent a small puff down her nostrils and rubbed her nose  its not as nice as it looks she said  he laughed at her with masculine indulgence  pretty boy she said stroking his chin  am i he murmured languidly  cheek she cried and she boxed his ears then oh pore fing she said and kissed him  she turned round to wink at my mother and at lettie she found the latter sitting in the old position with leslie two in a chair he was toying with her arm holding it and stroking it  isnt it lovely he said kissing the forearm so warm and yet so white io—it reminds one of io  somebody else talking about heifers murmured alice to george  can you remember said leslie speaking low that man in merimée who wanted to bite his wife and taste her blood  i do said lettie have you a strain of wild beast too  perhaps he laughed i wish these folks had gone your hair is all loose in your neck—it looks lovely like that though——  alice the mocker had unbuttoned the cuff of the thick wrist that lay idly on her knee and had pushed his sleeve a little way  ah she said what a pretty arm brown as an overbaked loaf  he watched her smiling  hard as a brick she added  do you like it he drawled  no she said emphatically in a tone that meant yes it makes me feel shivery he smiled again  she superposed her tiny pale flowerlike hands on his  he lay back looking at them curiously  do you feel as if your hands were full of silver she asked almost wistfully mocking  better than that he replied gently  and your heart full of gold she mocked  of hell he replied briefly  alice looked at him searchingly  and am i like a bluebottle buzzing in your window to keep your company she asked  he laughed  goodbye she said slipping down and leaving him  dont go he said—but too late  the irruption of alice into the quiet sentimental party was like taking a bright light into a sleeping henroost everybody jumped up and wanted to do something they cried out for a dance  emily—play a waltz—you wont mind will you george what you dont dance tom oh marie  i dont mind lettie protested marie  dance with me alice said george smiling and cyril will take miss tempest  glory—come on—do or die said alice  we began to dance i saw lettie watching and i looked round george was waltzing with alice dancing passably laughing at her remarks lettie was not listening to what her lover was saying to her she was watching the laughing pair at the end she went to george  why she said you can——  did you think i couldnt he said you are pledged for a minuet and a valeta with me—you remember  yes  you promise  yes but——  i went to nottingham and learned  why—because—very well leslie a mazurka will you play it emily—yes it is quite easy tom you look quite happy talking to the mater  we danced the mazurka with the same partners he did it better than i expected—without much awkwardness—but stiffly however he moved quietly through the dance laughing and talking abstractedly all the time with alice  then lettie cried a change of partners and they took their valeta there was a little triumph in his smile  do you congratulate me he said  i am surprised she answered  so am i but i congratulate myself  do you well so do i  thanks youre beginning at last  what she asked  to believe in me  dont begin to talk again she pleaded sadly nothing vital  do you like dancing with me he asked  now be quiet—thats real she replied  by heaven lettie you make me laugh  do i she said—what if you married alice—soon  i—alice—lettie besides ive only a hundred pounds in the world and no prospects whatever thats why—well—i shant marry anybody—unless its somebody with money  ive a couple of thousand or so of my own——  have you it would have done nicely he said smiling  you are different tonight she said leaning on him  am i he replied—its because things are altered too theyre settled one way now—for the present at least  dont forget the two steps this time said she smiling and adding seriously you see i couldnt help it  no why not  things i have been brought up to expect it—everybody expected it—and youre bound to do what people expect you to do—you cant help it we cant help ourselves were all chessmen she said  ay he agreed but doubtfully  i wonder where it will end she said  lettie he cried and his hand closed in a grip on hers  dont—dont say anything—its no good now its too late its done and what is done is done if you talk any more i shall say im tired and stop the dance dont say another word  he did not—at least to her their dance came to an end then he took marie who talked winsomely to him as he waltzed with marie he regained his animated spirits he was very lively the rest of the evening quite astonishing and reckless at supper he ate everything and drank much wine  have some more turkey mr saxton  thanks—but give me some of that stuff in brown jelly will you its new to me  have some of this trifle georgie  i will—you are a jewel  so will you be—a yellow topaz tomorrow  ah tomorrows tomorrow  after supper was over alice cried  georgie dear—have you finished—dont die the death of a king—king john—i cant spare you pet  are you so fond of me  i am—aw id throw my best sunday hat under a milkcart for you i would  no throw yourself into the milkcart—some sunday when im driving  yes—come and see us said emily  how nice tomorrow you wont want me georgie dear so ill come dont you wish pa would make tonobungay wouldnt you marry me then  i would said he  when the cart came and alice madie tom and will departed alice bade lettie a long farewell—blew georgie many kisses—promised to love him faithful and true—and was gone  george and emily lingered a short time  now the room seemed empty and quiet and all the laughter seemed to have gone the conversation dribbled away there was an awkwardness  well said george heavily at last today is nearly gone—it will soon be tomorrow i feel a bit drunk we had a good time tonight  i am glad said lettie  they put on their clogs and leggings and wrapped themselves up and stood in the hall  we must go said george before the clock strikes—like cinderella—look at my glass slippers— he pointed to his clogs midnight and rags and fleeing very appropriate i shall call myself cinderella who wouldnt fit i believe im a bit drunk—the world looks funny  we looked out at the haunting wanness of the hills beyond nethermere goodbye lettie goodbye  they were out in the snow which peered pale and eerily from the depths of the black wood  goodbye he called out of the darkness leslie slammed the door and drew lettie away into the drawingroom the sound of his low vibrating satisfaction reached us as he murmured to her and laughed low then he kicked the door of the room shut lettie began to laugh and mock and talk in a high strained voice the sound of their laughter mingled was strange and incongruous then her voice died down  marie sat at the little piano—which was put in the diningroom—strumming and tinkling the false quavering old notes it was a depressing jingling in the deserted remains of the feast but she felt sentimental and enjoyed it  this was a gap between today and tomorrow a dreary gap where one sat and looked at the dreary comedy of yesterdays and the grey tragedies of dawning tomorrows vacantly missing the poignancy of an actual today  the cart returned  leslie leslie john is here come along called marie  there was no answer  leslie—john is waiting in the snow  all right  but you must come at once she went to the door and spoke to him then he came out looking rather sheepish and rather angry at the interruption lettie followed tidying her hair she did not laugh and look confused as most girls do on similar occasions she seemed very tired  at last leslie tore himself away and after more returns for a farewell kiss mounted the carriage which stood in a pool of yellow light blurred and splotched with shadows and drove away calling something about tomorrow           part ii         chapter i     strange blossoms and strange new budding   winter lay a long time prostrate on the earth the men in the mines of tempest warrall and co came out on strike on a question of the rearranging of the working system down below the distress was not awful for the men were on the whole wise and wellconditioned but there was a dejection over the face of the countryside and some suffered keenly everywhere along the lanes and in the streets loitered gangs of men unoccupied and spiritless week after week went on and the agents of the miners union held great meetings and the ministers held prayermeetings but the strike continued there was no rest always the criers bell was ringing in the street always the servants of the company were delivering handbills stating the case clearly and always the people talked and filled the months with bitter and then hopeless resenting schools gave breakfasts chapels gave soup welltodo people gave teas—the children enjoyed it but we who knew the faces of the old men and the privations of the women breathed a cold disheartening atmosphere of sorrow and trouble  determined poaching was carried on in the squires woods and warrens annable defended his game heroically one man was at home with a leg supposed to be wounded by a fall on the slippery roads—but really by a mantrap in the woods then annable caught two men and they were sentenced to two months imprisonment  on both the lodge gates of highclose—on our side and on the far eberwich side—were posted notices that trespassers on the drive or in the grounds would be liable to punishment these posters were soon mudded over and fresh ones fixed  the men loitering on the road by nethermere looked angrily at lettie as she passed in her black furs which leslie had given her and their remarks were pungent she heard them and they burned in her heart from my mother she inherited democratic views which she now proceeded to debate warmly with her lover  then she tried to talk to leslie about the strike he heard her with mild superiority smiled and said she did not know women jumped to conclusions at the first touch of feeling men must look at a thing all round then make a decision—nothing hasty and impetuous—careful longthoughtout correct decisions women could not be expected to understand these things business was not for them in fact their mission was above business—etc etc unfortunately lettie was the wrong woman to treat thus  so said she with a quiet hopeless tone of finality  there now you understand dont you minnehaha my laughing water—so laugh again darling and dont worry about these things we will not talk about them any more eh  no more  no more—thats right—you are as wise as an angel come here—pooh the wood is thick and lonely look there is nobody in the world but us and you are my heaven and earth  and hell  ah—if you are so cold—how cold you are—it gives me little shivers when you look so—and i am always hot—lettie  well  you are cruel kiss me—now—no i dont want your cheek—kiss me yourself why dont you say something  what for whats the use of saying anything when theres nothing immediate to say  you are offended  it feels like snow today she answered  at last however winter began to gather her limbs to rise and drift with saddened garments northward  the strike was over the men had compromised it was a gentle way of telling them they were beaten but the strike was over  the birds fluttered and dashed the catkins on the hazel loosened their winter rigidity and swung soft tassels all through the day sounded long sweet whistlings from the brushes then later loud laughing shouts of bird triumph on every hand  i remember a day when the breast of the hills was heaving in a last quick waking sigh and the blue eyes of the waters opened bright across the infinite skies of march great rounded masses of cloud had sailed stately all day domed with a white radiance softened with faint fleeting shadows as if companies of angels were gently sweeping past adorned with resting silken shadows like those of a full white breast all day the clouds had moved on to their vast destination and i had clung to the earth yearning and impatient i took a brush and tried to paint them then i raged at myself i wished that in all the wild valley where cloud shadows were travelling like pilgrims something would call me forth from my rooted loneliness through all the grandeur of the white and blue day the poised cloud masses swung their slow flight and left me unnoticed  at evening they were all gone and the empty sky like a blue bubble over us swam on its pale bright rims  leslie came and asked his betrothed to go out with him under the darkening wonderful bubble she bade me accompany her and to escape from myself i went  it was warm in the shelter of the wood and in the crouching hollows of the hills but over the slanting shoulders of the hills the wind swept whipping the redness into our faces  get me some of those alder catkins leslie said lettie as we came down to the stream  yes those where they hang over the brook they are ruddy like new blood freshening under the skin look tassels of crimson and gold she pointed to the dusty hazel catkins mingled with the alder on her bosom then she began to quote christina rossettis a birthday  im glad you came to take me a walk she continued—doesnt strelley mill look pretty like a group of orange and scarlet fungi in a fairy picture do you know i havent been no not for quite a long time shall we call now  the daylight will be gone if we do it is half past five—more i saw him—the son—the other morning  where  he was carting manure—i made haste by  did he speak to you—did you look at him  no he said nothing i glanced at him—hes just the same brick colour—stolid mind that stone—it rocks im glad youve got strong boots on  seeing that i usually wear them——  she stood poised a moment on a large stone the fresh spring brook hastening towards her deepening sidling round her  you wont call and see them then she asked  no i like to hear the brook tinkling dont you he replied  ah yes—its full of music  shall we go on he said impatient but submissive  ill catch up in a minute said i  i went in and found emily putting some bread into the oven  come out for a walk said i  now let me tell mother—i was longing——  she ran and put on her long grey coat and her red tamoshanter as we went down the yard george called to me  ill come back i shouted  he came to the crewyard gate to see us off when we came out onto the path we saw lettie standing on the top bar of the stile balancing with her hand on leslies head she saw us she saw george and she waved to us leslie was looking up at her anxiously she waved again then we could hear her laughing and telling him excitedly to stand still and steady her while she turned she turned round and leaped with a great flutter like a big bird launching down from the top of the stile to the ground and into his arms then we climbed the steep hillside—sunny bank that had once shone yellow with wheat and now waved black tattered ranks of thistles where the rabbits ran we passed the little cottages in the hollow scooped out of the hill and gained the highlands that look out over leicestershire to charnwood on the left and away into the mountain knob of derbyshire straight in front and towards the right  the upper road is all grassy fallen into long disuse it used to lead from the abbey to the hall but now it ends blindly on the hillbrow half way along is the old white house farm with its green mounting steps mouldering outside ladies have mounted here and ridden towards the vale of belvoir—but now a labourer holds the farm  we came to the quarries and looked in at the limekilns  let us go right into the wood out of the quarry said leslie i have not been since i was a little lad  it is trespassing said emily  we dont trespass he replied grandiloquently  so we went along by the hurrying brook which fell over little cascades in its haste never looking once at the primroses that were glimmering all along its banks we turned aside and climbed the hill through the woods velvety green sprigs of dogmercury were scattered on the red soil we came to the top of a slope where the wood thinned as i talked to emily i became dimly aware of a whiteness over the ground she exclaimed with surprise and i found that i was walking in the first shades of twilight over clumps of snowdrops the hazels were thin and only here and there an oak tree uprose all the ground was white with snowdrops like drops of manna scattered over the red earth on the greygreen clusters of leaves there was a deep little dell sharp sloping like a cup and white sprinkling of flowers all the way down with white flowers showing pale among the first inpouring of shadow at the bottom the earth was red and warm pricked with the dark succulent green of bluebell sheaths and embroidered with greygreen clusters of spears and many white flowerets high above above the light tracery of hazel the weird oaks tangled in the sunset below in the first shadows drooped hosts of little white flowers so silent and sad it seemed like a holy communion of pure wild things numberless frail and folded meekly in the evening light other flower companies are glad stately barbaric hordes of bluebells merryheaded cowslip groups even light tossing woodanemones but snowdrops are sad and mysterious we have lost their meaning they do not belong to us who ravish them the girls bent among them touching them with their fingers and symbolising the yearning which i felt folded in the twilight these conquered flowerets are sad like forlorn little friends of dryads  what do they mean do you think said lettie in a low voice as her white fingers touched the flowers and her black furs fell on them  there are not so many this year said leslie  they remind me of mistletoe which is never ours though we wear it said emily to me  what do you think they say—what do they make you think cyril lettie repeated  i dont know emily says they belong to some old wild lost religion they were the symbol of tears perhaps to some strange hearted druid folk before us  more than tears said lettie more than tears they are so still something out of an old religion that we have lost they make me feel afraid  what should you have to fear asked leslie  if i knew i shouldnt fear she answered look at all the snowdrops—they hung in dim strange flecks among the dusky leaves—look at them—closed up retreating powerless they belong to some knowledge we have lost that i have lost and that i need i feel afraid they seem like something in fate do you think cyril we can lose things off the earth—like mastodons and those old monstrosities—but things that matter—wisdom  it is against my creed said i  i believe i have lost something said she  come said leslie dont trouble with fancies come with me to the bottom of this cup and see how strange it will be with the sky marked with branches like a filigree lid  she rose and followed him down the steep side of the pit crying ah you are treading on the flowers  no said he i am being very careful  they sat down together on a fallen tree at the bottom she leaned forward her fingers wandering white among the shadowed grey spaces of leaves plucking as if it were a rite flowers here and there he could not see her face  dont you care for me he asked softly  you—she sat up and looked at him and laughed strangely you do not seem real to me she replied in a strange voice  for some time they sat thus both bowed and silent birds skirred off from the bushes and emily looked up with a great start as a quiet sardonic voice said above us  a dovecot my eyes if it aint it struck me i eered a cooin an eres th birds come on sweethearts its th wrong place for billin an cooin in th middle o these ere snowdrops lets ave yer names come on  clear off you fool answered leslie from below jumping up in anger  we all four turned and looked at the keeper he stood in the rim of light darkly fine powerful form menacing us he did not move but like some malicious pan looked down on us and said  very pretty—pretty two—and two makes four tis true two and two makes four come on come on out o this ere bridal bed an lets ave a look at yer  cant you use your eyes you fool replied leslie standing up and helping lettie with her furs at any rate you can see there are ladies here  very sorry sir you cant tell a lady from a woman at this distance at dusk who may you be sir  clear out come along lettie you cant stay here now  they climbed into the light  oh very sorry mr tempest—when yer look down on a man he never looks the same i thought it was some young fools come here dallyin—  damn you—shut up exclaimed leslie—i beg your pardon lettie will you have my arm  they looked very elegant the pair of them lettie was wearing a long coat which fitted close she had a small hat whose feathers flushed straight back with her hair  the keeper looked at them then smiling he went down the dell with great strides and returned saying well the lady might as well take her gloves  she took them from him shrinking to leslie then she started and said  let me fetch my flowers  she ran for the handful of snowdrops that lay among the roots of the trees we all watched her  sorry i made such a mistake—a lady said annable but ive nearly forgot the sight o one—save the squires daughters who are never out o nights  i should think you never have seen many—unless— have you ever been a groom  no groom but a bridegroom sir and then i think id rather groom a horse than a lady for i got well bit—if you will excuse me sir  and you deserved it—no doubt  i got it—an i wish you better luck sir ones more a man here in th wood though than in my ladys parlour it strikes me  a ladys parlour laughed leslie indulgent in his amusement at the facetious keeper  oh yes will you walk into my parlour——  youre very smart for a keeper  oh yes sir—i was once a ladys man but id rather watch th rabbits an th birds an its easier breeding brats in th kennels than in th town  they are yours are they said i  you know em do you sir arent they a lovely little litter—arent they a pretty bag o ferrets—natural as weasels—thats what i said they should be—bred up like a bunch o young foxes to run as they would  emily had joined lettie and they kept aloof from the man they instinctively hated  theyll get nicely trapped one of these days said i  theyre natural—they can fend for themselves like wild beasts do he replied grinning  you are not doing your duty it strikes me put in leslie sententiously  the man laughed  duties of parents—tell me ive need of it ive nine—that is eight and one not far off she breeds well the owd lass—one every two years—nine in fourteen years—done well hasnt she  youve done pretty badly i think  i—why its natural when a mans more than nature hes a devil be a good animal says i whether its man or woman you sir a good natural male animal the lady there—a female un—thats proper as long as yer enjoy it  and what then  do as th animals do i watch my brats—i let em grow theyre beauties they are—sound as a young ash pole every one they shant learn to dirty themselves wi smirking deviltry—not if i can help it they can be like birds or weasels or vipers or squirrels so long as they aint human rot thats what i say  its one way of looking at things said leslie  ay look at the women looking at us im something between a bull and a couple of worms stuck together i am see that spink he raised his voice for the girls to hear pretty isnt he what for—and what for do you wear a fancy vest and twist your moustache sir what for at the bottom ha—tell a woman not to come in a wood till she can look at natural things—she might see something—good night sir  he marched off into the darkness  coarse fellow that said leslie when he had rejoined lettie but hes a character  he makes you shudder she replied but yet you are interested in him i believe he has a history  he seems to lack something said emily  i thought him rather a fine fellow said i  splendidly built fellow but callous—no soul remarked leslie dismissing the question  no assented emily no soul—and among the snowdrops  lettie was thoughtful and i smiled  it was a beautiful evening still with red shaken clouds in the west the moon in heaven was turning wistfully back to the east dark purple woods lay around us painting out the distance the near wild ruined land looked sad and strange under the pale afterglow the turf path was fine and springy  let us run said lettie and joining hands we raced wildly along with a flutter and a breathless laughter till we were happy and forgetful when we stopped we exclaimed at once hark  a child said lettie  at the kennels said i  we hurried forward from the house came the mad yelling and yelping of children and the wild hysterical shouting of a woman  tha little devil—tha little devil—tha shanna—that tha shanna and this was accompanied by the hollow sound of blows and a pandemonium of howling we rushed in and found the woman in a tousled frenzy belabouring a youngster with an enamelled pan the lad was rolled up like a young hedgehog—the woman held him by the foot and like a flail came the hollow utensil thudding on his shoulders and back he lay in the firelight and howled while scattered in various groups with the leaping firelight twinkling over their tears and their open mouths were the other children crying too the mother was in a state of hysteria her hair streamed over her face and her eyes were fixed in a stare of overwrought irritation up and down went her long arm like a windmill sail i ran and held it when she could hit no more the woman dropped the pan from her nerveless hand and staggered trembling to the squab she looked desperately weary and fordone—she clasped and unclasped her hands continually emily hushed the children while lettie hushed the mother holding her hard cracked hands as she swayed to and fro gradually the mother became still and sat staring in front of her then aimlessly she began to finger the jewels on letties finger  emily was bathing the cheek of a little girl who lifted up her voice and wept loudly when she saw the speck of blood on the cloth but presently she became quiet too and emily could empty the water from the late instrument of castigation and at last light the lamp  i found sam under the table in a little heap i put out my hand for him and he wriggled away like a lizard into the passage after a while i saw him in a corner lying whimpering with little savage cries of pain i cut off his retreat and captured him bearing him struggling into the kitchen then weary with pain he became passive  we undressed him and found his beautiful white body all discoloured with bruises the mother began to sob again with a chorus of babies the girls tried to soothe the weeping while i rubbed butter into the silent wincing boy then his mother caught him in her arms and kissed him passionately and cried with abandon the boy let himself be kissed—then he too began to sob till his little body was all shaken they folded themselves together the poor dishevelled mother and the halfnaked boy and wept themselves still then she took him to bed and the girls helped the other little ones into their nightgowns and soon the house was still  i canna manage em i canna said the mother mournfully they growin beyont me—i dunna know what to do wi em an niver a and does e lift ter elp me—no—e cares not a thing for me—not a thing—nowt but makes a mock an a sludge o me  ah baby said lettie setting the bonny boy on his feet and holding up his trailing nightgown behind him do you want to walk to your mother—go then—ah  the child a handsome little fellow of some sixteen months toddled across to his mother waving his hands as he went and laughing while his large hazel eyes glowed with pleasure his mother caught him pushed the silken brown hair back from his forehead and laid his cheek against hers  ah she said thas got a funny dad tha has not like another man no my duckie es got no art ter care for nobody e asna ma pigeon—no—lives like a stranger to his own flesh an blood  the girl with the wounded cheek had found comfort in leslie she was seated on his knee looking at him with solemn blue eyes her solemnity increased by the quaint round head whose black hair was cut short  s my chalk yes it is n our sam says as its issen an e taes it and marks it all gone so i wouldna gie t im—she clutched in her fat little hand a piece of red chalk my dad gen it me ter mark my dollys face red whats ony wood—ill show yer  she wriggled down and holding up her trailing gown with one hand trotted to a corner piled with a childs rubbish and hauled out a hideous carven caricature of a woman and brought it to leslie the face of the object was streaked with red  ere sh is my dolly what my dad make me—er names lady mima  is it said lettie and are these her cheeks shes not pretty is she  um—sh is my dad says sh is—like a lady  and he gave you her rouge did he  rouge she nodded  and you wouldnt let sam have it  no—an mi mower says dun

amercy e ll be in in a minute come on ere  she hustled the children to bed swept the litter into a corner and began to lay the table the cloth was spotless and she put him a silver spoon in the saucer  we had only just got out of the house when he drew near i saw his massive figure in the doorway and the big prolific woman moved subserviently about the room  hullo proserpine—had visitors  i never axed em—they come in earin th childer cryin i never encouraged em——  we hurried away into the night ah its always the woman bears the burden said lettie bitterly  if hed helped her—wouldnt she have been a fine woman now—splendid but shes dragged to bits men are brutes—and marriage just gives scope to them said emily  oh you wouldnt take that as a fair sample of marriage replied leslie think of you and me minnehaha  ay  oh—i meant to tell you—what do you think of greymede old vicarage for us  its a lovely old place exclaimed lettie and we passed out of hearing  we stumbled over the rough path the moon was bright and we stepped apprehensively on the shadows thrown from the trees for they lay so black and substantial occasionally a moonbeam would trace out a suave white branch that the rabbits had gnawed quite bare in the hard winter we came out of the woods into the full heavens the northern sky was full of a gush of green light in front eclipsed orion leaned over his bed and the moon followed  when the northern lights are up said emily i feel so strange—half eerie—they do fill you with awe dont they  yes said i they make you wonder and look and expect something  what do you expect she said softly and looked up and saw me smiling and she looked down again biting her lips  when we came to the parting of the roads emily begged them just to step into the mill—just for a moment—and lettie consented  the kitchen window was uncurtained and the blind as usual was not drawn we peeped in through the cords of budding honeysuckle george and alice were sitting at the table playing chess the mother was mending a coat and the father as usual was reading alice was talking quietly and george was bent on the game his arms lay on the table  we made a noise at the door and entered george rose heavily shook hands and sat down again  hullo lettie beardsall you are a stranger said alice are you so much engaged  ay—we dont see much of her nowadays added the father in his jovial way  and isnt she a toff in her fine hat and furs and snowdrops look at her george youve never looked to see what a toff she is  he raised his eyes and looked at her apparel and at her flowers but not at her face  ay she is fine he said and returned to the chess  we have been gathering snowdrops said lettie fingering the flowers in her bosom  they are pretty—give me some will you said alice holding out her hand lettie gave her the flowers  check said george deliberately  get out replied his opponent ive got some snowdrops—dont they suit me an innocent little soul like me lettie wont wear them—shes not meek and mild and innocent like me do you want some  if you like—what for  to make you pretty of course and to show you an innocent little meekling  youre in check he said  where can you wear them—theres only your shirt aw—there—she stuck a few flowers in his ruffled black hair—look lettie isnt he sweet  lettie laughed with a strained little laugh  hes like bottom and the asss head she said  then im titania—dont i make a lovely fairy queen bully bottom—and whos jealous oberon  he reminds me of that man in hedda gabler—crowned with vine leaves—oh yes vine leaves said emily  hows your mares sprain mr tempest george asked taking no notice of the flowers in his hair  oh—shell soon be all right thanks  ah—george told me about it put in the father and he held leslie in conversation  am i in check george said alice returning to the game she knitted her brows and cogitated  pooh she said thats soon remedied—she moved her piece and said triumphantly now sir  he surveyed the game and with deliberation moved alice pounced on him with a leap of her knight she called check  i didnt see it—you may have the game now he said  beaten my boy—dont crow over a woman any more stalemate—with flowers in your hair  he put his hand to his head and felt among his hair and threw the flowers on the table  would you believe it—— said the mother coming into the room from the dairy  what we all asked  nickie bens been and eaten the sile cloth yes when i went to wash it there sat nickie ben gulping and wiping the froth off his whiskers  george laughed loudly and heartily he laughed till he was tired lettie looked and wondered when he would be done  i imagined he gasped how hed feel with half a yard of muslin creeping down his throttle  this laughter was most incongruous he went off into another burst alice laughed too—it was easy to infect her with laughter then the father began—and in walked nickie ben stepping disconsolately—we all roared again till the rafters shook only lettie looked impatiently for the end george swept his bare arms across the table and the scattered little flowers fell broken to the ground  oh—what a shame exclaimed lettie  what said he looking round your flowers do you feel sorry for them—youre too tender hearted isnt she cyril  always was—for dumb animals and things said i  dont you wish you was a little dumb animal georgie said alice  he smiled putting away the chessmen  shall we go dear said lettie to leslie  if you are ready he replied rising with alacrity  i am tired she said plaintively  he attended to her with little tender solicitations  have we walked too far he asked  no its not that no—its the snowdrops and the man and the children—and everything i feel just a bit exhausted  she kissed alice and emily and the mother  goodnight alice she said its not altogether my fault were strangers you know—really—im just the same—really only you imagine and then what can i do  she said farewell to george and looked at him through a quiver of suppressed tears  george was somewhat flushed with triumph over lettie she had gone home with tears shaken from her eyes unknown to her lover at the farm george laughed with alice  we escorted alice home to eberwich—like a blooming little monkey dangling from two boughs as she put it when we swung her along on our arms we laughed and said many preposterous things george wanted to kiss her at parting but she tipped him under the chin and said sweet as one does to a canary then she laughed with her tongue between her teeth and ran indoors  she is a little devil said he  we took the long way home by greymede and passed the dark schools  come on said he lets go in the ram inn and have a look at my cousin meg  it was half past ten when he marched me across the road and into the sanded passage of the little inn the place had been an important farm in the days of georges granduncle but since his decease it had declined under the governance of the widow and a manofallwork the old grandaunt was propped and supported by a splendid granddaughter the near kin of meg were all in california so she a bonny delightful girl of twentyfour stayed near her grandma  as we tramped grittily down the passage the red head of bill poked out of the bar and he said as he recognised george  goodevnin—go forward—ers non abed yit  we went forward and unlatched the kitchen door the greataunt was seated in her little roundbacked armchair sipping her nightcap  well george my lad she cried in her querulous voice tha niver says its thai does ter thats comn for summat for sure else what brings thee ter see me  no he said ahn com ter see thee nowt else wheers meg  ah—ha—ha—ah—me did ter say—come ter see me—ha—wheers meg—an whos this young gentleman  i was formally introduced and shook the clammy corded hand of the old lady  tha looks delikit she observed shaking her cap and its scarlet geraniums sadly cum now sit thee down an dunna look so long o th leg  i sat down on the sofa on the cushions covered with blue and red checks the room was very hot and i stared about uncomfortably the old lady sat peering at nothing in reverie she was a hardvisaged bosomless dame clad in thick black clothlike armour and wearing an immense twisted gold brooch in the lace at her neck  we heard heavy quick footsteps above  ers commin remarked the old lady rousing from her apathy the footsteps came downstairs—quickly then cautiously round the bend meg appeared in the doorway she started with surprise saying  well i eered sumbody but i never thought it was you more colour still flamed into her glossy cheeks and she smiled in her fresh frank way i think i have never seen a woman who had more physical charm there was a voluptuous fascination in her every outline and movement one never listened to the words that came from her lips one watched the ripe motion of those red fruits  get em a drop o whiskey meg—youll ae a drop  i declined firmly but did not escape  nay declared the old dame i sll hae none o thy nos should ter like it ot—say th word an tha as it  i did not say the word  then gie im claret pronounced my hostess though its thinbellied stuff ter go to ter bed on—and claret it was  meg went out again to see about closing the grandaunt sighed and sighed again for no perceptible reason but the whiskey  its well youve come ter see me now she moaned for youll none ae a chance next time you comen—no—im all gone but my cap—— she shook that geraniumed erection and i wondered what sardonic fate left it behind  an im forced ter say it i sll be thankful to be gone she added after a few sighs  this weariness of the flesh was touching the cruel truth is however that the old lady clung to life like a louse to a pigs back dying she faintly but emphatically declared herself a bit better—a bit better i sll be up tomorrow  i should a gone before now she continued but for that blessed wench—i canna abear to think o leavin er—come drink up my lad drink up—nay tha rt nobbut young yet tha rt none topped up wi a thimbleful  i took whiskey in preference to the acrid stuff  ay resumed the grandaunt i canna go in peace till ers settled—an ers that tickle o choosin th right sort asnt th gumption ter ax er  she sniffed and turned scornfully to her glass george grinned and looked conscious as he swallowed a gulp of whiskey it crackled in his throat the sound annoyed the old lady  tha might be scard at summat she said tha niver ad six drops o spunk in thee  she turned again with a sniff to her glass he frowned with irritation half filled his glass with liquor and drank again  i dare bet as tha niver kissed a wench in thy life—not proper—and she tossed the last drops of her toddy down her skinny throat  here meg came along the passage  come granma she said im sure its time as you was in bed—come on  sit thee down an drink a drop wis—its not ivry night as we ae cumpny  no let me take you to bed—im sure you must be ready  sit thee down ere i say an get thee a drop o port come—no argybargyin  meg fetched more glasses and a decanter i made a place for her between me and george we all had port wine meg naïve and unconscious waited on us deliciously her cheeks gleamed like satin when she laughed save when the dimples held the shadow her suave tawny neck was bare and bewitching she turned suddenly to george as he asked her a question and they found their faces close together he kissed her and when she started back jumped and kissed her neck with warmth  là—là—dy—dà—là—dy—dà—dy—dà cried the old woman in delight and she clutched her wineglass  come on—chink she cried all together—chink to him  we four chinked and drank george poured wine in a tumbler and drank it off he was getting excited and all the energy and passion that normally were bound down by his caution and selfinstinct began to flame out  here aunt said he lifting his tumbler heres to what you want—you know  i knowed tha wor as spunky as ony onem she cried tha nobbut wanted warmin up ill see as youre all right its a bargain chink again ivrybody  a bargain said he before he put his lips to the glass  what bargains that said meg  the old lady laughed loudly and winked at george who with his lips wet with wine got up and kissed meg soundly saying  there it is—that seals it  meg wiped her face with her big pinafore and seemed uncomfortable  arent you comin granma she pleaded  eh tha wants ter orry me off—whats thai say george—a deep un isna er  dunna go aunt dunna be hustled off  tush—pish snorted the old lady yah tha rt a slow un an no mistakes get a candle meg im ready  meg brought a brass bedroom candlestick bill brought in the money in a tin box and delivered it into the hands of the old lady  go thy ways to bed now lad said she to the ugly wizened servingman he sat in a corner and pulled off his boots  come an kiss me goodnight george said the old woman—and as he did so she whispered in his ear whereat he laughed loudly she poured whiskey into her glass and called to the servingman to drink it then pulling herself up heavily she leaned on meg and went upstairs she had been a big woman one could see but now her shapeless broken figure looked pitiful beside megs luxuriant form we heard them slowly laboriously climb the stairs george sat pulling his moustache and halfsmiling his eyes were alight with that peculiar childish look they had when he was experiencing new and doubtful sensations then he poured himself more whiskey  i say steady i admonished  what for he replied indulging himself like a spoiled child and laughing  bill who had sat for some time looking at the hole in his stocking drained his glass and with a sad goodnight creaked off upstairs  presently meg came down and i rose and said we must be going  ill just come an lock the door after you said she standing uneasily waiting  george got up he gripped the edge of the table to steady himself then he got his balance and with his eyes on meg said  ere he nodded his head to her come here i want ter ax thee sumwhat  she looked at him halfsmiling half doubtful he put his arm round her and looking down into her eyes with his face very close to hers said  lets hae a kiss  quite unresisting she yielded him her mouth looking at him intently with her bright brown eyes he kissed her and pressed her closely to him  im going to marry thee he said  go on she replied softly half glad half doubtful  i am an all he repeated pressing her more tightly to him  i went down the passage and stood in the open doorway looking out into the night it seemed a long time then i heard the thin voice of the old woman at the top of the stairs  meg meg send im off now come on  in the silence that followed there was a murmur of voices and then they came into the passage  goodnight my lad good luck to thee cried the voice like a ghoul from upper regions  he kissed his betrothed a rather hurried goodnight at the door  goodnight she replied softly watching him retreat then we heard her shoot the heavy bolts  you know he began and he tried to clear his throat his voice was husky and strangulated with excitement he tried again  you know—she—shes a clinker  i did not reply but he took no notice  damn he ejaculated what did i let her go for  we walked along in silence—his excitement abated somewhat  its the way she swings her body—an the curves as she stands its when you look at her—you feel—you know  i suppose i knew but it was unnecessary to say so  you know—if ever i dream in the night—of women—you know—its always meg she seems to look so soft and to curve her body——  gradually his feet began to drag when we came to the place where the colliery railway crossed the road he stumbled and pitched forward only just recovering himself i took hold of his arm  good lord cyril am i drunk he said  not quite said i  no he muttered couldnt be  but his feet dragged again and he began to stagger from side to side i took hold of his arm he murmured angrily—then subsiding again muttered with slovenly articulation  i—i feel fit to drop with sleep  along the dead silent roadway and through the uneven blackness of the wood we lurched and stumbled he was very heavy and difficult to direct when at last we came to the brook we splashed straight through the water i urged him to walk steadily and quietly across the yard he did his best and we made a fairly still entry into the farm he dropped with all his weight on the sofa and leaning down began to unfasten his leggings in the midst of his fumblings he fell asleep and i was afraid he would pitch forward on to his head i took off his leggings and his wet boots and his collar then as i was pushing and shaking him awake to get off his coat i heard a creaking on the stairs and my heart sank for i thought it was his mother but it was emily in her long white nightgown she looked at us with great dark eyes of terror and whispered whats the matter  i shook my head and looked at him his head had dropped down on his chest again  is he hurt she asked her voice becoming audible and dangerous he lifted his head and looked at her with heavy angry eyes  george she said sharply in bewilderment and fear his eyes seemed to contract evilly  is he drunk she whispered shrinking away and looking at me have you made him drunk—you  i nodded i too was angry  oh if mother gets up i must get him to bed oh how could you  this sibilant whispering irritated him and me i tugged at his coat he snarled incoherently and swore she caught her breath he looked at her sharply and i was afraid he would wake himself into a rage  go upstairs i whispered to her she shook her head i could see him taking heavy breaths and the veins of his neck were swelling i was furious at her disobedience  go at once i said fiercely and she went still hesitating and looking back  i had hauled off his coat and waistcoat so i let him sink again into stupidity while i took off my boots then i got him to his feet and walking behind him impelled him slowly upstairs i lit a candle in his bedroom there was no sound from the other rooms so i undressed him and got him in bed at last somehow i covered him up and put over him the calfskin rug because the night was cold almost immediately he began to breathe heavily i dragged him over to his side and pillowed his head comfortably he looked like a tired boy asleep  i stood still now i felt myself alone and looked round up to the low roof rose the carven pillars of dark mahogany there was a chair by the bed and a little yellow chest of drawers by the windows that was all the furniture save the calfskin rug on the floor in the drawers i noticed a book it was a copy of omar khayyam that lettie had given him in her khayyam days a little shilling book with coloured illustrations  i blew out the candle when i had looked at him again as i crept on to the landing emily peeped from her room whispering is he in bed  i nodded and whispered goodnight then i went home heavily  after the evening at the farm lettie and leslie drew closer together they eddied unevenly down the little stream of courtship jostling and drifting together and apart he was unsatisfied and strove with every effort to bring her close to him submissive gradually she yielded and submitted to him she folded round her and him the snug curtain of the present and they sat like children playing a game behind the hangings of an old bed she shut out all distant outlooks as an arab unfolds his tent and conquers the mystery and space of the desert so she lived gleefully in a little tent of present pleasures and fancies  occasionally only occasionally she would peep from her tent into the out space then she sat poring over books and nothing would be able to draw her away or she sat in her room looking out of the window for hours together she pleaded headaches mother said liver he angry like a spoilt child denied his wish declared it moodiness and perversity           chapter ii     a shadow in spring  with spring came trouble the saxtons declared they were being bitten off the estate by rabbits suddenly in a fit of despair the father bought a gun although he knew that the squire would not for one moment tolerate the shooting of that manna the rabbits yet he was out in the first cold morning twilight banging away at first he but scared the brutes and brought annable on the scene then blooded by the use of the weapon he played havoc among the furry beasts bringing home some eight or nine couples  george entirely approved of this measure it rejoiced him even yet he had never had the initiative to begin the like himself or even to urge his father to it he prophesied trouble and possible loss of the farm it disturbed him somewhat to think they must look out for another place but he postponed the thought of the evil day till the time should be upon him  a vendetta was established between the mill and the keeper annable the latter cherished his rabbits  call em vermin he said i only know one sort of vermin—and thats the talkin sort so he set himself to thwart and harass the rabbit slayers  it was about this time i cultivated the acquaintance of the keeper all the world hated him—to the people in the villages he was like a devil of the woods some miners had sworn vengeance on him for having caused their committal to gaol but he had a great attraction for me his magnificent physique his great vigour and vitality and his swarthy gloomy face drew me  he was a man of one idea—that all civilisation was the painted fungus of rottenness he hated any sign of culture i won his respect one afternoon when he found me trespassing in the woods because i was watching some maggots at work in a dead rabbit that led us to a discussion of life he was a thorough materialist—he scorned religion and all mysticism he spent his days sleeping making intricate traps for weasels and men putting together a gun or doing some amateur forestry cutting down timber splitting it in logs for use in the hall and planting young trees when he thought he reflected on the decay of mankind—the decline of the human race into folly and weakness and rottenness be a good animal true to your animal instinct was his motto with all this he was fundamentally very unhappy—and he made me also wretched it was this power to communicate his unhappiness that made me somewhat dear to him i think he treated me as an affectionate father treats a delicate son i noticed he liked to put his hand on my shoulder or my knee as we talked yet withal he asked me questions and saved his thoughts to tell me and believed in my knowledge like any acolyte  i went up to the quarry woods one evening in early april taking a look for annable i could not find him however in the wood so i left the wildlands and went along by the old red wall of the kitchen garden along the main road as far as the mouldering church which stands high on a bank by the roadside just where the trees tunnel the darkness and the gloom of the highway startles the travellers at noon great trees growing on the banks suddenly fold over everything at this point in the swinging road and in the obscurity rots the hall church black and melancholy above the shrinking head of the traveller  the grassy path to the churchyard was still clogged with decayed leaves the church is abandoned as i drew near an owl floated softly out of the black tower grass overgrew the threshold i pushed open the door grinding back a heap of fallen plaster and rubbish and entered the place in the twilight the pews were leaning in ghostly disorder the prayerbooks dragged from their ledges scattered on the floor in the dust and rubble torn by mice and birds birds scuffled in the darkness of the roof i looked up in the upward well of the tower i could see a bell hanging i stooped and picked up a piece of plaster from the ragged confusion of feathers and broken nests and remnants of dead birds up into the vault overhead i tossed pieces of plaster until one hit the bell and it tonged out its faint remonstrance there was a rustle of many birds like spirits i sounded the bell again and dark forms moved with cries of alarm overhead and something fell heavily i shivered in the dark evilsmelling place and hurried to get out of doors i clutched my hands with relief and pleasure when i saw the sky above me quivering with the last crystal lights and the lowest red of sunset behind the yewboles i drank the fresh air that sparkled with the sound of the blackbirds and thrushes whistling their strong bright notes  i strayed round to where the headstones from their eminence leaned to look on the hall below where great windows shone yellow light on to the flagged courtyard and the little fish pool a stone staircase descended from the graveyard to the court between stone balustrades whose pockmarked grey columns still swelled gracefully and with dignity encrusted with lichens the staircase was filled with ivy and rambling roses—impassable ferns were unrolling round the big square halting place half way down where the stairs turned  a peacock startled from the back premises of the hall came flapping up the terraces to the churchyard then a heavy footstep crossed the flags it was the keeper i whistled the whistle he knew and he broke his way through the vicious roseboughs up the stairs the peacock flapped beyond me on to the neck of an old bowed angel rough and dark an angel which had long ceased sorrowing for the lost lucy and had died also the bird bent its voluptuous neck and peered about then it lifted up its head and yelled the sound tore the dark sanctuary of twilight the old grey grass seemed to stir and i could fancy the smothered primroses and violets beneath it waking and gasping for fear  the keeper looked at me and smiled he nodded his head towards the peacock saying  hark at that damned thing  again the bird lifted its crested head and gave a cry at the same time turning awkwardly on its ugly legs so that it showed us the full wealth of its tail glimmering like a stream of coloured stars over the sunken face of the angel  the proud fool—look at it perched on an angel too as if it were a pedestal for vanity thats the soul of a woman—or its the devil  he was silent for a time and we watched the great bird moving uneasily before us in the twilight  thats the very soul of a lady he said the very very soul damn the thing to perch on that old angel i should like to wring its neck  again the bird screamed and shifted awkwardly on its legs it seemed to stretch its beak at us in derision annable picked up a piece of sod and flung it at the bird saying  get out you screeching devil god he laughed there must be plenty of hearts twisting under here—and he stamped on a grave when they hear that row  he kicked another sod from a grave and threw at the big bird the peacock flapped away over the tombs down the terraces  just look he said the miserable brute has dirtied that angel a woman to the end i tell you all vanity and screech and defilement  he sat down on a vault and lit his pipe but before he had smoked two minutes it was out again i had not seen him in a state of perturbation before  the church said i is rotten i suppose theyll stand all over the country like this soon—with peacocks trailing the graveyards  ay he muttered taking no notice of me  this stone is cold i said rising  he got up too and stretched his arms as if he were tired it was quite dark save for the waxing moon which leaned over the east  it is a very fine night i said dont you notice a smell of violets  ay the moon looks like a woman with child i wonder what times got in her belly  you i said you dont expect anything exciting do you  exciting—no—about as exciting as this rotten old place—just rot off—oh my god—im like a good house built and finished and left to tumble down again with nobody to live in it  why—whats up—really  he laughed bitterly saying come and sit down  he led me off to a seat by the north door between two pews very black and silent there we sat he putting his gun carefully beside him he remained perfectly still thinking  whots up he said at last why—ill tell you i went to cambridge—my father was a big cattle dealer—he died bankrupt while i was in college and i never took my degree they persuaded me to be a parson and a parson i was  i went a curate to a little place in leicestershire—a bonnie place with not many people and a fine old church and a great rich parsonage i hadnt overmuch to do and the rector—he was the son of an earl—was generous he lent me a horse and would have me hunt like the rest i always think of that place with a smell of honeysuckle while the grass is wet in the morning it was fine and i enjoyed myself and did the parish work all right i believe i was pretty good  a cousin of the rectors used to come in the hunting season—a lady crystabel lady in her own right the second year i was there she came in june there wasnt much company so she used to talk to me—i used to read then—and she used to pretend to be so childish and unknowing and would get me telling her things and talking to her and i was hot on things we must play tennis together and ride together and i must row her down the river she said we were in the wilderness and could do as we liked she made me wear flannels and soft clothes she was very fine and frank and unconventional—ripping i thought her all the summer she stopped on i should meet her in the garden early in the morning when i came from a swim in the river—it was cleared and deepened on purpose—and shed blush and make me walk with her i can remember i used to stand and dry myself on the bank full where she might see me—i was mad on her—and she was madder on me  we went to some caves in derbyshire once and she would wander from the rest and loiter and for a game we played a sort of hide and seek with the party they thought wed gone and they went and locked the door then she pretended to be frightened and clung to me and said what would they think and hid her face in my coat i took her and kissed her and we made it up properly i found out afterwards—she actually told me—shed got the idea from a sloppy french novel—the romance of a poor young man i was the poor young man  we got married she gave me a living she had in her parsonage and we went to live at her hall she wouldnt let me out of her sight lord—we were an infatuated couple—and she would choose to view me in an aesthetic light i was greek statues for her bless you croton hercules i dont know what she had her own way too much—i let her do as she liked with me  then gradually she got tired—it took her three years to be really glutted with me i had a physique then—for that matter i have now  he held out his arm to me and bade me try his muscle i was startled the hard flesh almost filled his sleeve  ah he continued you dont know what it is to have the pride of a body like mine but she wouldnt have children—no she wouldnt—said she darent that was the root of the difference at first but she cooled down and if you dont know the pride of my body youd never know my humiliation i tried to remonstrate—and she looked simply astounded at my cheek i never got over that amazement  she began to get souly a poet got hold of her and she began to affect burnejones—or waterhouse—it was waterhouse—she was a lot like one of his women—lady of shalott i believe at any rate she got souly and i was her animal—son animal—son boeuf i put up with that for above a year then i got some servants clothes and went  i was seen in france—then in australia—though i never left england i was supposed to have died in the bush she married a young fellow then i was proved to have died and i read a little obituary notice on myself in a womans paper she subscribed to she wrote it herself—as a warning to other young ladies of position not to be seduced by plausible poor young men  now shes dead theyve got the paper—her paper—in the kitchen down there and its full of photographs even an old photo of me—an unfortunate misalliance i feel somehow as if i were at an end too i thought id grown a solid middleagedman and here i feel sore as i did at twentysix and i talk as i used to  one thing—i have got some children and theyre of a breed as youd not meet anywhere i was a good animal before everything and ive got some children  he sat looking up where the big moon swam through the black branches of the yew  so shes dead—your poor peacock i murmured  he got up looking always at the sky and stretched himself again he was an impressive figure massed in blackness against the moonlight with his arms outspread  i suppose he said it wasnt all her fault  a white peacock we will say i suggested  he laughed  go home by the top road will you he said i believe theres something on in the bottom wood  all right i answered with a quiver of apprehension  yes she was fair enough he muttered  ay said i rising i held out my hand from the shadow i was startled myself by the white sympathy it seemed to express extended towards him in the moonlight he gripped it and cleaved to me for a moment then he was gone  i went out of the churchyard feeling a sullen resentment against the tousled graves that lay inanimate across my way the air was heavy to breathe and fearful in the shadow of the great trees i was glad when i came out on the bare white road and could see the copper lights from the reflectors of a ponycarts lamps and could hear the amiable chatchat of the hoofs trotting towards me i was lonely when they had passed  over the hill the big flushed face of the moon poised just above the treetops very majestic and far off—yet imminent i turned with swift sudden friendliness to the net of elmboughs spread over my head dotted with soft clusters winsomely i jumped up and pulled the cool soft tufts against my face for company and as i passed still i reached upward for the touch of this budded gentleness of the trees the wood breathed fragrantly with a subtle sympathy the firs softened their touch to me and the larches woke from the barren wintersleep and put out velvet fingers to caress me as i passed only the clean bare branches of the ash stood emblem of the discipline of life i looked down on the blackness where trees filled the quarry and the valley bottoms and it seemed that the world my own homeworld was strange again  some four or five days after annable had talked to me in the churchyard i went out to find him again it was sunday morning the larchwood was afloat with clear lyric green and some primroses scattered whitely on the edge under the fringing boughs it was a clear morning as when the latent life of the world begins to vibrate afresh in the air the smoke from the cottage rose blue against the trees and thick yellow against the sky the fire it seemed was only just lighted and the woodsmoke poured out  sam appeared outside the house and looked round then he climbed the watertrough for a better survey evidently unsatisfied paying slight attention to me he jumped down and went running across the hillside to the wood he is going for his father i said to myself and i left the path to follow him down hill across the waste meadow crackling the blanched stems of last years thistles as i went and stumbling in rabbit holes he reached the wall that ran along the quarrys edge and was over it in a twinkling  when i came to the place i was somewhat nonplussed for sheer from the stone fence the quarryside dropped for some twenty or thirty feet piled up with unmortared stones i looked round—there was a plain dark thread down the hillside which marked a path to this spot and the wall was scored with the marks of heavy boots then i looked again down the quarryside and i saw—how could i have failed to see—stones projecting to make an uneven staircase such as is often seen in the derbyshire fences i saw this ladder was well used so i trusted myself to it and scrambled down clinging to the face of the quarry wall once down i felt pleased with myself for having discovered and used the unknown access and i admired the care and ingenuity of the keeper who had fitted and wedged the long stones into the uncertain pile  it was warm in the quarry there the sunshine seemed to thicken and sweeten there the little mounds of overgrown waste were aglow with very early dogviolets there the sparks were coming out on the bits of gorse and among the stones the coltfoot plumes were already silvery here was spring sitting just awake unloosening her glittering hair and opening her purple eyes  i went across the quarry down to where the brook ran murmuring a tale to the primroses and the budding trees i was startled from my wandering among the fresh things by a faint clatter of stones  whats that young rascal doing i said to myself setting forth to see i came towards the other side of the quarry on this the moister side the bushes grew up against the wall which was higher than on the other side though piled the same with old dry stones as i drew near i could hear the scrape and rattle of stones and the vigorous grunting of sam as he laboured among them he was hidden by a great bush of sallow catkins all yellow and murmuring with bees warm with spice when he came in view i laughed to see him lugging and grunting among the great pile of stones that had fallen in a mass from the quarryside a pile of stones and earth and crushed vegetation there was a great bare gap in the quarry wall somehow the lads labouring earnestness made me anxious and i hurried up  he heard me and glancing round his face red with exertion eyes big with terror he called commanding me  pull em off im—pull em off suddenly my heart beating in my throat nearly suffocated me i saw the hand of the keeper lying among the stones i set to tearing away the stones and we worked for some time without a word then i seized the arm of the keeper and tried to drag him out but i could not  pull it off im whined the lad working in a frenzy  when we got him out i saw at once he was dead and i sat down trembling with exertion there was a great smashed wound on the side of the head sam put his face against his fathers and snuffed round him like a dog to feel the life in him the child looked at me  he wont get up he said and his little voice was hoarse with fear and anxiety  i shook my head then the boy began to whimper he tried to close the lips which were drawn with pain and death leaving the teeth bare then his fingers hovered round the eyes which were wide open glazed and i could see he was trembling to touch them into life  hes not asleep he said because his eyes is open—look  i could not bear the childs questioning terror i took him up to carry him away but he struggled and fought to be free  mae im get up—mae im get up he cried in a frenzy and i had to let the boy go  he ran to the dead man calling feyther feyther and pulling his shoulder then he sat down fascinated by the sight of the wound he put out his finger to touch it and shivered  come away said i  is it that he asked pointing to the wound i covered the face with a big silk handkerchief  now said i hell go to sleep if you dont touch him—so sit still while i go and fetch somebody will you run to the hall  he shook his head i knew he would not so i told him again not to touch his father but to let him lie still till i came back he watched me go but did not move from his seat on the stones beside the dead man though i know he was full of terror at being left alone  i ran to the hall—i dared not go to the kennels in a short time i was back with the squire and three men as i led the way i saw the child lifting a corner of the handkerchief to peep and see if the eyes were closed in sleep then he heard us and started violently when we removed the covering and he saw the face unchanged in its horror he looked at me with a look i have never forgotten  a bad business—an awful business repeated the squire a bad business i said to him from the first that the stones might come down when he was going up and he said he had taken care to fix them but you cant be sure you cant be certain and hed be about half way up—ay—and the whole wall would come down on him an awful business it is really a terrible piece of work  they decided at the inquest that the death came by misadventure but there were vague rumours in the village that this was revenge which had overtaken the keeper    they decided to bury him in our churchyard at greymede under the beeches the widow would have it so and nothing might be denied her in her state  it was a magnificent morning in early spring when i watched among the trees to see the procession come down the hillside the upper air was woven with the music of the larks and my whole world thrilled with the conception of summer the young pale windflowers had arisen by the woodgale and under the hazels when perchance the hot sun pushed his way new little suns dawned and blazed with real light there was a certain thrill and quickening everywhere as a woman must feel when she has conceived a sallow tree in a favoured spot looked like a pale gold cloud of summer dawn nearer it had poised a golden fairy busby on every twig and was voiced with a hum of bees like any sacred golden bush uttering its gladness in the thrilling murmur of bees and in warm scent birds called and flashed on every hand they made off exultant with streaming strands of grass or wisps of fleece plunging into the dark spaces of the wood and out again into the blue  a lad moved across the field from the farm below with a dog trotting behind him—a dog no a fussy blacklegged lamb trotting along on its toes with its tail swinging behind they were going to the mothers on the common who moved like little grey clouds among the dark grose  i cannot help forgetting and sharing the spinks triumph when he flashes past with a fleece from a bramble bush it will cover the bedded moss it will weave among the soft red cowhair beautifully it is a prize it is an ecstasy to have captured it at the right moment and the nest is nearly ready  ah but the thrush is scornful ringing out his voice from the hedge he sets his breast against the mud and models it warm for the turquoise eggs—blue blue bluest of eggs which cluster so close and round against the breast which round up beneath the breast nestling content you should see the bright ecstasy in the eyes of a nesting thrush because of the rounded caress of the eggs against her breast  what a hurry the jenny wren makes—hoping i shall not see her dart into the low bush i have a delight in watching them against their shy little wills but they have all risen with a rush of wings and are gone the birds the air is brushed with agitation there is no lark in the sky not one the heaven is clear of wings or twinkling dot——  till the heralds come—till the heralds wave like shadows in the bright air crying lamenting fretting forever rising and falling and circling round and round the slowwaving peewits cry and complain and lift their broad wings in sorrow they stoop suddenly to the ground the lapwings then in another throb of anguish and protest they swing up again offering a glistening white breast to the sunlight to deny it in black shadow then a glisten of green and all the time crying and crying in despair  the pheasants are frightened into cover they run and dart through the hedge the cold cock must fly in his haste spread himself on his streaming plumes and sail into the woods security  there is a cry in answer to the peewits echoing louder and stronger the lamentation of the lapwings a wail which hushes the birds the men come over the brow of the hill slowly with the old squire walking tall and straight in front six bowed men bearing the coffin on their shoulders treading heavily and cautiously under the great weight of the glistening white coffin six men following behind ill at ease waiting their turn for the burden you can see the red handkerchiefs knotted round their throats and their shirtfronts blue and white between the open waistcoats the coffin is of new unpolished wood gleaming and glistening in the sunlight the men who carry it remember all their lives after the smell of new warm elmwood  again a loud cry from the hilltop the woman has followed thus far the big shapeless woman and she cries with loud cries after the white coffin as it descends the hill and the children that cling to her skirts weep aloud and are not to be hushed by the other woman who bends over them but does not form one of the group how the crying frightens the birds and the rabbits and the lambs away there run to their mothers but the peewits are not frightened they add their notes to the sorrow they circle after the white retreating coffin they circle round the woman it is they who forever keen the sorrows of this world they are like priests in their robes more black than white more grief than hope driving endlessly round and round turning lifting falling and crying always in mournful desolation repeating their last syllables like the broken accents of despair  the bearers have at last sunk between the high banks and turned out of sight the big woman cannot see them and yet she stands to look she must go home there is nothing left  they have rested the coffin on the gate posts and the bearers are wiping the sweat from their faces they put their hands to their shoulders on the place where the weight has pressed  the other six are placing the pads on their shoulders when a girl comes up with a jug and a blue pot the squire drinks first and fills for the rest meanwhile the girl stands back under the hedge away from the coffin which smells of new elmwood in imagination she pictures the man shut up there in close darkness while the sunlight flows all outside and she catches her breast with terror she must turn and rustle among the leaves of the violets for the flowers she does not see then trembling she comes to herself and plucks a few flowers and breathes them hungrily into her soul for comfort the men put down the pots beside her with thanks and the squire gives the word the bearers lift up the burden again and the elmboughs rattle along the hollow white wood and the pitiful red clusters of elmflowers sweep along it as if they whispered in sympathy—we are so sorry so sorry—— always the compassionate buds in their fulness of life bend down to comfort the dark man shut up there perhaps the girl thinks he hears them and goes softly to sleep she shakes the tears out of her eyes on to the ground and taking up her pots goes slowly down over the brooks  in a while i too got up and went down to the mill which lay red and peaceful with the blue smoke rising as winsomely and carelessly as ever on the other side of the valley i could see a pair of horses nod slowly across the fallow a mans voice called to them now and again with a resonance that filled me with longing to follow my horses over the fallow in the still lonely valley full of sunshine and eternal forgetfulness the day had already forgotten the water was blue and white and darkburnished with shadows two swans sailed across the reflected trees with perfect blithe grace the gloom that had passed across was gone i watched the swan with his ruffled wings swell onwards i watched his slim consort go peeping into corners and under bushes i saw him steer clear of the bushes to keep full in view turning his head to me imperiously till i longed to pelt him with the empty husks of last years flowers knapweed and scabius i was too indolent and i turned instead to the orchard  there the daffodils were lifting their heads and throwing back their yellow curls at the foot of each sloping grey old tree stood a family of flowers some bursten with golden fulness some lifting their heads slightly to show a modest sweet countenance others still hiding their faces leaning forward pensively from the jaunty greygreen spears i wished i had their language to talk to them distinctly  overhead the trees with lifted fingers shook out their hair to the sun decking themselves with buds as white and cool as a waternymphs breasts  i began to be very glad the coltsfoot discs glowed and laughed in a merry company down the path i stroked the velvet faces and laughed also and i smelled the scent of blackcurrant leaves which is full of childish memories  the house was quiet and complacent it was peopled with ghosts again but the ghosts had only come to enjoy the warm place once more carrying sunshine in their arms and scattering it through the dusk of gloomy rooms           chapter iii     the irony of inspired moments   it happened the next day after the funeral i came upon reproductions of aubrey beardsleys atalanta and of the tailpiece salome and others i sat and looked and my soul leaped out upon the new thing i was bewildered wondering grudging fascinated i looked a long time but my mind or my soul would come to no state of coherence i was fascinated and overcome but yet full of stubbornness and resistance  lettie was out so although it was dinnertime even because it was dinnertime i took the book and went down to the mill  the dinner was over there was the fragrance of cooked rhubarb in the room i went straight to emily who was leaning back in her chair and put the salome before her  look said i look here  she looked she was shortsighted and peered close i was impatient for her to speak she turned slowly at last and looked at me shrinking with questioning  well i said  isnt it—fearful she replied softly  no—why is it  it makes you feel—why have you brought it  i wanted you to see it  already i felt relieved seeing that she too was caught in the spell  george came and bent over my shoulder i could feel the heavy warmth of him  good lord he drawled half amused the children came crowding to see and emily closed the book  i shall be late—hurry up dave and she went to wash her hands before going to school  give it me will you george asked putting out his hand for the book i gave it him and he sat down to look at the drawings when mollie crept near to look he angrily shouted to her to get away she pulled a mouth and got her hat over her wild brown curls emily came in ready for school  im going—goodbye she said and she waited hesitatingly i moved to get my cap he looked up with a new expression in his eyes and said  are you going—wait a bit—im coming  i waited  oh very well—goodbye said emily bitterly and she departed  when he had looked long enough he got up and we went out he kept his finger between the pages of the book as he carried it we went towards the fallow land without speaking there he sat down on a bank leaning his back against a hollytree and saying very calmly  theres no need to be in any hurry now—— whereupon he proceeded to study the illustrations  you know he said at last i do want her  i started at the irrelevance of this remark and said who  lettie weve got notice did you know  i started to my feet this time with amazement  notice to leave—what for  rabbits i expect i wish shed have me cyril  to leave strelley mill i repeated  thats it—and im rather glad but do you think she might have me cyril  what a shame where will you go and you lie there joking——  i dont never mind about the damned notice i want her more than anything—and the more i look at these naked lines the more i want her its a sort of fine sharp feeling like these curved lines i dont know what im saying—but do you think shed have me has she seen these pictures  no  if she did perhaps shed want me—i mean shed feel it clear and sharp coming through her  ill show her and see  id been sort of thinking about it—since father had that notice it seemed as if the ground was pulled from under our feet i never felt so lost then i began to think of her if shed have me—but not clear till you showed me those pictures i must have her if i can—and i must have something its rather ghostish to have the road suddenly smudged out and all the world anywhere nowhere for you to go i must get something sure soon or else i feel as if i should fall from somewhere and hurt myself ill ask her  i looked at him as he lay there under the hollytree his face all dreamy and boyish very unusual  youll ask lettie said i when—how  i must ask her quick while i feel as if everything had gone and i was ghostish i think i must sound rather a lunatic  he looked at me and his eyelids hung heavy over his eyes as if he had been drinking or as if he were tired  is she at home he said  no shes gone to nottingham shell be home before dark  ill see her then can you smell violets  i replied that i could not he was sure that he could and he seemed uneasy till he had justified the sensation so he arose very leisurely and went along the bank looking closely for the flowers  i knew i could white ones  he sat down and picked three flowers and held them to his nostrils and inhaled their fragrance then he put them to his mouth and i saw his strong white teeth crush them he chewed them for a while without speaking then he spat them out and gathered more  they remind me of her too he said and he twisted a piece of honeysuckle stem round the bunch and handed it to me  a white violet is she i smiled  give them to her and tell her to come and meet me just when its getting dark in the wood  but if she wont  she will  if shes not at home  come and tell me  he lay down again with his head among the green violet leaves saying  i ought to work because it all counts in the valuation but i dont care  he lay looking at me for some time then he said  i dont suppose i shall have above twenty pounds left when weve sold up—but shes got plenty of money to start with—if she has me—in canada i could get well off—and she could have—what she wanted—im sure shed have what she wanted  he took it all calmly as if it were realised i was somewhat amused  what frock will she have on when she comes to meet me he asked  i dont know the same as shes gone to nottingham in i suppose—a sort of goldbrown costume with a rather tight fitting coat why  i was thinking how shed look  what chickens are you counting now i asked  but what do you think i look best in he replied  you just as you are—no put that old smooth cloth coat on—thats all i smiled as i told him but he was very serious  shant i put my new clothes on  no—you want to leave your neck showing  he put his hand to his throat and said naïvely  do i—and it amused him  then he lay looking dreamily up into the tree i left him and went wandering round the fields finding flowers and birds nests  when i came back it was nearly four oclock he stood up and stretched himself he pulled out his watch  good lord he drawled ive lain there thinking all afternoon i didnt know i could do such a thing where have you been its with being all upset you see you left the violets—here take them will you and tell her ill come when its getting dark i feel like somebody else—or else really like myself i hope i shant wake up to the other things—you know like i am always—before them  why not  oh i dont know—only i feel as if i could talk straight off without arranging—like birds without knowing what note is coming next  when i was going he said  here leave me that book—itll keep me like this—i mean im not the same as i was yesterday and that bookll keep me like it perhaps its a bilious bout—i do sometimes have one if something very extraordinary happens when its getting dark then  lettie had not arrived when i went home i put the violets in a little vase on the table i remembered he had wanted her to see the drawings—it was perhaps as well he had kept them  she came about six oclock—in the motorcar with marie but the latter did not descend i went out to assist with the parcels lettie had already begun to buy things the wedding was fixed for july  the room was soon overcovered with stuffs table linen underclothing pieces of silken stuff and lace stuff patterns for carpets and curtains a whole gleaming glowing array lettie was very delighted she could hardly wait to take off her hat but went round cutting the string of her parcels opening them talking all the time to my mother  look little woman ive got a readymade underskirt—isnt it lovely listen and she ruffled it through her hands shant i sound splendid froufrou but it is a charming shade isnt it and not a bit bulky or clumsy anywhere she put the band of the skirt against her waist and put forward her foot and looked down saying its just the right length isnt it little woman—and they said i was tall—it was a wonder dont you wish it were yours little—oh you wont confess it yes you like to be as fine as anybody—thats why i bought you this piece of silk—isnt it sweet though—you neednt say theres too much lavender in it there is not now she pleated it up and held it against my mothers chin it suits you beautifully—doesnt it dont you like it sweet you dont seem to like it a bit and im sure it suits you—makes you look ever so young i wish you wouldnt be so old fashioned in your notions you do like it dont you  of course i do—i was only thinking what an extravagant mortal you are when you begin to buy you know you mustnt keep on always——  now—now sweet dont be naughty and preachey its such a treat to go buying you will come with me next time wont you oh i have enjoyed it—but i wished you were there—marie takes anything shes so easy to suit—i like to have a good buy—oh it was splendid—and theres lots more yet oh did you see this cushion cover—these are the colours i want for that room—gold and amber——  this was a bad opening i watched the shadows darken further and further along the brightness hushing the glitter of the water i watched the golden ripeness come upon the west and thought the rencontre was never to take place at last however lettie flung herself down with a sigh saying she was tired  come into the diningroom and have a cup of tea said mother i told rebecca to mash when you came in  all right leslies coming up later on i believe—about half past eight he said should i show him what ive bought  theres nothing there for a man to see  i shall have to change my dress and im sure i dont want the fag rebecca just go and look at the things ive bought—in the other room—and becky fold them up for me will you and put them on my bed  as soon as shed gone out lettie said shell enjoy doing it wont she mother theyre so nice do you think i need dress mother  please yourself—do as you wish  i suppose i shall have to he doesnt like blouses and skirts of an evening he says he hates the belt ill wear that old cream cashmere it looks nice now ive put that new lace on it dont those violets smell nice—who got them  cyril brought them in  george sent them you said i  well ill just run up and take my dress off why are we troubled with men  its a trouble you like well enough said mother  oh do i such a bother and she ran upstairs  the sun was red behind highclose i kneeled in the window seat and smiled at fate and at people who imagine that strange states are near to the inner realities the sun went straight down behind the cedar trees deliberately and it seemed as i watched swiftly lowered itself behind the trees behind the rim of the hill  i must go i said to myself and tell him she will not come  yet i fidgeted about the room loth to depart lettie came down dressed in white—or cream—cut low round the neck she looked very delightful and fresh again with a sparkle of the afternoons excitement still  ill put some of these violets on me she said glancing at herself in the mirror and then taking the flowers from their water she dried them and fastened them among her lace  dont lettie and i look nice tonight she said smiling glancing from me to her reflection which was like a light in the dusky room  that reminds me i said george saxton wanted to see you this evening  what ever for  i dont know theyve got notice to leave their farm and i think he feels a bit sentimental  oh well—is he coming here  he said would you go just a little way in the wood to meet him  did he oh indeed well of course i cant  of course not—if you wont theyre his violets youre wearing by the way  are they—let them stay it makes no difference but whatever did he want to see me for  i couldnt say i assure you  she glanced at herself in the mirror and then at the clock  lets see she remarked its only a quarter to eight three quarters of an hour— but what can he want me for—i never knew anything like it  startling isnt it i observed satirically  yes she glanced at herself in the mirror  i cant go out like this  all right you cant then  besides—its nearly dark it will be too dark to see in the wood wont it  it will directly  well ill just go to the end of the garden for one moment—run and fetch that silk shawl out of my wardrobe—be quick while its light  i ran and brought the wrap she arranged it carefully over her head  we went out down the garden path lettie held her skirts carefully gathered from the ground a nightingale began to sing in the twilight we stepped along in silence as far as the rhododendron bushes now in rosy bud  i cannot go into the wood she said  come to the top of the riding—and we went round the dark bushes  george was waiting i saw at once he was half distrustful of himself now lettie dropped her skirts and trailed towards him he stood awkwardly awaiting her conscious of the clownishness of his appearance she held out her hand with something of a grand air  see she said i have come  yes—i thought you wouldnt—perhaps—he looked at her and suddenly gained courage you have been putting white on—you you do look nice—though not like——  what—who else  nobody else—only i—well id—id thought about it different—like some pictures  she smiled with a gentle radiance and asked indulgently and how was i different  not all that soft stuff—plainer  but dont i look very nice with all this soft stuff as you call it—and she shook the silk away from her smiles  oh yes—better than those naked lines  you are quaint tonight—what did you want me for—to say goodbye  goodbye  yes—youre going away cyril tells me im very sorry—fancy horrid strangers at the mill but then i shall be gone away soon too we are all going you see now weve grown up—she kept hold of my arm yes  and where will you go—canada youll settle there and be quite a patriarch wont you  i dont know  you are not really sorry to go are you  no im glad  glad to go away from us all  i suppose so—since i must  ah fate—fate it separates you whether you want it or not  what  why you see you have to leave i mustnt stay out here—it is growing chilly how soon are you going  i dont know  not soon then  i dont know  then i may see you again  i dont know  oh yes i shall well i must go shall i say goodbye now—that was what you wanted was it not  to say goodbye  yes  no—it wasnt—i wanted i wanted to ask you——  what she cried  you dont know lettie now the old lifes gone everything—how i want you—to set out with—its like beginning life and i want you  but what could i do—i could only hinder—what help should i be  i should feel as if my mind was made up—as if i could do something clearly now its all hazy—not knowing what to do next  and if—if you had—what then  if i had you i could go straight on  where  oh—i should take a farm in canada——  well wouldnt it be better to get it first and make sure——  i have no money  oh—so you wanted me——  i only wanted you i only wanted you i would have given you——  what  youd have me—youd have all me and everything you wanted  that i paid for—a good bargain no oh no george i beg your pardon this is one of my flippant nights i dont mean it like that but you know its impossible—look how im fixed—it is impossible isnt it now  i suppose it is  you know it is—look at me now and say if its not impossible—a farmers wife—with you in canada  yes—i didnt expect you like that yes i see it is impossible but id thought about it and felt as if i must have you should have you    yes it doesnt do to go on dreaming i think its the first time and itll be the last yes it is impossible now i have made up my mind  and what will you do  i shall not go to canada  oh you must not—you must not do anything rash  no—i shall get married  you will oh i am glad i thought—you—you were too fond— but youre not—of yourself i meant i am so glad yes—do marry  well i shall—since you are——  yes said lettie it is best but i thought that you—— she smiled at him in sad reproach  did you think so he replied smiling gravely  yes she whispered they stood looking at one another  he made an impulsive movement towards her she however drew back slightly checking him  well—i shall see you again sometime—so goodbye he said putting out his hand  we heard a foot crunching on the gravel leslie halted at the top of the riding lettie hearing him relaxed into a kind of feline graciousness and said to george  i am so sorry you are going to leave—it breaks the old life up you said i would see you again—— she left her hand in his a moment or two  yes george replied goodnight—and he turned away she stood for a moment in the same drooping graceful attitude watching him then she turned round slowly she seemed hardly to notice leslie  who was that you were talking to he asked  he has gone now she replied irrelevantly as if even then she seemed hardly to realise it  it appears to upset you—his going—who is it  he—oh—why its george saxton  oh him  yes  what did he want  eh what did he want oh nothing  a mere trysting—in the interim eh—he said this laughing generously passing off his annoyance in a jest  i feel so sorry she said  what for  oh—dont let us talk about him—talk about something else i cant bear to talk about—him  all right he replied—and after an awkward little pause what sort of a time had you in nottingham  oh a fine time  youll enjoy yourself in the shops between now and—july some time ill go with you and see them  very well  that sounds as if you dont want me to go am i already in the way on a shopping expedition like an old husband  i should think you would be  thats nice of you why  oh i dont know  yes you do  oh i suppose youd hang about  im much too well brought up  rebecca has lighted the hall lamp  yes its grown quite dark i was here early you never gave me a good word for it  i didnt notice theres a light in the diningroom well go there  they went into the diningroom she stood by the piano and carefully took off the wrap then she wandered listlessly about the room for a minute  arent you coming to sit down he said pointing to the seat on the couch beside him  not just now she said trailing aimlessly to the piano she sat down and began to play at random from memory then she did that most irritating thing—played accompaniments to songs with snatches of the air where the voice should have predominated  i say lettie    he interrupted after a time  yes she replied continuing to play  its not very interesting     no—she continued to play  nor very amusing     she did not answer he bore it for a little time longer then he said  how much longer is it going to last lettie  what  that sort of business     the piano—ill stop playing if you dont like it  she did not however cease  yes—and all this dry business  i dont understand  dont you—you make me  there she went on tinkling away at if i built a world for you dear  i say stop it do he cried  she tinkled to the end of the verse and very slowly closed the piano  come on—come and sit down he said  no i dont want to—id rather have gone on playing  go on with your damned playing then and ill go where theres more interest  you ought to like it  he did not answer so she turned slowly round on the stool opened the piano and laid her fingers on the keys at the sound of the chord he started up saying then im going  its very early—why she said through the calm jingle of meine ruh is hin——  he stood biting his lips then he made one more appeal  lettie  yes  arent you going to leave off—and be—amiable  amiable  you are a jolly torment whats upset you now  nay its not i who am upset  im glad to hear it—what do you call yourself  i—nothing  oh well im going then  must you—so early tonight  he did not go and she played more and more softly languidly aimlessly once she lifted her head to speak but did not say anything  look here he ejaculated all at once so that she started and jarred the piano what do you mean by it  she jingled leisurely a few seconds before answering then she replied  what a worry you are  i suppose you want me out of the way while you sentimentalise over that milkman you neednt bother you can do it while im here or ill go and leave you in peace ill go and call him back for you if you like—if thats what you want——  she turned on the piano stool slowly and looked at him smiling faintly  it is very good of you she said  he clenched his fists and grinned with rage  you tantalising little—— he began lifting his fists expressively she smiled then he swung round knocked several hats flying off the stand in the hall slammed the door and was gone  lettie continued to play for some time after which she went up to her own room  leslie did not return to us the next day nor the day after the first day marie came and told us he had gone away to yorkshire to see about the new mines that were being sunk there and was likely to be absent for a week or so these business visits to the north were rather frequent the firm of which mr tempest was director and chief shareholder were opening important new mines in the other county as the seams at home were becoming exhausted or unprofitable it was proposed that leslie should live in yorkshire when he was married to superintend the new workings he at first rejected the idea but he seemed later to approve of it more  during the time he was away lettie was moody and crosstempered she did not mention george nor the mill indeed she preserved her best most haughty and ladylike manner  on the evening of the fourth day of leslies absence we were out in the garden the trees were uttering joyous leaves my mother was in the midst of her garden lifting the dusky faces of the auriculas to look at the velvet lips or tenderly taking a young weed from the black soil the thrushes were calling and clamouring all round the japonica flamed on the wall as the light grew thicker the tassels of white cherryblossom swung gently in the breeze  what shall i do mother said lettie as she wandered across the grass to pick at the japonica flowers what shall i do—theres nothing to do  well my girl—what do you want to do you have been moping about all day—go and see somebody  its such a long way to eberwich  is it then go somewhere nearer  lettie fretted about with restless petulant indecision  i dont know what to do she said and i feel as if i might just as well never have lived at all as waste days like this i wish we werent buried in this dead little hole—i wish we were near the town—its hateful having to depend on about two or three folk for your—your—your pleasure in life  i cant help it my dear—you must do something for yourself  and what can i do—i can do nothing  then id go to bed  that i wont—with the dead weight of a wasted day on me i feel as if id do something desperate  very well then said mother do it and have done  oh its no good talking to you—i dont want—— she turned away went to the laurestinus and began pulling off it the long red berries i expected she would fret the evening wastefully away i noticed all at once that she stood still it was the noise of a motorcar running rapidly down the hill towards nethermere—a light quickclicking sound i listened also i could feel the swinging drop of the car as it came down the leaps of the hill we could see the dust trail up among the trees lettie raised her head and listened expectantly the car rushed along the edge of nethermere—then there was the jar of brakes as the machine slowed down and stopped in a moment with a quick flutter of sound it was passing the lodgegates and whirling up the drive through the wood to us lettie stood with flushed cheeks and brightened eyes she went towards the bushes that shut off the lawn from the gravelled space in front of the house watching a car came racing through the trees it was the small car leslie used on the firms business—now it was white with dust leslie suddenly put on the brakes and tore to a standstill in front of the house he stepped to the ground there he staggered a little being giddy and cramped with the long drive his motorjacket and cap were thick with dust  lettie called to him leslie—and flew down to him he took her into his arms and clouds of dust rose round her he kissed her and they stood perfectly still for a moment she looked up into his face—then she disengaged her arms to take off his disfiguring motorspectacles after she had looked at him a moment tenderly she kissed him again he loosened his hold of her and she said in a voice full of tenderness  you are trembling dear  its the ride ive never stopped  without further words she took him into the house  how pale you are—see lie on the couch—never mind the dust all right ill find you a coat of cyrils o mother hes come all those miles in the car without stopping—make him lie down  she ran and brought him a jacket and put the cushions round and made him lie on the couch then she took off his boots and put slippers on his feet he lay watching her all the time he was white with fatigue and excitement  i wonder if i shall be had up for scorching—i can feel the road coming at me yet he said  why were you so headlong  i felt as if i should go wild if i didnt come—if i didnt rush i didnt know how you might have taken me lettie when i said—what i did  she smiled gently at him and he lay resting recovering looking at her  its a wonder i havent done something desperate—ive been half mad since i said—oh lettie i was a damned fool and a wretch—i could have torn myself in two ive done nothing but curse and rage at myself ever since i feel as if id just come up out of hell you dont know how thankful i am lettie that youve not—oh—turned against me for what i said  she went to him and sat down by him smoothing his hair from his forehead kissing him her attitude tender suggesting tears her movements impulsive as if with a selfreproach she would not acknowledge but which she must silence with lavish tenderness he drew her to him and they remained quiet for some time till it grew dark  the noise of my mother stirring in the next room disturbed them lettie rose and he also got up from the couch  i suppose he said i shall have to go home and get bathed and dressed—though he added in tones which made it clear he did not want to go i shall have to get back in the morning—i dont know what theyll say  at any rate she said you could wash here——  but i must get out of these clothes—and i want a bath  you could—you might have some of cyrils clothes—and the waters hot i know at all events you can stay to supper——  if im going i shall have to go soon—or theyd not like it if i go in late—they have no idea ive come—they dont expect me till next monday or tuesday——  perhaps you could stay here—and they neednt know  they looked at each other with wide smiling eyes—like children on the brink of a stolen pleasure  oh but what would your mother think—no ill go  she wont mind a bit  oh but——  ill ask her  he wanted to stay far more than she wished it so it was she who put down his opposition and triumphed  my mother lifted her eyebrows and said very quietly  hed better go home—and be straight  but look how hed feel—hed have to tell them    and how would he feel its really my fault in the end dont be piggling and mean and grundyish matouchka  it is neither meanness nor grundyishness——  oh ydgrun ydgrun—— exclaimed lettie ironically  he may certainly stay if he likes said mother slightly nettled at letties gibe  all right mutterchen—and be a sweetling do  lettie went out a little impatient at my mothers unwillingness but leslie stayed nevertheless  in a few moments lettie was up in the spare bedroom arranging and adorning and rebecca was running with hotwater bottles and hurrying down with clean bedclothes lettie hastily appropriated my best brushes—which she had given me—and took the suit of pajamas of the thinnest finest flannel—and discovered a new toothbrush—and made selections from my shirts and handkerchiefs and underclothing—and directed me which suit to lend him altogether i was astonished and perhaps a trifle annoyed at her extraordinary thoughtfulness and solicitude  he came down to supper bathed brushed and radiant he ate heartily and seemed to emanate a warmth of physical comfort and pleasure the colour was flushed again into his face and he carried his body with the old independent assertive air i have never known the time when he looked handsomer when he was more attractive there was a certain warmth about him a certain glow that enhanced his words his laughter his movements he was the predominant person and we felt a pleasure in his mere proximity my mother however could not quite get rid of her stiffness and soon after supper she rose saying she would finish her letter in the next room bidding him goodnight as she would probably not see him again the cloud of this little coolness was the thinnest and most transitory he talked and laughed more gaily than ever and was ostentatious in his movements throwing back his head taking little attitudes which displayed the broad firmness of his breast the grace of his welltrained physique i left them at the piano he was sitting pretending to play and looking up all the while at her who stood with her hand on his shoulder  in the morning he was up early by six oclock downstairs and attending to the car when i got down i found him very busy and very quiet  i know im a beastly nuisance he said but i must get off early  rebecca came and prepared breakfast which we two ate alone he was remarkably dull and wordless  its a wonder lettie hasnt got up to have breakfast with you—shes such a one for raving about the perfection of the early morning—its purity and promises and so forth i said  he broke his bread nervously and drank some coffee as if he were agitated making noises in his throat as he swallowed  its too early for her i should think he replied wiping his moustache hurriedly yet he seemed to listen for her letties bedroom was over the study where rebecca had laid breakfast and he listened now and again holding his knife and fork suspended in their action then he went on with his meal again  when he was laying down his serviette the door opened he pulled himself together and turned round sharply it was mother when she spoke to him his face twitched with a little frown half of relief half of disappointment  i must be going now he said—thank you very much—mother  you are a harumscarum boy i wonder why lettie doesnt come down i know she is up  yes he replied yes ive heard her perhaps she is dressing i must get off  ill call her  no—dont bother her—shed come if she wanted——  but mother had called from the foot of the stairs  lettie lettie—hes going  all right said lettie and in another minute she came downstairs she was dressed in dark severe stuff and she was somewhat pale she did not look at any of us but turned her eyes aside  goodbye she said to him offering him her cheek he kissed her murmuring goodbye—my love  he stood in the doorway a moment looking at her with beseeching eyes she kept her face half averted and would not look at him but stood pale and cold biting her underlip he turned sharply away with a motion of keen disappointment set the engines of the car into action mounted and drove quickly away  lettie stood pale and inscrutable for some moments  then she went in to breakfast and sat toying with her food keeping her head bent down her face hidden  in less than an hour he was back again saying he had left something behind he ran upstairs and then hesitating went into the room where lettie was still sitting at table  i had to come back he said  she lifted her face towards him but kept her eyes averted looking out of the window she was flushed  what had you forgotten she asked  id left my cigarette case he replied  there was an awkward silence  but i shall have to be getting off he added  yes i suppose you will she replied  after another pause he asked  wont you just walk down the path with me  she rose without answering he took a shawl and put it round her carefully she merely allowed him they walked in silence down the garden  you—are you—are you angry with me he faltered  tears suddenly came to her eyes  what did you come back for she said averting her face from him he looked at her  i knew you were angry—and—— he hesitated  why didnt you go away she said impulsively he hung his head and was silent  i dont see why—why it should make trouble between us lettie he faltered she made a swift gesture of repulsion whereupon catching sight of her hand she hid it swiftly against her skirt again  you make my hands—my very hands disclaim me she struggled to say  he looked at her clenched fist pressed against the folds of her dress  but— he began much troubled  i tell you i cant bear the sight of my own hands she said in low passionate tones  but surely lettie theres no need—if you love me——  she seemed to wince he waited puzzled and miserable  and were going to be married arent we he resumed looking pleadingly at her  she stirred and exclaimed  oh why dont you go away what did you come back for  youll kiss me before i go he asked  she stood with averted face and did not reply his forehead was twitching in a puzzled frown  lettie he said  she did not move or answer but remained with her face turned full away so that he could see only the contour of her cheek after waiting awhile he flushed turned swiftly and set his machine rattling in a moment he was racing between the trees           chapter iv     kiss when shes ripe for tears   it was the sunday after leslies visit we had had a wretched week with everybody mute and unhappy  though spring had come none of us saw it afterwards it occurred to me that i had seen all the ranks of poplars suddenly bursten into a dark crimson glow with a flutter of bloodred where the sun came through the leaves that i had found high cradles where the swans eggs lay by the waterside that i had seen the daffodils leaning from the mossgrown wooden walls of the boathouse and all moss daffodils water scattered with the pink scarves from the elm buds that i had broken the halfspread fans of the sycamore and had watched the white cloud of sloeblossom go silver grey against the evening sky but i had not perceived it and i had not any vivid springpictures left from the neglected week  it was sunday evening just after tea when lettie suddenly said to me  come with me down to strelley mill  i was astonished but i obeyed unquestioningly on the threshold we heard a chattering of girls and immediately alices voice greeted us  hello sybil love hello lettie come on heres a gathering of the goddesses come on you just make us right youre juno and heres meg shes venus and im—here somebody who am i tell us quick—did you say minerva sybil dear well you ought then now paris hurry up hes putting his sunday clothes on to take us a walk—laws what a time it takes him get your blushes ready meg—now lettie look haughty and ill look wise i wonder if he wants me to go and tie his tie oh glory—where on earth did you get that antimacassar  in nottingham—dont you like it said george referring to his tie hello lettie—have you come  yes its a gathering of the goddesses have you that apple if so hand it over said alice  what apple  oh lum his education pariss apple—cant you see weve come to be chosen  oh well—i havent got any apple—ive eaten mine  isnt he flat—hes like boiling magnesia thats done boiling for a week are you going to take us all to church then  if you like  come on then wheres the abode of love look at lettie looking shocked awfully sorry old girl—thought love agreed with you  did you say love inquired george  yes i did didnt i meg and you say love as well dont you  i dont know what it is laughed meg who was very red and rather bewildered  amor est titillatio—love is a tickling—there—thats it isnt it sybil  how should i know  of course not old fellow leave it to the girls see how knowing lettie looks—and laws lettie you are solemn  its love suggested george over his new necktie  ill bet it is degustasse sat est—aint it lettie one licks enough—and damned be he that first cries hold enough—which one do you like but are you going to take us to church georgie darling—one by one or all at once  what do you want me to do meg he asked  oh i dont mind  and do you mind lettie  im not going to church  lets go a walk somewhere—and let us start now said emily somewhat testily she did not like this nonsense  there you are syb—youve got your orders—dont leave me behind wailed alice  emily frowned and bit her finger  come on georgie you look like the finger of a pair scales—between two weights whichll draw  the heavier he replied smiling and looking neither at meg or lettie  then its meg cried alice oh i wish i was fleshy—ive no chance with syb against pem  emily flashed looks of rage meg blushed and felt ashamed lettie began to recover from her first outraged indignation and smiled  thus we went a walk in two trios  unfortunately as the evening was so fine the roads were full of strollers groups of three or four men dressed in pale trousers and shiny black cloth coats following their suspicious little dogs gangs of youths slouching along occupied with nothing often silent talking now and then in raucous tones on some subject of brief interest then the gallant husbands in their tail coats very husbandly pushing a jingling perambulator admonished by a much dressed spouse round whom the small members of the family gyrated occasionally two lovers walking with a space between them disowning each other occasionally a smartly dressed mother with two little girls in white silk frocks and much expanse of yellow hair stepping mincingly and near by a father awkwardly controlling his sunday suit  to endure all this it was necessary to chatter unconcernedly george had to keep up the conversation behind and he seemed to do it with ease discoursing on the lambs discussing the breed—when meg exclaimed  oh arent they black they might ha crept down th chimney i never saw any like them before he described how he had reared two on the bottle exciting megs keen admiration by his mothering of the lambs then he went on to the peewits harping on the same string how they would cry and pretend to be wounded—just fancy though—and how he had moved the eggs of one pair while he was ploughing and the mother had followed them and had even sat watching as he drew near again with the plough watching him come and go—well she knew you—but they do know those who are kind to them——  yes he agreed her little bright eyes seem to speak as you go by  oh i do think theyre nice little things—dont you lettie cried meg in access of tenderness  lettie did—with brevity  we walked over the hills and down into greymede meg thought she ought to go home to her grandmother and george bade her go saying he would call and see her in an hour or so  the dear girl was disappointed but she went unmurmuring we left alice with a friend and hurried home through selsby to escape the afterchurch parade  as you walk home past selsby the pit stands up against the west with beautiful tapering chimneys marked in black against the swim of sunset and the headstocks etched with tall significance on the brightness then the houses are squat in rows of shadow at the foot of these high monuments  do you know cyril said emily i have meant to go and see mrs annable—the keepers wife—shes moved into bonsarts row and the children come to school—oh its awful—theyve never been to school and they are unspeakable  whats she gone there for i asked  i suppose the squire wanted the kennels—and she chose it herself but the way they live—its fearful to think of  and why havent you been  i dont know—ive meant to—but—— emily stumbled  you didnt want and you darent  perhaps not—would you  pah—lets go now—there you hang back  no i dont she replied sharply  come on then well go through the twitchel let me tell lettie  lettie at once declared no—with some asperity  all right said george ill take you home  but this suited lettie still less  i dont know what you want to go for cyril she said and sunday night and everybody everywhere i want to go home  well—you go then—emily will come with you  ha cried the latter you think i wont go to see her  i shrugged my shoulders and george pulled his moustache  well i dont care declared lettie and we marched down the twitchel indian file  we came near to the ugly rows of houses that back up against the pithill everywhere is black and sooty the houses are back to back having only one entrance which is from a square garden where blackspeckled weeds grow sulkily and which looks on to a row of evil little ashpit huts the road everywhere is trodden over with a crust of soot and coaldust and cinders  between the rows however was a crowd of women and children bare heads bare arms white aprons and black sunday frocks bristling with gimp one or two men squatted on their heels with their backs against a wall laughing the women were waving their arms and screaming up at the roof of the end house  emily and lettie drew back  look there—its that little beggar sam said george  there sure enough perched on the ridge of the roof against the end chimney was the young imp coatless his shirtsleeves torn away from the cuffs i knew his bright reddish young head in a moment he got up his bare toes clinging to the tiles and spread out his fingers fanwise from his nose shouting something which immediately caused the crowd to toss with indignation and the women to shriek again sam sat down suddenly having almost lost his balance  the village constable hurried up his thin neck stretching out of his tunic and demanded the cause of the hubbub  immediately a woman with bright brown squinting eyes and a birthmark on her cheek rushed forward and seized the policeman by the sleeve  tae im up tae im up an birch im till is bloody backs raw she screamed  the thin policeman shook her off and wanted to know what was the matter  ill smosh im like a rotten tater cried the woman if i can lay ands on im es not fit ter live nowhere where theres decent folks—the thievin brazen little devil—— thus she went on  but whats up interrupted the thin constable whats up wi im  up—its im as is up an let im wait till i get im down a crafty little——  sam seeing her look at him distorted his honest features and overheated her wrath till lettie and emily trembled with dismay  the mothers head appeared at the bedroom window she slid the sash back and craned out vainly trying to look over the gutter below the slates she was even more dishevelled than usual and the tears had dried on her pale face she stretched further out clinging to the window frame and to the gutter overhead till i was afraid she would come down with a crash  the men squatting on their heels against the wall of the ashpit laughed saying  nab im poll—can ter see m—clawk im and then the pitiful voice of the woman was heard crying come thy ways down my duckie come on—ony come ter thy mother—they shanna touch thee du thy mothers biddin now—sam—sam—sam her voice rose higher and higher  sammy sammy go to thy mammy jeered the wits below  shonna ter come shonna ter come to thy mother my duckie—come on come thy ways down  sam looked at the crowd and at the eaves from under which rose his mothers voice he was going to cry a big gaunt woman with the family steel comb stuck in her back hair shouted tha mun well bend thy face tha needs ter scraight and aided by the woman with the birthmark and the squint she reviled him the little scoundrel in a burst of defiance picked a piece of mortar from between the slates and in a second it flew into fragments against the family steel comb the wearer thereof declared her head was laid open and there was general confusion the policeman—i dont know how thin he must have been when he was taken out of his uniform—lost his head and he too began brandishing his fists spitting from under his sweepsbrush moustache as he commanded in tones of authority  now then no more on it—lets ae thee down here an no more messin about  the boy tried to creep over the ridge of the roof and escape down the other side immediately the brats rushed round yelling to the other side of the row and pieces of redburnt gravel began to fly over the roof sam crouched against the chimney  got im yelled one little devil got im hi—go again  a shower of stones came down scattering the women and the policeman the mother rushed from the house and made a wild onslaught on the throwers she caught one and flung him down immediately the rest turned and aimed their missiles at her then george and the policeman and i dashed after the young wretches and the women ran to see what happened to their offspring we caught two lads of fourteen or so and made the policeman haul them after us the rest fled  when we returned to the field of battle sam had gone too  if e asna slived off cried the woman with a squint but ill see him locked up for this  at this moment a band of missioners from one of the chapels or churches arrived at the end of the row and the little harmonium began to bray and the place vibrated with the sound of a womans powerful voice propped round by several others singing  at even ere the sun was set——  everybody hurried towards the new noise save the policeman with his captives the woman with the squint and the woman with the family comb i told the limb of the law hed better get rid of the two boys and find out what mischief the others were after  then i enquired of the woman with the squint what was the matter  thirtyseven young uns an we ad from that doe an theres no knowin ow many more if they adnt agone an aten er she replied lapsing now her fury was spent into sullen resentment  an niver a word should we a known added the familycombbearer but for that blessed cat of ourn as scrat it up  indeed said i the rabbit  no there were nowt left but th skin—theyd seen ter that a thieving dirteatin lot  when was that said i  this mortal night—an there was th head an th back in th dirty stewpot—i can show you this instant—ive got em in our pantry for a proof avent i martha  a fat lot o good it is—but ill rip th neck out of im if ever i lay ands on im  at last i made out that samuel had stolen a large lopeared doe out of a bunch in the coalhouse of the squinteyed lady had skinned it buried the skin and offered his booty to his mother as a wild rabbit trapped the doe had been the chief item of the annables sunday dinner—albeit a portion was unluckily saved till monday providing undeniable proof of the theft the owner of the rabbit had supposed the creature to have escaped this peaceful supposition had been destroyed by the combbearers seeing her cat scratching in the annables garden unearth the white and brown doeskin after which the trouble had begun  the squinteyed woman was not so hard to manage i talked to her as if she were some male friend of mine only appealing to her womanliness with all the soft sadness i could press into the tones of my voice in the end she was mollified and even tender and motherly in her feelings toward the unfortunate family i left on her dresser the halfcrown i shrank from offering her and having reduced the combwearer also i marched off carrying the stewpot and the fragments of the illfated doe to the cottage of the widow where george and the girls awaited me  the house was in a woeful state in the rocking chair beside the high guard that surrounded the hearth sat the mother rocking looking sadly shaken now her excitement was over lettie was nursing the little baby and emily the next child george was smoking his pipe and trying to look natural the little kitchen was crowded—there was no room—there was not even a place on the table for the stewjar so i gathered together cups and mugs containing tea sops and set down the vessel of ignominy on the much slopped teacloth the four little children were striped and patched with tears—at my entrance one under the table recommenced to weep so i gave him my pencil which pushed in and out but which pushes in and out no more the sight of the stewpot affected the mother afresh she wept again crying  an i niver thought as ow it were aught but a snared un as if i should set im on ter thieve their old doe an tough it was an all an im a thief an me called all the names they could lay their tongues to an then in my bit of a pantry takin the very pots out that stewpot as i brought all the way from nottingham an ive ad it afore our minnie wor born—  the baby the little baby then began to cry the mother got up suddenly and took it  oh come then come then my pet why why cos they shanna no they shanna yes hes his mothers least little lad he is a little un hush then there there—whats a matter my little she hushed the baby and herself at length she asked  as th pliceman gone as well  yes—its all right i said  she sighed deeply and her look of weariness was painful to see  how old is your eldest i asked  fanny—shes fourteen shes out service at websters then jim as is thirteen next month—lets see yes it is next month—hes gone to flints—farming they cant do much—an i shant let em go into th pit if i can help it my husband always used to say they should never go in th pit  they cant do much for you  they dun what they can but its a hard job it is ter keep em all goin wi weshin an

the day an th date an i said to im frank is it thee frank im all right im gettin on all right—an then e went seemed to go ower the whimsey an back towards th wood i know it wor im an e couldna rest thinkin i couldna manage——  after a while we left promising to go again and to see after the safety of sam  it was quite dark and the lamps were lighted in the houses we could hear the throb of the fanhouse engines and the soft whirr of the fan  isnt it cruel said emily plaintively  wasnt the man a wretch to marry the woman like that added lettie with decision  speak of lady chrystabel said i and then there was silence i suppose he did not know what he was doing any more than the rest of us  i thought you were going to your aunts—to the ram inn said lettie to george when they came to the crossroads  not now—its too late he answered quietly you will come round our way wont you  yes she said  we were eating bread and milk at the farm and the father was talking with vague sadness and reminiscence lingering over the thought of their departure from the old house he was a pure romanticist forever seeking the colour of the past in the presents monotony he seemed settling down to an easy contented middleage when the unrest on the farm and development of his children quickened him with fresh activity he read books on the land question and modern novels in the end he became an advanced radical almost a socialist occasionally his letters appeared in the newspapers he had taken a new hold on life  over supper he became enthusiastic about canada and to watch him his ruddy face lighted up his burly form straight and nerved with excitement was to admire him to hear him his words of thoughtful commonsense all warm with a young mans hopes was to love him at fortysix he was more spontaneous and enthusiastic than george and far more happy and hopeful  emily would not agree to go away with them—what should she do in canada she said—and she did not want the little ones to be drudges on a farm—in the end to be nothing but cattle  nay said her father gently mollie shall learn the dairying and david will just be right to take to the place when i give up itll perhaps be a bit rough and hard at first but when weve got over it we shall think it was one of the best times—like you do  and you george asked lettie  im not going what should i go for theres nothing at the end of it only a long life its like a day here in june—a long work day pleasant enough and when its done you sleep well—but its work and sleep and comfort—half a life its not enough whats the odds—i might as well be flower the mare  his father looked at him gravely and thoughtfully  now it seems to me so different he said sadly it seems to me you can live your own life and be independent and think as you like without being choked with harassments i feel as if i could keep on—like that——  im going to get more out of my life i hope laughed george no do you know and here he turned straight to lettie do you know im going to get pretty rich so that i can do what i want for a bit i want to see what its like to taste all sides—to taste the towns i want to know what ive got in me ill get rich—or at least ill have a good try  and pray how will you manage it asked emily  ill begin by marrying—and then youll see  emily laughed with scorn—let us see you begin  ah youre not wise said the father sadly—then laughing he said to lettie in coaxing confidential tones but hell come out there to me in a year or two—you see if he doesnt  i wish i could come now said i  if you would said george id go with you but not by myself to become a fat stupid fool like my own cattle  while he was speaking gyp burst into a rage of barking the father got up to see what it was and george followed trip the great bullterrier rushed out of the house shaking the buildings with his roars we saw the white dog flash down the yard we heard a rattle from the henhouse ladder and in a moment a scream from the orchard side  we rushed forward and there on the sharp bankside lay a little figure face down and trip standing over it looking rather puzzled  i picked up the child—it was sam he struggled as soon as he felt my hands but i bore him off to the house he wriggled like a wild hare and kicked but at last he was still i set him on the hearthrug to examine him he was a quaint little figure dressed in a mans trousers that had been botched small for him and a coat hanging in rags  did he get hold of you asked the father where was it he got hold of you  but the child stood unanswering his little pale lips pinched together his eyes staring out at nothing emily went on her knees before him and put her face close to his saying with a voice that made one shrink from its unbridled emotion of caress  did he hurt you eh—tell us where he hurt you she would have put her arms around him but he shrank away  look here said lettie its here—and its bleeding go and get some water emily and some rags come on sam let me look and ill put some rags round it come along  she took the child and stripped him of his grotesque garments trip had given him a sharp grab on the thigh before he had realised that he was dealing with a little boy it was not much however and lettie soon had it bathed and anointed with elderflower ointment on the boys body were several scars and bruises—evidently he had rough times lettie tended to him and dressed him again he endured these attentions like a trapped wild rabbit—never looking at us never opening his lips—only shrinking slightly when lettie had put on him his torn little shirt and had gathered the great breeches about him emily went to him to coax him and make him at home she kissed him and talked to him with her full vibration of emotional caress it seemed almost to suffocate him then she tried to feed him with bread and milk from a spoon but he would not open his mouth and he turned his head away  leave him alone—take no notice of him said lettie lifting him into the chimney seat with the basin of bread and milk beside him emily fetched the two kittens out of their basket and put them too beside him  i wonder how many eggs hed got said the father laughing softly  hush said lettie when do you think you will go to canada mr saxton  next spring—its no good going before  and then youll marry asked lettie of george  before then—oh before then he said  why—how is it you are suddenly in such a hurry—when will it be  when are you marrying he asked in reply  i dont know she said coming to a full stop  then i dont know he said taking a large wedge of cheese and biting a piece from it  it was fixed for june she said recovering herself at his suggestion of hope  july said emily  father said he holding the piece of cheese up before him as he spoke—he was evidently nervous would you advise me to marry meg  his father started and said  why was you thinking of doing  yes—all things considered  well—if she suits you——  were cousins——  if you want her i suppose you wont let that hinder you shell have a nice bit of money and if you like her——  i like her all right—i shant go out to canada with her though i shall stay at the ram—for the sake of the life  its a poor life that said the father ruminating  george laughed a bit mucky he said—but itll do it would need cyril or lettie to keep me alive in canada  it was a bold stroke—everybody was embarrassed  well said the father i suppose we cant have everything we want—we generally have to put up with the next best thing—dont we lettie—he laughed lettie flushed furiously  i dont know she said you can generally get what you want if you want it badly enough of course—if you dont mind——  she rose and went across to sam  he was playing with the kittens one was patting and cuffing his bare toe which had poked through his stocking he pushed and teased the little scamp with his toe till it rushed at him clinging tickling biting till he gave little bubbles of laughter quite forgetful of us then the kitten was tired and ran off lettie shook her skirts and directly the two playful mites rushed upon it darting round her rolling head over heels and swinging from the soft cloth suddenly becoming aware that they felt tired the young things trotted away and cuddled together by the fender where in an instant they were asleep almost as suddenly sam sank into drowsiness  hed better go to bed said the father  put him in my bed said george david would wonder what had happened  will you go to bed sam asked emily holding out her arms to him and immediately startling him by the terrible gentleness of her persuasion he retreated behind lettie  come along said the latter and she quickly took him and undressed him then she picked him up and his bare legs hung down in front of her his head drooped drowsily on to her shoulder against her neck  she put down her face to touch the loose riot of his ruddy hair she stood so quiet still and wistful for a few moments perhaps she was vaguely aware that the attitude was beautiful for her and irresistibly appealing to george who loved above all in her her delicate dignity of tenderness emily waited with the lighted candle for her some moments  when she came down there was a softness about her  now said i to myself if george asks her again he is wise  he is asleep she said quietly  im thinking we might as well let him stop while were here should we george said the father eh  well keep him here while we are here——  oh—the lad i should yes—hed be better here than up yonder  ah yes—ever so much it is good of you said lettie  oh hell make no difference said the father  not a bit added george  what about his mother asked lettie  ill call and tell her in the morning said george  yes she said call and tell her  then she put on her things to go he also put on his cap  are you coming a little way emily i asked  she ran laughing with bright eyes as we went out into the darkness  we waited for them at the wood gate we all lingered not knowing what to say lettie said finally  well—its no good—the grass is wet—goodnight—goodnight emily  goodnight he said with regret and hesitation and a trifle of impatience in his voice and his manner he lingered still a moment she hesitated—then she struck off sharply  he has not asked her the idiot i said to myself  really she said bitterly when we were going up the garden path you think rather quiet folks have a lot in them but its only stupidity—they are mostly fools           chapter v     an arrow from the impatient god   on an afternoon three or four days after the recovery of sam matters became complicated george as usual discovered that he had been dawdling in the portals of his desires when the doors came to with a bang then he hastened to knock  tell her he said i will come up tomorrow after milking—tell her im coming to see her  on the evening of that morrow the first person to put in an appearance was a garrulous spinster who had called ostensibly to inquire into the absence of the family from church i said to elizabeth now what a thing if anything happens to them just now and the wedding is put off i felt i must come and make myself sure—that nothing had happened we all feel so interested in lettie just now im sure everybody is talking of her she seems in the air—i really think we shall have thunder i hope we shant—yes we are all so glad that mr tempest is content with a wife from at home—the others his father and mr robert and the rest—they were none of them to be suited at home though to be sure the wives they brought were nothing—indeed they were not—as many a one said—mrs robert was a paltry choice—neither in looks or manner had she anything to boast of—if her family was older than mine family wasnt much to make up for what she lacked in other things that i could easily have supplied her with and oh dear what an object she is now with her wisp of hair and her spectacles she for one hasnt kept much of her youth but when is the exact date dear—some say this and some that but as i always say i never trust a they say it is so nice that you have that cousin a canon to come down for the service mrs beardsall and sir walter houghton for the grooms man what—you dont think so—oh but i know dear i know you do like to treasure up these secrets dont you you are greedy for all the good things just now  she shook her head at lettie and the jet ornaments on her bonnet twittered like a thousand wagging little tongues then she sighed and was about to recommence her song when she happened to turn her head and to espy a telegraph boy coming up the path  oh i hope nothing is wrong dear—i hope nothing is wrong i always feel so terrified of a telegram youd better not open it yourself dear—dont now—let your brother go  lettie who had turned pale hurried to the door the sky was very dark—there was a mutter of thunder  its all right said lettie trembling its only to say hes coming tonight  im very thankful very thankful cried the spinster it might have been so much worse im sure i never open a telegram without feeling as if i was opening a deathblow im so glad dear it must have upset you what news to take back to the village supposing something had happened she sighed again and the jet drops twinkled ominously in the thunder light as if declaring they would make something of it yet  it was six oclock the air relaxed a little and the thunder was silent george would be coming about seven and the spinster showed no signs of departure and leslie might arrive at any moment lettie fretted and fidgeted and the old woman gabbled on i looked out of the window at the water and the sky  the day had been uncertain in the morning it was warm and the sunshine had played and raced among the cloudshadows on the hills later great cloud masses had stalked up from the northwest and crowded thick across the sky in this little night sleet and wind and rain whirled furiously then the sky had laughed at us again in the sunshine came the spinster but as she talked over the hilltop rose the wide forehead of the cloud rearing slowly ominously higher a first messenger of storm passed darkly over the sky leaving the way clear again  i will go round to highclose said lettie i am sure it will be stormy again are you coming down the road miss slaighter or do you mind if i leave you  i will go dear if you think there is going to be another storm—i dread it so perhaps i had better wait——  oh it will not come over for an hour i am sure we read the weather well out here dont we cyril youll come with me wont you  we three set off the gossip leaning on her toes tripping between us she was much gratified by letties information concerning the proposals for the new home we left her in a glow of congratulatory smiles on the highway but the clouds had upreared and stretched in two great arms reaching overhead the little spinster hurried along but the black hands of the clouds kept pace and clutched her a sudden gust of wind shuddered in the trees and rushed upon her cloak blowing its bugles  an icy raindrop smote into her cheek she hurried on praying fervently for her bonnets sake that she might reach widow harrimans cottage before the burst came but the thunder crashed in her ear and a host of hailstones flew at her in despair and anguish she fled from under the ash trees she reached the widows garden gate when out leapt the lightning full at her put me in the stairhole she cried where is the stairhole  glancing wildly round she saw a ghost it was the reflection of the sainted spinster hilda slaighter in the widows mirror a reflection with a bonnet fallen backwards and to it attached a thick rope of greybrown hair the author of the ghost instinctively twisted to look at the back of her head she saw some ends of grey hair and fled into the open stairhole as into a grave  we had gone back home till the storm was over and then restless afraid of the arrival of george we set out again into the wet evening it was fine and chilly and already a mist was rising from nethermere veiling the farther shore where the trees rose loftily suggesting groves beyond the nile the birds were singing riotously the fresh green hedge glistened vividly and glowed again with intense green looking at the water i perceived a delicate flush from the west hiding along it the mist licked and wreathed up the shores from the hidden white distance came the mournful cry of water fowl we went slowly along behind a heavy cart which clanked and rattled under the dripping trees with the hoofs of the horse moving with broad thuds in front we passed over black patches where the ash flowers were beaten down and under great massed clouds of green sycamore at the sudden curve of the road near the foot of the hill i stopped to break off a spray of larch where the soft cones were heavy as raspberries and gay like flowers with petals the shaken bough spattered a heavy shower on my face of drops so cold that they seemed to sink into my blood and chill it  hark said lettie as i was drying my face there was the quick patter of a motorcar coming downhill the heavy cart was drawn across the road to rest and the driver hurried to turn the horse back it moved with painful slowness and we stood in the road in suspense suddenly before we knew it the car was dropping down on us coming at us in a curve having rounded the horse and cart lettie stood faced with terror leslie saw her and swung round the wheels on the sharp curving hillside looking only to see that he should miss her the car slid sideways the mud crackled under the wheels and the machine went crashing into nethermere it caught the edge of the old stone wall with a smash then for a few moments i think i was blind when i saw again leslie was lying across the broken hedge his head hanging down the bank his face covered with blood the car rested strangely on the brink of the water crumpled as if it had sunk down to rest  lettie with hands shuddering was wiping the blood from his eyes with a piece of her underskirt in a moment she said  he is not dead—let us take him home—let us take him quickly  i ran and took the wicket gate off its hinges and laid him on that his legs trailed down but we carried him thus she at the feet i at the head she made me stop and put him down i thought the weight was too much for her but it was not that  i cant bear to see his hand hanging knocking against the bushes and things  it was not many yards to the house a maidservant saw us came running out and went running back like the frightened lapwing from the wounded cat  we waited until the doctor came there was a deep graze down the side of the head—serious but not dangerous there was a cut across the cheekbone that would leave a scar and the collarbone was broken i stayed until he had recovered consciousness lettie he wanted lettie so she had to remain at highclose all night i went home to tell my mother  when i went to bed i looked across at the lighted windows of highclose and the lights trailed mistily towards me across the water the cedar stood dark guard against the house bright the windows were like the stars and like the stars covering their torment in brightness the sky was glittering with sharp lights—they are too far off to take trouble for us so little little almost to nothingness all the great hollow vastness roars overhead and the stars are only sparks that whirl and spin in the restless space the earth must listen to us she covers her face with a thin veil of mist and is sad she soaks up our blood tenderly in the darkness grieving and in the light she soothes and reassures us here on our earth is sympathy and hope the heavens have nothing but distances  a corncrake talked to me across the valley talked and talked endlessly asking and answering in hoarse tones from the sleeping misthidden meadows the monotonous voice that on past summer evenings had had pleasant notes of romance now was intolerable to me its inflexible harshness and cacophany seemed like the voice of fate speaking out its tuneless perseverance in the night  in the morning lettie came home wan sadeyed and selfreproachful after a short time they came for her as he wanted her again  when in the evening i went to see george he too was very despondent  its no good now said i you should have insisted and made your own destiny  yes—perhaps so he drawled in his best reflective manner  i would have had her—shed have been glad if youd done as you wanted with her she wont leave him till hes strong and hell marry her before then you should have had the courage to risk yourself—youre always too careful of yourself and your own poor feelings—you never could brace yourself up to a showerbath of contempt and hard usage so youve saved your feelings and lost—not much i suppose—you couldnt  but—— he began not looking up and i laughed at him  go on i said  well—she was engaged to him——  pah—you thought you were too good to be rejected  he was very pale and when he was pale the tan on his skin looked sickly he regarded me with his dark eyes which were now full of misery and a childs big despair  and nothing else i completed with which the little exhausted gunboat of my anger wrecked and sank utterly yet no thoughts would spread sail on the sea of my pity i was like water that heaves with yearning and is still  leslie was very ill for some time he had a slight brain fever and was delirious insisting that lettie was leaving him she stayed most of her days at highclose  one day in june he lay resting on a deck chair in the shade of the cedar and she was sitting by him it was a yellow sultry day when all the atmosphere seemed inert and all things were languid  dont you think dear she said it would be better for us not to marry  he lifted his head nervously from the cushions his face was emblazoned with a livid red bar on a field of white and he looked worn wistful  do you mean not yet he asked  yes—and perhaps—perhaps never  ha he laughed sinking down again i must be getting like myself again if you begin to tease me  but she said struggling valiantly im not sure i ought to marry you  he laughed again though a little apprehensively  are you afraid i shall always be weak in my noddle he asked but you wait a month  no that doesnt bother me——  oh doesnt it  silly boy—no its myself  im sure ive made no complaint about you  not likely—but i wish youd let me go  im a strong man to hold you arent i look at my muscular paw—he held out his hands frail and white with sickness  you know you hold me—and i want you to let me go i dont want to——  to what  to get married at all—let me be let me go  what for  oh—for my sake  you mean you dont love me  love—love—i dont know anything about it but i cant—we cant be—dont you see—oh what do they say—flesh of one flesh  why he whispered like a child that is told some tale of mystery  she looked at him as he lay propped upon his elbow turning towards hers his white face of fear and perplexity like a child that cannot understand and is afraid and wants to cry then slowly tears gathered full in her eyes and she wept from pity and despair  this excited him terribly he got up from his chair and the cushions fell on to the grass  whats the matter whats the matter—oh lettie—is it me—dont you want me now—is that it—tell me tell me now tell me—he grasped her wrists and tried to pull her hands from her face the tears were running down his cheeks she felt him trembling and the sound of his voice alarmed her from herself she hastily smeared the tears from her eyes got up and put her arms round him he hid his head on her shoulder and sobbed while she bent over him and so they cried out their cries till they were ashamed looking round to see if anyone were near then she hurried about picking up the cushions making him lie down and arranging him comfortably so that she might be busy he was querulous like a sick indulged child he would have her arm under his shoulders and her face near his  well he said smiling faintly again after a time you are naughty to give us such rough times—is it for the pleasure of making up bad little schnucke—arent you  she kept close to him and he did not see the wince and quiver of her lips  i wish i was strong again—couldnt we go boating—or ride on horseback—and youd have to behave then do you think i shall be strong in a month stronger than you  i hope so she said  why i dont believe you do i believe you like me like this—so that you can lay me down and smooth me—dont you quiet girl  when youre good  ah well in a month i shall be strong and well be married and go to switzerland—do you hear schnucke—you wont be able to be naughty any more then oh—do you want to go away from me again  no—only my arm is dead she drew it from beneath him standing up swinging it smiling because it hurt her  oh my darling—what a shame oh i am a brute a kiddish brute i wish i was strong again lettie and didnt do these things  you boy—its nothing she smiled at him again           chapter vi        the courting   during leslies illness i strolled down to the mill one saturday evening i met george tramping across the yard with a couple of buckets of swill and eleven young pigs rushing squealing about his legs shrieking in an agony of suspense he poured the stuff into a trough with luscious gurgle and instantly ten noses were dipped in and ten little mouths began to slobber though there was plenty of room for ten yet they shouldered and shoved and struggled to capture a larger space and many little trotters dabbled and spilled the stuff and the ten sucking clapping snouts twitched fiercely and twenty little eyes glared askance like so many points of wrath they gave uneasy gasping grunts in their haste the unhappy eleventh rushed from point to point trying to push in his snout but for his pains he got rough squeezing and sharp grabs on his ears then he lifted up his face and screamed screams of grief and wrath unto the evening sky  but the ten little gluttons only twitched their ears to make sure there was no danger in the noise and they sucked harder with much spilling and slobbing george laughed like a sardonic jove but at last he gave ear and kicked the ten gluttons from the trough and allowed the residue to the eleventh this one poor wretch almost wept with relief as he sucked and swallowed in sobs casting his little eyes apprehensively upwards though he did not lift his nose from the trough as he heard the vindictive shrieks of ten little fiends kept at bay by george the solitary feeder shivering with apprehension rubbed the wood bare with his snout then turning up to heaven his eyes of gratitude he reluctantly left the trough i expected to see the ten fall upon him and devour him but they did not they rushed upon the empty trough and rubbed the wood still drier shrieking with misery  how like life i laughed  fine litter said george there were fourteen only that damned shedevil circe went and ate three of em before we got at her  the great ugly sow came leering up as he spoke  why dont you fatten her up and devour her the old gargoyle shes an offence to the universe  nay—shes a fine sow  i snorted and he laughed and the old sow grunted with contempt and her little eyes twisted towards us with a demoniac leer as she rolled past  what are you going to do tonight i asked going out  im going courting he replied grinning  oh—wish i were  you can come if you like—and tell me where i make mistakes since youre an expert on such matters  dont you get on very well then i asked  oh all right—its easy enough when you dont care a damn besides you can always have a johnny walker thats the best of courting at the ram inn ill go and get ready  in the kitchen emily sat grinding out some stitching from a big old handmachine that stood on the table before her she was making shirts for sam i presumed that little fellow who was installed at the farm was seated by her side firing off words from a reading book the machine rumbled and rattled on like a whole factory at work for an inch or two during which time sam shouted in shrill explosions like irregular pistol shots do—not—pot—— put cried emily from the machine put—— shrilled the child the soot—on—my—boot——there the machine broke down and frightened by the sound of his own voice the boy stopped in bewilderment and looked round  go on said emily as she poked in the teeth of the old machine with the scissors then pulled and prodded again he began —boot—but—you—— here he died off again made nervous by the sound of his voice in the stillness emily sucked a piece of cotton and pushed it through the needle  now go on she said —but you may  but—you—may—shoot—he shouted away reassured by the rumble of the machine shoot—the—fox i—i—it—is—at—the—rot——  root shrieked emily as she guided the stuff through the doddering jaws of the machine  root echoed the boy and he went off with these crackers root—of—the—tree  next one cried emily  put—the—ol—— began the boy  what cried emily  ole—on——  wait a bit cried emily and then the machine broke down  hang she ejaculated  hang shouted the child  she laughed and leaned over to him  put the oil in the pan to boil while i toil in the soil—oh cyril i never knew you were there go along now sam david ll be at the back somewhere  hes in the bottom garden said i and the child ran out  directly george came in from the scullery drying himself he stood on the hearthrug as he rubbed himself and surveyed his reflection in the mirror above the high mantelpiece he looked at himself and smiled i wondered that he found such satisfaction in his image seeing that there was a gap in his chin and an uncertain motheaten appearance in one cheek mrs saxton still held this mirror an object of dignity it was fairly large and had a wellcarven frame but it left gaps and spots and scratches in ones countenance and even where it was brightest it gave ones reflection a faraway dim aspect notwithstanding george smiled at himself as he combed his hair and twisted his moustache  you seem to make a good impression on yourself said i  i was thinking i looked all right—sort of face to go courting with he replied laughing you just arrange a patch of black to come and hide your faults—and youre all right  i always used to think said emily that the black spots had swallowed so many faces they were full up and couldnt take any more—and the rest was misty because there were so many faces lapped one over the other—reflected  you do see yourself a bit ghostish—— said he on a background of your ancestors i always think when you stop in an old place like this you sort of keep company with your ancestors too much i sometimes feel like a bit of the old building walking about the old feelings of the old folks stick to you like the lichens on the walls you sort of get hoary  thats it—its true asserted the father people whose families have shifted about much dont know how it feels thats why im going to canada  and im going in a pub said george where its quite different—plenty of life  life echoed emily with contempt  thats the word my wench replied her brother lapsing into the dialect thats what im after we known such a lot an we known nöwt  you do—— said the father turning to me you stay in one place generation after generation and you seem to get proud an look on things outside as foolishness theres many a thing as any common man knows as we havent a glimpse of we keep on thinking and feeling the same year after year till weve only got one side an i suppose theyve done it before us  its goodnight an god bless you to th owd place granfeythers an grammothers laughed george as he ran upstairs—an off we go on the gallivant he shouted from the landing  his father shook his head saying  i cant make out how it is hes so different i suppose its being in love——  we went into the barn to get the bicycles to cycle over to greymede george struck a match to look for his pump and he noticed a great spider scuttle off into the corner of the wall and sit peeping out at him like a hoary little ghoul  how are you old chap said george nodding to him—thought he looked like an old grandfather of mine he said to me laughing as he pumped up the tyres of the old bicycle for me  it was saturday night so the bar parlour of the ram inn was fairly full  hello george—come cotin was the cry followed by a nod and a good evenin to me who was a stranger in the parlour  its raïght for thaïgh said a fat young fellow with an unwilling white mustache —tha can cote as much as ter likes ter ae as well as th lass an it costs thee nöwt—— at which the room laughed taking pipes from mouths to do so george sat down looking round  owd on a bit said a blackwhiskered man tha mun a e patience when to t cotin a lass ows puttin th owd lady ter bed—ark thee—can t ear—that wor th bed latts goin bang owll be dern in a minnit now gie er time ter tuck th owd lady up can ter ear er say er prayers  strike cried the fat young man exploding  fancy th owd lady sayin er prayers—it ud be enough ter mae er false teeth drop out  the room laughed  they began to tell tales about the old landlady she had practised bonesetting in which she was very skilful people came to her from long distances that she might divine their trouble and make right their limbs she would accept no fee  once she had gone up to dr fullwood to give him a piece of her mind inasmuch as he had let a child go for three weeks with a broken collarbone whilst treating him for dislocation the doctor had tried the high hand with her since when wherever he went the miners placed their hands on their shoulders and groaned oh my collarbone  here meg came in she gave a bright quick bird like look at george and flushed a brighter red  i thought you wasnt cummin she said  dunna thee bother—ed none stop away said the blackwhiskered man  she brought us glasses of whisky and moved about supplying the men who chaffed with her honestly and goodnaturedly then she went out but we remained in our corner the men talked on the most peculiar subjects there was a bitter discussion as to whether london is or is not a seaport—the matter was thrashed out with heat then an embryo artist set the room ablaze by declaring there were only three colours red yellow and blue and the rest were not colours they were mixtures this amounted almost to atheism and one man asked the artist to dare to declare that his brown breeches were not a colour which the artist did and almost had to fight for it next they came to strength and george won a bet of five shillings by lifting a piano then they settled down and talked sex sotto voce one man giving startling accounts of japanese and chinese prostitutes in liverpool after this the talk split up a farmer began to counsel george how to manage the farm attached to the inn another bargained with him about horses and argued about cattle a tailor advised him thickly to speculate and unfolded a fine secret by which a man might make money if he had the go to do it—so on till eleven oclock then bill came and called time and the place was empty and the room shivered as a little fresh air came in between the foul tobacco smoke and the smell of drink and foul breath  we were both affected by the whisky we had drunk i was ashamed to find that when i put out my hand to take my glass or to strike a match i missed my mark and fumbled my hands seemed hardly to belong to me and my feet were not much more sure yet i was acutely conscious of every change in myself and in him it seemed as if i could make my body drunk but could never intoxicate my mind which roused itself and kept the sharpest guard george was frankly half drunk his eyelids sloped over his eyes and his speech was thick when he put out his hand he knocked over his glass and the stuff was spilled all over the table he only laughed i too felt a great prompting to giggle on every occasion and i marvelled at myself  meg came into the room when all the men had gone  come on my duck he said waving his arm with the generous flourish of a tipsy man come an sit ere  shant you come in th kitchen she asked looking round on the tables where pots and glasses stood in little pools of liquor and where spent matches and tobaccoash littered the white wood  no—what for—come an sit ere—he was reluctant to get on his feet i knew it and laughed inwardly i also laughed to hear his thick speech and his words which seemed to slur against his cheeks  she went and sat by him having moved the little table with its spilled liquor  theyve been tellin me how to get rich he said nodding his head and laughing showing his teeth an im goin ter show em you see meg you see—im goin ter show em i can be as good as them you see  why said she indulgent what are you going to do  you wait a bit an see—they dont know yet what i can do—they dont know—you dont know—none of you know  an what shall you do when were rich george  do—i shall do what i like i can make as good a show as anybody else cant i—he put his face very near to hers and nodded at her but she did not turn away—yes—ill see what its like to have my fling weve been too cautious our family has—an i have were frightened of ourselves to do anything im goin to do what i like my duck now—i dont care—— i dont care—that—he brought his hand down heavily on the table nearest him and broke a glass bill looked in to see what was happening  but you wont do anything thats not right george  no—i dont want to hurt nobody—but i dont care—that  youre too goodhearted to do anybody any harm  i believe i am you know me a bit you do meg—you dont think im a fool now do you  im sure i dont—who does  no—you dont—i know you dont gie me a kiss—thourt a little beauty thou art—like a ripe plum i could set my teeth in thee thourt that nice—full o red juice—he playfully pretended to bite her she laughed and gently pushed him away  tha likest me doesna ta he asked softly  what do you want to know for she replied with a tender archness  but tha does—say now tha does  i should a thought youd a known without telling  nay but i want to hear thee  go on she said and she kissed him  but what should you do if i went to canada and left you  ah—you wouldnt do that  but i might—and what then  oh i dont know what i should do but you wouldnt do it i know you wouldnt—you couldnt he quickly put his arms round her and kissed her moved by the trembling surety of her tone  no i wouldna—id niver leave thee—thad be as miserable as sin shouldna ta my duck  yes she murmured  ah he said thart a warm little thing—tha loves me eh  yes she murmured and he pressed her to him and kissed her and held her close  well be married soon my bird—are ter glad—in a bit—thart glad arent ta  she looked up at him as if he were noble her love for him was so generous that it beautified him  he had to walk his bicycle home being unable to ride his shins i know were a good deal barked by the pedals           chapter vii     the fascination of the forbidden apple   on the first sunday in june when lettie knew she would keep her engagement with leslie and when she was having a day at home from highclose she got ready to go down to the mill we were in mourning for an aunt so she wore a dress of fine black voile and a black hat with long feathers then when i looked at her fair hands and her arms closely covered in the long black cuffs of her sleeves i felt keenly my old brotherlove shielding indulgent  it was a windy sunny day in shelter the heat was passionate but in the open the wind scattered its fire every now and then a white cloud broad based blue shadowed travelled slowly along the skyroad after the forerunner small in the distance and trailing over us a chill shade a gloom which we watched creep on over the water over the wood and the hill these royal rounded clouds had sailed all day along the same route from the harbour of the south to the wastes in the northern sky following the swift wild geese the brook hurried along singing only here and there lingering to whisper to the secret bushes then setting off afresh with a new snatch of song  the fowls pecked staidly in the farmyard with sabbath decorum occasionally a lost sportive windpuff would wander across the yard and ruffle them and they resented it the pigs were asleep in the sun giving faint grunts now and then from sheer luxury i saw a squirrel go darting down the mossy garden wall up into the laburnum tree where he lay flat along the bough and listened suddenly away he went chuckling to himself gyp all at once set off barking but i soothed her down it was the unusual sight of letties dark dress that startled her i suppose  we went quietly into the kitchen mrs saxton was just putting a chicken wrapped in a piece of flannel on the warm hob to coax it into life it looked very feeble george was asleep with his head in his arms on the table the father was asleep on the sofa very comfortable and admirable i heard emily fleeing up stairs presumably to dress  he stays out so late—up at the ram inn whispered the mother in a high whisper looking at george and then hes up at five—he doesnt get his proper rest she turned to the chicks and continued in her whisper—the mother left them just before they hatched out so weve been bringing them on here this ones a bit weak—i thought id hot him up a bit she laughed with a quaint little frown of deprecation eight or nine yellow fluffy little mites were cheeping and scuffling in the fender lettie bent over them to touch them they were tame and ran among her fingers  suddenly georges mother gave a loud cry and rushed to the fire there was a smell of singed down the chicken had toddled into the fire and gasped its faint gasp among the redhot cokes the father jumped from the sofa george sat up with wide eyes lettie gave a little cry and a shudder trip rushed round and began to bark there was a smell of cooked meat  there goes number one said the mother with her queer little laugh it made me laugh too  whats a matter—whats a matter asked the father excitedly  its a chicken been and walked into the fire—i put it on the hob to warm explained his wife  goodness—i couldnt think what was up he said and dropped his head to trace gradually the border between sleeping and waking  george sat and smiled at us faintly he was too dazed to speak his chest still leaned against the table and his arms were spread out thereon but he lifted his face and looked at lettie with his dazed dark eyes and smiled faintly at her his hair was all ruffled and his shirt collar unbuttoned then he got up slowly pushing his chair back with a loud noise and stretched himself pressing his arms upwards with a long heavy stretch  oh—h—h he said bending his arms and then letting them drop to his sides i never thought youd come today  i wanted to come and see you—i shant have many more chances said lettie turning from him and yet looking at him again  no i suppose not he said subsiding into quiet then there was silence for some time the mother began to enquire after leslie and kept the conversation up till emily came down blushing and smiling and glad  are you coming out said she there are two or three robins nests and a spinkies——  i think ill leave my hat said lettie unpinning it as she spoke and shaking her hair when she was free mrs saxton insisted on her taking a long white silk scarf emily also wrapped her hair in a gauze scarf and looked beautiful  george came out with us coatless hatless his waistcoat all unbuttoned as he was we crossed the orchard over the old bridge and went to where the slopes ran down to the lower pond a bank all covered with nettles and scattered with a hazel bush or two among the nettles old pans were rusting and old coarse pottery cropped up  we came upon a kettle heavily coated with lime emily bent down and looked and then we peeped in there were the robin birds with their yellow beaks stretched so wide apart i feared they would never close them again among the naked little mites that begged from us so blindly and confidently were huddled three eggs  they are like irish children peeping out of a cottage said emily with the family fondness for romantic similes  we went on to where a tin lay with the lid pressed back and inside it snug and neat was another nest with six eggs cheek to cheek  how warm they are said lettie touching them you can fairly feel the mothers breast  he tried to put his hand into the tin but the space was too small and they looked into each others eyes and smiled youd think the fathers breast had marked them with red said emily  as we went up the orchard side we saw three wide displays of coloured pieces of pots arranged at the foot of three trees  look said emily those are the childrens houses you dont know how our mollie gets all sams pretty bits—she is a cajoling hussy  the two looked at each other again smiling up on the pondside in the full glitter of light we looked round where the blades of clustering corn were softly healing the red bosom of the hill the larks were overhead among the sunbeams we straggled away across the grass the field was all afroth with cowslips a yellow glittering shaking froth on the still green of the grass we trailed our shadows across the fields extinguishing the sunshine on the flowers as we went the air was tingling with the scent of blossoms  look at the cowslips all shaking with laughter said emily and she tossed back her head and her dark eyes sparkled among the flow of gauze lettie was on in front flitting darkly across the field bending over the flowers stooping to the earth like a sable persephone come into freedom george had left her at a little distance hunting for something in the grass he stopped and remained standing in one place  gradually as if unconsciously she drew near to him and when she lifted her head after stooping to pick some chimneysweeps little grass flowers she laughed with a slight surprise to see him so near  ah she said i thought i was all alone in the world—such a splendid world—it was so nice  like eve in a meadow in eden—and adams shadow somewhere on the grass said i  no—no adam she asserted frowning slightly and laughing  who ever would want streets of gold emily was saying to me when you can have a field of cowslips look at that hedgebottom that gets the south sun—one stream and glitter of buttercups  those jews always had an eye to the filthy lucre—they even made heaven out of it laughed lettie and turning to him she said dont you wish we were wild—hark like woodpigeons—or larks—or look like peewits shouldnt you love flying and wheeling and sparkling and—courting in the wind she lifted her eyelids and vibrated the question he flushed bending over the ground  look he said heres a larkies  once a horse had left a hoofprint in the soft meadow now the larks had rounded softened the cup and had laid there three darkbrown eggs lettie sat down and leaned over the nest he leaned above her the wind running over the flower heads peeped in at the little brown buds and bounded off again gladly the big clouds sent messages to them down the shadows and ran in raindrops to touch them  i wish she said i wish we were free like that if we could put everything safely in a little place in the earth—couldnt we have a good time as well as the larks  i dont see said he why we cant  oh—but i cant—you know we cant—and she looked at him fiercely  why cant you he asked  you know we cant—you know as well as i do she replied and her whole soul challenged him we have to consider things she added he dropped his head he was afraid to make the struggle to rouse himself to decide the question for her she turned away and went kicking through the flowers he picked up the blossoms she had left by the nest—they were still warm from her hands—and followed her she walked on towards the end of the field the long strands of her white scarf running before her then she leaned back to the wind while he caught her up  dont you want your flowers he asked humbly  no thanks—theyd be dead before i got home—throw them away you look absurd with a posy  he did as he was bidden they came near the hedge a crabapple tree blossomed up among the blue  you may get me a bit of that blossom said she and suddenly added—no i can reach it myself whereupon she stretched upward and pulled several sprigs of the pink and white and put it in her dress  isnt it pretty she said and she began to laugh ironically pointing to the flowers—pretty pinkcheeked petals and stamens like yellow hair and buds like lips promising something nice—she stopped and looked at him flickering with a smile then she pointed to the ovary beneath the flower and said result crabapples  she continued to look at him and to smile he said nothing so they went on to where they could climb the fence into the spinney she climbed to the top rail holding by an oak bough then she let him lift her down bodily  ah she said you like to show me how strong you are—a veritable samson—she mocked although she had invited him with her eyes to take her in his arms  we were entering the spinney of black poplar in the hedge was an elm tree with myriads of dark dots pointed against the bright sky myriads of clusters of flaky green fruit  look at that elm she said youd think it was in full leaf wouldnt you do you know why its so prolific  no he said with a curious questioning drawl of the monosyllable  its casting its bread upon the winds—no it is dying so it puts out all its strength and loads its boughs with the last fruit itll be dead next year if youre here then come and see look at the ivy the suave smooth ivy with its fingers in the trees throat trees know how to die you see—we dont  with her whimsical moods she tormented him she was at the bottom a seething confusion of emotion and she wanted to make him likewise  if we were trees with ivy—instead of being fine humans with free active life—we should hug our thinning lives shouldnt we  i suppose we should  you for instance—fancy your sacrificing yourself—for the next generation—that reminds you of schopenhauer doesnt it—for the next generation or love or anything  he did not answer her she was too swift for him they passed on under the poplars which were hanging strings of green beads above them there was a little open space with tufts of bluebells lettie stooped over a woodpigeon that lay on the ground on its breast its wings half spread she took it up—its eyes were bursten and bloody she felt its breast ruffling the dimming iris on its throat  its been fighting he said  what for—a mate she asked looking at him  i dont know he answered  cold—hes quite cold under the feathers i think a woodpigeon must enjoy being fought for—and being won especially if the right one won it would be a fine pleasure to see them fighting—dont you think she said torturing him  the claws are spread—it fell dead off the perch he replied  ah poor thing—it was wounded—and sat and waited for death—when the other had won dont you think life is very cruel george—and love the cruellest of all  he laughed bitterly under the pain of her soft sad tones  let me bury him—and have done with the beaten lover but well make him a pretty grave  she scooped a hole in the dark soil and snatching a handful of bluebells threw them in on top of the dead bird then she smoothed the soil over all and pressed her white hands on the black loam  there she said knocking her hands one against the other to shake off the soil hes done with come on  he followed her speechless with his emotion  the spinney opened out the ferns were serenely uncoiling the bluebells stood grouped with blue curls mingled in the freer spaces forgetmenots flowered in nebulæ and dogviolets gave an undertone of dark purple with primroses for planets in the night there was a slight drift of woodruff sweet newmown hay scenting the air under the boughs on a wet bank was the design of golden saxifrage glistening unholily as if varnished by its minister the snail george and lettie crushed the veined belles of woodsorrel and broke the silken mosses what did it matter to them what they broke or crushed  over the fence of the spinney was the hillside scattered with old thorn trees there the little grey lichens held up ruby balls to us unnoticed what did it matter when all the great red apples were being shaken from the tree to be left to rot  if i were a man said lettie i would go out west and be free i should love it  she took the scarf from her head and let it wave out on the wind the colour was warm in her face with climbing and her curls were freed by the wind sparkling and rippling  well—youre not a man he said looking at her and speaking with timid bitterness  no she laughed if i were i would shape things—oh wouldnt i have my own way  and dont you now  oh—i dont want it particularly—when ive got it when ive had my way i do want somebody to take it back from me  she put her head back and looked at him sideways laughing through the glitter of her hair  they came to the kennels she sat down on the edge of the great stone water trough and put her hands in the water moving them gently like submerged flowers through the clear pool  i love to see myself in the water she said i dont mean on the water narcissus—but thats how i should like to be out west to have a little lake of my own and swim with my limbs quite free in the water  do you swim well he asked  fairly  i would race you—in your little lake  she laughed took her hands out of the water and watched the clear drops trickle off then she lifted her head suddenly at some thought or other she looked across the valley and saw the red roofs of the mill      —ilion ilion     fatalis incestusque judex     et mulier peregrina vertit     in pulverem——  whats that he said  nothing  thats a private trough exclaimed a thin voice high like a peewits cry we started in surprise to see a tall blackbearded man looking at us and away from us nervously fidgeting uneasily some ten yards off  is it said lettie looking at her wet hands which she proceeded to dry on a fragment of a handkerchief  you mustnt meddle with it said the man in the same reedy oboe voice then he turned his head away and his pale grey eyes roved the countryside——when he had courage he turned his back to us shading his eyes to continue his scrutiny he walked hurriedly a few steps then craned his neck peering into the valley and hastened a dozen yards in another direction again stretching and peering about then he went indoors  he is pretending to look for somebody said lettie but its only because hes afraid we shall think he came out just to look at us—and they laughed  suddenly a woman appeared at the gate she had pale eyes like the mousevoiced man  youll get brights disease sitting on that there damp stone she said to lettie who at once rose apologetically  i ought to know continued the mousevoiced woman my own mother died of it  indeed murmured lettie im sorry  yes continued the woman it behooves you to be careful do you come from strelley mill farm she asked suddenly of george surveying his shameful déshabille with bitter reproof  he admitted the imputation  and youre going to leave arent you  which also he admitted  humph—we sll appen get some neighbours its a dogs life for loneliness i suppose you knew the last lot that was here  another brief admission  a dirty lot—a dirty beagle she must have been you should just ha seen these grates  yes said lettie i have seen them  faugh—the state but come in—come in youll see a difference  they entered out of curiosity the kitchen was indeed different it was clean and sparkling warm with bright red chintzes on the sofa and on every chair cushion unfortunately the effect was spoiled by green and yellow antimaccassars and by a profusion of paper and woollen flowers there were three cases of woollen flowers and on the wall four fans stitched over with ruffled green and yellow paper adorned with yellow paper roses carnations arum lilies and poppies there were also wall pockets full of paper flowers while the wood outside was loaded with blossom yes said lettie there is a difference the woman swelled and looked round the blackbearded man peeped from behind the christian herald—those long blaring trumpets—and shrank again the woman darted at his pipe which he had put on a piece of newspaper on the hob and blew some imaginary ash from it then she caught sight of something—perhaps some dust—on the fireplace  there she cried i knew it i couldnt leave him one second i havent work enough burning wood but he must be poke——poke——  i only pushed a piece in between the bars complained the mousevoice from behind the paper  pushed a piece in she reechoed with awful scorn seizing the poker and thrusting it over his paper what do you call that sitting there telling your stories before folks——  they crept out and hurried away glancing round lettie saw the woman mopping the doorstep after them and she laughed he pulled his watch out of his breeches pocket it was halfpast three  what are you looking at the time for she asked  megs coming to tea he replied  she said no more and they walked slowly on  when they came on to the shoulder of the hill and looked down on to the mill and the millpond she said  i will not come down with you—i will go home  not come down to tea he exclaimed full of reproach and amazement why what will they say  no i wont come down—let me say farewell—jamque vale do you remember how eurydice sank back into hell  but—he stammered you must come down to tea—how can i tell them why wont you come  she answered him in latin with two lines from virgil as she watched him she pitied his helplessness and gave him a last cut as she said very softly and tenderly  it wouldnt be fair to meg  he stood looking at her his face was coloured only by the greybrown tan his eyes the dark selfmistrustful eyes of the family were darker than ever dilated with misery of helplessness and she was infinitely pitiful she wanted to cry in her yearning  shall we go into the wood for a few minutes she said in a low tremulous voice as they turned aside  the wood was high and warm along the ridings the forgetmenots were knee deep stretching glimmering into the distance like the milky way through the night they left the tall flowertangled paths to go in among the bluebells breaking through the closepressed flowers and ferns till they came to an oak which had fallen across the hazels where they sat half screened the hyacinths drooped magnificently with an overweight of purple or they stood pale and erect like unripe ears of purple corn heavy bees swung down in a blunder of extravagance among the purple flowers they were intoxicated even with the sight of so much blue the sound of their hearty wanton humming came clear upon the solemn boom of the wind overhead the sight of their clinging clambering riot gave satisfaction to the soul a rosy campion flower caught the sun and shone out an elm sent down a shower of fleshtinted sheaths upon them  if there were fauns and hamadryads she said softly turning to him to soothe his misery she took his cap from his head ruffled his hair saying  if you were a faun i would put guelder roses round your hair and make you look bacchanalian she left her hand lying on his knee and looked up at the sky its blue looked pale and green in comparison with the purple tide ebbing about the wood the clouds rose up like towers and something had touched them into beauty and poised them up among the winds the clouds passed on and the pool of sky was clear  look she said how we are netted down—boughs with knots of green buds if we were free on the winds—but im glad were not she turned suddenly to him and with the same movement she gave him her hand and he clasped it in both his im glad were netted down here if we were free in the winds—ah  she laughed a peculiar little laugh catching her breath  look she said its a palace with the ashtrunks smooth like a girls arm and the elmcolumns ribbed and bossed and fretted with the great steel shafts of beech all rising up to hold an embroidered carecloth over us and every thread of the carecloth vibrates with music for us and the little broidered birds sing and the hazelbushes fling green spray round us and the honeysuckle leans down to pour out scent over us look at the harvest of bluebells—ripened for us listen to the bee sounding among all the organplay—if he sounded exultant for us she looked at him with tears coming up into her eyes and a little winsome wistful smile hovering round her mouth he was very pale and dared not look at her she put her hand in his leaning softly against him he watched as if fascinated a young thrush with full pale breast who hopped near to look at them—glancing with quick shining eyes  the clouds are going on again said lettie  look at that cloud face—see—gazing right up into the sky the lips are opening—he is telling us something—now the form is slipping away—its gone—come we must go too  no he cried dont go—dont go away  her tenderness made her calm she replied in a voice perfect in restrained sadness and resignation  no my dear no the threads of my life were untwined they drifted about like floating threads of gossamer and you didnt put out your hand to take them and twist them up into the chord with yours now another has caught them up and the chord of my life is being twisted and i cannot wrench it free and untwine it again—i cant i am not strong enough besides you have twisted another thread far and tight into your chord could you get free  tell me what to do—yes if you tell me  i cant tell you—so let me go  no lettie he pleaded with terror and humility no lettie dont go what should i do with my life nobody would love you like i do—and what should i do with my love for you—hate it and fear it because its too much for me  she turned and kissed him gratefully he then took her in a long passionate embrace mouth to mouth in the end it had so wearied her that she could only wait in his arms till he was too tired to hold her he was trembling already  poor meg she murmured to herself dully her sensations having become vague  he winced and the pressure of his arms slackened she loosened his hands and rose half dazed from her seat by him she left him while he sat dejected raising no protest  when i went out to look for them when tea had already been waiting on the table half an hour or more i found him leaning against the gatepost at the bottom of the hill there was no blood in his face and his tan showed livid he was haggard as if he had been ill for some weeks  whatevers the matter i said wheres lettie  shes gone home he answered and the sound of his own voice and the meaning of his own words made him heave  why i asked in alarm  he looked at me as if to say what are you talking about i cannot listen  why i insisted  i dont know he replied  they are waiting tea for you i said  he heard me but took no notice  come on i repeated theres meg and everybody waiting tea for you  i dont want any he said  i waited a minute or two he was violently sick     vae meum    fervens difficile bile tumet jecur  i thought to myself  when the sickness passed over he stood up away from the post trembling and lugubrious his eyelids drooped heavily over his eyes and he looked at me and smiled a faint sick smile  come and lie down in the loft i said and ill tell them youve got a bilious bout  he obeyed me not having energy to question his strength had gone and his splendid physique seemed shrunken he walked weakly i looked away from him for in his feebleness he was already beginning to feel ludicrous  we got into the barn unperceived and i watched him climb the ladder to the loft then i went indoors to tell them  i told them lettie had promised to be at highclose for tea that george had a bilious attack and was mooning about the barn till it was over he had been badly sick we ate tea without zest or enjoyment meg was wistful and ill at ease the father talked to her and made much of her the mother did not care for her much  i cant understand it said the mother he so rarely has anything the matter with him—why ive hardly known the day are you sure its nothing serious cyril it seems such a thing—and just when meg happened to be down—just when meg was coming——  about halfpast six i had again to go and look for him to satisfy the anxiety of his mother and his sweetheart i went whistling to let him know i was coming he lay on a pile of hay in a corner asleep he had put his cap under his head to stop the tickling of the hay and he lay half curled up sleeping soundly he was still very pale and there was on his face the repose and pathos that a sorrow always leaves as he wore no coat i was afraid he might be chilly so i covered him up with a couple of sacks and i left him i would not have him disturbed—i helped the father about the cowsheds and with the pigs  meg had to go at halfpast seven she was so disappointed that i said  come and have a look at him—ill tell him you did  he had thrown off the sacks and spread out his limbs as he lay on his back flung out on the hay he looked big again and manly his mouth had relaxed and taken its old easy lines one felt for him now the warmth one feels for anyone who sleeps in an attitude of abandon she leaned over him and looked at him with a little rapture of love and tenderness she longed to caress him then he stretched himself and his eyes opened their sudden unclosing gave her a thrill he smiled sleepily and murmured allo meg then i saw him awake as he remembered he turned with a great sighing yawn hid his face again and lay still  come along meg i whispered hell be best asleep  id better cover him up she said taking the sack and laying it very gently over his shoulders he kept perfectly still while i drew her away           chapter viii     a poem of friendship   the magnificent promise of spring was broken before the mayblossom was fully out all through the beloved month the wind rushed in upon us from the north and northeast bringing the rain fierce and heavy the tenderbudded trees shuddered and moaned when the wind was dry the young leaves flapped limp the grass and corn grew lush but the light of the dandelions was quite extinguished and it seemed that only a long time back had we made merry before the broad glare of these flowers the bluebells lingered and lingered they fringed the fields for weeks like purple fringe of mourning the pink campions came out only to hang heavy with rain hawthorn buds remained tight and hard as pearls shrinking into the brilliant green foliage the forgetmenots the poor pleiades of the wood were ragged weeds often at the end of the day the sky opened and stately clouds hung over the horizon infinitely far away glowing through the yellow distance with an amber lustre they never came any nearer always they remained far off looking calmly and majestically over the shivering earth then saddened fearing their radiance might be dimmed they drew away and sank out of sight sometimes towards sunset a great shield stretched dark from the west to the zenith tangling the light along its edges as the canopy rose higher it broke dispersed and the sky was primrose coloured high and pale above the crystal moon then the cattle crouched among the gorse distressed by the cold while the longbilled snipe flickered round high overhead round and round in great circles seeming to carry a serpent from its throat and crying a tragedy more painful than the poignant lamentations and protests of the peewits following these evenings came mornings cold and grey  such a morning i went up to george on the top fallow his father was out with the milk—he was alone as i came up the hill i could see him standing in the cart scattering manure over the bare red fields i could hear his voice calling now and then to the mare and the creak and clank of the cart as it moved on starlings and smart wagtails were running briskly over the clods and many little birds flashed fluttered hopped here and there the lapwings wheeled and cried as ever between the low clouds and the earth and some ran beautifully among the furrows too graceful and glistening for the rough field  i took a fork and scattered the manure along the hollows and thus we worked with a wide field between us yet very near in the sense of intimacy i watched him through the wheeling peewits as the low clouds went stealthily overhead beneath us the spires of the poplars in the spinney were warm gold as if the blood shone through further gleamed the grey water and below it the red roofs nethermere was half hidden and far away there was nothing in this grey lonely world but the peewits swinging and crying and george swinging silently at his work the movement of active life held all my attention and when i looked up it was to see the motion of his limbs and his head the rise and fall of his rhythmic body and the rise and fall of the slow waving peewits after a while when the cart was empty he took a fork and came towards me working at my task  it began to rain so he brought a sack from the cart and we crushed ourselves under the thick hedge we sat close together and watched the rain fall like a grey striped curtain before us hiding the valley we watched it trickle in dark streams off the mares back as she stood dejectedly we listened to the swish of the drops falling all about we felt the chill of the rain and drew ourselves together in silence he smoked his pipe and i lit a cigarette the rain continued all the little pebbles and the red earth glistened in the grey gloom we sat together speaking occasionally it was at these times we formed the almost passionate attachment which later years slowly wore away  when the rain was over we filled our buckets with potatoes and went along the wet furrows sticking the spritted tubers in the cold ground being sandy the field dried quickly about twelve oclock when nearly all the potatoes were set he left me and fetching up bob from the far hedgeside harnessed the mare and him to the ridger to cover the potatoes the sharp light plough turned the soil in a fine furrow over the potatoes hosts of little birds fluttered settled bounded off again after the plough he called to the horses and they came downhill the white stars on the two brown noses nodding up and down george striding firm and heavy behind they came down upon me at a call the horses turned shifting awkwardly sideways he flung himself against the plough and leaning well in brought it round with a sweep a click and they are off uphill again there is a great rustle as the birds sweep round after him and follow up the new turned furrow untackling the horses when the rows were all covered we tramped behind them down the wet hillside to dinner  i kicked through the drenched grass crushing the withered cowslips under my clogs avoiding the purple orchids that were stunted with harsh upbringing but magnificent in their powerful colouring crushing the pallid lady smocks the washedout wild gillivers i became conscious of something near my feet something little and dark moving indefinitely i had found again the larkies nest i perceived the yellow beaks the bulging eyelids of two tiny larks and the blue lines of their wing quills the indefinite movement was the swift rise and fall of the brown fledged backs over which waved long strands of fine down the two little specks of birds lay side by side beak to beak their tiny bodies rising and falling in quick unison i gently put down my fingers to touch them they were warm gratifying to find them warm in the midst of so much cold and wet i became curiously absorbed in them as an eddy of wind stirred the strands of down when one fledgling moved uneasily shifting his soft ball i was quite excited but he nestled down again with his head close to his brothers in my heart of hearts i longed for someone to nestle against someone who would come between me and the coldness and wetness of the surroundings i envied the two little miracles exposed to any tread yet so serene it seemed as if i were always wandering looking for something which they had found even before the light broke into their shell i was cold the lilacs in the mill garden looked blue and perished i ran with my heavy clogs and my heart heavy with vague longing down to the mill while the wind blanched the sycamores and pushed the sullen pines rudely for the pines were sulking because their million creamy sprites could not fly wetwinged the horsechestnuts bravely kept their white candles erect in the socket of every bough though no sun came to light them drearily a cold swan swept up the water trailing its black feet clacking its great hollow wings rocking the frightened water hens and insulting the staid blacknecked geese what did i want that i turned thus from one thing to another  at the end of june the weather became fine again hay harvest was to begin as soon as it settled there were only two fields to be mown this year to provide just enough stuff to last until the spring as my vacation had begun i decided i would help and that we three the father george and i would get in the hay without hired assistance  i rose the first morning very early before the sun was well up the clear sound of challenging cocks could be heard along the valley in the bottoms over the water and over the lush wet grass the night mist still stood white and substantial as i passed along the edge of the meadow the cowparsnip was as tall as i frothing up to the top of the hedge putting the faded hawthorn to a wan blush little early birds—i had not heard the lark—fluttered in and out of the foamy meadowsea plunging under the surf of flowers washed high in one corner swinging out again dashing past the crimson sorrel cresset under the froth of flowers were the purple vetchclumps yellow milk vetches and the scattered pink of the woodbetony and the floating stars of marguerites there was a weight of honeysuckle on the hedges where pink roses were waking up for their broadspread flight through the day  morning silvered the swaths of the far meadow and swept in smooth brilliant curves round the stones of the brook morning ran in my veins morning chased the silver darting fish out of the depth and i who saw them snapped my fingers at them driving them back  i heard trip barking so i ran towards the pond the punt was at the island where from behind the bushes i could hear george whistling i called to him and he came to the waters edge half dressed  fetch a towel he called and come on  i was back in a few moments and there stood my charon fluttering in the cool air one good push sent us to the islet i made haste to undress for he was ready for the water trip dancing round barking with excitement at his new appearance  he wonders whats happened to me he said laughing pushing the dog playfully away with his bare foot trip bounded back and came leaping up licking him with little caressing licks he began to play with the dog and directly they were rolling on the fine turf the laughing expostulating naked man and the excited dog who thrust his great head on to the mans face licking and when flung away rushed forward again snapping playfully at the naked arms and breasts at last george lay back laughing and panting holding trip by the two fore feet which were planted on his breast while the dog also panting reached forward his head for a flickering lick at the throat pressed back on the grass and the mouth thrown back out of reach when the man had thus lain still for a few moments and the dog was just laying his head against his masters neck to rest too i called and george jumped up and plunged into the pond with me trip after us  the water was icily cold and for a moment deprived me of my senses when i began to swim soon the water was buoyant and i was sensible of nothing but the vigorous poetry of action i saw george swimming on his back laughing at me and in an instant i had flung myself like an impulse after him the laughing face vanished as he swung over and fled and i pursued the dark head and the ruddy neck trip the wretch came paddling towards me interrupting me then all bewildered with excitement he scudded to the bank i chuckled to myself as i saw him run along then plunge in and go plodding to george i was gaining he tried to drive off the dog and i gained rapidly as i came up to him and caught him with my hand on his shoulder there came a laughter from the bank it was emily  i trod the water and threw handfuls of spray at her she laughed and blushed then trip waded out to her and she fled swiftly from his showerbath george was floating just beside me looking up and laughing  we stood and looked at each other as we rubbed ourselves dry he was well proportioned and naturally of handsome physique heavily limbed he laughed at me telling me i was like one of aubrey beardsleys long lean ugly fellows i referred him to many classic examples of slenderness declaring myself more exquisite than his grossness which amused him  but i had to give in and bow to him and he took on an indulgent gentle manner i laughed and submitted for he knew how i admired the noble white fruitfulness of his form as i watched him he stood in white relief against the mass of green he polished his arm holding it out straight and solid he rubbed his hair into curls while i watched the deep muscles of his shoulders and the bands stand out in his neck as he held it firm i remembered the story of annable  he saw i had forgotten to continue my rubbing and laughing he took hold of me and began to rub me briskly as if i were a child or rather a woman he loved and did not fear i left myself quite limply in his hands and to get a better grip of me he put his arm round me and pressed me against him and the sweetness of the touch of our naked bodies one against the other was superb it satisfied in some measure the vague indecipherable yearning of my soul and it was the same with him when he had rubbed me all warm he let me go and we looked at each other with eyes of still laughter and our love was perfect for a moment more perfect than any love i have known since either for man or woman  we went together down to the fields he to mow the island of grass he had left standing the previous evening i to sharpen the machine knife to mow out the hedgebottoms with the scythe and to rake the swaths from the way of the machine when the unmown grass was reduced to a triangle the cool moist fragrance of the morning the intentional stillness of everything of the tall bluish trees of the wet frank flowers of the trustful moths folded and unfolded in the fallen swaths was a perfect medium of sympathy the horses moved with a still dignity obeying his commands when they were harnessed and the machine oiled still he was loth to mar the perfect morning but stood looking down the valley  i shant mow these fields any more he said and the fallen silvered swaths flickered back his regret and the faint scent of the limes was wistful so much of the field was cut so much remained to cut then it was ended this year the elder flowers were widespread over the corner bushes and the pink roses fluttered high above the hedge there were the same flowers in the grass as we had known many years we should not know them any more  but merely to have mown them is worth having lived for he said looking at me  we felt the warmth of the sun trickling through the mornings mist of coolness  you see that sycamore he said that bushy one beyond the big willow i remember when father broke off the leading shoot because he wanted a fine straight stick i can remember i felt sorry it was running up so straight with such a fine balance of leaves—you know how a young strong sycamore looks about nine feet high—it seemed a cruelty when you are gone and we are left from here i shall feel like that as if my leading shoot were broken off you see the tree is spoiled yet how it went on growing i believe i shall grow faster i can remember the bright red stalks of the leaves as he broke them off from the bough  he smiled at me half proud of his speech then he swung into the seat of the machine having attended to the horses heads he lifted the knife  goodbye he said smiling whimsically back at me the machine started the bed of the knife fell and the grass shivered and dropped over i watched the heads of the daisies and the splendid lines of the cocksfool grass quiver shake against the crimson burnet and dropover the machine went singing down the field leaving a track of smooth velvet green in the way of the swathboard the flowers in the wall of uncut grass waited unmoved as the days wait for us the sun caught in the uplicking scarlet sorrel flames the butterflies woke and i could hear the fine ring of his whoa from the far corner then he turned and i could see only the tossing ears of the horses and the white of his shoulder as they moved along the wall of high grass on the hill slope i sat down under the elm to file the sections of the knife always as he rode he watched the falling swath only occasionally calling the horses into line it was his voice which rang the morning awake when we were at work we hardly noticed one another yet his mother had said  george is so glad when youre in the field—he doesnt care how long the day is  later when the morning was hot and the honeysuckle had ceased to breathe and all the other scents were moving in the air about us when all the field was down when i had seen the last trembling ecstasy of the harebells trembling to fall when the thick clump of purple vetch had sunk when the green swaths were settling and the silver swaths were glistening and glittering as the sun came along them in the hot ripe morning we worked together turning the hay tipping over the yesterdays swaths with our forks and bringing yesterdays fresh hidden flowers into the death of sunlight  it was then that we talked of the past and speculated on the future as the day grew older and less wistful we forgot everything and worked on singing and sometimes i would recite him verses as we went and sometimes i would tell him about books life was full of glamour for us both           chapter ix     pastorals and peonies   at dinner time the father announced to us the exciting fact that leslie had asked if a few of his guests might picnic that afternoon in the strelley hayfields the closes were so beautiful with the brook under all its sheltering trees running into the pond that was set with two green islets moreover the squires lady had written a book filling these meadows and the mill precincts with potpourri romance the wedding guests at highclose were anxious to picnic in so choice a spot  the father who delighted in a gay throng beamed at us from over the table george asked who were coming  oh not many—about half a dozen—mostly ladies down for the wedding  george at first swore warmly then he began to appreciate the affair as a joke  mrs saxton hoped they wouldnt want her to provide them pots for she hadnt two cups that matched nor had any of her spoons the least pretence to silver the children were hugely excited and wanted a holiday from school which emily at once vetoed firmly thereby causing family dissension  as we went round the field in the afternoon turning the hay we were thinking apart and did not talk every now and then—and at every corner—we stopped to look down towards the wood to see if they were coming  here they are george exclaimed suddenly having spied the movement of white in the dark wood we stood still and watched two girls heliotrope and white a man with two girls pale green and white and a man with a girl last  can you tell who they are i asked  thats marie tempest that first girl in white and thats him and lettie at the back i dont know any more  he stood perfectly still until they had gone out of sight behind the banks down by the brooks then he stuck his fork in the ground saying  you can easily finish—if you like ill go and mow out that bottom corner  he glanced at me to see what i was thinking of him i was thinking that he was afraid to meet her and i was smiling to myself perhaps he felt ashamed for he went silently away to the machine where he belted his riding breeches tightly round his waist and slung the scythe strap on his hip i heard the clanging slur of the scythe stone as he whetted the blade then he strode off to mow the far bottom corner where the ground was marshy and the machine might not go to bring down the lush green grass and the tall meadow sweet  i went to the pond to meet the newcomers i bowed to louie denys a tall graceful girl of the drooping type elaborately gowned in heliotrope linen i bowed to agnes darcy an erect intelligent girl with magnificent auburn hair—she wore no hat and carried a sunshade i bowed to hilda seconde a svelte petite girl exquisitely and delicately pretty i bowed to maria and to lettie and i shook hands with leslie and with his friend freddy cresswell the latter was to be best man a broad shouldered palefaced fellow with beautiful soft hair like red wheat and laughing eyes and a whimsical drawling manner of speech like a man who has suffered enough to bring him to manhood and maturity but who in spite of all remains a boy irresponsible lovable—a trifle pathetic as the day was very hot both men were in flannels and wore flannel collars yet it was evident that they had dressed with scrupulous care instinctively i tried to pull my trousers into shape within my belt and i felt the inferiority cast upon the father big and fine as he was in his way for his shoulders were rounded with work and his trousers were much distorted  what can we do said marie you know we dont want to hinder we want to help you it was so good of you to let us come  the father laughed his fine indulgence saying to them—they loved him for the mellow laughing modulation of his voice  come on then—i see theres a bit of turningover to do as cyrils left come and pick your forks  from among a sheaf of hayforks he chose the lightest for them and they began anywhere just tipping at the swaths he showed them carefully—marie and the charming little hilda—just how to do it but they found the right way the hardest way so they worked in their own fashion and laughed heartily with him when he made playful jokes at them he was a great lover of girls and they blossomed from timidity under his hearty influence  ain it flippin ot drawled cresswell who had just taken his m a degree in classics this bloomin stuffs dry enough—come an flop on it  he gathered a cushion of hay which louie denys carefully appropriated arranging first her beautiful dress that fitted close to her shape without any belt or interruption and then laying her arms that were netted to the shoulder in open lace gracefully at rest lettie who was also in a closefitting white dress which showed her shape down to the hips sat where leslie had prepared for her and miss darcy reluctantly accepted my pile  cresswell twisted his cleancut mouth in a little smile saying  lord a giddy little pastoral—fit for old theocritus aint it miss denys  why do you talk to me about those classic people—i darent even say their names what would he say about us  he laughed winking his blue eyes  hed make old daphnis there—pointing to leslie—sing a match with me damoetas—contesting the merits of our various sheperdesses—begin daphnis sing up for amaryllis i mean nais damn em they were for ever getting mixed up with their nymphs  i say mr cresswell your language consider whom youre damning said miss denys leaning over and tapping his head with her silk glove  you say any giddy thing in a pastoral he replied taking the edge of her skirt and lying back on it looking up at her as she leaned over him strike up daphnis something about honey or white cheese—or else the early apples thatll be ripe in a weeks time  im sure the apples you showed me are ever so little and green interrupted miss denys they will never be ripe in a week—ugh sour  he smiled up at her in his whimsical way  hear that tempest—ugh sour—not much oh love us havent you got a start yet—isnt there aught to sing about you bluntfaced kid  ill hear you first—im no judge of honey and cheese  an darn little apples—takes a woman to judge them dont it miss denys  i dont know she said stroking his soft hair from his forehead with her hand whereon rings were sparkling  my love is not white my hair is not yellow like honey dropping through the sunlight—my love is brown and sweet and ready for the lips of love go on tempest—strike up old cowherd whos that tuning his pipe—oh that fellow sharpening his scythe its enough to make your backache to look at him working—go an stop him somebody  yes let us go and fetch him said miss darcy im sure he doesnt know what a happy pastoral state hes in—let us go and fetch him  they dont like hindering at their work agnes—besides where ignorance is bliss—— said lettie afraid lest she might bring him the other hesitated then with her eyes she invited me to go with her  oh dear she laughed with a little mowe freddy is such an ass and louie denys is like a wasp at treacle i wanted to laugh yet i felt just a tiny bit cross dont you feel great when you go mowing like that father timey sort of feeling shall we go and look well say we want those foxgloves hell be cutting down directly—and those bell flowers i suppose you neednt go on with your labours——  he did not know we were approaching till i called him then he started slightly as he saw the tall proud girl  mr saxton—miss darcy i said and he shook hands with her immediately his manner became ironic for he had seen his hand big and coarse and inflamed with the snaith clasping the ladys hand  we thought you looked so fine she said to him and men are so embarrassing when they make love to somebody else—arent they save us those foxgloves will you—they are splendid—like savage soldiers drawn up against the hedge—dont cut them down—and those campanulas—bellflowers ah yes they are spinning idylls up there i dont care for idylls do you oh you dont know what a classical pastoral person you are—but there i dont suppose you suffer from idyllic love—— she laughed —one doesnt see the silly little god fluttering about in our hayfields does one do you find much time to sport with amaryllis in the shade—im sure its a shame they banished phyllis from the fields——  he laughed and went on with his work she smiled a little too thinking she had made a great impression she put out her hand with a dramatic gesture and looked at me when the scythe crunched through the meadowsweet  crunch isnt it fine she exclaimed a kind of inevitable fate—i think its fine  we wandered about picking flowers and talking until teatime a manservant came with the teabasket and the girls spread the cloth under a great willow tree lettie took the little silver kettle and went to fill it at the small spring which trickled into a stone trough all pretty with cranesbill and stellaria hanging over while long blades of grass waved in the water george who had finished his work and wanted to go home to tea walked across to the spring where lettie sat playing with the water getting little cupfuls to put into the kettle watching the quick skating of the water beetles and the large faint spots of their shadows darting on the silted mud at the bottom of the trough  she glanced round on hearing him coming and smiled nervously they were mutually afraid of meeting each other again  it is about teatime he said  yes—it will be ready in a moment—this is not to make the tea with—its only to keep a little supply of hot water  oh he said ill go on home—id rather  no she replied you cant because we are all having tea together i had some fruits put up because i know you dont trifle with tea—and your fathers coming  but he replied pettishly i cant have my tea with all those folks—i dont want to—look at me  he held out his inflamed barbaric hands  she winced and said  it wont matter—youll give the realistic touch  he laughed ironically  no—you must come she insisted  ill have a drink then if youll let me he said yielding  she got up quickly blushing offering him the tiny pretty cup  im awfully sorry she said  never mind he muttered and turning from the proffered cup he lay down flat put his mouth to the water and drank deeply she stood and watched the motion of his drinking and of his heavy breathing afterwards he got up wiping his mouth not looking at her then he washed his hands in the water and stirred up the mud he put his hand to the bottom of the trough bringing out a handful of silt with the grey shrimps twisting in it he flung the mud on the floor where the poor grey creatures writhed  it wants cleaning out he said  yes she replied shuddering you wont be long she added taking up the silver kettle  in a few moments he got up and followed her reluctantly down he was nervous and irritable  the girls were seated on tufts of hay with the men leaning in attendance on them and the manservant waiting on all george was placed between lettie and hilda the former handed him his little eggshell of tea which as he was not very thirsty he put down on the ground beside him then she passed him the bread and butter cut for fiveoclock tea and fruits grapes and peaches and strawberries in a beautifully carved oak tray she watched for a moment his thick halfwashed fingers fumbling over the fruits then she turned her head away all the gay teatime when the talk bubbled and frothed over all the cups she avoided him with her eyes yet again and again as someone said im sorry mr saxton—will you have some cake—or see mr saxton—try this peach im sure it will be mellow right to the stone—speaking very naturally but making the distinction between him and the other men by their indulgence towards him lettie was forced to glance at him as he sat eating answering in monosyllables laughing with constraint and awkwardness and her irritation flickered between her brows although she kept up the gay frivolity of the conversation still the discord was felt by everybody and we did not linger as we should have done over the cups george they said afterwards was a wet blanket on the party lettie was intensely annoyed with him his presence was unbearable to her she wished him a thousand miles away he sat listening to cresswells whimsical affectation of vulgarity which flickered with fantasy and he laughed in a strained fashion  he was the first to rise saying he must get the cows up for milking  oh let us go—let us go may we come and see the cows milked said hilda her delicate exquisite features flushing for she was very shy  no drawled freddy the stink o live beef aint salubrious you be warned and stop here  i never could bear cows except those lovely little highland cattle all woolly in pictures said louie denys smiling archly with a little irony  no laughed agnes darcy they—theyre smelly—and she pursed up her mouth and ended in a little trill of deprecatory laughter as she often did hilda looked from one to the other blushing  come lettie said leslie goodnaturedly i know you have a farmyard fondness—come on and they followed george down  as they passed along the pond bank a swan and her tawny fluffy brood sailed with them the length of the water tipping on their little toes the darlings—pitterpatter through the water tiny little things as marie said  we heard george below calling bully—bully—bully—bully—and then a moment or two after in the bottom garden come out you little fool—are you coming out of it in manifestly angry tones  has it run away laughed hilda delighted and we hastened out of the lower garden to see  there in the green shade between the tall gooseberry bushes the heavy crimson peonies stood gorgeously along the path the full red globes poised and leaning voluptuously sank their crimson weight on to the seeding grass of the path borne down by secret rain and by their own splendour the path was poured over with red rich silk of strewn petals the great flowers swung their crimson grandly about the walk like crowds of cardinals in pomp among the green bushes we burst into the new world of delight as lettie stooped taking between both hands the gorgeous silken fulness of one blossom that was sunk to the earth george came down the path with the brown bullcalf straddling behind him its neck stuck out sucking zealously at his middle finger  the unconscious attitudes of the girls all bent enraptured over the peonies touched him with sudden pain as he came up with the calf stalking grudgingly behind he said  theres a fine show of pyeenocks this year isnt there  what do you call them cried hilda turning to him her sweet charming face full of interest  pyeenocks he replied  lettie remained crouching with a red flower between her hands glancing sideways unseen to look at the calf which with its shiny nose uplifted was mumbling in its sticky gums the seductive finger it sucked eagerly but unprofitably and it appeared to cast a troubled eye inwards to see if it were really receiving any satisfaction—doubting but not despairing marie and hilda and leslie laughed while he after looking at lettie as she crouched wistfully as he thought over the flower led the little brute out of the garden and sent it running into the yard with a smack on the haunch  then he returned rubbing his sticky finger dry against his breeches he stood near to lettie and she felt rather than saw the extraordinary pale cleanness of the one finger among the others she rubbed her finger against her dress in painful sympathy  but arent the flowers lovely exclaimed marie again i want to hug them  oh yes assented hilda  they are like a romance—dannunzio—a romance in passionate sadness said lettie in an ironical voice speaking half out of conventional necessity of saying something half out of desire to shield herself and yet in a measure express herself  there is a tale about them i said  the girls clamoured for the legend  pray do tell us pleaded hilda the irresistible  it was emily told me—she says its a legend but i believe its only a tale she says the peonies were brought from the hall long since by a fellow of this place—when it was a mill he was brown and strong and the daughter of the hall who was pale and fragile and young loved him when he went up to the hall gardens to cut the yew hedges she would hover round him in her white frock and tell him tales of old days in little snatches like a wren singing till he thought she was a fairy who had bewitched him he would stand and watch her and one day when she came near to him telling him a tale that set the tears swimming in her eyes he took hold of her and kissed her and kept her they used to tryst in the poplar spinney she would come with her arms full of flowers for she always kept to her fairy part one morning she came early through the mists he was out shooting she wanted to take him unawares like a fairy her arms were full of peonies when she was moving beyond the trees he shot her not knowing she stumbled on and sank down in their tryst place he found her lying there among the red pyeenocks white and fallen he thought she was just lying talking to the red flowers so he stood waiting then he went up and bent over her and found the flowers full of blood it was he set the garden here with these pyeenocks  the eyes of the girls were round with the pity of the tale and hilda turned away to hide her tears  it is a beautiful ending said lettie in a low tone looking at the floor  its all a tale said leslie soothing the girls  george waited till lettie looked at him she lifted her eyes to him at last then each turned aside trembling  marie asked for some of the peonies  give me just a few—and i can tell the others the story—it is so sad—i feel so sorry for him it was so cruel for him—— and lettie says it ends beautifully——  george cut the flowers with his great clasp knife and marie took them carefully treating their romance with great tenderness then all went out of the garden and he turned to the cowshed  goodbye for the present said lettie afraid to stay near him  goodbye he laughed  thank you so much for the flowers—and the story—it was splendid said marie —but so sad  then they went and we did not see them again  later when all had gone to bed at the mill george and i sat together on opposite sides of the fire smoking saying little he was casting up the total of discrepancies and now and again he ejaculated one of his thoughts  and all day he said blench has been ploughing his wheat in because it was that bitten off by the rabbits it was no manner of use so hes ploughed it in an they say with idylls eating peaches in our close  then there was silence while the clock throbbed heavily and outside a wild bird called and was still softly the ashes rustled lower in the grate  she said it ended well—but whats the good of death—whats the good of that he turned his face to the ashes in the grate and sat brooding  outside among the trees some wild animal set up a thin wailing cry  damn that row said i stirring looking also into the grey fire  its some stoat or weasel or something its been going on like that for nearly a week ive shot in the trees ever so many times there were two—ones gone  continuously through the heavy chilling silence came the miserable crying from the darkness among the trees  you know he said she hated me this afternoon and i hated her——  it was midnight full of sick thoughts  it is no good said i go to bed—it will be morning in a few hours           part iii         chapter i     a new start in life   lettie was wedded as i had said before leslie lost all the wistful traces of his illness they had been gone away to france five days before we recovered anything like the normal tone in the house then though the routine was the same everywhere was a sense of loss and of change the long voyage in the quiet home was over we had crossed the bright sea of our youth and already lettie had landed and was travelling to a strange destination in a foreign land it was time for us all to go to leave the valley of nethermere whose waters and whose woods were distilled in the essence of our veins we were the children of the valley of nethermere a small nation with language and blood of our own and to cast ourselves each one into separate exile was painful to us  i shall have to go now said george it is my nature to linger an unconscionable time yet i dread above all things this slow crumbling away from my foundations by which i free myself at last i must wrench myself away now——  it was the slack time between the hay and the corn harvest and we sat together in the grey still morning of august pulling the stack my hands were sore with tugging the loose wisps from the lower part of the stack so i waited for the touch of rain to send us indoors it came at last and we hurried into the barn we climbed the ladder into the loft that was strewn with farming implements and with carpenters tools we sat together on the shavings that littered the bench before the high gable window and looked out over the brooks and the woods and the ponds the treetops were very near to us and we felt ourselves the centre of the waters and the woods that spread down the rainy valley  in a few years i said we shall be almost strangers  he looked at me with fond dark eyes and smiled incredulously  it is as far said i to the ram as it is for me to london—farther  dont you want me to go there he asked smiling quietly  its all as one where you go you will travel north and i east and lettie south lettie has departed in seven weeks i go—and you  i must be gone before you he said decisively  do you know—— and he smiled timidly in confession i feel alarmed at the idea of being left alone on a loose end i must not be the last to leave—— he added almost appealingly  and you will go to meg i asked  he sat tearing the silken shavings into shreds and telling me in clumsy fragments all he could of his feelings  you see its not so much what you call love i dont know you see i built on lettie—he looked up at me shamefacedly then continued tearing the shavings—you must found your castles on something and i founded mine on lettie you see im like plenty of folks i have nothing definite to shape my life to i put brick upon brick as they come and if the whole topples down in the end it does but you see you and lettie have made me conscious and now im at a dead loss i have looked to marriage to set me busy on my house of life something whole and complete of which it will supply the design i must marry or be in a lost lane there are two people i could marry—and letties gone i love meg just as well as far as love goes im not sure i dont feel better pleased at the idea of marrying her you know i should always have been second to lettie and the best part of love is being made much of being first and foremost in the whole world for somebody and megs easy and lovely i can have her without trembling shes full of soothing and comfort i can stroke her hair and pet her and she looks up at me full of trust and lovingness and there is no flaw all restfulness in one another——  three weeks later as i lay in the august sunshine in a deckchair on the lawn i heard the sound of wheels along the gravel path it was george calling for me to accompany him to his marriage he pulled up the dogcart near the door and came up the steps to me on the lawn he was dressed as if for the cattle market in jacket and breeches and gaiters  well are you ready he said standing smiling down on me his eyes were dark with excitement and had that vulnerable look which was so peculiar to the saxtons in their emotional moments  you are in good time said i it is but half past nine  it wouldnt do to be late on a day like this he said gaily see how the sun shines come you dont look as brisk as a best man should i thought you would have been on tenterhooks of excitement get up get up look here a bird has given me luck—he showed me a white smear on his shoulder  i drew myself up lazily  all right i said but we must drink a whisky to establish it  he followed me out of the fragrant sunshine into the dark house the rooms were very still and empty but the cool silence responded at once to the gaiety of our sunwarm entrance the sweetness of the summer morning hung invisible like glad ghosts of romance through the shadowy room we seemed to feel the sunlight dancing golden in our veins as we filled again the pale liqueur  joy to you—i envy you today  his teeth were white and his eyes stirred like dark liquor as he smiled  here is my wedding present  i stood the four large watercolours along the wall before him they were drawings among the waters and the fields of the mill grey rain and twilight morning with the sun pouring gold into the mist and the suspense of a midsummer noon upon the pond all the glamour of our yesterdays came over him like an intoxicant and he quivered with the wonderful beauty of life that was weaving him into the large magic of the years he realised the splendour of the pageant of days which had him in train  its been wonderful cyril all the time he said with surprised joy  we drove away through the freshness of the wood and among the flowing of the sunshine along the road the cottages of greymede filled the shadows with colour of roses and the sunlight with odour of pinks and the blue of corn flowers and larkspur we drove briskly up the long sleeping hill and bowled down the hollow past the farms where the hens were walking with the red gold cocks in the orchard and the ducks like white cloudlets under the aspen trees revelled on the pond  i told her to be ready any time said george—but she doesnt know its today i didnt want the publichouse full of the business  the mare walked up the sharp little rise on top of which stood the ram inn in the quiet as the horse slowed to a standstill we heard the crooning of a song in the garden we sat still in the cart and looked across the flagged yard to where the tall madonna lilies rose in clusters out of the alyssome beyond the border of flowers was meg bending over the gooseberry bushes she saw us and came swinging down the path with a bowl of gooseberries poised on her hip she was dressed in a plain fresh holland frock with a white apron her black heavy hair reflected the sunlight and her ripe face was luxuriant with laughter  well i never she exclaimed trying not to show that she guessed his errand fancy you here at this time o morning  her eyes delightful black eyes like polished jet untroubled and frank looked at us as a robin might with bright questioning her eyes were so different from the saxtons darker but never still and full never hesitating dreading a wound never dilating with hurt or with timid ecstasy  are you ready then he asked smiling down on her  what she asked in confusion  to come to the registrar with me—ive got the licence  but im just going to make the pudding she cried in full expostulation  let them make it themselves—put your hat on  but look at me ive just been getting the gooseberries look she showed us the berries and the scratches on her arms and hands  what a shame he said bending down to stroke her hand and her arm she drew back smiling flushing with joy i could smell the white lilies where i sat  but you dont mean it do you she said lifting to him her face that was round and glossy like a blackheart cherry for answer he unfolded the marriage licence she read it and turned aside her face in confusion saying  well ive got to get ready shall you come an tell granma  is there any need he answered reluctantly  yes you come an tell er persuaded meg  he got down from the trap i preferred to stay out of doors presently meg ran out with a glass of beer for me  we shant be many minutes she apologised ive ony to slip another frock on  i heard george go heavily up the stairs and enter the room over the barparlour where the grandmother lay bedridden  what is it thaïgh ma lad what are thaïgh doin ere this mornin she asked  well ant how does ta feel by now he said  eh sadly lad sadly itll not be long afore they carry me

withering sarcasm tha wor niver in a orry a thy life shes non commin wi thee this day though  he laughed also sarcastic the old lady was angry she poured on him her abuse declaring she would not have

not cried the old woman  are you coming meg repeated george in a passion  meg began to cry i suppose she looked at him through her tears the next thing i heard was a cry from the old woman and the sound of staggering feet  would ta drag er from me—if tha goos ma wench tha enters this ouse no more tha eers that tha does thysen my lady dunna venture anigh me after this my gel—the old woman called louder and louder george appeared in the doorway holding meg by the arm she was crying in a little distress her hat with its large silk roses was slanting over her eyes she was dressed in white linen they mounted the trap i gave him the reins and scrambled up behind the old woman heard us through the open window and we listened to her calling as we drove away  dunna let me clap eyes on thee again tha ungrateful ussy tha ungrateful ussy thall rue it my wench thall rue it an then dunna come ter me——  we drove out of hearing george sat with a shut mouth scowling meg wept awhile to herself woefully we were swinging at a good pace under the beeches of the churchyard which stood above the level of the road meg having settled her hat bent her head to the wind too much occupied with her attire to weep we swung round the hollow by the bog end and rattled a short distance up the steep hill to watnall then the mare walked slowly meg at leisure to collect herself exclaimed plaintively  oh ive only got one glove  she looked at the odd silk glove that lay in her lap then peered about among her skirts  i must a left it in th bedroom she said piteously  he laughed and his anger suddenly vanished  what does it matter youll do without all right  at the sound of his voice she recollected and her tears and her weeping returned  nay he said dont fret about the old woman shell come round tomorrow—an if she doesnt its her lookout shes got polly to attend to her  but shell be that miserable—— wept meg  its her own fault at any rate dont let it make you miserable—he glanced to see if anyone were in sight then he put his arm round her waist and kissed her saying softly coaxingly shell be all right tomorrow well go an see her then an shell be glad enough to have us well give in to her then poor old granma she can boss you about an me as well tomorrow as much as she likes she feels it hard being tied to her bed but today is ours surely—isnt it today is ours an youre not sorry are you  but ive got no gloves an im sure my hairs a sight i never thought she could a reached up like that  george laughed tickled  no he said she was in a temper but we can get you some gloves directly we get to nottingham  i havent a farthing of money she said  ive plenty he laughed oh an lets try this on  they were merry together as he tried on her wedding ring and they talked softly he gentle and coaxing she rather plaintive the mare took her own way and megs hat was disarranged once more by the sweeping elmboughs the yellow corn was dipping and flowing in the fields like a cloth of gold pegged down at the corners under which the wind was heaving sometimes we passed cottages where the scarlet lilies rose like bonfires and the tall larkspur like bright blue leaping smoke sometimes we smelled the sunshine on the browning corn sometimes the fragrance of the shadow of leaves occasionally it was the dizzy scent of new haystacks then we rocked and jolted over the rough cobblestones of cinderhill and bounded forward again at the foot of the enormous pit hill smelling of sulphur inflamed with slow red fires in the daylight and crusted with ashes we reached the top of the rise and saw the city before us heaped high and dim upon the broad range of the hill i looked for the square tower of my old school and the sharp proud spire of st andrews over the city hung a dullness a thin dirty canopy against the blue sky  we turned and swung down the slope between the last sullied cornfields towards basford where the swollen gasometers stood like toadstools as we neared the mouth of the street meg rose excitedly pulling georges arm crying  oh look the poor little thing  on the causeway stood two small boys lifting their faces and weeping to the heedless heavens while before them upside down lay a baby strapped to a shutup babychair the gimcrack carpetseated thing had collapsed as the boys were dismounting the curbstone with it it had fallen backwards and they were unable to right it there lay the infant strapped head downwards to its silly cart in imminent danger of suffocation meg leaped out and dragged the child from the wretched chair the two boys drenched with tears howled on meg crouched on the road the baby on her knee its tiny feet dangling against her skirt she soothed the pitiful tearwet mite she hugged it to her and kissed it and hugged it and rocked it in an abandonment of pity when at last the childish trio were silent the boys shaken only by the last ebbing sobs meg calmed also from her frenzy of pity for the little thing she murmured to it tenderly and wiped its wet little cheeks with her handkerchief soothing kissing fondling the bewildered mite smoothing the wet strands of brown hair under the scrap of cotton bonnet twitching the inevitable baby cape into order it was a pretty baby with wisps of browngold silken hair and large blue eyes  is it a girl i asked one of the boys—how old is she  i dont know he answered awkwardly we ve ad er about a three week  why isnt she your sister  no—my mother keeps er—they were very reluctant to tell us anything  poor little lamb cried meg in another access of pity clasping the baby to her bosom with one hand holding its winsome slippered feet in the other she remained thus stung through with acute pity crouching folding herself over the mite at last she raised her head and said in a voice difficult with emotion  but you love her—dont you  yes—shes—shes all right but we ave to mind er replied the boy in great confusion  surely said meg surely you dont begrudge that poor little thing—so little she is—surely you dont grumble at minding her a bit——  the boys would not answer  oh poor little lamb poor little lamb murmured meg over the child condemning with bitterness the boys and the whole world of men  i taught one of the lads how to fold and unfold the wretched chair meg very reluctantly seated the unfortunate baby therein gently fastening her with the strap  wheers er dummy asked one of the boys in muffled selfconscious tones the infant began to cry thinly meg crouched over it the dummy was found in the gutter and wiped on the boys coat then plugged into the babys mouth meg released the tiny clasping hand from over her finger and mounted the dog cart saying sternly to the boys  mind you look after her well poor little baby with no mother gods watching to see what you do to her—so you be careful mind  they stood very shamefaced george clicked to the mare and as we started threw coppers to the boys while we drove away i watched the little group diminish down the road  its such a shame she said and the tears were in her voice —a sweet little thing like that——  ay said george softly theres all sorts of things in towns  meg paid no attention to him but sat womanlike thinking of the forlorn baby and condemning the hard world he full of tenderness and protectiveness towards her having watched her with softening eyes felt a little bit rebuffed that she ignored him and sat alone in her fierce womanhood so he busied himself with the reins and the two sat each alone until meg was roused by the bustle of the town the mare sidled past the electric cars nervously and jumped when a traction engine came upon us meg rather frightened clung to george again she was very glad when we had passed the cemetery with its white population of tombstones and drew up in a quiet street  but when we had dismounted and given the horses head to a loafer she became confused and bashful and timid to the last degree he took her on his arm he took the whole charge of her and laughing bore her away towards the steps of the office she left herself entirely in his hands she was all confusion so he took the charge of her  when after a short time they came out she began to chatter with blushful animation he was very quiet and seemed to be taking his breath  wasnt he a funny little man did i do it all proper—i didnt know what i was doing im sure they were laughing at me—do you think they were oh just look at my frock—what a sight what would they think—— the baby had slightly soiled the front of her dress  george drove up the long hill into the town as we came down between the shops on mansfield road he recovered his spirits  where are we going—where are you taking us asked meg  we may as well make a day of it while we are here he answered smiling and flicking the mare they both felt that they were launched forth on an adventure he put up at the spread eagle and we walked towards the marketplace for megs gloves when he had bought her these and a large lace scarf to give her a more clothed appearance he wanted dinner  well go he said to an hôtel  his eyes dilated as he said it and she shrank away with delighted fear neither of them had ever been to an hôtel she was really afraid she begged him to go to an eating house to a café he was obdurate his one idea was to do the thing that he was halfafraid to do his passion—and it was almost intoxication—was to dare to play with life he was afraid of the town he was afraid to venture into the foreign places of life and all was foreign save the valley of nethermere so he crossed the borders flauntingly and marched towards the heart of the unknown we went to the victoria hôtel—the most imposing he could think of—and we had luncheon according to the menu they were like two children very much afraid yet delighting in the adventure he dared not however give the orders he dared not address anybody waiters or otherwise i did that for him and he watched me absorbing learning wondering that things were so easy and so delightful i murmured them injunctions across the table and they blushed and laughed with each other nervously it would be hard to say whether they enjoyed that luncheon i think meg did not—even though she was with him but of george i am doubtful he suffered exquisitely from self consciousness and nervous embarrassment but he felt also the intoxication of the adventure he felt as a man who has lived in a small island when he first sets foot on a vast continent this was the first step into a new life and he mused delightedly upon it over his brandy yet he was nervous he could not get over the feeling that he was trespassing  where shall we go this afternoon he asked  several things were proposed but meg pleaded warmly for colwick  lets go on a steamer to colwick park therell be entertainments there this afternoon itll be lovely  in a few moments we were on the top of the car swinging down to the trent bridges it was dinner time and crowds of people from shops and warehouses were hurrying in the sunshine along the pavements sunblinds cast their shadows on the shopfronts and in the shade streamed the people dressed brightly for summer as our car stood in the great space of the market place we could smell the mingled scent of fruit oranges and small apricots and pears piled in their vividly coloured sections on the stalls then away we sailed through the shadows of the dark streets and the open pools of sunshine the castle on its high rock stood in the dazzling dry sunlight the fountain stood shadowy in the green glimmer of the lime trees that surrounded the almshouses  there were many people at the trent we stood awhile on the bridge to watch the bright river swirling in a silent dance to the sea while the light pleasureboats lay asleep along the banks we went on board the little paddle steamer and paid our sixpence return after much waiting we set off with great excitement for our milelong voyage two banjos were tumming somewhere below and the passengers hummed and sang to their tunes a few boats dabbled on the water soon the river meadows with their high thorn hedges lay green on our right while the scarp of red rock rose on our left covered with the dark trees of summer  we landed at colwick park it was early and few people were there dead glass fairylamps were slung about the trees the grass in places was worn threadbare we walked through the avenues and small glades of the park till we came to the boundary where the racecourse stretched its level green its winding white barriers running low into the distance they sat in the shade for some time while i wandered about then many people began to arrive it became noisy even rowdy we listened for some time to an openair concert given by the pierrots it was rather vulgar and very tiresome it took me back to cowes to yarmouth there were the same foolish overeyebrowed faces the same perpetual jingle from an outoftune piano the restless jigging to the songs the same choruses the same escapading meg was well pleased the vulgarity passed by her she laughed and sang the choruses half audibly daring but not bold she was immensely pleased oh its bens turn now i like him hes got such a wicked twinkle in his eye look at joey trying to be funny—he cant to save his life doesnt he look soft—— she began to giggle in georges shoulder he saw the funny side of things for the time and laughed with her  during tea which we took on the green verandah of the degraded hall she was constantly breaking forth into some chorus and he would light up as she looked at him and sing with her sotto voce he was not embarrassed at colwick there he had on his best careless superior air he moved about with a certain scornfulness and ordered lobster for tea offhandedly this also was a new walk of life here he was not hesitating or tremulously strung he was patronising both meg and he thoroughly enjoyed themselves  when we got back into nottingham she entreated him not to go to the hotel as he had proposed and he readily yielded instead they went to the castle we stood on the high rock in the cool of the day and watched the sun sloping over the great riverflats where the menial town spread out and ended while the river and the meadows continued into the distance in the picture galleries there was a fine collection of arthur melvilles paintings meg thought them very ridiculous i began to expound them but she was manifestly bored and he was halfhearted outside in the grounds was a military band playing meg longed to be there the townspeople were dancing on the grass she longed to join them but she could not dance so they sat awhile looking on  we were to go to the theatre in the evening the carl rosa company was giving carmen at the royal we went into the dress circle like giddy dukes as i said to him so that i could see his eyes dilate with adventure again as he laughed in the theatre among the people in evening dress he became once more childish and timorous he had always the air of one who does something forbidden and is charmed yet fearful like a trespassing child he had begun to trespass that day outside his own estates of nethermere  carmen fascinated them both the gaudy careless southern life amazed them the bold free way in which carmen played with life startled them with hints of freedom they stared on the stage fascinated between the acts they held each others hands and looked full into each others wide bright eyes and laughing with excitement talked about the opera the theatre surged and roared dimly like a hoarse shell then the music rose like a storm and swept and rattled at their feet on the stage the strange storm of life clashed in music towards tragedy and futile death the two were shaken with a tumult of wild feeling when it was all over they rose bewildered stunned she with tears in her eyes he with a strange wild beating of his heart  they were both in a tumult of confused emotion their ears were full of the roaring passion of life and their eyes were blinded by a spray of tears and that strange quivering laughter which burns with real pain they hurried along the pavement to the spread eagle meg clinging to him running clasping her lace scarf over her white frock like a scared white butterfly shaken through the night we hardly spoke as the horse was being harnessed and the lamps lighted in the little smoke room he drank several whiskies she sipping out of his glass standing all the time ready to go he pushed into his pocket great pieces of bread and cheese to eat on the way home he seemed now to be thinking with much acuteness his few orders were given sharp and terse he hired an extra light rug in which to wrap meg and then we were ready  who drives said i  he looked at me and smiled faintly  you he answered  meg like an impatient white flame stood waiting in the light of the lamps he covered her extinguished her in the dark rug           chapter ii     puffs of wind in the sail   the year burst into glory to usher us forth out of the valley of nethermere the cherry trees had been gorgeous with heavy outreaching boughs of red and gold immense vegetable marrows lay prostrate in the bottom garden their great tentacles clutching the pond bank against the wall the globed crimson plums hung close together and dropped occasionally with a satisfied plunge into the rhubarb leaves the crop of oats was very heavy the stalks of corn were like strong reeds of bamboo the heads of grain swept heavily over like tresses weighted with drops of gold  george spent his time between the mill and the ram the grandmother had received them with much grumbling but with real gladness meg was reinstalled and george slept at the ram he was extraordinarily bright almost gay the fact was that his new life interested and pleased him keenly he often talked to me about meg how quaint and naïve she was how she amused him and delighted him he rejoiced in having a place of his own a home and a beautiful wife who adored him then the publichouse was full of strangeness and interest no hour was ever dull if he wanted company he could go into the smokeroom if he wanted quiet he could sit with meg and she was such a treat so soft and warm and so amusing he was always laughing at her quaint crude notions and at her queer little turns of speech she talked to him with a little language she sat on his knee and twisted his mustache finding small unreal fault with his features for the delight of dwelling upon them he was he said incredibly happy really he could not believe it meg was ah she was a treat then he would laugh thinking how indifferent he had been about taking her a little shadow might cross his eyes but he would laugh again and tell me one of his wifes funny little notions she was quite uneducated and such fun he said i looked at him as he sounded this note i remembered his crude superiority of early days which had angered emily so deeply there was in him something of the prig i did not like his amused indulgence of his wife  at threshing day when i worked for the last time at the mill i noticed the new tendency in him the saxtons had always kept up a certain proud reserve in former years the family had moved into the parlour on threshing day and an extra woman had been hired to wait on the men who came with the machine this time george suggested let us have dinner with the men in the kitchen cyril they are a rum gang its rather good sport mixing with them theyve seen a bit of life and i like to hear them theyre so blunt theyre good studies though  the farmer sat at the head of the table the seven men trooped in very sheepish and took their places they had not much to say at first they were a mixed set some rather small young and furtive looking some unshapely and coarse with unpleasant eyes the eyelids slack there was one man whom we called the parrot because he had a hooked nose and put forward his head as he talked he had been a very large man but he was grey and bending at the shoulders his face was pale and fleshy and his eyes seemed dull sighted  george patronised the men and they did not object he chaffed them making a good deal of demonstration in giving them more beer he invited them to pass up their plates called the woman to bring more bread and altogether played mine host of a feast of beggars the parrot ate very slowly  come dad said george youre not getting on not got many grinders——  what ive gots in th road isll ae ter get em out i can manage wi bare gums like a baby again  second childhood eh ah well we must all come to it george laughed  the old man lifted his head and looked at him and said slowly  youn got ter ower th first afore that  george laughed unperturbed evidently he was well used to the thrusts of the publichouse  i suppose you soon got over yours he said  the old man raised himself and his eyes flickered into life he chewed slowly then said  id married an paid for it id broke a constables jaw an paid for it id deserted from the army an paid for that id had a bullet through my cheek in india atop of it all by i was your age  oh said george with condescending interest youve seen a bit of life then  they drew the old man out and he told them in his slow laconic fashion a few brutal stories they laughed and chaffed him george seemed to have a thirst for tales of brutal experience the raw gin of life he drank it all in with relish enjoying the sensation the dinner was over it was time to go out again to work  and how old are you dad george asked the parrot looked at him again with his heavy tired ironic eyes and answered  if youll be any better for knowing—sixtyfour  its a bit rough on you isnt it continued the young man going round with the threshing machine and sleeping outdoors at that time of life i should a thought youd a wanted a bit o comfort——  how do you mean rough on me the parrot replied slowly  oh i think you know what i mean answered george easily  dont know as i do said the slow old parrot well you havent made exactly a good thing out of life have you  what dyou mean by a good thing ive had my life an im satisfied wi it isll die with a full belly  oh so you have saved a bit  no said the old man deliberately ive spent as ive gone on an ive had all i wish for but i pity the angels when the lord sets me before them like a book to read heaven wont be heaven just then  youre a philosopher in your way laughed george  and you replied the old man toddling about your backyard think yourself mighty wise but your wisdom ll go with your teeth youll learn in time to say nothing  the old man went out and began his work carrying the sacks of corn from the machine to the chamber  theres a lot in the old parrot said george as hell never tell  i laughed  he makes you feel as well as if youd a lot to discover in life he continued looking thoughtfully over the dusty strawstack at the chuffing machine      ——   after the harvest was ended the father began to deplete his farm most of the stock was transferred to the ram george was going to take over his fathers milk business and was going to farm enough of the land attaching to the inn to support nine or ten cows until the spring however mr saxton retained his own milk round and worked at improving the condition of the land ready for the valuation george with three cows started a little milk supply in the neighbourhood of the inn prepared his land for the summer and helped in the publichouse  emily was the first to depart finally from the mill she went to a school in nottingham and shortly afterwards mollie her younger sister went to her in october i moved to london lettie and leslie were settled in their home in brentwood yorkshire we all felt very keenly our exile from nethermere but as yet the bonds were not broken only use could sever them christmas brought us all home again hastening to greet each other there was a slight change in everybody lettie was brighter more imperious and very gay emily was quiet selfrestrained and looked happier leslie was jollier and at the same time more subdued and earnest george looked very healthy and happy and sounded well pleased with himself my mother with her gaiety at our return brought tears to our eyes  we dined one evening at highclose with the tempests it was dull as usual and we left before ten oclock lettie had changed her shoes and put on a fine cloak of greenish blue we walked over the frostbound road the ice on nethermere gleamed mysteriously in the moonlight and uttered strange halfaudible whoops and yelps the moon was very high in the sky small and brilliant like a vial full of the pure white liquid of light there was no sound in the night save the haunting movement of the ice and the clear tinkle of letties laughter  on the drive leading to the wood we saw someone approaching the wild grass was grey on either side the thorn trees stood with shaggy black beards sweeping down the pine trees were erect like dark soldiers the black shape of the man drew near with a shadow running at its feet i recognised george obscured as he was in his cap and his upturned collar lettie was in front with her husband as george was passing she said in bright clear tones  a happy new year to you  he stopped swung round and laughed  i thought you wouldnt have known me he said  what is it you george cried lettie in great surprise—now what a joke how are you—she put out her white hand from her draperies he took it and answered i am very well—and you— however meaningless the words were the tone was curiously friendly intimate informal  as you see she replied laughing interested in his attitude—but where are you going  i am going home he answered in a voice that meant have you forgotten that i too am married  oh of course cried lettie you are now mine host of the ram you must tell me about it may i ask him to come home with us for an hour mother—it is new years eve you know  you have asked him already laughed mother  will mrs saxton spare you for so long asked lettie of george  meg oh she does not order my comings and goings  does she not laughed lettie she is very unwise train up a husband in the way he should go and in after life—— i never could quote a text from end to end i am full of beginnings but as for a finish—— leslie my shoelace is untied—shall i wait till i can put my foot on the fence  leslie knelt down at her feet she shook the hood back from her head and her ornaments sparkled in the moonlight her face with its whiteness and its shadows was full of fascination and in their dark recesses her eyes thrilled george with hidden magic she smiled at him along her cheeks while her husband crouched before her then as the three walked along towards the wood she flung her draperies into loose eloquence and there was a glimpse of her bosom white with the moon she laughed and chattered and shook her silken stuffs sending out a perfume exquisite on the frosted air when we reached the house lettie dropped her draperies and rustled into the drawingroom there the lamp was lowlit shedding a yellow twilight from the window space lettie stood between the firelight and the dusky lamp glow tall and warm between the lights as she turned laughing to the two men she let her cloak slide over her white shoulder and fall with silk splendour of a peacocks gorgeous blue over the arm of the large settee there she stood with her white hand upon the peacock of her cloak where it tumbled against her dull orange dress she knew her own splendour and she drew up her throat laughing and brilliant with triumph then she raised both her arms to her head and remained for a moment delicately touching her hair into order still fronting the two men then with a final little laugh she moved slowly and turned up the lamp dispelling some of the witchcraft from the room she had developed strangely in six months she seemed to have discovered the wonderful charm of her womanhood as she leaned forward with her arm outstretched to the lamp as she delicately adjusted the wicks with mysterious fingers she seemed to be moving in some alluring figure of a dance her hair like a nimbus clouding the light her bosom lit with wonder the soft outstretching of her hand was like the whispering of strange words into the blood and as she fingered a book the heart watched silently for the meaning  wont you take off my shoes darling she said sinking among the cushions of the settee leslie kneeled again before her and she bent her head and watched him  my feet are a tiny bit cold she said plaintively giving him her foot that seemed like gold in the yellow silk stocking he took it between his hands stroking it  it is quite cold he said and he held both her feet in his hands  ah you dear boy she cried with sudden gentleness bending forward and touching his cheek  is it great fun being mine host of ye ramme inne she said playfully to george there seemed a long distance between them now as she sat with the man in evening dress crouching before her putting golden shoes on her feet  it is rather he replied the men in the smoke room say such rum things my word you hear some tales there  tell us do she pleaded  oh i couldnt i never could tell a tale and even if i could—well——  but i do long to hear she said what the men say in the smoke room of ye ramme inne is it quite untellable  quite he laughed  what a pity see what a cruel thing it is to be a woman leslie we never know what men say in smoke rooms while you read in your novels everything a woman ever uttered it is a shame george you are a wretch you should tell me i do envy you——  what do you envy me exactly he asked laughing always at her whimsical way  your smoke room the way you see life—or the way you hear it rather  but i should have thought you saw life ten times more than me he replied  i i only see manners—good manners and bad manners you know manners maketh a man thats when a womans there but you wait awhile youll see  when shall i see asked george flattered and interested  when you have made the fortune you talked about she replied  he was uplifted by her remembering the things he had said  but when i have made it—when—he said sceptically—even then—well i shall only be or have been landlord of ye ramme inne he looked at her waiting for her to lift up his hopes with her gay balloons  oh that doesnt matter leslie might be landlord of some ram inn when hes at home for all anybody would know—mightnt you hubby dear  thanks replied leslie with good humoured sarcasm  you cant tell a publican from a peer if hes a rich publican she continued money maketh the man you know  plus manners added george laughing  oh they are always there—where i am i give you ten years at the end of that time you must invite us to your swell place—say the hall at eberwich—and we will come— with all our numerous array  she sat among her cushions smiling upon him she was half ironical half sincere he smiled back at her his dark eyes full of trembling hope and pleasure and pride  how is meg she asked is she as charming as ever—or have you spoiled her  oh she is as charming as ever he replied and we are tremendously fond of one another  that is right—i do think men are delightful she added smiling  i am glad you think so he laughed  they talked on brightly about a thousand things she touched on paris and pictures and new music with her quick chatter sounding to george wonderful in her culture and facility and at last he said he must go  not until you have eaten a biscuit and drunk good luck with me she cried catching her dress about her like a dim flame and running out of the room we all drank to the new year in the cold champagne  to the vita nuova said lettie and we drank smiling  hark said george the hooters  we stood still and listened there was a faint booing noise far away outside it was midnight lettie caught up a wrap and we went to the door the wood the ice the grey dim hills lay frozen in the light of the moon but outside the valley far away in derbyshire away towards nottingham on every hand the distant hooters and buzzers of mines and ironworks crowed small on the borders of the night like so many strange low voices of cockerels bursting forth at different pitch with different tone warning us of the dawn of the new year           chapter iii     the first pages of several romances   i found a good deal of difference in leslie since his marriage he had lost his assertive selfconfidence he no longer pronounced emphatically and ultimately on every subject nor did he seek to dominate as he had always done the company in which he found himself i was surprised to see him so courteous and attentive to george he moved unobtrusively about the room while lettie was chattering and in his demeanour there was a new reserve a gentleness and grace it was charming to see him offering the cigarettes to george or with beautiful tact asking with his eyes only whether he should refill the glass of his guest and afterward replacing it softly close to the others hand  to lettie he was unfailingly attentive courteous and undemonstrative  towards the end of my holiday he had to go to london on business and we agreed to take the journey together we must leave woodside soon after eight oclock in the morning lettie and he had separate rooms i thought she would not have risen to take breakfast with us but at a quarterpast seven just as rebecca was bringing in the coffee she came downstairs she wore a blue morning gown and her hair was as beautifully dressed as usual  why my darling you shouldnt have troubled to come down so early said leslie as he kissed her  of course i should come down she replied lifting back the heavy curtains and looking out on the snow where the darkness was wilting into daylight i should not let you go away into the cold without having seen you take a good breakfast i think it is thawing the snow on the rhododendrons looks sodden and drooping ah well we can keep out the dismal of the morning for another hour she glanced at the clock—just an hour she added he turned to her with a swift tenderness she smiled to him and sat down at the coffeemaker we took our places at table  i think i shall come back tonight he said quietly almost appealingly  she watched the flow of the coffee before she answered then the brass urn swung back and she lifted her face to hand him the cup  you will not do anything so foolish leslie she said calmly  he took his cup thanking her and bent his face over the fragrant steam  i can easily catch the 715 from st pancras he replied without looking up  have i sweetened to your liking cyril she asked and then as she stirred her coffee she added it is ridiculous leslie you catch the 715 and very probably miss the connection at nottingham you cant have the motorcar there because of the roads besides it is absurd to come toiling home in the cold slushy night when you may just as well stay in london and be comfortable  at any rate i should get the 1030 down to lawton hill he urged  but there is no need she replied there is not the faintest need for you to come home tonight it is really absurd of you think of all the discomfort indeed i should not want to come trailing dismally home at midnight i should not indeed you would be simply wretched stay and have a jolly evening with cyril  he kept his head bent over his plate and did not reply his persistence irritated her slightly  that is what you can do she said go to the pantomime or wait—go to maeterlincks blue bird i am sure that is on somewhere i wonder if rebecca has destroyed yesterdays paper do you mind touching the bell cyril rebecca came and the paper was discovered lettie carefully read the notices and planned for us with zest a delightful programme for the evening leslie listened to it all in silence  when the time had come for our departure lettie came with us into the hall to see that we were well wrapped up leslie had spoken very few words she was conscious that he was deeply offended but her manner was quite calm and she petted us both brightly  goodbye dear she said to him when he came mutely to kiss her you know it would have been miserable for you to sit all those hours in the train at night you will have ever such a jolly time i know you will i shall look for you tomorrow goodbye then goodbye  he went down the steps and into the car without looking at her she waited in the doorway as we moved round in the blackgrey morning she seemed to harbour the glittering blue sky and the sunshine of march in her dress and her luxuriant hair he did not look at her till we were curving to the great snowcumbered rhododendrons when at the last moment he stood up in a sudden panic to wave to her almost as he saw her the bushes came between them and he dropped dejectedly into his seat  goodbye we heard her call cheerfully and tenderly like a blackbird  goodbye i answered and goodbye darling goodbye he cried suddenly starting up in a passion of forgiveness and tenderness  the car went cautiously down the soddened white path under the trees  i suffered acutely the sickness of exile in norwood for weeks i wandered the streets of the suburb haunted by the spirit of some part of nethermere as i went along the quiet roads where the lamps in yellow loneliness stood among the leafless trees of the night i would feel the feeling of the dark wet bit of path between the wood meadow and the brooks the spirit of that wild little slope to the mill would come upon me and there in the suburb of london i would walk wrapt in the sense of a small wet place in the valley of nethermere a strange voice within me rose and called for the hill path again i could feel the wood waiting for me calling and calling and i crying for the wood yet the space of many miles was between us since i left the valley of home i have not much feared any other loss the hills of nethermere had been my walls and the sky of nethermere my roof overhead it seemed almost as if at home i might lift my hand to the ceiling of the valley and touch my own beloved sky whose familiar clouds came again and again to visit me whose stars were constant to me born when i was born whose sun had been all my father to me but now the skies were strange over my head and orion walked past me unnoticing he who night after night had stood over the woods to spend with me a wonderful hour when does day now lift up the confines of my dwelling place when does the night throw open her vastness for me and send me the stars for company there is no night in a city how can i lose myself in the magnificent forest of darkness when night is only a thin scattering of the trees of shadow with barrenness of lights between  i could never lift my eyes save to the crystal palace crouching cowering wretchedly among the yellowgrey clouds pricking up its two round towers like pillars of anxious misery no landmark could have been more foreign to me more depressing than the great dilapidated palace which lay forever prostrate above us fretting because of its own degradation and ruin  i watched the buds coming on the brown almond trees i heard the blackbirds and i saw the restless starlings in the streets were many heaps of violets and men held forward to me snowdrops whose white mute lips were pushed upwards in a bunch but these things had no meaning for me and little interest  most eagerly i waited for my letters emily wrote to me very constantly  dont you find it quite exhilarating almost intoxicating to be so free i think it is quite wonderful at home you cannot live your own life you have to struggle to keep even a little apart for yourself it is so hard to stand aloof from our mothers and yet they are only hurt and insulted if you tell them what is in your heart it is such a relief not to have to be anything to anybody but just to please yourself i am sure mother and i have suffered a great deal from trying to keep up our old relations yet she would not let me go when i come home in the evening and think that i neednt say anything to anybody nor do anything for anybody but just have the evening for myself i am overjoyed  i have begun to write a story——  again a little later she wrote  as i go to school by old brayford village in the morning the birds are thrilling wonderfully and everything seems stirring very likely there will be a setback and after that spring will come in truth  when shall you come and see me i cannot think of a spring without you the railways are the only fine exciting things here—one is only a few yards away from school all day long i am watching the great midland trains go south they are very lucky to be able to rush southward through the sunshine  the crows are very interesting they flap past all the time were out in the yard the railways and the crows make the charm of my life in brayford the other day i saw no end of pairs of crows do you remember what they say at home—one for sorrow very often one solitary creature sits on the telegraph wires i almost hate him when i look at him i think my badge for life ought to be—one crow——  again a little later  i have been home for the weekend isnt it nice to be made much of to be an important cherished person for a little time it is quite a new experience for me  the snowdrops are full out among the grass in the front garden—and such a lot i imagined you must come in the sunshine of the sunday afternoon to see them it did not seem possible you should not the winter aconites are out along the hedge i knelt and kissed them i have been so glad to go away to breathe the free air of life but i felt as if i could not come away from the aconites i have sent you some—are they much withered  now i am in my lodgings i have the quite unusual feeling of being contented to stay here a little while—not long—not above a year i am sure but even to be contented for a little while is enough for me——  in the beginning of march i had a letter from the father  youll not see us again in the old place we shall be gone in a fortnight the things are most of them gone already george has got bob and flower i have sold three of the cows stafford and julia and hannah the place looks very empty i dont like going past the cowsheds and we miss hearing the horses stamp at night but i shall not be sorry when we have really gone i begin to feel as if wed stagnated here i begin to feel as if i was settling and getting narrow and dull it will be a new lease of life to get away  but im wondering how we shall be over there mrs saxton feels very nervous about going but at the worst we can but come back i feel as if i must go somewhere its stagnation and starvation for us here i wish george would come with me i never thought he would have taken to publichouse keeping but he seems to like it all right he was down with meg on sunday mrs saxton says hes getting a publichouse tone he is certainly much livelier more full of talk than he was meg and he seem very comfortable im glad to say hes got a good milkround and ive no doubt but what hell do well he is very cautious at the bottom hell never lose much if he never makes much  sam and david are very great friends im glad ive got the boy we often talk of you it would be very lonely if it wasnt for the excitement of selling things and so on mrs saxton hopes you will stick by george she worries a bit about him thinking he may go wrong i dont think he will ever go far but i should be glad to know you were keeping friends mrs saxton says she will write to you about it——  george was a very poor correspondent i soon ceased to expect a letter from him i received one directly after the fathers  my dear cyril  forgive me for not having written you before but you see i cannot sit down and write to you any time if i cannot do it just when i am in the mood i cannot do it at all and it so often happens that the mood comes upon me when i am in the fields at work when it is impossible to write last night i sat by myself in the kitchen on purpose to write to you and then i could not all day at greymede when i was drilling in the fallow at the back of the church i had been thinking of you and i could have written there if i had had materials but i had not and at night i could not  i am sorry to say that in my last letter i did not thank you for the books i have not read them both but i have nearly finished evelyn innes i get a bit tired of it towards the end i do not do much reading now there seems to be hardly any chance for me either somebody is crying for me in the smoke room or there is some business or else meg wont let me she doesnt like me to read at night she says i ought to talk to her so i have to  it is halfpast seven and i am sitting ready dressed to go and talk to harry jackson about a young horse he wants to sell to me he is in pretty low water and it will make a pretty good horse but i dont care much whether i have it or not the mood seized me to write to you somehow at the bottom i feel miserable and heavy yet there is no need i am making pretty good money and ive got all i want but when ive been ploughing and getting the oats in those fields on the hillside at the back of greymede church ive felt as if i didnt care whether i got on or not its very funny last week i made over five pounds clear one way and another and yet now im as restless and discontented as i can be and i seem eager for something but i dont know what it is sometimes i wonder where i am going yesterday i watched broken white masses of cloud sailing across the sky in a fresh strong wind they all seemed to be going somewhere i wondered where the wind was blowing them i dont seem to have hold on anything do i can you tell me what i want at the bottom of my heart i wish you were here then i think i should not feel like this but generally i dont generally i am quite jolly and busy  by jove heres harry jackson come for me i will finish this letter when i get back  ——i have got back we have turned out but i cannot finish i cannot tell you all about it ive had a little row with meg oh ive had a rotten time but i cannot tell you about it tonight it is late and i am tired and have a headache some other time perhaps——     george saxton  the spring came bravely even in south london and the town was filled with magic i never knew the sumptuous purple of evening till i saw the round arclamps fill with light and roll like golden bubbles along the purple dusk of the high road everywhere at night the city is filled with the magic of lamps over the river they pour in golden patches their floating luminous oil on the restless darkness the bright lamps float in and out of the cavern of london bridge station like round shining bees in and out of a black hive in the suburbs the street lamps glimmer with the brightness of lemons among the trees i began to love the town  in the mornings i loved to move in the aimless streets procession watching the faces come near to me with the sudden glance of dark eyes watching the mouths of the women blossom with talk as they passed watching the subtle movements of the shoulders of men beneath their coats and the naked warmth of their necks that went glowing along the street i loved the city intensely for its movement of men and women the soft fascinating flow of the limbs of men and women and the sudden flash of eyes and lips as they pass among all the faces of the street my attention roved like a bee which clambers drunkenly among blue flowers i became intoxicated with the strange nectar which i sipped out of the eyes of the passersby  i did not know how time was hastening by on still bright wings till i saw the scarlet hawthorn flaunting over the road and the limebuds lit up like wine drops in the sun and the pink scarves of the limebuds pretty as lousewort ablossom in the gutters and a silverpink tangle of almond boughs against the blue sky the lilacs came out and in the pensive stillness of the suburb at night came the delicious tarry scent of lilac flowers wakening a silent laughter of romance  across all this strangely came the bleak sounds of home alice wrote to me at the end of may  cyril dear prepare yourself meg has got twins—yesterday i went up to see how she was this afternoon not knowing anything and there i found a pair of bubs in the nest and old ma stainwright bossing the show i nearly fainted sybil dear i hardly knew whether to laugh or to cry when i saw those two rummy little round heads like two larch cones cheek by cheek on a twig one is a darkie with lots of black hair and the other is red would you believe it just lit up with thin red hair like a flicker of firelight i gasped i believe i did shed a few tears though what for i dont know  the old grandma is a perfect old wretch over it she lies chuckling and passing audible remarks in the next room as pleased as punch really but so mad because ma stainwright wouldnt have them taken in to her you should have heard her when we took them in at last they are both boys she did make a fuss poor old woman i think shes going a bit funny in the head she seemed sometimes to think they were hers and you should have heard her the way she talked to them it made me feel quite funny she wanted them lying against her on the pillow so that she could feel them with her face i shed a few more tears sybil i think i must be going dotty also but she came round when we took them away and began to chuckle to herself and talk about the things shed say to george when he came—awful shocking things sybil made me blush dreadfully  georgie didnt know about it then he was down at bingham buying some horses i believe he seems to have got a craze for buying horses he got in with harry jackson and mayhews sons—you know they were horse dealers—at least their father was you remember he died bankrupt about three years ago there are fred and duncan left and they pretend to keep on the old business they are always up at the ram and georgie is always driving about with them i dont like it—they are a loose lot rather common and poor enough now  well i thought id wait and see georgie he came about halfpast five meg had been fidgeting about him wondering where he was and how he was and so on bless me if id worry and whittle about a man the old grandma heard the cart and before he could get down she shouted—you know her room is in the front—hi george ma lad sharpen thy shins an com an ae a look at em—theers two on em two on em and she laughed something awful  ello granma what art ter shoutin about he said and at the sound of his voice meg turned to me so pitiful and said   hes been wi them mayhews  thas gotten twins a couple at a go ma lad shouted the old woman and you know how she gives squeal before she laughs she made the horse shy and he swore at it something awful then bill took it and georgie came upstairs i saw meg seem to shrink when she heard him kick at the stairs as he came up and she went white when he got to the top he came in he fairly reeked of whisky and horses bah a man is hateful when he reeks of drink he stood by the side of the bed grinning like a fool and saying quite thick   youve bin in a bit of a urry avent you meg an how are ter feelin then  oh im a right said meg  is it twins straight he said wheer is em  meg looked over at the cradle and he went round the bed to it holding to the bedrail he had never kissed her nor anything when he saw the twins asleep with their fists shut tight as wax he gave a laugh as if he was amused and said   two right enough—an one on em red which is the girl meg the black un  theyre both boys said meg quite timidly  he turned round and his eyes went little  blast em then he said he stood there looking like a devil sybil dear i did not know our george could look like that i thought he could only look like a faithful dog or a wounded stag but he looked fiendish he stood watching the poor little twins scowling at them till at last the little red one began to whine a bit ma stainwright came pushing her fat carcass in front of him and bent over the baby saying  why my pretty what are they doin to thee what are they—what are they doin to thee  georgie scowled blacker than ever and went out lurching against the washstand and making the pots rattle till my heart jumped in my throat  well if you dont call that scandylos—— said old ma stainwright and meg began to cry you dont know cyril she sobbed fit to break her heart i felt as if i could have killed him  that old granma began talking to him and he laughed at her i do hate to hear a man laugh when hes half drunk it makes my blood boil all of a sudden that old grandmother backs him up in everything shes a regular nuisance meg has cried to me before over the pair of them the wicked vulgar old thing that she is——  i went home to woodside early in september emily was staying at the ram it was strange that everything was so different nethermere even had changed nethermere was no longer a complete wonderful little world that held us charmed inhabitants it was a small insignificant valley lost in the spaces of the earth the tree that had drooped over the brook with such delightful romantic grace was a ridiculous thing when i came home after a year of absence in the south the old symbols were trite and foolish  emily and i went down one morning to strelley mill the house was occupied by a labourer and his wife strangers from the north he was tall very thin and silent strangely suggesting kinship with the rats of the place she was small and very active like some ragged domestic fowl run wild already emily had visited her so she invited us into the kitchen of the mill and set forward the chairs for us the large room had the barren air of a cell there was a small table stranded towards the fireplace and a few chairs by the walls for the rest desert spaces of flagged floor retreating into shadow on the walls by the windows were five cages of canaries and the small sharp movements of the birds made the room more strange in its desolation when we began to talk the birds began to sing till we were quite bewildered for the little woman spoke glasgow scotch and she had a hare lip she rose and ran toward the cages crying herself like some wild fowl and flapping a duster at the warbling canaries  stop it stop it she cried shaking her thin weird body at them silly little devils fools fools fools and she flapped the duster till the birds were subdued then she brought us delicious scones and apple jelly urging us almost nudging us with her thin elbows to make us eat  dont you like em dont you well eat em eat em then go on emily go on eat some more only dont tell tom—dont tell tom when e comes in—she shook her head and laughed her shrilling weird laughter  as we were going she came out with us and went running on in front we could not help noting how ragged and unkempt was her short black skirt but she hastened around us hither and thither like an excited fowl talking in her highpitched unintelligible manner i could not believe the brooding mill was in her charge i could not think this was the strelley mill of a year ago she fluttered up the steep orchard bank in front of us happening to turn round and see emily and me smiling at each other she began to laugh her strident weird laughter saying with a leer  emily hes your sweetheart your sweetheart emily you never told me and she laughed aloud  we blushed furiously she came away from the edge of the sluice gully nearer to us crying  youve been here o nights havent you emily—havent you and she laughed again then she sat down suddenly and pointing above our heads shrieked  ah look there—we looked and saw the mistletoe look at her look at her how many kisses a night emily—ha ha kisses all the year kisses o nights in a lonely place  she went on wildly for a short time then she dropped her voice and talked in low pathetic tones she pressed on us scones and jelly and oatcakes and we left her  when we were out on the road by the brook emily looked at me with shamefaced laughing eyes i noticed a small movement of her lips and in an instant i found myself kissing her laughing with some of the little womans wildness           chapter iii     domestic life at the ram   george was very anxious to receive me at his home the ram had as yet only a six days licence so on sunday afternoon i walked over to tea it was very warm and still and sunny as i came through greymede a few sweethearts were sauntering under the horsechestnut trees or crossing the road to go into the fields that lay smoothly carpeted after the hayharvest  as i came round the flagged track to the kitchen door of the inn i heard the slur of a baking tin and the bang of the oven door and meg saying crossly  no dont you take him emily—naughty little thing let his father hold him  one of the babies was crying  i entered and found meg all flushed and untidy wearing a large white apron just rising from the oven emily in a cream dress was taking a redhaired crying baby from out of the cradle george sat in the small armchair smoking and looking cross  i cant shake hands said meg rather flurried i am all floury sit down will you—— and she hurried out of the room emily looked up from the complaining baby to me and smiled a womans rare intimate smile which says see i am engaged thus for a moment but i keep my heart for you all the time  george rose and offered me the round armchair it was the highest honour he could do me he asked me what i would drink when i refused everything he sat down heavily on the sofa frowning and angrily cudgelling his wits for something to say—in vain  the room was large and comfortably furnished with rushchairs a glassknobbed dresser a cupboard with glass doors perched on a shelf in the corner and the usual large sofa whose cosy loosebed and pillows were covered with red cotton stuff there was a peculiar reminiscence of victuals and drink in the room beer and a touch of spirits and bacon teenie the sullen blackbrowed servant girl came in carrying the other baby and meg called from the scullery to ask her if the child were asleep meg was evidently in a bustle and a flurry a most uncomfortable state  no replied teenie hes not for sleep this day  mend the fire and see to the oven and then put him his frock on replied meg testily teenie set the blackhaired baby in the second cradle immediately he began to cry or rather to shout his remonstrance george went across to him and picked up a white furry rabbit which he held before the child  here look at bunbun have your nice rabbit hark at it squeaking  the baby listened for a moment then deciding that this was only a putoff began to cry again george threw down the rabbit and took the baby swearing inwardly he dandled the child on his knee  whats up then—whats up wi thee have a ride then—deededeededee  but the baby knew quite well what was the fathers feeling towards him and he continued to cry  hurry up teenie said george as the maid rattled the coal on the fire emily was walking about hushing her charge and smiling at me so that i had a peculiar pleasure in gathering for myself the honey of endearment which she shed on the lips of the baby george handed over his child to the maid and said to me with patient sarcasm  will you come in the garden  i rose and followed him across the sunny flagged yard along the path between the bushes he lit his pipe and sauntered along as a man on his own estate does feeling as if he were untrammeled by laws or conventions  you know he said shes a dam rotten manager  i laughed and remarked how full of plums the trees were  yes he replied heedlessly—you know she ought to have sent the girl out with the kids this afternoon and have got dressed directly but no she must sit gossiping with emily all the time they were asleep and then as soon as they wake up she begins to make cake——  i suppose she felt shed enjoy a pleasant chat all quiet i answered  but she knew quite well you were coming and what it would be but a womans no dam foresight  nay what does it matter said i  sundays the only day we can have a bit of peace so she might keep em quiet then  i suppose it was the only time too that she could have a quiet gossip i replied  but you dont know he said there seems to be never a minute of freedom teenie sleeps in now and lives with us in the kitchen—oswald as well—so i never know what it is to have a moment private there doesnt seem a single spot anywhere where i can sit quiet its the kids all day and the kids all night and the servants and then all the men in the house—i sometimes feel as if i should like to get away i shall leave the pub as soon as i can—only meg doesnt want to  but if you leave the publichouse—what then  i should like to get back on a farm this is no sort of a place really for farming ive always got some business on hand theres a traveller to see or ive got to go to the brewers or ive somebody to look at a horse or something your lifes all messed up if i had a place of my own and farmed it in peace——  youd be as miserable as you could be i said  perhaps so he assented in his old reflective manner perhaps so anyhow i neednt bother for i feel as if i never shall go back—to the land  which means at the bottom of your heart you dont intend to i said laughing  perhaps so he again yielded you see im doing pretty well here—apart from the publichouse i always think thats megs come and look in the stable ive got a shire mare and two nags pretty good i went down to melton mowbray with tom mayhew to a chap theyve had dealings with toms all right and he knows how to buy but he is such a lazy careless devil too lazy to be bothered to sell——  george was evidently interested as we went round to the stables emily came out with the baby which was dressed in a new silk frock she advanced smiling to me with dark eyes  see now he is good doesnt he look pretty  she held the baby for me to look at i glanced at it but i was only conscious of the near warmth of her cheek and of the scent of her hair  who is he like i asked looking up and finding myself full in her eyes the question was quite irrelevant her eyes spoke a whole clear message that made my heart throb yet she answered  who is he why nobody of course but he will be like father dont you think  the question drew my eyes to hers again and again we looked each other the strange intelligence that made her flush and me breathe in as i smiled  ay blue eyes like your fathers—not like yours——  again the wild messages in her looks  no she answered very softly and i think hell be jolly like father—they have neither of them our eyes have they  no i answered overcome by a sudden hot flush of tenderness no—not vulnerable to have such soft vulnerable eyes as you used makes one feel nervous and irascible but you have clothed over the sensitiveness of yours havent you—like naked life naked defenceless protoplasm they were is it not so  she laughed and at the old painful memories she dilated in the old way and i felt the old tremor at seeing her soul flung quivering on my pity  and were mine like that asked george who had come up  he must have perceived the bewilderment of my look as i tried to adjust myself to him a slight shadow a slight chagrin appeared on his face  yes i answered yes—but not so bad you never gave yourself away so much—you were most cautious but just as defenceless  and am i altered he asked with quiet irony as if he knew i was not interested in him  yes more cautious you keep in the shadow but emily has clothed herself and can now walk among the crowd at her own gait  it was with an effort i refrained from putting my lips to kiss her at that moment as she looked at me with womanly dignity and tenderness then i remembered and said  but you are taking me to the stable george come and see the horses too emily  i will i admire them so much she replied and thus we both indulged him  he talked to his horses and of them laying his hand upon them running over their limbs the glossy restless animals interested him more than anything he broke into a little flush of enthusiasm over them they were his new interest they were quiet and yet responsive he was their master and owner this gave him real pleasure  but the baby became displeased again emily looked at me for sympathy with him  he is a little wanderer she said he likes to be always moving perhaps he objects to the ammonia of stables too she added frowning and laughing slightly it is not very agreeable is it  not particularly i agreed and as she moved off i went with her leaving him in the stables when emily and i were alone we sauntered aimlessly back to the garden she persisted in talking to the baby and in talking to me about the baby till i wished the child in jericho this made her laugh and she continued to tantalise me the hollyhock flowers of the second whorl were flushing to the top of the spires the bees covered with pale crumbs of pollen were swaying a moment outside the wide gates of the florets then they swung in with excited hum and clung madly to the fury white capitols and worked riotously round the waxy bases emily held out the baby to watch talking all the time in low fond tones the child stretched towards the bright flowers the sun glistened on his smooth hair as on bronze dust and the wondering blue eyes of the baby followed the bees then he made small sounds and suddenly waved his hands like rumpled pink hollyhock buds  look said emily look at the little bees ah but you mustnt touch them they bite theyre coming she cried with sudden laughing apprehension drawing the child away he made noises of remonstrance she put him near to the flowers again till he knocked the spire with his hand and two indignant bees came sailing out emily drew back quickly crying in alarm then laughing with excited eyes at me as if she had just escaped a peril in my presence thus she teased me by flinging me all kinds of bright gages of love while she kept me aloof because of the child she laughed with pure pleasure at this state of affairs and delighted the more when i frowned till at last i swallowed my resentment and laughed too playing with the hands of the baby and watching his blue eyes change slowly like a softly sailing sky  presently meg called us in to tea she wore a dress of fine blue stuff with cream silk embroidery and she looked handsome for her hair was very hastily dressed  what have you had that child all this time she exclaimed on seeing emily where is his father  i dont know—we left him in the stable didnt we cyril but i like nursing him meg i like it ever so much replied emily  oh yes you may be sure george would get off it if he could hes always in the stable as i tell him he fair stinks of horses hes not that fond of the children i can tell you come on my pet—why come to its mammy  she took the baby and kissed it passionately and made extravagant love to it a clean shaven young man with thick bare arms went across the yard  here just look and tell george as tea is ready said meg  where is he asked oswald the sturdy youth who attended to the farm business  you know where to find him replied meg with that careless freedom which was so subtly derogatory to her husband  george came hurrying from the outbuilding what is it tea already he said  its a wonder you havent been crying out for it this last hour said meg  its a marvel youve got dressed so quick he replied  oh is it she answered—well its not with any of your help that ive done it that is a fact wheres teenie  the maid short stiffly built very dark and sullen looking came forward from the gate  can you take alfy as well just while we have tea she asked teenie replied that she should think she could whereupon she was given the ruddyhaired baby as well as the dark one she sat with them on a seat at the end of the yard we proceeded to tea  it was a very great spread there were hot cakes three or four kinds of cold cakes tinned apricots jellies tinned lobster and trifles in the way of jam cream and rum  i dont know what those cakes are like said meg i made them in such a fluster really you have to do things as best you can when youve got children—especially when theres two i never seem to have time to do my hair up even—look at it now  she put up her hands to her head and i could not help noticing how grimy and rough were her nails  the tea was going on pleasantly when one of the babies began to cry teenie bent over it crooning gruffly i leaned back and looked out of the door to watch her i thought of the girl in tchekoffs story who smothered her charge and i hoped the grim teenie would not be driven to such desperation the other child joined in this chorus teenie rose from her seat and walked about the yard gruffly trying to soothe the twins  its a funny thing but whenever anybody comes theyre sure to be cross said meg beginning to simmer  theyre no different from ordinary said george its only that youre forced to notice it then  no it is not cried meg in a sudden passion is it now emily of course he has to say something werent they as good as gold this morning emily—and yesterday—why they never murmured as good as gold they were but he wants them to be as dumb as fishes hed like them shutting up in a box as soon as they make a bit of noise  i was not saying anything about it he replied  yes you were she retorted i dont know what you call it then——  the babies outside continued to cry  bring alfy to me called meg yielding to the mother feeling  oh no damn it said george let oswald take him  yes replied meg bitterly let anybody take him so long as hes out of your sight you never ought to have children you didnt——  george murmured something about today  come then said meg with a whole passion of tenderness as she took the redhaired baby and held it to her bosom why what is it then what is it my precious hush then pet hush then  the baby did not hush meg rose from her chair and stood rocking the baby in her arms swaying from one foot to the other  hes got a bit of wind she said  we tried to continue the meal but everything was awkward and difficult  i wonder if hes hungry said meg lets try him  she turned away and gave him her breast then he was still so she covered herself as much as she could and sat down again to tea we had finished so we sat and waited while she ate this disjointing of the meal by reflex action made emily and me more accurate we were exquisitely attentive and polite to a nicety our very speech was clipped with precision as we drifted to a discussion of strauss and debussy this of course put a breach between us two and our hosts but we could not help it it was our only way of covering over the awkwardness of the occasion george sat looking glum and listening to us meg was quite indifferent she listened occasionally but her position as mother made her impregnable she sat eating calmly looking down now and again at her baby holding us in slight scorn babblers that we were she was secure in her high maternity she was mistress and sole authority george as father was first servant as an indifferent father she humiliated him and was hostile to his wishes emily and i were mere intruders feeling ourselves such after tea we went upstairs to wash our hands the grandmother had had a second stroke of paralysis and lay inert almost stupified her large bulk upon the bed was horrible to me and her face with the muscles all slack and awry seemed like some cruel cartoon she spoke a few thick words to me george asked her if she felt all right or should he rub her she turned her old eyes slowly to him  my leg—my leg a bit she said in her strange guttural  he took off his coat and pushing his hand under the bedclothes sat rubbing the poor old womans limb patiently slowly for some time she watched him for a moment then without her turning her eyes from him he passed out of her vision and she lay staring at nothing in his direction  there he said at last is that any better then mother  ay thats a bit better she said slowly  should i gie thee a drink he asked lingering wishing to minister all he could to her before he went  she looked at him and he brought the cup she swallowed a few drops with difficulty  doesnt it make you miserable to have her always there i asked him when we were in the next room he sat down on the large white bed and laughed shortly  were used to it—we never notice her poor old granma  but she must have made a difference to you—she must make a big difference at the bottom even if you dont know it i said  shed got such a strong character he said musing —she seemed to understand me she was a real friend to me before she was so bad sometimes i happen to look at her—generally i never see her you know how i mean—but sometimes i do—and then—it seems a bit rotten——  he smiled at me peculiarly —it seems to take the shine off things he added and then smiling again with ugly irony—shes our skeleton in the closet he indicated her large bulk  the church bells began to ring the grey church stood on a rise among the fields not far away like a handsome old stag looking over towards the inn the five bells began to play and the sound came beating upon the window  i hate sunday night he said restlessly  because youve nothing to do i asked  i dont know he said it seems like a gag and you feel helpless i dont want to go to church and hark at the bells they make you feel uncomfortable  what do you generally do i asked  feel miserable—ive been down to mayhews these last two sundays and megs been pretty mad she says its the only night i could stop with her or go out with her but if i stop with her what can i do—and if we go out its only for half an hour i hate sunday night—its a dead end  when we went downstairs the table was cleared and meg was bathing the dark baby thus she was perfect she handled the bonny naked child with beauty of gentleness she kneeled over him nobly her arms and her bosom and her throat had a nobility of roundness and softness she drooped her head with the grace of a madonna and her movements were lovely accurate and exquisite like an old song perfectly sung her voice playing and soothing round the curved limbs of the baby was like water soft as wine in the sun running with delight  we watched humbly sharing the wonder from afar  emily was very envious of megs felicity she begged to be allowed to bathe the second baby meg granted her bounteous permission  yes you can wash him if you like but what about your frock  emily delighted began to undress the baby whose hair was like crocus petals her fingers trembled with pleasure as she loosed the little tapes i always remember the inarticulate delight with which she took the child in her hands when at last his little shirt was removed and felt his soft white limbs and body a distinct glowing atmosphere seemed suddenly to burst out around her and the child leaving me outside the moment before she had been very near to me her eyes searching mine her spirit clinging timidly about me now i was put away quite alone neglected forgotten outside the glow which surrounded the woman and the baby  ha—haaa she said with a deep throated vowel as she put her face against the childs small breasts so round almost like a girls silken and warm and wonderful she kissed him and touched him and hovered over him drinking in his baby sweetnesses the sweetness of the laughing little mouths wide wet kisses of the round waving limbs of the little shoulders so winsomely curving to the arms and the breasts of the tiny soft neck hidden very warm beneath the chin tasting deliciously with her lips and her cheeks all the exquisite softness silkiness warmth and tender life of the babys body  a woman is so ready to disclaim the body of a mans love she yields him her own soft beauty with so much gentle patience and regret she clings to his neck to his head and his cheeks fondling them for the souls meaning that is there and shrinking from his passionate limbs and his body it was with some perplexity some anger and bitterness that i watched emily moved almost to ecstasy by the babys small innocuous person  meg never found any pleasure in me as she does in the kids said george bitterly for himself  the child laughing and crowing caught his hands in emilys hair and pulled dark tresses down while she cried out in remonstrance and tried to loosen the small fists that were shut so fast she took him from the water and rubbed him dry with marvellous gentle little rubs he kicking and expostulating she brought his fine hair into one silken upspringing of ruddy gold like an aureole she played with his tiny balls of toes like wee pink mushrooms till at last she dare detain him no longer when she put on his flannel and his nightgown and gave him to meg  before carrying him to bed meg took him to feed him his mouth was stretched round the nipple as he sucked his face was pressed close and closer to the breast his fingers wandered over the fine white globe blue veined and heavy trying to hold it meg looked down upon him with a consuming passion of tenderness and emily clasped her hands and leaned forward to him even thus they thought him exquisite  when the twins were both asleep i must tiptoe upstairs to see them they lay cheek by cheek in the crib next the large white bed breathing little ruffling breaths out of unison so small and pathetic with their tiny shut fingers i remembered the two larks  from the next room came a heavy sound of the old womans breathing meg went in to her as in passing i caught sight of the large prone figure in the bed i thought of guy de maupassants toine who acted as an incubator           chapter iv     the dominant motif of suffering   the old woman lay still another year then she suddenly sank out of life george ceased to write to me but i learned his news elsewhere he became more and more intimate with the mayhews after old mayhews bankruptcy the two sons had remained on in the large dark house that stood off the nottingham road in eberwich this house had been bequeathed to the oldest daughter by the mother maud mayhew who was married and separated from her husband kept house for her brothers she was a tall large woman with high cheekbones and oily black hair looped over her ears tom mayhew was also a handsome man very dark and ruddy with insolent bright eyes  the mayhews house was called the hollies it was a solid building of old red brick standing fifty yards back from the eberwich highroad between it and the road was an unkempt lawn surrounded by very high black holly trees the house seemed to be imprisoned among the bristling hollies passing through the large gate one came immediately upon the bare side of the house and upon the great range of stables old mayhew had in his day stabled thirty or more horses there now grass was between the red bricks and all the bleaching doors were shut save perhaps two or three which were open for georges horses  the hollies became a kind of club for the disconsolate betteroff men of the district the large diningroom was gloomily and sparsely furnished the drawingroom was a desert but the smaller morningroom was comfortable enough with wicker armchairs heavy curtains and a large sideboard in this room george and the mayhews met with several men two or three times a week there they discussed horses and made mock of the authority of women george provided the whisky and they all gambled timidly at cards these bachelor parties were the source of great annoyance to the wives of the married men who attended them  hes quite unbearable when hes been at those mayhews said meg im sure they do nothing but cry us down  maud mayhew kept apart from these meetings watching over her two children she had been very unhappily married and now was reserved silent the women of eberwich watched her as she went swiftly along the street in the morning with her basket and they gloried a little in her overthrow because she was too proud to accept consolation yet they were sorry in their hearts for her and she was never touched with calumny george saw her frequently but she treated him coldly as she treated the other men so he was afraid of her  he had more facilities now for his horsedealing when the grandmother died in the october two years after the marriage of george she left him seven hundred pounds to meg she left the inn and the two houses she had built in newerton together with brewery shares to the value of nearly a thousand pounds george and meg felt themselves to be people of property the result however was only a little further coldness between them he was very careful that she had all that was hers she said to him once when they were quarrelling that he neednt go feeding the mayhews on the money that came out of her business thenceforward he kept strict accounts of all his affairs and she must audit them receiving her exact dues this was a mortification to her womans capricious soul of generosity and cruelty  the christmas after the grandmothers death another son was born to them for the time george and meg became very good friends again  when in the following march i heard he was coming down to london with tom mayhew on business i wrote and asked him to stay with me meg replied saying she was so glad i had asked him she did not want him going off with that fellow again he had been such a lot better lately and she was sure it was only those men at mayhews made him what he was  he consented to stay with me i wrote and told him lettie and leslie were in london and that we should dine with them one evening i met him at kings cross and we all three drove west mayhew was a remarkably handsome wellbuilt man he and george made a notable couple they were both in breeches and gaiters but george still looked like a yeoman while mayhew had all the braggadocio of the stable we made an impossible trio mayhew laughed and jested broadly for a short time then he grew restless and fidgety he felt restrained and awkward in my presence later he told george i was a damned parson on the other hand i was content to look at his rather vulgar beauty—his teeth were blackened with smoking—and to listen to his ineffectual talk but i could find absolutely no response george was gobetween to me he was cautious and rather deferential to mayhew he was careless and his attitude was tinged with contempt  when the son of the horsedealer at last left us to go to some of his fathers old cronies we were glad very uncertain very sensitive and wavering our old intimacy burned again like the fragile burning of alcohol closed together in the same blue flames we discovered and watched the pageant of life in the town revealed wonderfully to us we laughed at the tyranny of old romance we scorned the faded procession of old years and made mock of the vast pilgrimage of bygone romances travelling farther into the dim distance were we not in the midst of the bewildering pageant of modern life with all its confusion of bannerets and colours with its infinite interweaving of sounds the screech of the modern toys of haste striking like keen spray the heavy boom of busy mankind gathering its bread earnestly forming the bed of all other sounds and between these two the swiftness of songs the triumphant tilt of the joy of life the hoarse oboes of privation the shuddering drums of tragedy and the eternal scraping of the two deeptoned strings of despair  we watched the taxicabs coursing with their noses down to the street we watched the rocking hansoms and the lumbering stateliness of buses in the silent green cavern of the park we stood and listened to the surging of the ocean of life we watched a girl with streaming hair go galloping down the row a dark man laughing and showing his white teeth galloping more heavily at her elbow we saw a squad of lifeguards enter the gates of the park erect and glittering with silver and white and red they came near to us and we thrilled a little as we watched the muscles of their white smooth thighs answering the movement of the horses and their cheeks and their chins bending with proud manliness to the rhythm of the march we watched the exquisite rhythm of the body of men moving in scarlet and silver further down the leafless avenue like a slightly wavering spark of red life blown along at the marble arch corner we listened to a little socialist who was flaring fiercely under a plane tree the hot stream of his words flowed over the old wounds that the knowledge of the unending miseries of the poor had given me and i winced for him the world was all eastend and all the eastend was as a pool from which the waters are drained off leaving the waterthings to wrestle in the wet mud under the sun till the whole of the city seems a heaving shuddering struggle of blackmudded objects deprived of the elements of life i felt a great terror of the little man lest he should make me see all mud as i had seen before then i felt a breathless pity for him that his eyes should be always filled with mud and never brightened george listened intently to the speaker very much moved by him  at night after the theatre we saw the outcasts sleep in a rank under the waterloo bridge their heads to the wall their feet lying out on the pavement a long black ruffled heap at the foot of the wall all the faces were covered but two that of a peaked pale little man and that of a brutal woman over these two faces floating like uneasy pale dreams on their obscurity swept now and again the trailing light of the tram cars we picked our way past the line of abandoned feet shrinking from the sight of the thin bare ankles of a young man from the draggled edge of the skirts of a bunchedup woman from the pitiable sight of the men who had wrapped their legs in newspaper for a little warmth and lay like worthless parcels it was raining some men stood at the edge of the causeway fixed in dreary misery finding no room to sleep outside on a seat in the blackness and the rain a woman sat sleeping while the water trickled and hung heavily at the ends of her loosened strands of hair her hands were pushed in the bosom of her jacket she lurched forward in her sleep started and one of her hands fell out of her bosom she sank again to sleep george gripped my arm  give her something he whispered in panic i was afraid then suddenly getting a florin from my pocket i stiffened my nerves and slid it into her palm her hand was soft and warm and curled in sleep she started violently looking up at me then down at her hand i turned my face aside terrified lest she should look in my eyes and full of shame and grief i ran down the embankment to him we hurried along under the plane trees in silence the shining cars were drawing tall in the distance over westminster bridge a fainter yellow light running with them on the water below the wet streets were spilled with golden liquor of light and on the deep blackness of the river were the restless yellow slashes of the lamps  lettie and leslie were staying up at hampstead with a friend of the tempests one of the largest shareholders in the firm of tempest wharton  co the raphaels had a substantial house and lettie preferred to go to them rather than to an hotel especially as she had brought with her her infant son now ten months old with his nurse they invited george and me to dinner on the friday evening the party included letties host and hostess and also a scottish poetess and an irish musician composer of songs and pianoforte rhapsodies  lettie wore a black lace dress in mourning for one of leslies maternal aunts this made her look older otherwise there seemed to be no change in her a subtle observer might have noticed a little hardness about her mouth and disillusion hanging slightly on her eyes she was however excited by the company in which she found herself therefore she overflowed with clever speeches and rapid brilliant observations certainly on such occasions she was admirable the rest of the company formed as it were the orchestra which accompanied her  george was exceedingly quiet he spoke a few words now and then to mrs raphael but on the whole he was altogether silent listening  really lettie was saying i dont see that one thing is worth doing any more than another its like dessert you are equally indifferent whether you have grapes or pears or pineapple  have you already dined so far sang the scottish poetess in her musical plaintive manner  the only thing worth doing is producing said lettie  alas that is what all the young folk are saying nowadays sighed the irish musician  that is the only thing one finds any pleasure in—that is to say any satisfaction continued lettie smiling and turning to the two artists  do you not think so she added  you do come to a point at last said the scottish poetess when your work is a real source of satisfaction  do you write poetry then asked george of lettie  i oh dear no i have tried strenuously to make up a limerick for a competition but in vain so you see i am a failure there did you know i have a son though—a marvellous little fellow is he not leslie—he is my work i am a wonderful mother am i not leslie  too devoted he replied  there she exclaimed in triumph—when i have to sign my name and occupation in a visitors book it will be ——mother i hope my business will flourish she concluded smiling  there was a touch of ironical brutality in her now she was at the bottom quite sincere having reached that point in a womans career when most perhaps all of the things in life seem worthless and insipid she had determined to put up with it to ignore her own self to empty her own potentialities into the vessel of another or others and to live her life at second hand this peculiar abnegation of self is the resource of a woman for the escaping of the responsibilities of her own development like a nun she puts over her living face a veil as a sign that the woman no longer exists for herself she is the servant of god of some man of her children or may be of some cause as a servant she is no longer responsible for her self which would make her terrified and lonely service is light and easy to be responsible for the good progress of ones life is terrifying it is the most insufferable form of loneliness and the heaviest of responsibilities so lettie indulged her husband but did not yield her independence to him rather it was she who took much of the responsibility of him into her hands and therefore he was so devoted to her she had however now determined to abandon the charge of herself to serve her children when the children grew up either they would unconsciously fling her away back upon herself again in bitterness and loneliness or they would tenderly cherish her chafing at her lovebonds occasionally  george looked and listened to all the flutter of conversation and said nothing it seemed to him like so much unreasonable rustling of pieces of paper of leaves of books and so on later in the evening lettie sang no longer italian folk songs but the fragmentary utterances of debussy and strauss these also to george were quite meaningless and rather wearisome it made him impatient to see her wasting herself upon them  do you like those songs she asked in the frank careless manner she affected  not much he replied ungraciously  dont you she exclaimed adding with a smile those are the most wonderful things in the world those little things—she began to hum a debussy idiom he could not answer her on the point so he sat with the arrow sticking in him and did not speak  she enquired of him concerning meg and his children and the affairs of eberwich but the interest was flimsy as she preserved a wide distance between them although apparently she was so unaffected and friendly we left before eleven  when we were seated in the cab and rushing down hill he said  you know she makes me mad  he was frowning looking out of the window away from me  who lettie why what riles you i asked  he was some time in replying  why shes so affected  i sat still in the small close space and waited  do you know—— he laughed keeping his face averted from me she makes my blood boil i could hate her  why i said gently  i dont know i feel as if shed insulted me she does lie doesnt she  i didnt notice it i said but i knew he meant her shirking her shuffling of her life  and you think of those poor devils under the bridge—and then of her and them frittering away themselves and money in that idiocy——  he spoke with passion  you are quoting longfellow i said  what he asked looking at me suddenly  life is real life is earnest——  he flushed slightly at my goodnatured gibe  i dont know what it is he replied but its a pretty rotten business when you think of her fooling about wasting herself and all the waste that goes on up there and the poor devils rotting on the embankment—and——  and you—and mayhew—and me—— i continued  he looked at me very intently to see if i were mocking he laughed i could see he was very much moved  is the time quite out of joint i asked  why—he laughed no but she makes me feel so angry—as if i should burst—i dont know when i felt in such a rage i wonder why im sorry for him poor devil lettie and leslie—they seemed christened for one another didnt they  what if youd had her i asked  we should have been like a cat and dog id rather be with meg a thousand times—now he added significantly he sat watching the lamps and the people and the dark buildings slipping past us  shall we go and have a drink i asked him thinking we would call in frascatis to see the comeandgo  i could do with a brandy he replied looking at me slowly  we sat in the restaurant listening to the jigging of the music watching the changing flow of the people i like to sit a long time by the hollyhocks watching the throng of varied bees which poise and hesitate outside the wild flowers then swing in with a hum which sets everything aquiver but still more fascinating it is to watch the come and go of people weaving and intermingling in the complex mesh of their intentions with all the subtle grace and mystery of their moving shapely bodies  i sat still looking out across the amphitheatre george looked also but he drank glass after glass of brandy  i like to watch the people said i  ay—and doesnt it seem an aimless idiotic business—look at them he replied in tones of contempt i looked instead at him in some surprise and resentment his face was gloomy stupid and unrelieved the amount of brandy he had drunk had increased his ill humour  shall we be going i said i did not want him to get drunk in his present state of mind  ay—in half a minute he finished the brandy and rose although he had drunk a good deal he was quite steady only there was a disagreeable look always on his face and his eyes seemed smaller and more glittering than i had seen them we took a bus to victoria he sat swaying on his seat in the dim clumsy vehicle saying not a word in the vast cavern of the station the theatregoers were hastening crossing the pale grey strand small creatures scurrying hither and thither in the space beneath the lonely lamps as the train crawled over the river we watched the farflung hoop of diamond lights curving slowly round and striping with bright threads the black water he sat looking with heavy eyes seeming to shrink from the enormous unintelligible lettering of the poem of london  the town was too large for him he could not take in its immense its stupendous poetry what did come home to him was its flagrant discords the unintelligibility of the vast city made him apprehensive and the crudity of its big coarse contrasts wounded him unutterably  what is the matter i asked him as we went along the silent pavement at norwood  nothing he replied nothing and i did not trouble him further  we occupied a large twobedded room—that looked down the hill and over to the far woods of kent he was morose and untalkative i brought up a sodasyphon and whisky and we proceeded to undress when he stood in his pajamas he waited as if uncertain  do you want a drink he asked  i did not he crossed to the table and as i got into my bed i heard the brief fizzing of the syphon he drank his glass at one draught then switched off the light in the sudden darkness i saw his pale shadow go across to the sofa in the windowspace the blinds were undrawn and the stars looked in he gazed out on the great bay of darkness wherein far away and below floated a few sparks of lamps like herring boats at sea  arent you coming to bed i asked  im not sleepy—you go to sleep he answered resenting having to speak at all  then put on a dressing gown—theres one in that corner—turn the light on  he did not answer but fumbled for the garment in the darkness when he had found it he said  do you mind if i smoke  i did not he fumbled again in his pockets for cigarettes always refusing to switch on the light i watched his face bowed to the match as he lighted his cigarette he was still handsome in the ruddy light but his features were coarser i felt very sorry for him but i saw that i could get no nearer to him to relieve him for some time i lay in the darkness watching the end of his cigarette like a ruddy malignant insect hovering near his lips putting the timid stars immensely far away he sat quite still leaning on the sofa arm occasionally there was a little glow on his cheeks as the cigarette burned brighter then again i could see nothing but the dull red bee  i suppose i must have dropped asleep suddenly i started as something fell to the floor i heard him cursing under his breath  whats the matter i asked  ive only knocked something down—cigarette case or something he replied apologetically  arent you coming to bed i asked  yes im coming he answered quite docile  he seemed to wander about and knock against things as he came he dropped heavily into bed  are you sleepy now i asked  i dunno—i shall be directly he replied  whats up with you i asked  i dunno he answered i am like this sometimes when theres nothing i want to do and nowhere i want to go and nobody i want to be near then you feel so rottenly lonely cyril you feel awful like a vacuum with a pressure on you a sort of pressure of darkness and you yourself—just nothing a vacuum—thats what its like—a little vacuum thats not dark all loose in the middle of a space of darkness thats pressing on you  good gracious i exclaimed rousing myself in bed that sounds bad  he laughed slightly  its all right he said its only the excitement of london and that little man in the park and that woman on the seat—i wonder where she is tonight poor devil—and then lettie i seem thrown off my balance—i think really i ought to have made something of myself——  what i asked as he hesitated  i dont know he replied slowly —a poet or something like burns—i dont know i shall laugh at myself for thinking so tomorrow but i am born a generation too soon—i wasnt ripe enough when i came i wanted something i hadnt got im something short im like corn in a wet harvest—full but pappy no good isll rot i came too soon or i wanted something that would ha made me grow fierce thats why i wanted lettie—i think but am i talking damn rot what am i saying what are you making me talk for what are you listening for  i rose and went across to him saying i dont want you to talk if you sleep till morning things will look different  i sat on his bed and took his hand he lay quite still  im only a kid after all cyril he said a few moments later  we all are i answered still holding his hand presently he fell asleep  when i awoke the sunlight was laughing with the young morning in the room the large blue sky shone against the window and the birds were calling in the garden below shouting to one another and making fun of life i felt glad to have opened my eyes i lay for a moment looking out on the morning as on a blue bright sea in which i was going to plunge  then my eyes wandered to the little table near the couch i noticed the glitter of georges cigarette case and then with a start the whisky decanter it was nearly empty he must have drunk threequarters of a pint of liquor while i was dozing i could not believe it i thought i must have been mistaken as to the quantity the bottle contained i leaned out to see what it was that had startled me by its fall the night before it was the large heavy drinking glass which he had knocked down but not broken i could see no stain on the carpet  george was still asleep he lay half uncovered and was breathing quietly his face looked inert like a mask the pallid uninspired clay of his features seemed to have sunk a little out of shape so that he appeared rather haggard rather ugly with grooves of ineffectual misery along his cheeks i wanted him to wake so that his inert flaccid features might be inspired with life again i could not believe his charm and his beauty could have forsaken him so and left his features dreary sunken clay  as i looked he woke his eyes opened slowly he looked at me and turned away unable to meet my eyes he pulled the bedclothes up over his shoulders as though to cover himself from me and he lay with his back to me quite still as if he were asleep although i knew he was quite awake he was suffering the humiliation of lying waiting for his life to crawl back and inhabit his body as it was his vitality was not yet sufficient to inform the muscles of his face and give him an expression much less to answer by challenge        chapter v        pisgah  when her eldest boy was three years old lettie returned to live at eberwich old mr tempest died suddenly so leslie came down to inhabit highclose he was a very much occupied man very often he was in germany or in the south of england engaged on business at home he was unfailingly attentive to his wife and his two children he had cultivated a taste for public life in spite of his pressure of business he had become a county councillor and one of the prominent members of the conservative association he was very fond of answering or proposing toasts at some public dinner of entertaining political men at highclose of taking the chair at political meetings and finally of speaking on this or that platform his name was fairly often seen in the newspapers as a mine owner he spoke as an authority on the employment of labour on royalties landowning and so on  at home he was quite tame he treated his wife with respect romped in the nursery and domineered the servants royally they liked him for it—her they did not like he was noisy but unobservant she was quiet and exacting he would swear and bluster furiously but when he was round the corner they smiled she gave her orders and passed very moderate censure but they went away cursing to themselves as lettie was always a very good wife leslie adored her when he had the time and when he had not forgot her comfortably  she was very contradictory at times she would write to me in terms of passionate dissatisfaction she had nothing at all in her life it was a barren futility  i hope i shall have another child next spring she would write there is only that to take away the misery of this torpor i seem full of passion and energy and it all fizzles out in day to day domestics——  when i replied to her urging her to take some work that she could throw her soul into she would reply indifferently then later  you charge me with contradiction well naturally you see i wrote that screeching letter in a mood which wont come again for some time generally i am quite content to take the rain and the calm days just as they come then something flings me out of myself—and i am a trifle demented—very very blue as i tell leslie  like so many women she seemed to live for the most part contentedly a small indoor existence with artificial light and padded upholstery only occasionally hearing the winds of life outside she clamoured to be out in the black keen storm she was driven to the door she looked out and called into the tumult wildly but feminine caution kept her from stepping over the threshold  george was flourishing in his horsedealing  in the morning processions of splendid shire horses tied tail and head would tramp grandly along the quiet lanes of eberwich led by georges man or by tom mayhew while in the fresh clean sunlight george would go riding by two restless nags dancing beside him  when i came home from france five years after our meeting in london i found him installed in the hollies he had rented the house from the mayhews and had moved there with his family leaving oswald in charge of the ram i called at the large house one afternoon but george was out his family surprised me the twins were tall lads of six there were two more boys and meg was nursing a beautiful babygirl about a year old this child was evidently mistress of the household meg who was growing stouter indulged the little creature in every way  how is george i asked her  oh hes very well she replied hes always got something on hand he hardly seems to have a spare moment what with his socialism and one thing and another  it was true the outcome of his visit to london had been a wild devotion to the cause of the downtrodden i saw a picture of watts mammon on the walls of the morningroom and the works of blatchford masterman and chiozza money on the side table the socialists of the district used to meet every other thursday evening at the hollies to discuss reform meg did not care for these earnest souls  theyre not my sort she said too jerky and bumptious they think everybodys slowwitted but them theres one thing about them though they dont drink so thats a blessing  why i said have you had much trouble that way  she lowered her voice to a pitch which was sufficiently mysterious to attract the attention of the boys  i shouldnt say anything if it wasnt that you were like brothers she said but he did begin to have dreadful drinking bouts you know it was always spirits and generally brandy—and that makes such work with them youve no idea what hes like when hes evildrunk sometimes hes all for talk sometimes hes laughing at everything and sometimes hes just snappy and then—— here her tones grew ominous ——hell come home evildrunk  at the memory she grew serious  you couldnt imagine what its like cyril she said its like having satan in the house with you or a black tiger glowering at you im sure nobody knows what ive suffered with him——  the children stood with large awful eyes and paling lips listening  but hes better now i said  oh yes—since gertie came—she looked fondly at the baby in her arms—hes a lot better now you see he always wanted a girl and hes very fond of her—isnt he pet—are you your daddas girlie—and mammas too arent you  the baby turned with sudden coy shyness and clung to her mothers neck meg kissed her fondly then the child laid her cheek against her mothers the mothers dark eyes and the babys large hazel eyes looked at me serenely the two were very calm very complete and triumphant together in their completeness was a security which made me feel alone and ineffectual a woman who has her child in her arms is a tower of strength a beautiful unassailable tower of strength that may in its turn stand quietly dealing death  i told meg i would call again to see george two evenings later i asked lettie to lend me a dogcart to drive over to the hollies leslie was away on one of his political jaunts and she was restless she proposed to go with me she had called on meg twice before in the new large home  we started about six oclock the night was dark and muddy lettie wanted to call in eberwich village so she drove the long way round selsby the horse was walking through the gate of the hollies at about seven oclock meg was upstairs in the nursery the maid told me and george was in the diningroom getting baby to sleep  all right i said we will go in to him dont bother to tell him  as we stood in the gloomy square hall we heard the rumble of a rockingchair the stroke coming slow and heavy to the tune of henry martin one of our strelley mill folk songs then through the mans heavilyaccented singing floated the long light crooning of the baby as she sang in her quaint little fashion a mischievous second to her fathers lullaby he waxed a little louder and without knowing why we found ourselves smiling with piquant amusement the baby grew louder too till there was a shrill ring of laughter and mockery in her music he sang louder and louder the baby shrilled higher and higher the chair swung in long heavy beats then suddenly he began to laugh the rocking stopped and he said still with laughter and enjoyment in his tones  now that is very wicked ah naughty girlie—go to boh go to bohey—at once  the baby chuckled her small insolent mockery  come mamma he said come and take girlie to bohey  the baby laughed again but with an uncertain touch of appeal in her tone we opened the door and entered he looked up very much startled to see us he was sitting in a tall rockingchair by the fire coatless with white shirtsleeves the baby in her highwaisted tight little nightgown stood on his knee her wide eyes fixed on us wild wisps of her brown hair brushed across her forehead and glinting like puffs of bronze dust over her ears quickly she put her arms round his neck and tucked her face under his chin her small feet poised on his thigh the nightgown dropping upon them he shook his head as the puff of soft brown hair tickled him he smiled at us saying  you see im busy  then he turned again to the little brown head tucked under his chin blew away the luminous cloud of hair and rubbed his lips and his moustache on the small white neck so warm and secret the baby put up her shoulders and shrank a little bubbling in his neck with hidden laughter she did not lift her face or loosen her arms  she thinks she is shy he said look up young hussy and see the lady and gentleman she is a positive owl she wont go to bed—will you young brownowl  he tickled her neck again with his moustache and the child bubbled over with naughty merry laughter  the room was very warm with a red bank of fire up the chimney mouth it was half lighted from a heavy bronze chandelier black and gloomy in the middle of the room there was the same sombre sparse furniture that the mayhews had had george looked large and handsome the glossy black silk of his waistcoat fitting close to his sides the roundness of the shoulder muscle filling the white linen of his sleeves  suddenly the baby lifted her head and stared at us thrusting into her mouth the dummy that was pinned to the breast of her nightgown the faded pink sleeves of the nightgown were tight on her fat little wrists she stood thus sucking her dummy one arm round her fathers neck watching us with hazel solemn eyes then she pushed her fat little fist up among the bush of small curls and began to twist her fingers about her ear that was white like a camelia flower  she is really sleepy said lettie  come then said he folding her for sleep against his breast come and go to boh  but the young rascal immediately began to cry her remonstrance she stiffened herself freed herself and stood again on his knee watching us solemnly vibrating the dummy in her mouth as she suddenly sucked at it twisting her fathers ear in her small fingers till he winced  her nails are sharp he said smiling  he began asking and giving the small information that pass between friends who have not met for a long time the baby laid her head on his shoulder keeping her tired owllike eyes fixed darkly on us then gradually the lids fluttered and sank and she dropped on to his arm  she is asleep whispered lettie  immediately the dark eyes opened again we looked significantly at one another continuing our subdued talk after a while the baby slept soundly  presently meg came downstairs she greeted us in breathless whispers of surprise and then turned to her husband  has she gone she whispered bending over the sleeping child in astonishment my this is wonderful isnt it  she took the sleeping drooping baby from his arms putting her mouth close to its forehead murmuring with soothing inarticulate sounds  we stayed talking for some time when meg had put the baby to bed george had a new tone of assurance and authority in the first place he was an established man living in a large house having altogether three men working for him in the second place he had ceased to value the conventional treasures of social position and ostentatious refinement very very many things he condemned as flummery and sickly waste of time the life of an ordinary welltodo person he set down as adorned futility almost idiocy he spoke passionately of the monstrous denial of life to the many by the fortunate few he talked at lettie most flagrantly  of course she said i have read mr wells and mr shaw and even niel lyons and a dutchman—what is his name querido but what can i do i think the rich have as much misery as the poor and of quite as deadly a sort what can i do it is a question of life and the development of the human race society and its regulations is not a sort of drill that endless napoleons have forced on us it is the only way we have yet found of living together  pah said he that is rank cowardice it is feeble and futile to the last degree  we cant grow consumptionproof in a generation nor can we grow povertyproof  we can begin to take active measures he replied contemptuously  we can all go into a sanatorium and live miserably and dejectedly warding off death she said but life is full of goodliness for all that  it is fuller of misery he said  nevertheless she had shaken him she still kept her astonishing power of influencing his opinions all his passion and heat and rude speech analysed out was only his terror at her threatening of his lifeinterest  she was rather piqued by his rough treatment of her and by his contemptuous tone moreover she could never quite let him be she felt a driving force which impelled her almost against her will to interfere in his life she invited him to dine with them at highclose he was now quite possible he had in the course of his business been sufficiently in the company of gentlemen to be altogether comme it faut at a private dinner and after dinner  she wrote me concerning him occasionally  george saxton was here to dinner yesterday he and leslie had frightful battles over the nationalisation of industries george is rather more than a match for leslie which in his secret heart makes our friend gloriously proud it is very amusing i of course have to preserve the balance of power and of course to bolster my husbands dignity at a crucial dangerous moment when george is just going to wave his bloody sword and leslie lies bleeding with rage i step in and prick the victor under the heart with some little satire or some esoteric question i raise leslie and say his blood is luminous for the truth and vous voilà then i abate for the thousandth time leslies conservative crow and i appeal once more to george—it is no use my arguing with him he gets so angry—i make an abtruse appeal for all the wonderful sad and beautiful expressions on the countenance of life expressions which he does not see or which he distorts by his oblique vision of socialism into grimaces—and there i am i think i am something of a machiavelli but it is quite true what i say——  again she wrote  we happened to be motoring from derby on sunday morning and as we came to the top of the hill we had to thread our way through quite a large crowd i looked up and whom should i see but our friend george holding forth about the state endowment of mothers i made leslie stop while we listened the marketplace was quite full of people george saw us and became fiery leslie then grew excited and although i clung to the skirts of his coat with all my strength he jumped up and began to question i must say it with shame and humility—he made an ass of himself the men all round were jeering and muttering under their breath i think leslie is not very popular among them he is such an advocate of machinery which will do the work of men so they cheered our friend george when he thundered forth his replies and his demonstrations he pointed his finger at us and flung his hand at us and shouted till i quailed in my seat i cannot understand why he should become so frenzied as soon as i am within range george had a triumph that morning but when i saw him a few days later he seemed very uneasy rather selfmistrustful——  almost a year later i heard from her again on the same subject  i have had such a lark two or three times i have been to the hollies to socialist meetings leslie does not know they are great fun of course i am in sympathy with the socialists but i cannot narrow my eyes till i see one thing only life is like a large rather beautiful man who is young and full of vigour but hairy barbaric with hands hard and dirty the dirt ingrained i know his hands are very ugly i know his mouth is not firmly shapen i know his limbs are hairy and brutal but his eyes are deep and very beautiful that is what i tell george  the people are so earnest they make me sad but then they are so didactic they hold forth so much they are so cocksure and so narroweyed they make me laugh george laughs too i am sure we made such fun of a straighthaired goggle of a girl who had suffered in prison for the cause of women that i am ashamed when i see my womans league badge at the bottom you know cyril i dont care for anything very much except myself things seem so frivolous i am the only real thing i and the children——  gradually george fell out of the socialist movement it wearied him it did not feed him altogether he began by mocking his friends of the confraternity then he spoke in bitter dislike of hudson the wordy humorous shallow leader of the movement in eberwich it was hudson with his wriggling and his claptrap who disgusted george with the cause finally the meetings at the hollies ceased and my friend dropped all connection with his former associates  he began to speculate in land a hosiery factory moved to eberwich giving the place a new stimulus to growth george happened to buy a piece of land at the end of the street of the village when he got it it was laid out in allotment gardens these were becoming valueless owing to the encroachment of houses he took it divided it up and offered it as sites for a new row of shops he sold at a good profit  altogether he was becoming very well off i heard from meg that he was flourishing that he did not drink anything to speak of but that he was always out she hardly saw anything of him if gettingon was to keep him so much away from home she would be content with a little less fortune he complained that she was narrow and that she would not entertain any sympathy with any of his ideas  nobody comes here to see me twice he said because meg receives them in such an offhand fashion i asked jim curtiss and his wife from everley hall one evening we were uncomfortable all the time meg had hardly a word for anybody—yes and no and hm hm—theyll never come again  meg herself said  oh i cant stand stuckup folks they make me feel uncomfortable as soon as they begin mincing their words im done for—i can no more talk than a lobster——  thus their natures contradicted each other he tried hard to gain a footing in eberwich as it was he belonged to no class of society whatsoever meg visited and entertained the wives of small shopkeepers and publicans this was her set  george voted the women loudmouthed vulgar and narrow—not without some cause meg however persisted she visited when she thought fit and entertained when he was out he made acquaintance after acquaintance dr francis mr cartridge the veterinary surgeon toby heswall the brewers son the curtisses farmers of good standing from everley hall but it was no good george was by nature a family man he wanted to be private and secure in his own rooms then he was at ease as meg never went out with him and as every attempt to entertain at the hollies filled him with shame and mortification he began to give up trying to place himself and remained suspended in social isolation at the hollies    the friendship between lettie and himself had been kept up in spite of all things leslie was sometimes jealous but he dared not show it openly for fear of his wifes scathing contempt george went to highclose perhaps once in a fortnight perhaps not so often lettie never went to the hollies as megs attitude was too antagonistic  meg complained very bitterly of her husband he often made a beast of himself drinking he thought more of himself than he ought home was not good enough for him he was selfish to the backbone he cared neither for her nor the children only for himself    i happened to be at home for letties thirtyfirst birthday george was then thirtyfive lettie had allowed her husband to forget her birthday he was now very much immersed in politics foreseeing a general election in the following year and intending to contest the seat in parliament the division was an impregnable liberal stronghold but leslie had hopes that he might capture the situation therefore he spent a great deal of time at the conservative club and among the men of influence in the southern division lettie encouraged him in these affairs it relieved her of him it was thus that she let him forget her birthday while for some unknown reason she let the intelligence slip to george he was invited to dinner as i was at home  george came at seven oclock there was a strange feeling of festivity in the house although there were no evident signs lettie had dressed with some magnificence in a blackish purple gauze over soft satin of lighter tone nearly the colour of double violets she wore vivid green azurite ornaments on the fairness of her bosom and her bright hair was bound by a band of the same colour it was rather startling she was conscious of her effect and was very excited immediately george saw her his eyes wakened with a dark glow she stood up as he entered her hand stretched straight out to him her body very erect her eyes bright and rousing like two blue pennants  thank you so much she said softly giving his hand a last pressure before she let it go he could not answer so he sat down bowing his head then looking up at her in suspense she smiled at her  presently the children came in they looked very quaint like acolytes in their long straight dressinggowns of quilted blue silk the boy particularly looked as if he were going to light the candles in some childish church in paradise he was very tall and slender and fair with a round fine head and serene features both children looked remarkably almost transparently clean it is impossible to consider anything more fresh and fair the girl was a merry curly headed puss of six she played with her mothers green jewels and prattled prettily while the boy stood at his mothers side a slender and silent acolyte in his pale blue gown i was impressed by his patience and his purity when the girl had bounded away into georges arms the lad laid his hand timidly on letties knee and looked with a little wonder at her dress  how pretty those green stones are mother he said  yes replied lettie brightly lifting them and letting their strange pattern fall again on her bosom i like them  are you going to sing mother he asked  perhaps but why said lettie smiling  because you generally sing when mr saxton comes  he bent his head and stroked letties dress shyly  do i she said laughing can you hear  just a little he replied quite small as if it were nearly lost in the dark  he was hesitating shy as boys are lettie laid her hand on his head and stroked his smooth fair hair  sing a song for us before we go mother he asked almost shamefully she kissed him  you shall sing with me she said what shall it be  she played without a copy of the music he stood at her side while lucy the little mouse sat on her mothers skirts pressing letties silk slippers in turn upon the pedals the mother and the boy sang their song     gaily the troubadour touched his guitar    as he was hastening from the war  the boy had a pure treble clear as the flight of swallows in the morning the light shone on his lips under the piano the girl child sat laughing pressing her mothers feet with all her strength and laughing again lettie smiled as she sang  at last they kissed us a gentle goodnight and flitted out of the room the girl popped her curly head round the door again we saw the white cuff on the nurses wrist as she held the youngsters arm  youll come and kiss us when were in bed mum asked the rogue her mother laughed and agreed  lucy was withdrawn for a moment then we heard her just a tick nurse just halfatick  the curly head appeared round the door again  and one teenie sweetie she suggested only one  go you—— lettie clapped her hands in mock wrath the child vanished but immediately there appeared again round the door two blue laughing eyes and the snub tip of a nose  a nice one mum—not a jellyone  lettie rose with a rustle to sweep upon her the child vanished with a glitter of laughter we heard her calling breathlessly on the stairs—wait a bit freddie—wait for me  george and lettie smiled at each other when the children had gone as the smile died from their faces they looked down sadly and until dinner was announced they were very still and heavy with melancholy after dinner lettie debated pleasantly which bonbon she should take for the children when she came down again she smoked a cigarette with us over coffee george did not like to see her smoking yet he brightened a little when he sat down after giving her a light pleased with the mark of recklessness in her  it is ten years today since my party at woodside she said reaching for the small roman saltcellar of green jade that she used as an ashtray  my lord—ten years he exclaimed bitterly it seems a hundred  it does and it doesnt she answered smiling  if i look straight back and think of my excitement it seems only yesterday if i look between then and now at all the days that lie between it is an age  if i look at myself he said i think i am another person altogether  you have changed she agreed looking at him sadly there is a great change—but you are not another person i often think—there is one of his old looks he is just the same at the bottom  they embarked on a barge of gloomy recollections and drifted along the soiled canal of their past  the worst of it is he said i have got a miserable carelessness a contempt for things you know i had such a faculty for reverence i always believed in things  i know you did she smiled you were so humblyminded—too humblyminded i always considered you always thought things had a deep religious meaning somewhere hidden and you reverenced them is it different now  you know me very well he laughed what is there left for me to believe in if not in myself  you have to live for your wife and children she said with firmness  meg has plenty to secure her and the children as long as they live he said smiling so i dont know that im essential  but you are she replied you are necessary as a father and a husband if not as a provider  i think said he marriage is more of a duel than a duet one party wins and takes the other captive slave servant—what you like it is so more or less  well said lettie  well he answered meg is not like you she wants me part of me so shed kill me rather than let me go loose  oh no said lettie emphatically  you know nothing about it he said quietly  in the marital duel meg is winning the woman generally does she has the children on her side i cant give her any of the real part of me the vital part that she wants—i cant any more than you could give kisses to a stranger and i feel that im losing—and dont care  no she said you are getting morbid  he put the cigarette between his lips drew a deep breath then slowly sent the smoke down his nostrils  no he said  look here she said let me sing to you shall i and make you cheerful again  she sang from wagner it was the music of resignation and despair she had not thought of it all the time he listened he was thinking the music stimulated his thoughts and illuminated the trend of his brooding all the time he sat looking at her his eyes were dark with his thoughts she finished the star of eve from tannhäuser and came over to him  why are you so sad tonight when it is my birthday she asked plaintively  am i slow he replied i am sorry  what is the matter she said sinking onto the small sofa near to him  nothing he replied—you are looking very beautiful  there i wanted you to say that you ought to be quite gay you know when i am so smart tonight  nay he said i know i ought but the tomorrow seems to have fallen in love with me i cant get out of its lean arms  why she said tomorrows arms are not lean they are white like mine she lifted her arms and looked at them smiling  how do you know he asked pertinently  oh of course they are was her light answer  he laughed brief and sceptical  no he said it came when the children kissed us  what she asked  these lean arms of tomorrows round me and the white arms round you he replied smiling whimsically she reached out and clasped his hand  you foolish boy she said  he laughed painfully not able to look at her  you know he said and his voice was low and difficult i have needed you for a light you will soon be the only light again  who is the other she asked  my little girl he answered then he continued and you know i couldnt endure complete darkness i couldnt its the solitariness  you mustnt talk like this she said you know you mustnt she put her hand on his head and ran her fingers through the hair he had so ruffled  it is as thick as ever your hair she said  he did not answer but kept his face bent out of sight she rose from her seat and stood at the back of his low armchair taking an amber comb from her hair she bent over him and with the translucent comb and her white fingers she busied herself with his hair  i believe you would have a parting she said softly  he laughed shortly at her playfulness she continued combing just touching pressing the strands in place with the tips of her fingers  i was only a warmth to you he said pursuing the same train of thought so you could do without me but you were like the light to me and otherwise it was dark and aimless aimlessness is horrible  she had finally smoothed his hair so she lifted her hands and put back her head  there she said it looks fair fine as alice would say ravens wings are raggy in comparison  he did not pay any attention to her  arent you going to look at yourself she said playfully reproachful she put her fingertips under his chin he lifted his head and they looked at each other she smiling trying to make him play he smiling with his lips but not with eyes dark with pain  we cant go on like this lettie can we he said softly  yes she answered him yes why not  it cant he said it cant i couldnt keep it up lettie  but dont think about it she answered dont think of it  lettie he said i have to set my teeth with loneliness  hush she said no there are the children dont say anything—do not be serious will you  no there are the children he replied smiling dimly  yes hush now stand up and look what a fine parting i have made in your hair stand up and see if my style becomes you  it is no good lettie he said we cant go on  oh but come come come she exclaimed we are not talking about going on we are considering what a fine parting i have made you down the middle like two wings of a spread bird—— she looked down smiling playfully on him just closing her eyes slightly in petition  he rose and took a deep breath and set his shoulders  no he said and at the sound of his voice lettie went pale and also stiffened herself  no he repeated it is impossible i felt as soon as fred came into the room—it must be one way or another  very well then said lettie coldly her voice was muted like a violin  yes he replied submissive the children he looked at her contracting his lips in a smile of misery  are you sure it must be so final she asked rebellious even resentful she was twisting the azurite jewels on her bosom and pressing the blunt points into her flesh he looked up from the fascination of her action when he heard the tone of her last question he was angry  quite sure he said at last simply ironically  she bowed her head in assent his face twitched sharply as he restrained himself from speaking again then he turned and quietly left the room she did not watch him go but stood as he had left her when after some time she heard the grating of his dogcart on the gravel and then the sharp trot of hoofs down the frozen road she dropped herself on the settee and lay with her bosom against the cushions looking fixedly at the wall           chapter vi     the scarp slope   leslie won the conservative victory in the general election which took place a year or so after my last visit to highclose  in the interim the tempests had entertained a continuous stream of people i heard occasionally from lettie how she was busy amused or bored she told me that george had thrown himself into the struggle on behalf of the candidate of the labour party that she had not seen him except in the streets for a very long time  when i went down to eberwich in the march succeeding the election i found several people staying with my sister she had under her wing a young literary fellow who affected the doady style—dora copperfields doady he had bunches of halfcurly hair and a romantic black cravat he played the impulsive part but was really as calculating as any man on the stockexchange it delighted lettie to mother him he was so shrewd as to be less than harmless his fellow guests a woman much experienced in music and an elderly man who was in the artistic world without being of it were interesting for a time bubble after bubble of floating fancy and wit we blew with our breath in the evenings i rose in the morning loathing the idea of more bubbleblowing  i wandered around nethermere which had now forgotten me the daffodils under the boathouse continued their golden laughter and nodded to one another in gossip as i watched them never for a moment pausing to notice me the yellow reflection of daffodils among the shadows of grey willow in the water trembled faintly as they told haunted tales in the gloom i felt like a child left out of the group of my playmates there was a wind running across nethermere and on the eager water blue and glistening grey shadows changed places swiftly along the shore the wild birds rose flapping in expostulation as i passed peewits mewing fiercely round my head while two white swans lifted their glistening feathers till they looked like grand double waterlilies laying back their orange beaks among the petals and fronting me with haughty resentment charging towards me insolently  i wanted to be recognised by something i said to myself that the dryads were looking out for me from the woods edge but as i advanced they shrank and glancing wistfully turned back like pale flowers falling in the shadow of the forest i was a stranger an intruder among the bushes a twitter of lively birds exclaimed upon me finches went leaping past in bright flashes and a robin sat and asked rudely hello who are you  the bracken lay sere under the trees broken and chavelled by the restless wild winds of the long winter  the trees caught the wind in their tall netted twigs and the young morning wind moaned at its captivity as i trod the discarded oakleaves and the bracken they uttered their last sharp gasps pressed into oblivion the wood was roofed with a wide young sobbing sound and floored with a faint hiss like the intaking of the last breath between was all the glad outpeeping of buds and anemone flowers and the rush of birds i wandering alone felt them all the anguish of the bracken fallen facedown in defeat the careless dash of the birds the sobbing of the young wind arrested in its haste the trembling expanding delight of the buds i alone among them could hear the whole succession of chords  the brooks talked on just the same just as gladly just as boisterously as they had done when i had netted small glittering fish in the restpools at strelley mill a servant girl in a white cap and white apronbands came running out of the house with purple prayerbooks which she gave to the elder of two finicking girls who sat disconsolately with their blacksilked mother in the governess cart at the gate ready to go to church near woodside there was barbedwire along the path and at the end of every riding it was tarred on the treetrunks private  i had done with the valley of nethermere the valley of nethermere had cast me out many years before while i had fondly believed it cherished me in memory  i went along the road to eberwich the church bells were ringing boisterously with the careless boisterousness of the brooks and the birds and the rollicking coltsfoots and celandines  a few people were hastening blithely to service miners and other labouring men were passing in aimless gangs walking nowhere in particular so long as they reached a sufficiently distant public house  i reached the hollies it was much more spruce than it had been the yard however and the stables had again a somewhat abandoned air i asked the maid for george  oh masters not up yet she said giving a little significant toss of her head and smiling i waited a moment  but he rung for a bottle of beer about ten minutes since so i should think—— she emphasised the word with some ironical contempt —he wont be very long she added in tones which conveyed that she was not by any means sure i asked for meg  oh missis is gone to church—and the children—but miss saxton is in she might——  emily i exclaimed  the maid smiled  shes in the drawingroom shes engaged but perhaps if i tell her——  yes do said i sure that emily would receive me  i found my old sweetheart sitting in a low chair by the fire a man standing on the hearthrug pulling his moustache emily and i both felt a thrill of old delight at meeting  i can hardly believe it is really you she said laughing me one of the old intimate looks she had changed a great deal she was very handsome but she had now a new selfconfidence a fine free indifference  let me introduce you mr renshaw cyril tom you know who it is you have heard me speak often enough of cyril i am going to marry tom in three weeks time she said laughing  the devil you are i exclaimed involuntarily  if he will have me she added quite as a playful afterthought  tom was a wellbuilt fair man smoothly almost delicately tanned there was something soldierly in his bearing something selfconscious in the way he bent his head and pulled his moustache something charming and fresh in the way he laughed at emilys last preposterous speech  why didnt you tell me i asked  why didnt you ask me she retorted arching her brows  mr renshaw i said you have outmanoeuvred me all unawares quite indecently  i am very sorry he said giving one more twist to his moustache then breaking into a loud short laugh at his joke  do you really feel cross said emily to me knitting her brows and smiling quaintly  i do i replied with truthful emphasis  she laughed and laughed again very much amused  it is such a joke she said to think you should feel cross now when it is—how long is it ago——  i will not count up said i  are you not sorry for me i asked of tom renshaw  he looked at me with his young blue eyes eyes so bright so naïvely inquisitive so winsomely meditative he did not know quite what to say or how to take it  very he replied in another short burst of laughter quickly twisting his moustache again and looking down at his feet  he was twentynine years old had been a soldier in china for five years was now farming his fathers farm at papplewick where emily was schoolmistress he had been at home eighteen months his father was an old man of seventy who had had his right hand chopped to bits in the chopping machine so they told me i liked tom for his handsome bearing and his fresh winsome way he was exceedingly manly that is to say he did not dream of questioning or analysing anything all that came his way was ready labelled nice or nasty good or bad he did not imagine that anything could be other than just what it appeared to be—and with this appearance he was quite content he looked up to emily as one wiser nobler nearer to god than himself  i am a thousand years older than he she said to me laughing just as you are centuries older than i  and you love him for his youth i asked  yes she replied for that and—he is wonderfully sagacious—and so gentle  and i was never gentle was i i said  no as restless and as urgent as the wind she said and i saw a last flicker of the old terror  where is george i asked  in bed she replies briefly hes recovering from one of his orgies if i were meg i would not live with him  is he so bad i asked  bad she replied hes disgusting and im sure hes dangerous id have him removed to an inebriates home  youd have to persuade him to go said tom who had come into the room again he does have dreadful bouts though hes killing himself sure enough i feel awfully sorry for the fellow  it seems so contemptible to me said emily to become enslaved to one of your likings till it makes a beast of you look what a spectacle he is for his children and what a disgusting disgrace for his wife  well if he cant help it he cant poor chap said tom though i do think a man should have more backbone  we heard heavy noises from the room above  he is getting up said emily i suppose id better see if hell have any breakfast she waited however presently the door opened and there stood george with his hand on the knob leaning looking in  i thought i heard three voices he said as if it freed him from a certain apprehension he smiled his waistcoat hung open over his woollen shirt he wore no coat and was slipperless his hair and his moustache were dishevelled his face pale and stupid with sleep his eyes small he turned aside from our looks as from a bright light his hand as i shook it was flaccid and chill  how do you come to be here cyril he said subduedly faintly smiling  will you have any breakfast emily asked him coldly  ill have a bit if theres any for me he replied  it has been waiting for you long enough she answered he turned and went with a dull thud of his stockinged feet across to the diningroom emily rang for the maid i followed george leaving the betrothed together i found my host moving about the diningroom looking behind the chairs and in the corners  i wonder where the devil my slippers are he muttered explanatorily meanwhile he continued his search i noticed he did not ring the bell to have them found for him presently he came to the fire spreading his hands over it as he was smashing the slowly burning coal the maid came in with the tray he desisted and put the poker carefully down while the maid spread his meal on one corner of the table he looked in the fire paying her no heed when she had finished  its fried whitebait she said shall you have that  he lifted his head and looked at the plate  ay he said have you brought the vinegar  without answering she took the cruet from the sideboard and set it on the table as she was closing the door she looked back to say  youd better eat it now while its hot  he took no notice but sat looking in the fire  and how are you going on he asked me  i oh very well and you——  as you see he replied turning his head on one side with a little gesture of irony  as i am very sorry to see i rejoined  he sat forward with his elbows on his knees tapping the back of his hand with one finger in monotonous twopulse like heartbeats  arent you going to have breakfast i urged the clock at that moment began to ring a sonorous twelve he looked up at it with subdued irritation  ay i suppose so he answered me when the clock had finished striking he rose heavily and went to the table as he poured out a cup of tea he spilled it on the cloth and stood looking at the stain it was still some time before he began to eat he poured vinegar freely over the hot fish and ate with an indifference that made eating ugly pausing now and again to wipe the tea off his moustache or to pick a bit of fish from off his knee  you are not married i suppose he said in one of his pauses  no i replied i expect i shall have to be looking round  youre wiser not he replied quiet and bitter  a moment or two later the maid came in with a letter  this came this morning she said as she laid it on the table beside him he looked at it then he said  you didnt give me a knife for the marmalade  didnt i she replied i thought you wouldnt want it you dont as a rule  and do you know where my slippers are he asked  they ought to be in their usual place she went and looked in the corner i suppose miss gerties put them somewhere ill get you another pair  as he waited for her he read the letter he read it twice then he put it back in the envelope quietly without any change of expression but he ate no more breakfast even after the maid had brought the knife and his slippers and though he had had but a few mouthfuls  at halfpast twelve there was an imperious womans voice in the house meg came to the door as she entered the room and saw me she stood still she sniffed glanced at the table and exclaimed coming forward effusively  well i never cyril whod a thought of seeing you here this morning how are you  she waited for the last of my words then immediately she turned to george and said  i must say youre in a nice state for cyril to see you have you finished—if you have kate can take that tray out it smells quite sickly have you finished  he did not answer but drained his cup of tea and pushed it away with the back of his hand meg rang the bell and having taken off her gloves began to put the things on the tray tipping the fragments of fish and bones from the edge of his plate to the middle with short disgusted jerks of the fork her attitude and expression were of resentment and disgust the maid came in  clear the table kate and open the window have you opened the bedroom windows  nom—not yet—she glanced at george as if to say he had only been down a few minutes  then do it when you have taken the tray said meg  you dont open this window said george churlishly its cold enough as it is  you should put a coat on then if youre starved replied meg contemptuously its warm enough for those that have got any life in their blood you do not find it cold do you cyril  it is fresh this morning i replied  of course it is not cold at all and im sure this room needs airing  the maid however folded the cloth and went out without approaching the windows  meg had grown stouter and there was a certain immovable confidence in her she was authoritative amiable calm she wore a handsome dress of dark green and a toque with opulent ostrich feathers as she moved about the room she seemed to dominate everything particularly her husband who sat ruffled and dejected his waistcoat hanging loose over his shirt  a girl entered she was proud and mincing in her deportment her face was handsome but too haughty for a child she wore a white coat with ermine tippet muff and hat her long brown hair hung twining down her back  has dad only just had his breakfast she exclaimed in high censorious tones as she came in  he has replied meg  the girl looked at her father in calm childish censure  and we have been to church and come home to dinner she said as she drew off her little white gloves george watched her with ironical amusement  hello said meg glancing at the opened letter which lay near his elbow who is that from  he glanced round having forgotten it he took the envelope doubled it and pushed it in his waistcoat pocket  its from william housley he replied  oh and what has he to say she asked  george turned his dark eyes at her  nothing he said  hmhm sneered meg funny letter about nothing  i suppose said the child with her insolent highpitched superiority its some money that he doesnt want us to know about  thats about it said meg giving a small laugh at the childs perspicuity  sos he can keep it for himself thats what it is continued the child nodding her head in rebuke at him  ive no right to any money have i asked the father sarcastically  no you havent the child nodded her head at him dictatorially you havent because you only put it in the fire  youve got it wrong he sneered you mean its like giving a child fire to play with  um—and it is isnt it mam—the small woman turned to her mother for corroboration meg had flushed at his sneer when he quoted for the child its mothers dictum  and youre very naughty preached gertie turning her back disdainfully on her father  is that what the parsons been telling you he asked a grain of amusement still in his bitterness  no it isnt retorted the youngster if you want to know you should go and listen for yourself everybody that goes to church looks nice—— she glanced at her mother and at herself pruning herself proudly —and god loves them she added she assumed a sanctified expression and continued after a little thought because they look nice and are meek  what exclaimed meg laughing glancing with secret pride at me  because theyre meek repeated gertie with a superior little smile of knowledge  youre off the mark this time said george  no im not am i mam isnt it right mam the meek shall inevit the erf  meg was too much amused to answer  the meek shall have herrings on earth mocked the father also amused his daughter looked dubiously at him she smelled impropriety  its not mam is it she asked turning to her mother meg laughed  the meek shall have herrings on earth repeated george with soft banter  no its not mam is it cried the child in real distress  tell your father hes always teaching you something wrong answered meg  then i said i must go they pressed me to stay  oh yes—do stop to dinner suddenly pleaded the child smoothing her wild ravels of curls after having drawn off her hat she asked me again and again with much earnestness  but why i asked  sos you can talk to us this afternoon—an sos dad wont be so disgreeable she replied plaintively poking the black spots on her muff  meg moved nearer to her daughter with a little gesture of compassion  but said i i promised a lady i would be back for lunch so i must you have some more visitors you know  oh well she complained they go in another room and dad doesnt care about them  but come said i  well hes just as disgreeable when auntie emilys here—he is with her an all  you are having your character given away said meg brutally turning to him  i bade them goodbye he did me the honour of coming with me to the door we could neither of us find a word to say though we were both moved when at last i held his hand and was looking at him as i said goodbye he looked back at me for the first time during our meeting his eyes were heavy and as he lifted them to me seemed to recoil in an agony of shame           chapter vii     a prospect among the marshes of lethe   george steadily declined from this time i went to see him two years later he was not at home meg wept to me as she told me of him how he let the business slip how he drank what a brute he was in drink and how unbearable afterwards he was ruining his constitution he was ruining her life and the childrens i felt very sorry for her as she sat large and ruddy brimming over with bitter tears she asked me if i did not think i might influence him he was she said at the ram when he had an extra bad bout on he went up there and stayed sometimes for a week at a time with oswald coming back to the hollies when he had recovered—though said meg hes sick every morning and almost after every meal  all the time meg was telling me this sat curled up in a large chair their youngest boy a pale sensitive rather spoiled lad of seven or eight years with a petulant mouth and nervous dark eyes he sat watching his mother as she told her tale heaving his shoulders and settling himself in a new position when his feelings were nearly too much for him he was full of wild childish pity for his mother and furious childish hate of his father the author of all their trouble i called at the ram and saw george he was half drunk  i went up to highclose with a heavy heart letties last child had been born much to the surprise of everybody some few months before i came down there was a space of seven years between her youngest girl and this baby lettie was much absorbed in motherhood  when i went up to talk to her about george i found her in the bedroom nursing the baby who was very good and quiet on her knee she listened to me sadly but her attention was caught away by each movement made by the child as i was telling her of the attitude of georges children towards their father and mother she glanced from the baby to me and exclaimed  see how he watches the light flash across your spectacles when you turn suddenly—look  but i was weary of babies my friends had all grown up and married and inflicted them on me there were storms of babies i longed for a place where they would be obsolete and young arrogant impervious mothers might be a forgotten tradition letties heart would quicken in answer to only one pulse the easy light ticking of the babys blood  i remembered one day as i sat in the train hastening to charing cross on my way from france that that was georges birthday i had the feeling of him upon me heavily and i could not rid myself of the depression i put it down to travel fatigue and tried to dismiss it as i watched the evening sun glitter along the new cornstubble in the fields we passed trying to describe the effect to myself i found myself asking but—whats the matter ive not had bad news have i to make my chest feel so weighted  i was surprised when i reached my lodging in new maiden to find no letters for me save one fat budget from alice i knew her squat saturnine handwriting on the envelope and i thought i knew what contents to expect from the letter  she had married an old acquaintance who had been her particular aversion this young man had got himself into trouble so that the condemnations of the righteous pursued him like clouds of gnats on a summer evening alice immediately rose to sting back his vulgar enemies and having rendered him a service felt she could only wipe out the score by marrying him they were fairly comfortable occasionally as she said there were displays of small fireworks in the back yard he worked in the offices of some iron foundries just over the erewash in derbyshire alice lived in a dirty little place in the valley a mile and a half from eberwich not far from his work she had no children and practically no friends a few young matrons for acquaintances as wife of a superior clerk she had to preserve her dignity among the workpeople so all her little crackling fires were sodded down with the sods of british respectability occasionally she smouldered a fierce smoke that made ones eyes water occasionally perhaps once a year she wrote me a whole venomous budget much to my amusement  i was not in any haste to open this fat letter until after supper i turned to it as a resource from my depression  oh dear cyril im in a bubbling state i want to yell not write oh cyril why didnt you marry me or why didnt our georgie saxton or somebody im deadly sick percival charles is enough to stop a clock oh cyril he lives in an eternal sunday suit holy broadcloth and righteous three inches of cuffs he goes to bed in it nay he wallows in bibles when he goes to bed i can feel the brass covers of all his family bibles sticking in my ribs as i lie by his side i could weep with wrath yet i put on my black hat and trot to chapel with him like a lamb  oh cyril nothings happened nothing has happened to me all these years i shall die of it when i see percival charles at dinner after having asked a blessing i feel as if i should never touch a bit at his table again in about an hour i shall hear him hurrying up the entry—prayers always make him hungry—and his first look will be on the table but im not fair to him—hes really a good fellow—i only wish he wasnt  its george saxton whos put this seidlitz powder in my marital cup of cocoa cyril i must a tale unfold it is fifteen years since our george married meg when i count up and think of the future it nearly makes me scream but my tale my tale  can you remember his faithfuldog woundedstag gentlegazelle eyes cyril you can see the whisky or the brandy combusting in them hes got d—ts bluedevils—and ive seen him and im swarming myself with little red devils after it i went up to eberwich on wednesday afternoon for a pound of fry for percival charles thursday dinner i walked by that little path which you know goes round the back of the hollies—its as near as any way for me i thought i heard a row in the paddock at the back of the stables so i said i might as well see the fun i went to the gate basket in one hand ninepence in coppers in the other a demure deacons wife i didnt take in the scene at first  there was our georgie in leggings and breeches as of yore and a whip he was flourishing and striding and yelling go it old boy i said youll want your stocking round your throat tonight but cyril i had spoken too soon oh lum there came raking up the croft that long wirespringy racehorse of his ears flat and clinging to its neck the palefaced lad wilfred the kid was white as death and squealing mam mam i thought it was a bit rotten of georgie trying to teach the kid to jockey the racehorse bonnyboy—boney boy i call him—came bouncing round like a spiral eggwhish then i saw our georgie rush up screaming nearly spitting the moustache off his face and fetch the horse a cut with the whip it went off like a flame along hot paraffin the kid shrieked and clung georgie went rushing after him running staggery and swearing fairly screaming—awful—a lilylivered little swine the high lanky racehorse went larroping round as if it was going mad i was dazed then meg came rushing and the other two lads all screaming she went for george but he lifted his whip like the devil she darent go near him—she rushed at him and stopped rushed at him and stopped striking at him with her two fists he waved his whip and kept her off and the racehorse kept tearing along meg flew to stop it he ran with his drunken totterstep brandishing his whip i flew as well i hit him with my basket the kid fell off and meg rushed to him some men came running george stood fairly shuddering you would never have known his face cyril he was mad demoniacal i feel sometimes as if i should burst and shatter to bits like a skyrocket when i think of it ive got such a weal on my arm  i lost percival charles ninepence and my nice white cloth out of the basket and everything besides having black looks on thursday because it was mutton chops which he hates oh cyril i wish i was a cassowary on the banks of the timbuctoo when i saw meg sobbing over that lad—thank goodness he wasnt hurt— i wished our georgie was dead i do now also i wish we only had to remember him i havent been to see them lately—cant stand megs ikeyness i wonder how it all will end  theres p c bidding good night and god bless you to brother jakes and no supper ready——  as soon as i could after reading alices letter i went down to eberwich to see how things were memories of the old days came over me again till my heart hungered for its old people  they told me at the hollies that after a bad attack of delirium tremens george had been sent to papplewick in the lonely country to stay with emily i borrowed a bicycle to ride the nine miles the summer had been wet and everything was late at the end of september the foliage was heavy green and the wheat stood dejectedly in stook i rode through the still sweetness of an autumn morning the mist was folded blue along the hedges the elm trees loomed up along the dim walls of the morning the horsechestnut trees at hand flickered with a few yellow leaves like bright blossoms as i rode through the tree tunnel by the church where on his last night the keeper had told me his story i smelled the cold rotting of the leaves of the cloudy summer  i passed silently through the lanes where the chill grass was weighed down with greyblue seedpearls of dew in the shadow where the wet woollen spidercloths of autumn were spread as on a loom brown birds rustled in flocks like driven leaves before me i heard the faroff hooting of the looseall at the pits telling me it was halfpast eleven that the men and boys would be sitting in the narrow darkness of the mines eating their snap while shadowy mice darted for the crumbs and the boys laughed with red mouths rimmed with grime as the bold little creatures peeped at them in the dim light of the lamps the dogwood berries stood jauntily scarlet on the hedgetops the bunched scarlet and green berries of the convolvulus and bryony hung amid golden trails the blackberries dropped ungathered i rode slowly on the plants dying around me the berries leaning their heavy ruddy mouths and languishing for the birds the men imprisoned underground below me the brown birds dashing in haste along the hedges  swineshed farm where the renshaws lived stood quite alone among its fields hidden from the highway and from everything the lane leading up to it was deep and unsunned on my right i caught glimpses through the hedge of the cornfields where the shocks of wheat stood like small yellowsailed ships in a widespread flotilla the upper part of the field was cleared i heard the clank of a wagon and the voices of men and i saw the high load of sheaves go lurching rocking up the incline to the stackyard  the lane debouched into a closebitten field and out of this empty land the farm rose up with its buildings like a huddle of old painted vessels floating in still water white fowls went stepping discreetly through the mild sunshine and the shadow i leaned my bicycle against the grey silken doors of the old coachhouse the place was breathing with silence i hesitated to knock at the open door emily came she was rich as always with her large beauty and stately now with the stateliness of a strong woman six months gone with child  she exclaimed with surprise and i followed her into the kitchen catching a glimpse of the glistening pans and the white wood baths as i passed through the scullery the kitchen was a goodsized low room that through long course of years had become absolutely a home the great beams of the ceiling bowed easily the chimneyseat had a bit of darkgreen curtain and under the high mantelpiece was another low shelf that the men could reach with their hands as they sat in the inglenook there the pipes lay many generations of peaceful men and fruitful women had passed through the room and not one but had added a new small comfort a chair in the right place a hook a stool a cushion a certain pleasing cloth for the sofa covers a shelf of books the room that looked so quiet and crude was a home evolved through generations to fit the large bodies of the men who dwelled in it and the placid fancy of the women at last it had an individuality it was the home of the renshaws warm lovable serene emily was in perfect accord with its brownness its shadows its ease i as i sat on the sofa under the window felt rejected by the kind room i was distressed with a sense of ephemerality of pale erratic fragility  emily in her fullblooded beauty was at home it is rare now to feel a kinship between a room and the one who inhabits it a close bond of blood relation emily had at last found her place and had escaped from the torture of strange complex modern life she was making a pie and the flour was white on her brown arms she pushed the tickling hair from her face with her arm and looked at me with tranquil pleasure as she worked the paste in the yellow bowl i was quiet subdued before her  you are very happy i said  ah very she replied and you—you are not you look worn  yes i replied i am happy enough i am living my life  dont you find it wearisome she asked pityingly  she made me tell her all my doings and she marvelled but all the time her eyes were dubious and pitiful  you have george here i said  yes hes in a poor state but hes not as sick as he was  what about the delirium tremens  oh he was better of that—very nearly—before he came here he sometimes fancies theyre coming on again and hes terrified isnt it awful and hes brought it all on himself toms very good to him  theres nothing the matter with him—physically is there i asked  i dont know she replied as she went to the oven to turn a pie that was baking she put her arm to her forehead and brushed aside her hair leaving a mark of flour on her nose for a moment or two she remained kneeling on the fender looking into the fire and thinking he was in a poor way when he came here could eat nothing sick every morning i suppose its his liver they all end like that she continued to wipe the large black plums and put them in the dish  hardening of the liver i asked she nodded  and is he in bed i asked again  yes she replied its as i say if hed get up and potter about a bit hed get over it but he lies there skulking  and what time will he get up i insisted  i dont know he may crawl down somewhere towards teatime do you want to see him thats what you came for isnt it  she smiled at me with a little sarcasm and added you always thought more of him than anybody didnt you ah well come up and see him  i followed her up the back stairs which led out of the kitchen and which emerged straight in a bedroom we crossed the hollowsounding plasterfloor of this naked room and opened a door at the opposite side george lay in bed watching us with apprehensive eyes  here is cyril come to see you said emily so ive brought him up for i didnt know when youd be downstairs  a small smile of relief came on his face and he put out his hand from the bed he lay with the disorderly clothes pulled up to his chin his face was discoloured and rather bloated his nose swollen  dont you feel so well this morning asked emily softening with pity when she came into contact with his sickness  oh all right he replied wishing only to get rid of us  you should try to get up a bit its a beautiful morning warm and soft— she said gently he did not reply and she went downstairs  i looked round to the cold whitewashed room with its ceiling curving and sloping down the walls it was sparsely furnished and bare of even the slightest ornament the only things of warm colour were the cow and horse skins on the floor all the rest was white or grey or drab on one side the roof sloped down so that the window was below my knees and nearly touching the floor on the other side was a larger window breast high through it one could see the jumbled ruddy roofs of the sheds and the skies the tiles were shining with patches of vivid orange lichen beyond was the cornfield and the men small in the distance lifting the sheaves on the cart  you will come back to farming again wont you i asked him turning to the bed he smiled  i dont know he answered dully  would you rather i went downstairs i asked  no im glad to see you he replied in the same uneasy fashion  ive only just come back from france i said  ah he replied indifferent  i am sorry youre ill i said  he stared unmovedly at the opposite wall i went to the window and looked out after some time i compelled myself to say in a casual manner  wont you get up and come out a bit  i suppose isll have to he said gathering himself slowly together for the effort he pushed himself up in bed  when he took off the jacket of his pajamas to wash himself i turned away his arms seemed thin and he had bellied and was bowed and unsightly i remembered the morning we swam in the millpond i remembered that he was now in the prime of his life i looked at his bluish feeble hands as he laboriously washed himself the soap once slipped from his fingers as he was picking it up and fell rattling the pot loudly it startled us and he seemed to grip the sides of the washstand to steady himself then he went on with his slow painful toilet as he combed his hair he looked at himself with dull eyes of shame  the men were coming in from the scullery when we got downstairs dinner was smoking on the table i shook hands with tom renshaw and with the old mans hard fierce left hand then i was introduced to arthur renshaw a cleanfaced large bashful lad of twenty i nodded to the man jim and to jims wife annie we all sat down to table  well an ow are ter feelin by now like asked the old man heartily of george receiving no answer he continued tha should a gor up an com an gen us a and wi th wheat it ud a done thee good  you will have a bit of this mutton wont you tom asked him tapping the joint with the carving knife george shook his head  its quite lean and tender he said gently  no thanks said george  gie im a bit gie im a bit cried the old man itll do im good—its what e wants a bit o strengthenin nourishment  its no good if his stomach wont have it said tom in mild reproof as if he were speaking of a child arthur filled georges glass with beer without speaking the two young men were full of kind gentle attention  let im ae a spoonful o tonnup then persisted the old man i canna eat while is plate stands there empy  so they put turnip and onion sauce on georges plate and he took up his fork and tasted a few mouthfuls the men ate largely and with zest the sight of their grand satisfaction amounting almost to gusto sickened him  when at last the old man laid down the dessert spoon which he used in place of a knife and fork he looked again at georges plate and said  why tha asna aten a smite not a smite tha non goos th raight road to be better  george maintained a stupid silence  dont bother him father said emily  tha art an öwd whittle feyther added tom smiling goodnaturedly he spoke to his father in dialect but to emily in good english whatever she said had toms immediate support before serving us with pie emily gave her brother junket and damsons setting the plate and the spoon before him as if he were a child for this act of grace tom looked at her lovingly and stroked her hand as she passed  after dinner george said with a miserable struggle for an indifferent tone  arent you going to give cyril a glass of whisky  he looked up furtively in a conflict of shame and hope a silence fell on the room  ay said the old man softly let im ave a drop  yes added tom in submissive pleading  all the men in the room shrank a little awaiting the verdict of the woman  i dont know she said clearly that cyril wants a glass  i dont mind i answered feeling myself blush i had not the courage to counteract her will directly not even the old man had that courage we waited in suspense after keeping us so for a few minutes while we smouldered with mortification she went into another room and we heard her unlocking a door she returned with a decanter containing rather less than half a pint of liquor she put out five tumblers  tha nedna gie me none said the old man ahm non a proud chap ahm not  nor me neither said arthur  you will tom she asked  do you want me to he replied smiling  i dont she answered sharply i want nobody to have it when you look at the results of it but if cyril is having a glass you may as well have one with him  tom was pleased with her she gave her husband and me fairly stiff glasses  steady steady he said give that george and give me not so much two fingers two of your fingers you know  but she passed him the glass when george had had his share there remained but a drop in the decanter  emily watched the drunkard coldly as he took this remainder  george and i talked for a time while the men smoked he from his glum stupidity broke into a harsh almost imbecile loquacity  have you seen my family lately he asked continuing yes not badly set up are they the children but the little devils are soft mardsoft every one of em its their mothers bringin up—she marded em till they were soft an would never let me have a say in it i should a brought em up different you know i should  tom looked at emily and remarking her angry contempt suggested that she should go out with him to look at the stacks i watched the tall squareshouldered man leaning with deference and tenderness towards his wife as she walked calmly at his side she was the mistress quiet and selfassured he her rejoiced husband and servant  george was talking about himself if i had not seen him i should hardly have recognised the words as his he was lamentably decayed he talked stupidly with vulgar contumely of others and in weak praise of himself  the old man rose with a  well i suppose we mun mae another dag at it and the men left the house  george continued his foolish harsh monologue making gestures of emphasis with his head and his hands he continued when we were walking round the buildings into the fields the same babble of bragging and abuse i was wearied and disgusted he looked and he sounded so worthless  across the empty cornfield the partridges were running we walked through the september haze slowly because he was feeble on his legs as he became tired he ceased to talk we leaned for some time on a gate in the brief glow of the transient afternoon and he was stupid again he did not notice the brown haste of the partridges he did not care to share with me the handful of ripe blackberries and when i pulled the bryony ropes off the hedges and held the great knots of red and green berries in my hand he glanced at them without interest or appreciation  poisonberries arent they he said dully  like a tree that is falling going soft and pale and rotten clammy with small fungi he stood leaning against the gate while the dim afternoon drifted with a flow of thick sweet sunshine past him not touching him  in the stackyard the summers splendid monuments of wheat and grass were reared in gold and grey the wheat was littered brightly round the rising stack the loaded wagon clanked slowly up the incline drew near and rode like a ship at anchor against the scotches brushing the stack with a crisp sharp sound tom climbed the ladder and stood a moment there against the sky amid the brightness and fragrance of the gold corn and waved his arm to his wife who was passing in the shadow of the building then arthur began to lift the sheaves to the stack and the two men worked in an exquisite subtle rhythm their white sleeves and their dark heads gleaming moving against the mild sky and the corn the silence was broken only by the occasional lurch of the body of the wagon as the teamer stepped to the front or again to the rear of the load occasionally i could catch the blue glitter of the prongs of the forks tom now lifted high above the small wagon load called to his brother some question about the stack the sound of his voice was strong and mellow  i turned to george who also was watching and said  you ought to be like that  we heard tom calling all right and saw him standing high up on the tallest corner of the stack as on the prow of a ship  george watched and his face slowly gathered expression he turned to me his dark eyes alive with horror and despair  i shall soon—be out of everybodys way he said his moment of fear and despair was cruel i cursed myself for having roused him from his stupor  you will be better i said  he watched again the handsome movement of the men at the stack  i couldnt team ten sheaves he said  you will in a month or two i urged  he continued to watch while tom got on the ladder and came down the front of the stack  nay the sooner i clear out the better he repeated to himself  when we went in to tea he was as tom said downcast the men talked uneasily with abated voices emily attended to him with a little palpitating solicitude we were all uncomfortably impressed with the sense of our alienation from him he sat apart and obscure among us like a condemned man        the end
