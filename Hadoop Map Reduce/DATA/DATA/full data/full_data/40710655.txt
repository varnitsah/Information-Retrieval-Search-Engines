40710655	the jerusalem sinner saved or good news for the vilest of men  by john bunyan      beginning at jerusalemluke xxiv 47  the whole verse runs thus  and that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in his name among all nations beginning at jerusalem  the words were spoken by christ after he rose from the dead and they are here rehearsed after an historical manner but do contain in them a formal commission with a special clause therein  the commission is as you see for the preaching of the gospel and is very distinctly inserted in the holy record by matthew and mark  go teach all nations c  go ye into all the world and preach the gospel unto every creature  matt xxviii 19 mark xvi 15  only this cause is in special mentioned by luke who saith that as christ would have the doctrine of repentance and remission of sins preached in his name among all nations so he would have the people of jerusalem to have the first proffer thereof  preach it saith christ in all nations but begin at jerusalem  the apostles then though they had a commission so large as to give them warrant to go and preach the gospel in all the world yet by this clause they were limited as to the beginning of their ministry they were to begin this work at jerusalem  beginning at jerusalem  before i proceed to an observation upon the words i must but briefly touch upon two things  namely  i  show you what jerusalem now was  ii  show you what it was to preach the gospel to them  i  for the first jerusalem is to be considered either  1  with respect to the descent of her people  or  2  with respect to her preference and exaltation  or  3  with respect to her present state as to her decays  first as to her descent  she was from abraham the sons of jacob a people that god singled out from the rest of the nations to set his love upon them  secondly as to her preference or exaltation she was the place of gods worship and that which had in and with her the special tokens and signs of gods favour and presence above any other people in the world  hence the tribes went up to jerusalem to worship there was gods house gods highpriest gods sacrifices accepted and gods eye and gods heart perpetually psalm lxxvi 1 2 psalm cxxii 1 kings ix 3  but  thirdly we are to consider jerusalem also in her decays for as she is so considered she is the proper object of our text as will be further showed by and by  jerusalem as i told you was the place and seat of gods worship but now decayed degenerated and apostatized  the word the rule of worship was rejected of them and in its place they had put and set up their own traditions they had rejected also the most weighty ordinances and put in the room thereof their own little things matt xv mark vii  jerusalem was therefore now greatly backsliding and become the place where truth and true religion were much defaced  it was also now become the very sink of sin and seat of hypocrisy and gulf where true religion was drowned  here also now reigned presumption and groundless confidence in god which is the bane of souls  amongst its rulers doctors and leaders envy malice and blasphemy vented itself against the power of godliness in all places where it was espied as also against the promoters of it yea their lord and maker could not escape them  in a word jerusalem was now become the shambles the very slaughter shop for saints  this was the place wherein the prophets christ and his people were most horribly persecuted and murdered  yea so hardened at this time was this jerusalem in her sins that she feared not to commit the biggest and to bind herself by wish under the guilt and damning evil of it saying when she had murdered the son of god his blood be upon us and our children  and though jesus christ did both by doctrine miracles and holiness of life seek to put a stop to their villanies yet they shut their eyes stopped their ears and rested not till as was hinted before they had driven him out of the world  yea that they might if possible have extinguished his name and exploded his doctrine out of the world they against all argument and in despite of heaven its mighty hand and undeniable proof of his resurrection did hire soldiers to invent a lie saying his disciples stole him away from the grave on purpose that men might not count him the saviour of the world nor trust in him for the remission of sins  they were saith paul contrary to all men  for they did not only shut up the door of life against themselves but forbade that it should be opened to any else  forbidding us saith he to preach to the gentiles that they might be saved to fill up their sins alway matt xxiii 35 chap xv 79 mark vii 68 matt iii 7 9 john viii 33 41 matt xxvii 18 mark iii 30 matt xxiii 37 luke xiii 33 34 matt xxvii 25 chap xx 1116 1 thess ii 14 16  this is the city and these are the people this is their character and these are their sins  nor can there be produced their parallel in all this world  nay what world what people what nation for sin and transgression could or can be compared to jerusalem especially if you join to the matter of fact the light they sinned against and the patience which they abused  infinite was the wickedness upon this account which they committed  after all their abusings of wise men and prophets god sent unto them john baptist to reduce them and then his son to redeem them but they would be neither reduced nor redeemed but persecuted both to the death  nor did they as i said stop here the holy apostles they afterwards persecuted also to death even so many as they could the rest they drove from them unto the utmost corners  ii  i come now to show you what it was to preach the gospel to them it was saith luke to preach to them repentance and remission of sins in christs name or as mark has it to bid them repent and believe the gospel mark i 15 not that repentance is a cause of remission but a sign of our hearty reception thereof  repentance is therefore here put to intimate that no pretended faith of the gospel is good that is not accompanied with it  and this he doth on purpose because he would not have them deceive themselves  for with what faith can he expect remission of sins in the name of christ that is not heartily sorry for them  or how shall a man be able to give to others a satisfactory account of his unfeigned subjection to the gospel that yet abides in his impenitency  wherefore repentance is here joined with faith in the way of receiving the gospel  faith is that without which it cannot be received at all and repentance that without which it cannot be received unfeignedly  when therefore christ says he would have repentance and remission of sins preached in his name among all nations it is as much as to say i will that all men every where be sorry for their sins and accept of mercy at gods hand through me lest they fall under his wrath in the judgment  for as i had said without repentance what pretence soever men have of faith they cannot escape the wrath to come  wherefore paul saith god commands all men every where to repent in order to their salvation because he hath appointed a day in the which he will judge the world in righteousness by that man whom he hath ordained acts xvii 31  and now to come to this clause beginning at jerusalem that is that christ would have jerusalem have the first offer of the gospel  1  this cannot be so commanded because they had now any more right of themselves thereto than had any of the nations of the world for their sins had divested them of all selfdeservings  2  nor yet because they stood upon the advanceground with the worst of the sinners of the nations nay rather the sinners of the nations had the advanceground of them  for jerusalem was long before she had added this iniquity to her sin worse than the very nations that god cast out before the children of israel 2 chron xxxiii  3  it must therefore follow that this clause begin at jerusalem was put into this commission of mere grace and compassion even from the overflowings of the bowels of mercy for indeed they were the worst and so in the most deplorable condition of any people under the heavens  whatever therefore their relation was to abraham isaac or jacob however they formerly had been the people among whom god had placed his name and worship they were now degenerated from god more than the nations were from their idols and were become guilty of the highest sins which the people of the world were capable of committing  nay none can be capable of committing of such pardonable sins as they committed against their god when they slew his son and persecuted his name and word  from these words therefore thus explained we gain this observation  that jesus christ would have mercy offered in the first place to the biggest sinners  that these jerusalem sinners were the biggest sinners that ever were in the world i think none will deny that believes that christ was the best man that ever was in the world and also was their lord god and that they were to have the first offer of his grace the text is as clear as the sun for it saith begin at jerusalem  preach saith he repentance and remission of sins to the jerusalem sinners  to the jerusalem sinners in the first place  one would athought since the jerusalem sinners were the worst and greatest sinners christs greatest enemies and those that not only despised his person doctrine and miracles but that a little before had had their hands up to the elbows in his heartblood that he should rather have said go into all the world and preach repentance and remission of sins among all nations and after that offer the same to jerusalem yea it had been infinite grace if he had said so  but what grace is this or what name shall we give it when he commands that this repentance and remission of sins which is designed to be preached in all nations should first be offered to jerusalem in the first place to the worst of sinners  nor was this the first time that the grace which was in the heart of christ thus shewed itself to the world  for while he was yet alive even while he was yet in jerusalem and perceived even among these jerusalem sinners which was the most vile amongst them he still in his preaching did signify that he had a desire that the worst of these worst should in the first place come unto him  the which he showeth where he saith to the better sort of them the publicans and harlots enter into the kingdom of god before you matt xxi 31 also when he compared jerusalem with the sinners of the nations then he commands that the jerusalem sinners should have the gospel at present confined to them  go not saith he into the way of the gentiles and into any of the cities of the samaritans enter ye not but go rather to the lost sheep of the house of israel matt x 5 6 chap xxiii 37 but go rather to them for they were in the most fearful plight  these therefore must have the cream of the gospel namely the first offer thereof in his lifetime  yea when he departed out of the world he left this as part of his last will with his preachers that they also should offer it first to jerusalem  he had a mind a careful mind as it seems to privilege the worst of sinners with the first offer of mercy and to take from among them a people to be the first fruits unto god and to the lamb  the 15th of luke also is famous for this where the lord jesus takes more care as appears there by three parables for the lost sheep lost groat and the prodigal son than for the other sheep the other pence or for the son that said he had never transgressed yea he shows that there is joy in heaven among the angels of god at the repentance of one sinner more than over ninety and nine just persons which need no repentance luke xv  after this manner therefore the mind of christ was set on the salvation of the biggest sinners in his lifetime  but join to this this clause which he carefully put into the apostles commission to preach when he departed hence to the father and then you shall see that his heart was vehemently set upon it for these were part of his last words with them preach my gospel to all nations but see that you begin at jerusalem  nor did the apostles overlook this clause when their lord was gone into heaven  they went first to them of jerusalem and preached christs gospel to them  they abode also there for a season and time and preached it to no body else for they had regard to the commandment of their lord  and it is to be observed namely that the first sermon which they preached after the ascension of christ it was preached to the very worst of these jerusalem sinners even to these that were the murderers of jesus christ acts ii 23 for these are part of the sermon  ye took him and by wicked hands have crucified and slain him  yea the next sermon and the next and also the next to that was preached to the selfsame murderers to the end they might be saved acts iii 1416 chap iv 10 11 chap v 30 chap vii 52  but we will return to the first sermon that was preached to these jerusalem sinners by which will be manifest more than great grace if it be duly considered  for after that peter and the rest of the apostles had in their exhortation persuaded these wretches to believe that they had killed the prince of life and after they had duly fallen under the guilt of their murder saying men and brethren what shall we do he replies by an universal tender to them all in general considering them as christs killers that if they were sorry for what they had done and would be baptized for the remission of their sins in his name they should receive the gift of the holy ghost acts ii 37 38  this he said to them all though he knew that they were such sinners yea he said it without the least stick or stop or pause of spirit as to whether he had best to say so or no  nay so far off was peter from making an objection against one of them that by a particular clause in his exhortation he endeavours that not one of them may escape the salvation offered  repent saith he and be baptized every one of you  i shut out never a one of you for i am commanded by my lord to deal with you as it were one by one by the word of his salvation  but why speaks he so particularly  oh there were reasons for it  the people with whom the apostles were now to deal as they were murderers of our lord and to be charged in the general with his blood so they had their various and particular acts of villany in the guilt thereof now lying upon their consciences  and the guilt of these their various and particular acts of wickedness could not perhaps be reached to a removal thereof but by this particular application  repent every one of you be baptized every one of you in his name for the remission of sins and you shall every one of you receive the gift of the holy ghost  object  but i was one of them that plotted to take away his life may i be saved by him  peter  every one of you  object  but i was one of them that bare false witness against him is there grace for me  peter  for every one of you  object  but i was one of them that cried out crucify him crucify him and desired that barabbas the murderer might live rather than him  what will become of me think you  peter  i am to preach repentance and remission of sins to every one of you says peter  object  but i was one of them that did spit in his face when he stood before his accusers  i also was one that mocked him when in anguish he hanged bleeding on the tree  is there room for me  peter  for every one of you says peter  object  but i was one of them that in his extremity said give him gall and vinegar to drink  why may not i expect the same when anguish and guilt is upon me  peter  repent of these your wickednesses and here is remission of sins for every one of you  object  but i railed on him i reviled him i hated him i rejoiced to see him mocked at by others  can there be hopes for me  peter  there is for every one of you  repent and be baptised every one of you in the name of jesus christ for the remission of sins and ye shall receive the gift of the holy ghost  oh what a blessed every one of you is here  how willing was peter and the lord jesus by his ministry to catch these murderers with the word of the gospel that they might be made monuments of the grace of god  how unwilling i say was he that any of these should escape the hand of mercy  yea what an amazing wonder it is to think that above all the world and above every body in it these should have the first offer of mercy  beginning at jerusalem  but was there not something of moment in this clause of the commission  did not peter think you see a great deal in it that he should thus begin with these men and thus offer so particularly this grace to each particular man of them  but as i told you this is not all these jerusalem sinners must have this offer again and again every one of them must be offered it over and over  christ would not take their first rejection for a denial nor their second repulse for a denial but he will have grace offered once and twice and thrice to these jerusalem sinners  is not this amazing grace  christ will not be put off  these are the sinners that are sinners indeed  they are sinners of the biggest sort consequently such as christ can if they convert and be saved best serve his ends and designs upon  of which more anon  but what a pitch of grace is this  christ is minded to amaze the world and to shew that he acteth not like the children of men this is that which he said of old  i will not execute the fierceness of my wrath i will not return to destroy ephraim for i am god and not man hos xi 9  this is not the manner of men men are shorter winded men are soon moved to take vengeance and to right themselves in a way of wrath and indignation  but god is full of grace full of patience ready to forgive and one that delights in mercy  all this is seen in our text  the biggest sinners must first be offered mercy they must i say have the cream of the gospel offered unto them  but we will a little proceed  in the third chapter we find that they who escaped converting by the first sermon are called upon again to accept of grace and forgiveness for their murder committed upon the son of god  you have killed yea you have denied the holy one and the just and desired a murderer to be granted unto you and killed the prince of life  mark he falls again upon the very men that actually were as you have it in the chapters following his very betrayers and murderers acts iii 14 15 as being loath that they should escape the mercy of forgiveness and exhorts them again to repent that their sins might be blotted out verses 19 20  again in the fourth chapter he charges them afresh with this murder ver 10 but withal tells them salvation is in no other then like a heavenly decoy he puts himself also among them to draw them the better under the net of the gospel saying there is none other name under heaven given among men whereby we must be saved ver 12  in the fifth chapter you find them railing at him because he continued preaching among them salvation in the name of jesus  but he tells them that that very jesus whom they had slain and hanged on a tree him god had raised up and exalted to be a prince and a saviour to give repentance to israel and forgiveness of sins  ver 2931  still insinuating that though they had killed him and to this day rejected him yet his business was to bestow upon them repentance and forgiveness of sins  tis true after they began to kill again and when nothing but killing would serve their turn then they that were scattered abroad went every where preaching the word  yet even some of them so hankered after the conversion of the jews that they preached the gospel only to them  also the apostles still made their abode at jerusalem in hopes that they might yet let down their net for another draught of these jerusalem sinners  neither did paul and barnabas who were the ministers of god to the gentiles but offer the gospel in the first place to those of them that for their wickedness were scattered like vagabonds among the nations yea and when they rendered rebellion and blasphemy for their service and love they replied it was necessary that the word of god should first have been spoken to them acts i 8 chap xiii 46 47  nor was this their preaching unsuccessful among these people  but the lord jesus so wrought with the word thus spoken that thousands of them came flocking to him for mercy  three thousand of them closed with him at the first and afterwards two thousand more for now they were in number about five thousand whereas before sermons were preached to these murderers the number of the disciples was not above a hundred and twenty acts i 15 chap ii 41 chap iv 4  also among these people that thus flocked to him for mercy there was a great company of the priests chap vi 7  now the priests were they that were the greatest of these biggest sinners they were the ringleaders they were the inventors and ringleaders in the mischief it was they that set the people against the lord jesus and that were the cause why the uproar increased until pilate had given sentence upon him  the chief priests and elders says the text persuaded the people the multitude that they should ask barabbas and destroy jesus matt xxvii 20  and yet behold the priests yea a great company of the priests became obedient to the faith  oh the greatness of the grace of christ that he should be thus in love with the souls of jerusalem sinners that he should be thus delighted with the salvation of the jerusalem sinners that he should not only will that his gospel should be offered them but that it should be offered unto them first and before other sinners were admitted to a hearing of it  begin at jerusalem  were this doctrine well believed where would there be a place for a doubt or a fear of the damnation of the soul if the sinner be penitent how bad a life soever he has lived how many soever in number are his sins  but this grace is hid from the eyes of men the devil hides it from them for he knows it is alluring he knows it has an attracting virtue in it  for this is it that above all arguments can draw the soul to god  i cannot help it but must let drop another word  the first church the jerusalem church from whence the gospel was to be sent into all the world was a church made up of jerusalem sinners  these great sinners were here the most shining monuments of the exceeding grace of god  thus you see i have proved the doctrine and that not only by showing you that this was the practice of the lord jesus christ in his lifetime but his last will when he went up to god saying begin to preach at jerusalem  yea it is yet further manifested in that when his ministers first began to preach there he joined his power to the word to the converting of thousands of his betrayers and murderers and also many of the ringleading priests to the faith  i shall now proceed and shall show you  1  the reasons of the point  2  and then make some application of the whole  the observation you know is this  jesus christ would have mercy offered in the first place to the biggest sinners to the jerusalem sinners  preach repentance and remission of sins in my name among all nations beginning at jerusalem  the reasons of the point are  first because the biggest sinners have most need thereof  he that has most need reason says should be helped first  i mean when a helping hand is offered and now it is  for the gospel of the grace of god is sent to help the world acts xvi 9  but the biggest sinner has most need  therefore in reason when mercy is sent down from heaven to men the worst of men should have the first offer of it  begin at jerusalem  this is the reason which the lord christ himself renders why in his lifetime he left the best and turned him to the worst why he sat so loose from the righteous and stuck so close to the wicked  the whole saith he have no need of the physician but the sick  i came not to call the righteous but sinners to repentance mark ii 1547  above you read that the scribes and pharisees said to his disciples how is it that he eateth and drinketh with publicans and sinners alas they did not know the reason  but the lord renders them one and such an one as is both natural and cogent saying these have need most need  their great necessity requires that i should be most friendly and show my grace first to them  not that the other were sinless and so had no need of a saviour but the publicans and their companions were the biggest sinners they were as to view worse than the scribes and therefore in reason should be helped first because they had most need of a saviour  men that are at the point to die have more need of the physician than they that are but now and then troubled with an heartfainting qualm the publicans and sinners were as it were in the mouth of death death was swallowing of them down  and therefore the lord jesus receives them first offers them mercy first  the whole have no need of the physician but the sick  i came not to call the righteous but sinners to repentance  the sick as i said is the biggest sinner whether he sees his disease or not  he is stained from head to foot from heart to life and conversation  this man in every mans judgment has the most need of mercy  there is nothing attends him from bed to board and from board to bed again but the visible characters and obvious symptoms of eternal damnation  this therefore is the man that has need most need and therefore in reason should be helped in the first place  thus it was with the people concerned in the text they were the worst of sinners jerusalem sinners sinners of the biggest size and therefore such as had the greatest need wherefore they must have mercy offered to them before it be offered any where else in the world  begin at jerusalem offer mercy first to a jerusalem sinner  this man has most need he is farthest from god nearest to hell and so one that has most need  this mans sins are in number the most in cry the loudest in weight the heaviest and consequently will sink him soonest  wherefore he has most need of mercy  this man is shut up in satans hand fastest bound in the cords of his sins  one that justice is whetting his sword to cut off and therefore has most need not only of mercy but that it should be extended to him in the first place  but a little further to show you the true nature of this reason to wit that jesus christ would have mercy offered in the first place to the biggest sinners  first mercy ariseth from the bowels and compassion from pity and from a feeling of the condition of those in misery  in his love and in his pity he saveth us  and again the lord is pitiful very pitiful and of great mercy isa lxiii 9 james v 11  now where pity and compassion is there is yearning of bowels and where there is that there is a readiness to help  and i say again the more deplorable and dreadful the condition is the more directly doth bowels and compassion turn themselves to such and offer help and deliverance  all this flows from our first scripture proof i came to call them that have need to call them first while the rest look on and murmur  how shall i give thee up ephraim  ephraim was a revolter from god a man that had given himself up to devilism  a company of men the ten tribes that worshipped devils while judah kept with his god  but how shall i give thee up ephraim  how shall i deliver thee israel  how shall i make thee as admah  how shall i set thee as zeboim and yet thou art worse than they  nor has samaria committed half thy sins ezek xvi 4651  my heart is turned within me and my repentings are kindled together hos xi 8  but where do you find that ever the lord did thus yearn in his bowels for and after any selfrighteous man  no no they are the publicans and harlots idolaters and jerusalem sinners for whom his bowels thus yearn and tumble about within him  for alas poor worms they have most need of mercy  had not the good samaritan more compassion for that man that fell among thieves though that fall was occasioned by his going from the place where they worshipped god to jericho the cursed city than we read he had for any other besides  his wine was for him his oil was for him his beast for him his penny his care and his swaddling bands for him for alas wretch he had most need luke x 3035  zaccheus the publican the chief of the publicans one that had made himself the richer by wronging of others the lord at that time singled him out from all the rest of his brother publicans and that in the face of many pharisees and proclaimed in the audience of them all that that day salvation was come to his house luke xix 18  the woman also that had been bound down by satan for eighteen years together his compassions putting him upon it he loosed her though those that stood by snarled at him for so doing luke xiii 1113  and why the woman of sarepta and why naaman the syrian rather than widows and lepers in israel but because their conditions were more deplorable for that they were most forlorn and farthest from help luke iv 25 27  but i say why all these thus named why have we not a catalogue of some holy men that were so in their own eyes and in the judgment of the world  alas if at any time any of them are mentioned how seemingly coldly doth the record of scripture present them to us nicodemus a night professor and simon the pharisee with his fifty pence and their great ignorance of the methods of grace we have now and then touched upon  mercy seems to be out of his proper channel when it deals with self righteous men but then it runs with a full stream when it extends itself to the biggest sinners  as gods mercy is not regulated by mans goodness nor obtained by mans worthiness so not much set out by saving of any such  but more of this anon  and here let me ask my reader a question  suppose that as thou art walking by some pond side thou shouldst espy in it four or five children all in danger of drowning and one in more danger than all the rest judge which has most need to be helped out first  i know thou wilt say he that is nearest drowning  why this is the case the bigger sinner the nearer drowning therefore the bigger sinner the more need of mercy yea of help by mercy in the first place and to this our text agrees when it saith beginning at jerusalem let the jerusalem sinner says christ have the first offer the first invitation the first tender of my grace and mercy for he is the biggest sinner and so has most need thereof  secondly christ jesus would have mercy offered in the first place to the biggest sinners because when they any of them receive it it redounds most to the fame of his name  christ jesus as you may perceive has put himself under the term of a physician a doctor for curing of diseases  and you know that applause and fame are things that physicians much desire  that is it that helps them to patients and that also that will help their patients to commit themselves to their skill for cure with the more confidence and repose of spirit  and the best way for a doctor or physician to get himself a name is in the first place to take in hand and cure some such as all others have given off for lost and dead  physicians get neither name nor fame by pricking of wheals or pricking out thistles or by laying of plaisters to the scratch of a pin every old woman can do this  but if they would have a name and a fame if they will have it quickly they must as i said do some great and desperate cures  let them fetch one to life that was dead let them recover one to his wits that was mad let them make one that was born blind to see or let them give ripe wits to a fool these are notable cures and he that can do thus and if he doth thus first he shall have the name and fame he desires he may lie abed till noon  why christ jesus forgiveth sins for a name and so begets of himself a good report in the hearts of the children of men  and therefore in reason he must be willing as also he did command that his mercy should be offered first to the biggest sinners  i will forgive their sins iniquities and transgressions says he and it shall turn to me for a name of joy and a praise and an honour before all the nations of the earth jer xxxiii 8 9  and hence it is that at his first appearing he took upon him to do such mighty works  he got a fame thereby he got a name thereby matt iv 23 24  when christ had cast the legion of devils out of the man of whom you read mark v he bid him go home to his friends and tell it  go home saith he to thy friends and tell them how great things god has done for thee and has had compassion on thee mark v 19 christ jesus seeks a name and desireth a fame in the world and therefore or the better to obtain that he commands that mercy should first be proffered to the biggest sinners because by the saving of one of them he makes all men marvel  as tis said of the man last mentioned whom christ cured towards the beginning of his ministry  and he departed says the text and began to publish in decapolis how great things jesus had done for him and all men did marvel ver 20  when john told christ that they saw one casting out devils in his name and they forbade him because he followed not with them what is the answer of christ  forbid him not  for there is no man which shall do a miracle in my name that can lightly speak evil of me no they will rather cause his praise to be heard and his name to be magnified and so put glory on the head of christ  but we will follow a little our metaphor  christ as i said has put himself under the term of a physician consequently he desireth that his fame as to the salvation of sinners may spread abroad and that the world may see what he can do  and to this end he has not only commanded that the biggest sinners should have the first offer of his mercy but has as physicians do put out his bills and published his doings that things may be read and talked of  yea he has moreover in these his blessed bills the holy scriptures i mean inserted the very names of persons the places of their abode and the great cures that by the means of his salvations he has wrought upon them to this very end  here is item such a one by my grace and redeeming blood was made a monument of everlasting life and such a one by my perfect obedience became an heir of glory  and then he produceth their names  item i saved lot from the guilt and damnation that he had procured to himself by his incest  item i saved david from the vengeance that belonged to him for committing of adultery and murder  here is also solomon manasseh peter magdalen and many others made mention of in this book  yea here are their names their sins and their salvations recorded together that you may read and know what a saviour he is and do him honour in the world  for why are these things thus recorded but to show to sinners what he can do to the praise and glory of his grace  and it is observable as i said before we have but very little of the salvation of little sinners mentioned in gods book because that would not have answered the design to wit to bring glory and fame to the name of the son of god  what should be the reason think you why christ should so easily take a denial of the great ones that were the grandeur of the world and struggle so hard for hedgecreepers and highwaymen as that parable luke xiv seems to import he doth but to show forth the riches of the glory of his grace to his praise  this i say is one reason to be sure  they that had their grounds their yoke of oxen and their marriage joys were invited to come but they made their excuse and that served the turn  but when he comes to deal with the worst he saith to his servants go ye out and bring them in hither  go out quickly and bring in hither the poor the maimed the halt and the blind  and they did so  and he said again go out into the highways and hedges and compel them to come in that my house may be filled luke xiv 18 19 23  these poor lame maimed blind hedgecreepers and highwaymen must come in must be forced in these if saved will make his merits shine  when christ was crucified and hanged up between the earth and heavens there were two thieves crucified with him and behold he lays hold of one of them and will have him away with him to glory was not this a strange act and a display of unthought of grace were there none but thieves there or were the rest of that company out of his reach  could he not think you have stooped from the cross to the ground and have laid hold on some honester man if he would  yes doubtless  oh but then he would not have displayed his grace nor so have pursued his own designs namely to get to himself a praise and a name  but now he has done it to purpose  for who that shall read this story but must confess that the son of god is full of grace for a proof of the riches thereof he left behind him when upon the cross he took the thief away with him to glory  nor can this one act of his be buried it will be talked of to the end of the world to his praise  men shall speak of the might of thy terrible acts and will declare thy greatness they shall abundantly utter the memory of thy great goodness and shall sing of thy righteousness  they shall speak of the glory of thy kingdom and talk of thy power to make known to the sons of men his mighty acts and the glorious majesty of his kingdom psalm cxlv 612  when the word of god came among the conjurers and those soothsayers that you read of acts xix and had prevailed with some of them to accept of the grace of christ the holy ghost records it with a boast for that it would redound to his praise saying and many of them that used curious arts brought their books together and burned them before all men  and counted the price of them and found it fifty thousand pieces of silver  so mightily grew the word of god and prevailed acts xix 19 20  it wrenched out of the clutches of satan some of those of whom he thought himself most sure  so mightily grew the word of god  it grew mightily it encroached upon the kingdom of the devil  it pursued him and took the prey it forced him to let go his hold  it brought away captive as prisoners taken by force of arms some of the most valiant of his army  it fetched back from as it were the confines of hell some of those that were his most trusty and that with hell had been at an agreement  it made them come and confess their deeds and burn their books before all men  so mightily grew the word of god and prevailed  thus therefore you see why christ will have mercy offered in the first place to the biggest sinners they have most need thereof and this is the most ready way to extol his name that rideth upon the heavens to our help  but  thirdly christ jesus would have mercy offered in the first place to the biggest sinners because by their forgiveness and salvation others hearing of it will be encouraged the more to come to him for life  for the physician by curing the most desperate at the first doth not only get himself a name but begets encouragement in the minds of other diseased folk to come to him for help  hence you read of our lord that after through his tender mercy he had cured many of great diseases his fame was spread abroad they brought unto him all sick people that were taken with divers diseases and torments and those which were possessed with devils and those which were lunatic and those that had the palsy and he healed them  and there followed him great multitudes of people from galilee and decapolis and jerusalem and judea and from beyond jordan matt iv 24 25  see here he first by working gets himself a fame a name and renown and now men take encouragement and bring from all quarters their diseased to him being helped by what they had heard to believe that their diseased should be healed  now as he did with those outward cures so he does in the proffers of his grace and mercy  he proffers that in the first place to the biggest sinners that others may take heart to come to him to be saved  i will give you a scripture or two i mean to show you that christ by commanding that his mercy should in the first place be offered to the biggest of sinners has a design thereby to encourage and provoke others to come also to him for mercy  god saith paul who is rich in mercy for his great love wherewith he loved us even when we were dead in sins hath quickened us together with christ by grace ye are saved and hath raised us up together and made us sit together in heavenly places in christ jesus  but why did he do all this  that in the ages to come he might shew the exceeding riches of his grace in his kindness towards us through christ jesus eph ii 47  see here is a design god lets out his mercy to ephesus of design even to shew to the ages to come the exceeding riches of his grace in his kindness to them through christ jesus  and why to shew by these the exceeding riches of his grace to the ages to come through christ jesus but to allure them and their children also to come to him and to partake of the same grace through christ jesus  but what was paul and the ephesian sinners of paul we will speak anon  these ephesian sinners they were men dead in sins men that walked according to the dictates and motions of the devil worshippers of diana that effeminate goddess men far off from god aliens and strangers to all good things such as were far off from that as i said and consequently in a most deplorable condition  as the jerusalem sinners were of the highest sort among the jews so these ephesian sinners were of the highest sort among the gentiles eph ii 13 11 12 acts xix 35  wherefore as by the jerusalem sinners in saving them first he had a design to provoke others to come to him for mercy so the same design is here set on foot again in his calling and converting the ephesian sinners that in the ages to come he might shew the exceeding riches of his grace says he in his kindness towards us through christ jesus  there is yet one hint behind  it is said that god saved these for his love that is as i think for the setting forth for the commendations of his love for the advance of his love in the hearts and minds of them that should come after  as who should say god has had mercy upon and been gracious to you that he might shew to others for their encouragement that they have ground to come to him to be saved  when god saves one great sinner it is to encourage another great sinner to come to him for mercy  he saved the thief to encourage thieves to come to him for mercy he saved magdalen to encourage other magdalens to come to him for mercy he saved saul to encourage sauls to come to him for mercy and this paul himself doth say for this cause saith he i obtained mercy that in me first jesus christ might shew forth all longsuffering for a pattern to them which should hereafter believe on him to life everlasting 1 tim i 16  how plain are the words  christ in saving of me has given to the world a pattern of his grace that they might see and believe and come and be saved that they that are to be born hereafter might believe on jesus christ to life everlasting  but what was paul  why he tells you himself i am says he the chief of sinners  i was says he a blaspheme a persecutor an injurious person but i obtained mercy 1 tim i 14 15  ay that is well for you paul but what advantage have we thereby  oh very much saith he for for this cause i obtained mercy that in me first jesus christ might shew all longsuffering for a pattern to them which shall believe on him to life everlasting  thus therefore you see that this third reason is of strength namely that jesus christ would have mercy offered in the first place to the biggest sinners because by their forgiveness and salvation others hearing of it will be encouraged the more to come to him for mercy  it may well therefore be said to god thou delightest in mercy and mercy pleases thee mich vii 18  but who believes that this was gods design in shewing mercy of old namely that we that come after might take courage to come to him for mercy or that jesus christ would have mercy offered in the first place to the biggest sinners to stir up others to come to him for life  this is not the manner of men o god  but david saw this betimes therefore he makes this one argument with god that he would blot out his transgressions that he would forgive his adultery his murders and horrible hypocrisy  do it o lord saith he do it and then will i teach transgressors thy ways and sinners shall be converted unto thee psalm li 713  he knew that the conversion of sinners would be a work highly pleasing to god as being that which he had designed before he made mountain or hill  wherefore he comes and he saith save me o lord if thou wilt but save me i will fall in with thy design i will help to bring what sinners to thee i can  and lord i am willing to be made a preacher myself for that i have been a horrible sinner wherefore if thou shalt forgive my great transgressions i shall be a fit man to tell of thy wondrous grace to others  yea lord i dare promise that if thou wilt have mercy upon me it shall tend to the glory of thy grace and also to the increase of thy kingdom for i will tell it and sinners will hear ont  and there is nothing so suiteth with the hearing sinner as mercy and to be informed that god is willing to bestow it upon him  i will teach transgressors thy ways and sinners shall be converted unto thee  nor will christ jesus miss of his design in proffering of mercy in the first place to the biggest sinners  you know what work the lord by laying hold of the woman of samaria made among the people there they knew that she was a town sinner an adulteress yea one that after the most audacious manner lived in uncleanness with a man that was not her husband  but when she from a turn upon her heart went into the city and said to her neighbours come oh how they came how they flocked out of the city to jesus christ  then they went out of the city and came to him  and many of the samaritans people perhaps as bad as herself believed on him for the saying of the woman which testified saying he told me all that ever i did john iv 39  that word he told me all that ever i did was a great argument with them for by that they gathered that though he knew her to be vile yet he did not despise her nor refuse to shew how willing he was to communicate his grace unto her and this fetched over first her then them  this woman as i said was a samaritan sinner a sinner of the worst complexion  for the jews abhorred to have ought to do with them ver 9 wherefore none more fit than she to be made one of the decoys of heaven to bring others of these samaritan wildfowls under the net of the grace of christ  and she did the work to purpose  many and many more of the samaritans believed on him ver 4042  the heart of man though set on sin will when it comes once to a persuasion that god is willing to have mercy upon us incline to come to jesus christ for life  witness those turnaways from god that you also read of in jeremiah for after they had heard three or four times over that god had mercy for backsliders they broke out and said behold we come unto thee for thou art the lord our god  or as those in hosea did for in thee the fatherless find mercy jer iii 22 hos xiv 13  mercy and the revelation thereof is the only antidote against sin it is of a thawing nature it will loose the heart that is frozen up in sin yea it will make the unwilling willing to come to jesus christ for life  wherefore do you think was it that jesus christ told the adulterous woman and that before so many sinners that he had not condemned her but to allure her with them there present to hope to find favour at his hands  as he also saith in another place i came not to judge but to save the world  for might they not thence most rationally conclude that if jesus christ had rather save than damn an harlot there was encouragement for them to come to him for mercy  i heard once a story from a soldier who with his company had laid siege against a fort that so long as the besieged were persuaded their foes would shew them no favour they fought like madmen but when they saw one of their fellows taken and received to favour they all came tumbling down from their fortress and delivered themselves into their enemies hands  i am persuaded did men believe that there is that grace and willingness in the heart of christ to save sinners as the word imports there is they would come tumbling into his arms  but satan has blinded their minds that they cannot see this thing  howbeit the lord jesus has as i said that others might take heart and come to him given out a commandment that mercy should in the first place be offered to the biggest sinners  begin saith he at jerusalem  and thus i end the third reason  fourthly jesus christ would have mercy offered in the first place to the biggest sinners because that is the way if they receive it most to weaken the kingdom of satan and to keep it lowest in every age of the world  the biggest sinners they are satans colonels and captains the leaders of his people and they that most stoutly make head against the son of god  wherefore let these first be conquered and his kingdom will be weak  when ishbosheth had lost his abner his kingdom was made weak  nor did he sit but tottering then upon his throne  so when satan loseth his strong men them that are mighty to work iniquity and dexterous to manage others in the same then is his kingdom weak 2 sam iii  therefore i say christ doth offer mercy in the first place to such the more to weaken his kingdom  christ jesus was glad to see satan fall like lightning from heaven that is suddenly or head long and it was surely by casting of him out of strong possessions and by recovering of some notorious sinners out of his clutches luke x 1719  samson when he would pull down the philistines temple took hold of the two main pillars of it and breaking them down came the house christ came to destroy the works of the devil and to destroy by converting grace as well as by redeeming blood  now sin swarms and lieth by legions and whole armies in the souls of the biggest sinners as in garrisons  wherefore the way the most direct way to destroy it is first to deal with such sinners by the word of his gospel and by the merits of his passion  for example though i shall give you but a homely one  suppose a family to be troubled with vermin and one or two of the family to be in chief the breeders the way the quickest way to clear that family or at least to weaken the so swarming of those vermin is in the first place to sweeten the skin head and clothes of the chief breeders and then though all the family should be apt to breed them the number of them and so the greatness of that plague there will be the more impaired  why there are some people that are in chief the devils sinbreeders in the towns and places where they live  the place town or family where they live must needs be horribly verminous as it were eaten up with vermin  now let the lord jesus in the first place cleanse these great breeders and there will be given a nip to those swarms of sins that used to be committed in such places throughout the town house or family where such sinbreeding persons used to be  i speak by experience  i was one of these verminous ones one of these great sinbreeders i infected all the youth of the town where i was born with all manner of youthful vanities  the neighbours counted me so my practice proved me so  wherefore christ jesus took me first and taking me first the contagion was much allayed all the town over  when god made me sigh they would hearken and enquiringly say what is the matter with john  they also gave their various opinions of me  but as i said sin cooled and failed as to his full career  when i went out to seek the bread of life some of them would follow and the rest be put into a muse at home  yea almost the town at first at times would go out to hear at the place where i found good yea young and old for a while had some reformation on them also some of them perceiving that god had mercy upon me came crying to him for mercy too  but what need i give you an instance of poor i i will come to manasseh the king  so long as he was a ringleading sinner the great idolater the chief for devilism the whole land flowed with wickedness for he made them to sin and do worse than the heathen that dwelt round about them or that was cast out from before them but when god converted him the whole land was reformed  down went the groves the idols and altars of baal and up went true religion in much of the power and purity of it  you will say the king reformed by power  i answer doubtless and by example too for people observe their leaders as their fathers did so did they 2 chron xxxiii 2  this therefore is another reason why jesus would have mercy offered in the first place to the biggest sinners because that is the best way if they receive it most to weaken the kingdom of satan and to keep it poor and low  and do you not think now that if god would but take hold of the hearts of some of the most notorious in your town in your family or country that this thing would be verified before your faces  it would it would to the joy of you that are godly to the making of hell to sigh to the great suppressing of sin the glory of christ and the joy of the angels of god  and ministers should therefore that this work might go on take advantages to persuade with the biggest sinners to come into christ according to my text and their commissions beginning at jerusalem  fifthly jesus christ would have mercy offered in the first place to the biggest sinners because such when converted are usually the best helps in the church against temptations and fittest for the support of the feebleminded there  hence usually you have some such in the first plantation of churches or quickly upon it churches would do but sorrily if christ jesus did not put such converts among them  they are the monuments and mirrors of mercy the very sight of such a sinner in gods house yea the very thought of him where the sight of him cannot be had is ofttimes greatly for the help of the faith of the feeble  when the churches said paul that were in judea heard this concerning me that he which persecuted them in time past now preached the faith which once he destroyed they glorified god in me gal i 2024  glorified god  how is that  why they praised him and took courage to believe the more in the mercy of god for that he had had mercy on such a great sinner as he  they glorified god in me they wondered that grace should be so rich as to take hold of such a wretch as i was and for my sake believed in christ the more  there are two things that great sinners are acquainted with when they come to divulge them to the saints that are a great relief to their faith  1  the contests that they usually have with the devil at their parting with him  2  their knowledge of his secrets in his workings  for the first the biggest sinners have usually great contests with the devil at their partings and this is an help to saints  for ordinary saints find afterwards what the vile ones find at first but when at the opening of hearts the one finds himself to be as the other the one is a comfort to the other  the lesser sort of sinners find but little of this till after they have been some time in profession but the vile man meets with his at the beginning wherefore he when the other is down is ready to tell that he has met with the same before for i say he has had it before  satan is loath to part with a great sinner  what my true servant quoth he my old servant wilt thou forsake me now having so often sold thyself to me to work wickedness wilt thou forsake me now  thou horrible wretch dost not know that thou hast sinned thyself beyond the reach of grace and dost think to find mercy now  art not thou a murderer a thief a harlot a witch a sinner of the greatest size and dost thou look for mercy now  dost thou think that christ will foul his fingers with thee  tis enough to make angels blush saith satan to see so vile a one knock at heavengates for mercy and wilt thou be so abominably bold to do it  thus satan dealt with me says the great sinner when at first i came to jesus christ  and what did you reply saith the tempted  why i granted the whole charge to be true says the other and what did you despair or how  no saith he i said i am magdalen i am zaccheus i am the thief i am the harlot i am the publican i am the prodigal and one of christs murderers  yea worse than any of these and yet god was so far off from rejecting of me as i found afterwards that there was music and dancing in his house for me and for joy that i was come home unto him  o blessed be god for grace says the other for then i hope there is favour for me  yea as i told you such a one is a continual spectacle in the church for every one to behold gods grace and wonder by  secondly and as for the secrets of satan such as are suggestions to question the being of god the truth of his word and to be annoyed with devilish blasphemies none more acquainted with these than the biggest sinners at their conversion wherefore thus also they are prepared to be helps in the church to relieve and comfort the other  i might also here tell you of the contests and battles that such are engaged in wherein they find the besettings of satan above any other of the saints  at which times satan assaults the soul with darkness fears frightful thoughts of apparitions now they sweat pant cry out and struggle for life  the angels now come down to behold the sight and rejoice to see a bit of dust and ashes to overcome principalities and powers and might and dominions  but as i said when these come a little to be settled they are prepared for helping others and are great comforts unto them  their great sins give great encouragement to the devil to assault them and by these temptations christ takes advantage to make them the more helpful to the churches  the biggest sinner when he is converted and comes into the church says to them all by his very coming in behold me all you that are men and women of a low and timorous spirit you whose hearts are narrow for that you never had the advantage to know because your sins are few the largeness of the grace of god  behold i say in me the exceeding riches of his grace  i am a pattern set forth before your faces on whom you may look and take heart  this i say the great sinner can say to the exceeding comfort of all the rest  wherefore as i have hinted before when god intends to stock a place with saints and to make that place excellently to flourish with the riches of his grace he usually begins with the conversion of some of the most notorious thereabouts and lays them as an example to allure others and to build up when they are converted  it was paul that must go to the gentiles because paul was the most outrageous of all the apostles in the time of his unregeneracy yea peter must be he that after his horrible fall was thought fittest when recovered again to comfort and strengthen his brethren  see luke xxii 31 32  some must be pillars in gods house and if they be pillars of cedar they must stand while they are stout and sturdy sticks in the forest before they are cut down and planted or placed there  no man when he buildeth his house makes the principal parts thereof of weak or feeble timber for how could such bear up the rest but of great and able wood  christ jesus also goeth this way to work he makes of the biggest sinners bearers and supporters to the rest this then may serve for another reason why jesus christ gives out in commandment that mercy should in the first place be offered to the biggest sinners  because such when converted are usually the best helps in the church against temptations and fittest for the support of the feebleminded there  sixthly another reason why jesus christ would have mercy offered in the first place to the biggest sinners is because they when converted are apt to love him most  this agrees both with scripture and reason  scripture says so  to whom much is forgiven the same loveth much  to whom little is forgiven the same loveth little luke vii 47  reason says so for as it would be the unreasonablest thing in the world to render hatred for love and contempt for forgiveness so it would be as ridiculous to think that the reception of a little kindness should lay the same obligations upon the heart to love as the reception of a great deal  i would not disparage the love of christ i know the least drachm of it when it reaches to forgiveness is great above all the world but comparatively there are greater extensions of the love of christ to one than to another  he that has most sin if forgiven is partaker of the greatest love of the greatest forgiveness  i know also that there are some that from this very doctrine say let us do evil that good may come and that turn the grace of our god into lasciviousness  but i speak not of these these will neither be ruled by grace nor reason  grace would teach them if they know it to deny ungodly courses and so would reason too if it could truly sense the love of god titus ii 11 12 rom xi 1  doth it look like what hath any coherence with reason or mercy for a man to abuse his friend  because christ died for men shall i therefore spit in his face  the bread and water that was given by elisha to his enemies that came into the land of israel to take him had so much influence upon their minds though heathens that they returned to their homes without hurting him  yea it kept them from coming again in a hostile manner into the coasts of israel 2 kings vi 1923  but to forbear to illustrate till anon  one reason why christ jesus shews mercy to sinners is that he might obtain their love that he may remove their base affections from base objects to himself  now if he loves to be loved a little he loves to be loved much but there is not any that are capable of loving much save those that have much forgiven them  hence it is said of paul that he laboured more than them all to wit with a labour of love because he had been by sin more vile against christ than they all 1 cor xv  he it was that persecuted the church of god and wasted it gal i 13  he of them all was the only raving bedlam against the saints  and being exceeding mad says he against them i persecuted them even to strange cities acts xxvi 11  this raving bedlam that once was so is he that now says i laboured more than them all more for christ than them all  but paul what moved thee thus to do  the love of christ says he it was not i but the grace of god that was with me  as who should say o grace  it was such grace to save me  it was such marvellous grace for god to look down from heaven upon me and that secured me from the wrath to come that i am captivated with the sense of the riches of it  hence i act hence i labour for how can i otherwise do since god not only separated me from my sins and companions but separated all the powers of my soul and body to his service  i am therefore prompted on by this exceeding love to labour as i have done yet not i but the grace of god with me  oh  i shall never forget his love nor the circumstances under which i was when his love laid hold upon me  i was going to damascus with letters from the highpriest to make havock of gods people there as i had made havock of them in other places  these bloody letters were not imposed upon me  i went to the highpriest and desired them of him acts ix 1 2 and yet he saved me  i was one of the men of the chief men that had a hand in the blood of his martyr stephen yet he had mercy on me  when i was at damascus i stunk so horribly like a bloodsucker that i became a terror to all thereabout  yea ananias good man made intercession to my lord against me yet he would have mercy upon me yea joined mercy to mercy until he had made me a monument of grace  he made a saint of me and persuaded me that my transgressions were forgiven me  when i began to preach those that heard me were amazed and said is not this he that destroyed them that called on this name in jerusalem and came hither for that intent that he might bring them bound to the highpriest  hell doth know that i was a sinner heaven doth know that i was a sinner the world also knows that i was a sinner a sinner of the greatest size but i obtained mercy 1 tim i 15 16  shall not this lay obligation upon me  is not love of the greatest force to oblige  is it not strong as death cruel as the grave and hotter than the coals of juniper  hath it not a most vehement flame can the waters quench it can the floods drown it  i am under the force of it and this is my continual cry what shall i render to the lord for all the benefits which he has bestowed upon me  ay paul this is something thou speakest like a man like a man affected and carried away with the love and grace of god  now this sense and this affection and this labour giveth to christ the love that he looks for  but he might have converted twenty little sinners and yet not found for grace bestowed so much love in them all  i wonder how far a man might go among the converted sinners of the smaller size before one could find one that so much as looked any thing this wayward  where is he that is thus under pangs of love for the grace bestowed upon him by jesus christ  excepting only some few you may walk to the worlds end and find none  but as i said some there are and so there has been in every age of the church great sinners that have had much forgiven them and they love much upon this account  jesus christ therefore knows what he doth when he lays hold on the hearts of sinners of the biggest size  he knows that such an one will love more than many that have not sinned half their sins  i will tell you a story that i have read of martha and mary the name of the book i have forgot i mean of the book in which i found the relation but the thing was thus  martha saith my author was a very holy woman much like lazarus her brother but mary was a loose and wanton creature martha did seldom miss good sermons and lectures when she could come at them in jerusalem but mary would frequent the house of sports and the company of the vilest of men for lust  and though martha had often desired that her sister would go with her to hear her preachers yea had often entreated her with tears to do it yet could she never prevail for still mary would make her excuse or reject her with disdain for her zeal and preciseness in religion  after martha had waited long tried many ways to bring her sister to good and all proved ineffectual at last she comes upon her thus sister quoth she i pray thee go with me to the temple today to hear one preach a sermon  what kind of preacher is he said she martha replied it is one jesus of nazareth he is the handsomest man that ever you saw with your eyes  oh he shines in beauty and is a most excellent preacher  now what does mary after a little pause but goes up into her chamber and with her pins and her clouts decks up herself as fine as her fingers could make her  this done away she goes not with her sister martha but as much unobserved as she could to the sermon or rather to see the preacher  the hour and preacher being come and she having observed whereabout the preacher would stand goes and sets herself so in the temple that she might be sure to have the full view of this excellent person  so he comes in and she looks and the first glimpse of his person pleased her  well jesus addresseth himself to his sermon and she looks earnestly on him  now at that time saith my author jesus preached about the lost sheep the lost groat and the prodigal child  and when he came to shew what care the shepherd took for one lost sheep and how the woman swept to find her piece which was lost and what joy there was at their finding she began to be taken by the ears and forgot what she came about musing what the preacher would make of it  but when he came to the application and shewed that by the lost sheep was meant a great sinner by the shepherds care was meant gods love for great sinners and that by the joy of the neighbours was shewed what joy there was among the angels in heaven over one great sinner that repenteth she began to be taken by the heart  and as he spake these last words she thought he pitched his innocent eyes just upon her and looked as if he spake what was now said to her  wherefore her heart began to tremble being shaken with affection and fear then her eyes ran down with tears apace wherefore she was forced to hide her face with her handkerchief and so sat sobbing and crying all the rest of the sermon  sermon being done up she gets and away she goes and withal inquired where this jesus the preacher dined that day and one told her at the house of simon the pharisee  so away goes she first to her chamber and there strips herself of her wanton attire  then falls upon her knees to ask god forgiveness for all her wicked life this done in a modest dress she goes to simons house where she finds jesus sat at dinner  so she gets behind him and weeps and drops her tears upon his feet like rain and washes them and wipes them with the hair of her head  she also kissed his feet with her lips and anointed them with ointment  when simon the pharisee perceived what the woman did and being ignorant of what it was to be forgiven much for he never was forgiven more than fifty pence he began to think within himself that he had been mistaken about jesus christ because he suffered such a sinner as this woman was to touch him  surely quoth he this man if he were a prophet would not let this woman come near him for she is a townsinner so ignorant are all selfrighteous men of the way of christ with sinners  but lest mary should be discouraged with some clownish carriage of this pharisee and so desert her good beginnings and her new steps which she now had begun to take towards eternal life jesus began thus with simon  simon saith he i have somewhat to say unto thee  and he saith master say on  there was said jesus a certain creditor had two debtors the one owed five hundred pence and the other fifty  and when they had nothing to pay he frankly forgave them both  tell me therefore which of them will love him most  simon answered and said i suppose that he to whom he forgave most  and he said unto him thou hast rightly judged  and he turned to the woman and said unto simon seest thou this woman  i entered into thy house thou gavest me no water for my feet but she hath washed my feet with tears and wiped them with the hairs of her head  thou gavest me no kiss  but this woman since the time i came in hath not ceased to kiss my feet  my head with oil thou didst not anoint but this woman hath anointed my feet with ointment  wherefore i say unto thee her sins which are many are forgiven for she loved much but to whom little is forgiven the same loveth little  and he said unto her thy sins are forgiven luke vii 3650  thus you have the story  if i come short in any circumstance i beg pardon of those that can correct me  it is three or four and twenty years since i saw the book  yet i have as far as my memory will admit given you the relation of the matter  however luke as you see doth here present you with the substance of the whole  alas  christ jesus has but little thanks for the saving of little sinners  to whom little is forgiven the same loveth little  he gets not water for his feet by his saving of such sinners  there are abundance of dryeyed christians in the world and abundance of dryeyed duties too duties that never were wetted with the tears of contrition and repentance nor ever sweetened with the great sinners box of ointment  and the reason is such sinners have not great sins to be saved from or if they have they look upon them in the diminishing glass of the holy law of god  but i rather believe that the professors of our days want a due sense of what they are for verily for the generality of them both before and since conversion they have been sinners of a lusty size  but if their eyes be holden if convictions are not shewn if their knowledge of their sins is but like to the eyesight in twilight the heart cannot be affected with that grace that has laid hold on the man and so christ jesus sows much and has little coming in  wherefore his way is ofttimes to step out of the way to jericho to samaria to the country of the gadarenes to the coasts of tyre and sidon and also to mount calvary that he may lay hold of such kind of sinners as will love him to his liking luke xix 111 john iv 311 mark v 121 matt xv 2129 luke xxiii 3344  but thus much for the sixth reason why christ jesus would have mercy offered in the first place to the biggest sinners to wit because such sinners when converted are apt to love him most  the jerusalem sinners were they that outstripped when they were converted in some things all the churches of the gentiles  they were of one heart and of one soul neither said any of them that aught of the things that they possessed was their own  neither was there any among them that lacked  for as many as were possessors of lands or houses sold them and brought the price of the things that were sold and laid them down at the apostles feet c acts iv 3235  now shew me such another pattern if you can  but why did these do thus  oh they were jerusalem sinners  these were the men that but a little before had killed the prince of life and those to whom he did that notwithstanding send the first offer of grace and mercy  and the sense of this took them up betwixt the earth and the heaven and carried them on in such ways and methods as could never be trodden by any since  they talk of the church of rome and set her in her primitive state as a pattern and mother of churches when the truth is they were the jerusalem sinners when converts that outdid all the churches that ever were  seventhly christ jesus would have mercy offered in the first place to the biggest sinners because grace when it is received by such finds matter to kindle upon more freely than it finds in other sinners  great sinners are like the dry wood or like great candles which burn best and shine with biggest light  i lay not this down as i did those reasons before to shew that when great sinners are converted they will be encouragement to others though that is true but to shew that christ has a delight to see grace the grace we receive to shine  we love to see things that bear a good gloss yea we choose to buy such kind of matter to work upon as will if wrought up to what we intend cast that lustre that we desire  candles that burn not bright we like not  wood that is green will rather smother and sputter and smoke and crack and flounce than cast a brave light and a pleasant heat  wherefore great folks care not much not so much for such kind of things as for them that will better answer their ends  hence christ desires the biggest sinner in him there is matter to work by to wit a great deal of sin for as by the tallow of the candle the fire takes occasion to burn the brighter so by the sin of the soul grace takes occasion to shine the clearer  little candles shine but little for there wanteth matter for the fire to work upon but in the great sinner here is more matter for grace to work by  faith shines when it worketh towards christ through the sides of many and great transgressors and so does love for that much is forgiven  and what matter can be found in the soul for humility to work by so well as by a sight that i have been and am an abominable sinner  and the same is to be said of patience meekness gentleness selfdenial or of any other grace  grace takes occasion by the vileness of the man to shine the more even as by the ruggedness of a very strong distemper or disease the virtue of the medicine is best made manifest  where sin abounds grace much more abounds rom v 20  a black string makes the neck look whiter great sins make grace burn clear  some say when grace and a good nature meet together they do make shining christians  but i say when grace and a great sinner meet and when grace shall subdue that great sinner to itself and shall operate after its kind in the soul of that great sinner then we have a shining christian witness all those of whom mention was made before  abraham was among the idolaters when in the land of assyria and served idols with his kindred on the other side of the flood jos xxiv 2 gen xi 31  but who when called was there in the world in whom grace shone so bright as in him  the thessalonians were idolaters before the word of god came to them but when they had received it they became examples to all that did believe in macedonia and achaia 1 thess i 610  god the father and jesus christ his son are for having things seen for having the word of life held forth  they light not a candle that it might be put under a bushel or under a bed but on a candlestick that all that come in may see the light matt v 15 mark iv 21 luke viii 16 chap xi 33  and i say as i said before in whom is light like so to shine as in the souls of great sinners  when the jewish pharisees dallied with the gospel christ threatened to take it from them and to give it to the barbarous heathens and idolaters  why so  for they saith he will bring forth the fruits thereof in their season  therefore say i unto you the kingdom of god shall be taken from you and given to a nation bringing forth the fruits thereof matt xxi 4143  i have often marvelled at our youth and said in my heart what should be the reason that they should be so generally at this day debauched as they are  for they are now profane to amazement and sometimes i have thought one thing and sometimes another that is why god should suffer it so to be  at last i have thought of this how if the god whose ways are past finding out should suffer it so to be now that he might make of some of them the more glorious saints hereafter  i know sin is of the devil but it cannot work in the world without permission  and if it happens to be as i have thought it will not be the first time that god the lord hath caught satan in his own design  for my part i believe that the time is at hand that we shall see better saints in the world than has been seen in it this many a day  and this vileness that at present does so much swallow up our youth is one cause of my thinking so  for out of them for from among them when god sets to his hand as of old you shall see what penitent ones what trembling ones and what admirers of grace will be found to profess the gospel to the glory of god by christ  alas we are a company of wornout christians our moon is in the wane we are much more black than white more dark than light we shine but a little grace in the most of us is decayed  but i say when they of these debauched ones that are to be saved shall be brought in when these that look more like devils than men shall be converted to christ and i believe several of them will then will christ be exalted grace adored the word prized zions path better trodden and men in the pursuit of their own salvation to the amazement of them that are left behind  just before christ came into the flesh the world was degenerated as it is now  the generality of the men in jerusalem were become either high and famous for hypocrisy or filthy base in their lives the devil also was broke loose in a hideous manner and had taken possession of many  yea i believe that there was never generation before nor since that could produce so many possessed with devils deformed lame blind and infected with monstrous diseases as that generation could  but what was the reason thereof i mean the reason from god  why one and we may sum up more in that answer that christ gave to his disciples concerning him that was born blind was that the works of god might be made manifest in them and that the son of god might be glorified thereby john ix 2 3 chap xi 4  now if these devils and diseases as they possessed men then were to make way and work for an approaching christ in person and for the declaring of his power why may we not think that now even now also he is ready to come by his spirit in the gospel to heal many of the debaucheries of our age  i cannot believe that grace will take them all for there are but few that are saved but yet it will take some even some of the worst of men and make blessed ones of them  but o how these ringleaders in vice will then shine in virtue  they will be the very pillars in churches they will be as an ensign in the land  the lord their god shall save them in that day as the flock of his people  for they shall be as the stones of a crown lifted up as an ensign upon his land zech ix 16  but who are these  even idolatrous ephraim and backsliding judah ver 13  i know there is ground to fear that the iniquity of this generation will be pursued with heavy judgments  but that will not hinder what we have supposed  god took him a glorious church out of bloody jerusalem yea out of the chief of the sinners there and left the rest to be taken and spoiled and sold thirty for a penny in the nations where they were captives  the gospel working gloriously in a place to the seizing upon many of the ringleading sinners thereof promiseth no security to the rest but rather threateneth them with the heaviest and smartest judgments as in the instance now given we have a full demonstration but in defending the lord will defend his people and in saving he will save his inheritance  nor does this speak any great comfort to a decayed and backsliding sort of christians for the next time god rides post with his gospel he will leave such christians behind him  but i say christ is resolved to set up his light in the world yea he is delighted to see his graces shine and therefore he commands that his gospel should to that end be offered in the first place to the biggest sinners for by great sins it shineth most therefore he saith begin at jerusalem  eighthly and lastly christ jesus will have mercy to be offered in the first place to the biggest sinners for that by that means the impenitent that are left behind will be at the judgment the more left without excuse  gods word has two edges it can cut backstroke and forestroke  if it doth thee no good it will do thee hurt it is the savour of life unto life to those that receive it but of death unto death to them that refuse it 2 cor ii 15 16  but this is not all the tender of grace to the biggest sinners in the first place will not only leave the rest or those that refuse it in a deplorable condition but will also stop their mouths and cut off all pretence to excuse at that day  if i had not come and spoken unto them saith christ they had not had sin but now they have no cloak for their sin for their sin of persevering in impenitence job xv 22  but what did he speak to them  why even that which i have told you to wit that he has in special a delight in saving the biggest sinners  he spake this in the way of his doctrine he spake this in the way of his practice even to the pouring out of his last breath before them luke xxiii 34  now since this is so what can the condemned at the judgment say for themselves why sentence of death should not be passed upon them  i say what excuse can they make for themselves when they shall be asked why they did not in the day of salvation come to christ to be saved  will they have ground to say to the lord thou wast only for saving of little sinners and therefore because they were great ones they durst not come unto him or that thou hadst not compassion for the biggest sinners therefore i died in despair  will these be excuses for them as the case now standeth with them  is there not every where in gods book a flat contradiction to this in multitudes of promises of invitations of examples and the like  alas alas there will then be there millions of souls to confute this plea ready i say to stand up and say o deceived world heaven swarms with such as were when they were in the world to the full as bad as you  now this will kill all plea or excuse why they should perish in their sins yea the text says they shall see them there  there shall be weeping when you shall see abraham and isaac and jacob and all the prophets in the kingdom of heaven and you yourselves thrust out  and they shall come from the east and from the west and from the north and from the south and shall sit down in the kingdom of god luke xiii 28 29  out of which company it is easy to pick such as sometimes were as bad people as any that now breathe on the face of the earth  what think you of the first man by whose sins there are millions now in hell  and so i may say what think you of ten thousand more besides  but if the world will not stifle and gag them up i speak now for amplifications sake the view of those who are saved shall  there comes an incestuous person to the bar and pleads that the bigness of his sins was a bar to his receiving the promise  but will not his mouth be stopped as to that when lot and the incestuous corinthian shall be set before him gen xix 3337 1 cor v 1 2  there comes a thief and says lord my sin of theft i thought was such as could not be pardoned by thee  but when he shall see the thief that was saved on the cross stand by as clothed with beauteous glory what further can he be able to object  yea the lord will produce ten thousand of his saints at his coming who shall after this manner execute judgment upon all and so convince all that are ungodly among them of all their hard speeches which ungodly sinners have spoken against him  and these are hard speeches against him to say that he was not able or willing to save men because of the greatness of their sins or to say that they were discouraged by his word from repentance because of the heinousness of their offences  these things i say shall then be confuted  he comes with ten thousand of his saints to confute them and to stop their mouths from making objections against their own eternal damnation  here is adam the destroyer of the world here is lot that lay with both his daughters here is abraham that was sometime an idolater and jacob that was a supplanter and reuben that lay with his fathers concubine and judah that lay with his daughterinlaw and levi and simeon that wickedly slew thee shechemites and aaron that great backslider and manassah that man of blood and that made an idol to be worshipped and that proclaimed a religious feast unto it here is also rachab the harlot and bathsheba that bare a bastard to david  here is solomon a witch  time would fail me to tell you of the woman of canaans daughter magdalen of matthew the publican and of gideon and sampson and many thousands more  alas alas  i say what will these sinners do that have through their unbelief eclipsed the glorious largeness of the mercy of god and gave way to despair of salvation because of the bigness of their sins  for all these though now glorious saints in light were sometimes sinners of the biggest size who had sins that were of a notorious hue yet now i say they are in their shining and heavenly robes before the throne of god and of the lamb blessing for ever and ever that son of god for their salvation who died for them upon the tree admiring that ever it should come into their hearts once to think of coming to god by christ but above all blessing god for granting of them light to see those encouragements in his testament without which without doubt they had been daunted and sunk down under guilt of sin and despair as their fellowsinners have done  but now they also are witnesses for god and for his grace against an unbelieving world for as i said they shall come to convince the world of their speeches their hard and unbelieving words that they have spoken concerning the mercy of god and the merits of the passion of his blessed son jesus christ  but will it not think you strangely put to silence all such thoughts and words and reasonings of the ungodly before the bar of god  doubtless it will yea and will send them away from his presence also with the greatest guilt that possibly can fasten upon the consciences of men  for what will sting like thisi have through mine own foolish narrow unworthy undervaluing thoughts of the love and ability of christ to save me brought myself to everlasting ruin  it is true i was a horrible sinner not one in a hundred did live so vile a life as i  but this should not have kept me from closing with jesus christ  i see now that there are abundance in glory that once were as bad as i have been  but they were saved by faith and i am damned by unbelief  wretch that i am why did not i give glory to the redeeming blood of jesus  why did i not humbly cast my soul at his blessed footstool for mercy  why did i judge of his ability to save me by the voice of my shallow reason and the voice of a guilty conscience  why betook not i myself to the holy word of god  why did i not read and pray that i might understand since now i perceive that god said then he giveth liberally to them that pray and upbraideth not jam i 5  it is rational to think that by such cogitations as these the unbelieving world will be torn in pieces before the judgment of christ especially those that have lived where they did or might have heard the gospel of the grace of god  oh that saying it shall be more tolerable for sodom at the judgment than for them will be better understood  see luke x 812  this reason therefore standeth fast namely that christ by offering mercy in the first place to the biggest sinner now will stop all mouths of the impenitent at the day of judgment and cut off all excuse that shall be attempted to be made from the thoughts of the greatness of their sins why they came not to him  i have often thought of the day of judgment and how god will deal with sinners at that day and i believe it will be managed with that sweetness with that equitableness with that excellent righteousness as to every sin and circumstance and aggravation thereof that men that are damned before the judgment is over shall receive such conviction of the righteous judgment of god upon them and of their deserts of hellfire that they shall in themselves conclude that there is all the reason in the world that they should be shut out of heaven and go to hellfire  these shall go away into everlasting punishment matt xxv 46  only this will tear them that they have missed of mercy and glory and obtained everlasting damnation through their unbelief but it will tear but themselves but their own souls they will gnash upon themselves for in that mercy was offered to the chief of them in the first place and yet they were damned for rejecting of it they were damned for forsaking what they had a sort of propriety in for forsaking their own mercy  and thus much for the reasons  i will conclude with a word of application   the application   first would jesus christ have mercy offered in the first place to the biggest sinners then this shews us how to make a right judgment of the heart of christ to men  indeed we have advantage to guess at the goodness of his heart by many things as by his taking our nature upon him his dying for us his sending his word and ministers to us and all that we might be saved  but this of beginning to offer mercy to jerusalem is that which heightens all the rest for this doth not only confirm to us that love was the cause of his dying for us but it shews us yet more the depth of that love  he might have died for us and yet have extended the benefit of his death to a few as one might call them of the best conditioned sinners to those who though they were weak and could not but sin yet made not a trade of sinning to those that sinned not lavishingly  there are in the world as one may call them the moderate sinners the sinners that mix righteousness with their pollutions the sinners that though they be sinners do what on their part lies some that are blind would think so that they might be saved  i say it had been love great love if he had died for none but such and sent his love to such  but that he should send out conditions of peace to the biggest of sinners yea that they should be offered to them first of all for so he means when he says begin at jerusalem this is wonderful this shews his heart to purpose as also the heart of god his father who sent him to do thus  there is nothing more incident to men that are awake in their souls than to have wrong thoughts of god thoughts that are narrow and that pinch and pen up his mercy to scanty and beggarly conclusions and rigid legal conditions supposing that it is rude and an intrenching upon his majesty to come ourselves or to invite others until we have scraped and washed and rubbed off as much of our dirt from us as we think is convenient to make us somewhat orderly and handsome in his sight  such never knew what these words meant begin at jerusalem yea such in their hearts have compared the father and his son to niggardly rich men whose money comes from them like drops of blood  true says such god has mercy but he is loath to part with it you must please him well if you get any from him he is not so free as many suppose nor is he so willing to save as some pretended gospellers imagine  but i ask such if the father and son be not unspeakably free to shew mercy why was this clause put into our commission to preach the gospel  yea why did he say begin at jerusalem for when men through the weakness of their wits have attempted to shew other reasons why they should have the first proffer of mercy yet i can prove by many undeniable reasons that they of jerusalem to whom the apostles made the first offer according as they were commanded were the biggest sinners that ever did breathe upon the face of gods earth set the unpardonable sin aside upon which my doctrine stands like a rock that jesus the son of god would have mercy in the first place offered to the biggest sinners  and if this doth not shew the heart of the father and the son to be infinitely free in bestowing forgiveness of sins i confess myself mistaken  neither is there set this aside another argument like it to shew us the willingness of christ to save sinners for as was said before all the rest of the signs of christs mercifulness might have been limited to sinners that are so and so qualified but when he says begin at jerusalem the line is stretched out to the utmost no man can imagine beyond it and it is folly here to pinch and pare to narrow and seek to bring it within scanty bounds for he plainly saith begin at jerusalem the biggest sinner is the biggest sinner the biggest is the jerusalem sinner  it is true he saith that repentance and remission of sins must go together but yet remission is sent to the chief the jerusalem sinner nor doth repentance lessen at all the jerusalem sinners crimes it diminisheth none of his sins nor causes that there should be so much as half a one the fewer  it only puts a stop to the jerusalem sinners course and makes him willing to be saved freely by grace and for time to come to be governed by that blessed word that has brought the tidings of good things to him  besides no man shews himself willing to be saved that repenteth not of his deeds for he that goes on still in his trespasses declares that he is resolved to pursue his own damnation further  learn then to judge of the largeness of gods heart and of the heart of his son jesus christ by the word judge not thereof by feeling nor by the reports of thy conscience conscience is oftentimes here befooled and made to go quite beside the word  it was judging without the word that made david say i am cast off from gods eyes and shall perish one day by the hand of saul psalm xxxi 22 1 sam xxvii 1  the word had told him another thing namely that he should be king in his stead  our text says also that jesus christ bids preachers in their preaching repentance and remission of sins begin first at jerusalem thereby declaring most truly the infinite largeness of the merciful heart of god and his son to the sinful children of men  judge thou i say therefore of the goodness of the heart of god and his son by this text and by others of the same import so shalt thou not dishonour the grace of god nor needlessly fright thyself nor give away thy faith nor gratify the devil nor lose the benefit of his word  i speak now to weak believers  secondly would jesus christ have mercy offered in the first place to the biggest sinners to the jerusalem sinners then by this also you must learn to judge of the sufficiency of the merits of christ not that the merits of christ can be comprehended for that they are beyond the conceptions of the whole world being called the unsearchable riches of christ but yet they may be apprehended to a considerable degree  now the way to apprehend them most is to consider what offers after his resurrection he makes of his grace to sinners for to be sure he will not offer beyond the virtue of his merits because as grace is the cause of his merits so his merits are the basis and bounds upon and by which his grace stands good and is let out to sinners  doth he then command that his mercy should be offered in the first place to the biggest sinners  it declares that there is sufficiency in his blood to save the biggest sinners  the blood of jesus christ cleanseth from all sin  and again be it known unto you therefore men and brethren that through this man this mans merits is preached unto you the forgiveness of sins  and by him all that believe are justified from all things from which ye could not be justified by the law of moses acts xiii 38  observe then thy rule to make judgment of the sufficiency of the blessed merits of thy saviour  if he had not been able to have reconciled the biggest sinners to his father by his blood he would not have sent to them have sent to them in the first place the doctrine of remission of sins for remission of sins is through faith in his blood  we are justified freely by the grace of god through the redemption that is in the blood of christ  upon the square as i may call it of the worthiness of the blood of christ grace acts and offers forgiveness of sin to men eph i 7 chap ii 13 14 col i 2022  hence therefore we must gather that the blood of christ is of infinite value for that he offereth mercy to the biggest of sinners nay further since he offereth mercy in the first place to the biggest sinners considering also that this first act of his is that which the world will take notice of and expect it should be continued unto thee end  also it is a disparagement to a man that seeks his own glory in what he undertakes to do that for a sport which he cannot continue and hold out in  this is our lords own argument he began to build saith he but was not able to finish luke xiv 28  shouldst thou hear a man say i am resolved to be kind to the poor and should begin with giving handfuls of guineas you would conclude that either he is wonderful rich or must straiten his hand or will soon be at the bottom of his riches  why this is the case  christ at his resurrection gave it out that he would be good to the world and first sends to the biggest sinners with an intent to have mercy on them  now the biggest sinners cannot be saved but by abundance of grace it is not a little that will save great sinners rom v 17  and i say again since the lord jesus mounts thus high at the first and sends to the jerusalem sinners that they may come first to partake of his mercy it follows that either he has unsearchable riches of grace and worth in himself or else he must straiten his hand or his grace and merits will be spent before the world is at an end  but let it be believed as surely as spoken he is still as full as ever  he is not a jot the poorer for all the forgivenesses that he has given away to great sinners  also he is still as free as at first for he never yet called back this word begin at the jerusalem sinners  and as i said before since his grace is extended according to the worth of his merits i conclude that there is the same virtue in his merits to save now as there was at the very beginning  oh the riches of the grace of christ  oh the riches of the blood of christ  thirdly would jesus christ have mercy offered in the first place to the biggest sinners then here is encouragement for you that think for wicked hearts and lives you have not your fellows in the world yet to come to him  there is a people that therefore fear lest they should be rejected of jesus christ because of the greatness of their sins when as you see here such are sent to sent to by jesus christ to come to him for mercy begin at jerusalem  never did one thing answer another more fitly in this world than this text fitteth such kind of sinners  as face answereth face in a glass so this text answereth the necessities of such sinners  what can a man say more but that he stands in the rank of the biggest sinners let him stretch himself whither he can and think of himself to the utmost he can but conclude himself to be one of the biggest sinners  and what then why the text meets him in the very face and saith christ offereth mercy to the biggest sinners to the very jerusalem sinners  what more can be objected  nay he doth not only offer to such his mercy but to them it is commanded to be offered in the first place begin at jerusalem  preach repentance and remission of sins among all nations  begin at jerusalem  is not here encouragement for those that think for wicked hearts and lives they have not their fellows in the world  object  but i have a heart as hard as a rock  answ  well but this doth but prove thee a bigger sinner  object  but my heart continually frets against the lord  answ  well this doth but prove thee a bigger sinner  object  but i have been desperate in sinful courses  answ  well stand thou with the number of the biggest sinners  object  but my grey head is found in the way of wickedness  answ  well thou art in the rank of the biggest sinners  object  but i have not only a base heart but i have lived a debauched life  answ  stand thou also among those that are called the biggest sinners  and what then  why the text swoops you all you cannot object yourselves beyond the text  it has a particular message to the biggest sinners  i say it swoops you all  object  but i am a reprobate  answ  now thou talkest like a fool and of that thou understandest not  no sin but the sin of final impenitence can prove a man a reprobate and i am sure thou hast not arrived as yet unto that therefore thou understandest not what thou sayest and makest groundless conclusions against thyself  say thou art a sinner and i will hold with thee say thou art a great sinner and i will say so too yea say thou art one of the biggest sinners and spare not for the text yet is beyond thee is yet betwixt he and thee begin at jerusalem has yet a smile upon thee and thou talkest as if thou wast a reprobate and that the greatness of thy sins do prove thee so to be when yet they of jerusalem were not such whose sins i dare say were such both for bigness and heineousness as thou art incapable of committing beyond them unless now after thou hast received conviction that the lord jesus is the only saviour of the world thou shouldst wickedly and despitefully turn thyself from him and conclude he is not to be trusted to for life and so crucify him for a cheat afresh  this i must confess will bring a man under the black rod and set him in danger of eternal damnation heb vi 6 chap x 29  this is trampling under foot the son of god and counting his blood an unholy thing  this did they of jerusalem but they did it ignorantly in unbelief and so were yet capable of mercy but to do this against professed light and to stand to it puts a man beyond the text indeed acts iii 1417 1 tim i 13  but i say what is this to him that would fain be saved by christ his sins did as to greatness never yet reach to the nature of the sins that the sinners intended by the text had made themselves guilty of  he that would be saved by christ has an honourable esteem of him but they of jerusalem preferred a murderer before him but as for him they cried away away with him it is not fit that he should live  perhaps thou wilt object that thyself hast a thousand times preferred a stinking lust before him  i answer be it so it is but what is common to men to do nor doth the lord jesus make such a foolish life a bar to thee to forbid thy coming to him or a bond to his grace that it might be kept from thee but admits of thy repentance and offereth himself unto thee freely as thou standest among the jerusalem sinners  take therefore encouragement man mercy is by the text held forth to the biggest sinners yea put thyself into the number of the worst by reckoning that thou mayst be one of the first and mayst not be put off till the biggest sinners are served for the biggest sinners are first invited consequently if they come they are like to be the first that shall be served  it was so with jerusalem jerusalem sinners were they that were first invited and those of them that came first and there came three thousand of them the first day they were invited how many came afterwards none can tell they were first served  put in thy name man among the biggest lest thou art made to wait till they are served  you have some men that think themselves very cunning because they put up their names in their prayers among them that feign it saying god i thank thee i am not so bad as the worst  but believe it if they be saved at all they shall be saved in the last place  the first in their own eyes shall be served last and the last or worst shall be first  the text insinuates it begin at jerusalem and reason backs it for they have most need  behold ye therefore how gods ways are above ours we are for serving the worst last god is for serving the worst first  the man at the pool that to my thinking was longest in his disease and most helpless as to his cure was first healed yea he only was healed for we read that christ healed him but we read not then that he healed one more there  john v 110  wherefore if thou wouldst soonest be served put in thy name among the very worst of sinners  say when thou art upon thy knees lord here is a jerusalem sinner a sinner of the biggest size one whose burden is of the greatest bulk and heaviest weight one that cannot stand long without sinking into hell without thy supporting hand be not thou far from me o lord  o my strength haste thou to help me i say put in thy name with magdalen with manasseh that thou mayst fare as the magdalen and the manasseh sinners do  the man in the gospel made the desperate condition of his child an argument with christ to haste his cure  sir come down saith he ere my child die john iv 49 and christ regarded his haste saying go thy way thy son liveth ver 50  haste requires haste  david was for speed deliver me speedily hear me speedily answer me speedily psalm xxxi 2 lxix 17 cii 2  but why speedily  i am in the net i am in trouble my days are consumed like smoke psalm xxxi 4 lxix 17 cii 3  deep calleth unto deep necessity calls for help great necessity for present help  wherefore i say be ruled by me in this matter feign not thyself another man if thou hast been a filthy sinner but go in thy colours to jesus christ and put thyself among the most vile and let him alone to put thee among the children jer iii 19  confess all that thou knowest of thyself i know thou wilt find it hard work to do thus especially if thy mind be legal but do it lest thou stay and be deferred with the little sinners until the great ones have had their alms  what do you think david intended when he said his wounds stunk and were corrupted but to hasten god to have mercy upon him and not to defer his cure  lord says he i am troubled i am bowed down greatly i go mourning all the day long  i am feeble and sore broken by reason of the disquietness of my heart psalm xxxviii 38  david knew what he did by all this he knew that his making the worst of his case was the way to speedy help and that a feigning and dissembling the matter with god was the next way to a demur as to his forgiveness  i have one thing more to offer for thy encouragement who deemest thyself one of the biggest sinners and that is thou art as it were called by thy name in the first place to come in for mercy  thou man of jerusalem hearken to thy call men do so in courts of judicature and presently cry out here sir and then they shoulder and crowd and say pray give way i am called into the court  why this thy case thou great thou jerusalem sinner be of good cheer he calleth thee mark x 4649  why sitttest thou still arise  why standest thou still come man thy call should give thee authority to come  begin at jerusalem is thy call and authority to come wherefore up and shoulder it man say stand away devil christ calls me stand away unbelief christ calls me stand away all ye my discouraging apprehensions for my saviour calls me to him to receive of his mercy  men will do thus as i said in courts below and why shouldst not thou approach thus to the court above  the jerusalem sinner is first in thought first in commission first in the record of names and therefore should give attendance with expectation that he is first to receive mercy of god  is not this an encouragement to the biggest sinners to make their application to christ for mercy come unto me all ye that labour and are heavy laden doth also confirm this thing that is that the biggest sinner and he that has the biggest burden is he who is first invited  christ pointeth over the heads of thousands as he sits on the throne of grace directly to such a man and says bring in hither the maimed the halt and the blind let the jerusalem sinner that stands there behind come to me  wherefore since christ says  come to thee let thee angels make a lane and let all men give place that the jerusalem sinner may come to jesus christ for mercy  fourthly would jesus christ have mercy offered in the first place to the biggest sinners  then come thou profane wretch and let me a little enter into an argument with thee  why wilt thou not come to jesus christ since thou art a jerusalem sinner  how canst thou find in thy heart to set thyself against grace against such grace as offereth mercy to thee  what spirit possesseth thee and holds thee back from a sincere closure with thy saviour  behold god groaningly complains of thee saying but israel would none of me  when i called none did answer psl lxxxi 11 isa lxvi 4  shall god enter this complaint against thee  why dost thou put him off  why dost thou stop thine ear  canst thou defend thyself  when thou art called to an account for thy neglects of so great salvation what canst thou answer or doest thou think thou shalt escape the judgment  heb ii 3  no more such christs  there will be no more such christs sinner oh put not the day the day of grace away from thee if it be once gone it will never come again sinner  but what is it that has got thy heart and that keeps it from thy saviour  who in the heaven can be compared unto the lord who among the sons of the mighty can be likened unto the lord  psl lxxxix 6  hast thou thinkest thou found anything so good as jesus christ  is there any among thy sins thy companions and foolish delights that like christ can help thee in the day of thy distress  behold the greatness of thy sins cannot hinder let not the stubbornness of thy heart hinder thee sinner  object  but i am ashamed  answ  oh  do not be ashamed to be saved sinner  object  but my old companions will mock me  answ  oh  do not be mocked out of eternal life sinner  thy stubbornness affects afflicts the heart of thy saviour  carest thou not for this  of old he beheld the city and wept over it canst thou hear this and not be concerned  luke xix 41 42  shall christ weep to see thy soul going on to destruction and wilt thou sport thyself in that way  yea shall christ that can be eternally happy without thee be more afflicted at the thoughts of the loss of thy soul than thyself who art certainly eternally miserable if thou neglectest to come to him  those things that keep thee and thy saviour on thy part asunder are but bubbles the least prick of an affliction will let out as to thee what now thou thinkest is worth the venture of heaven to enjoy  hast thou not reason  canst thou not so much as once soberly think of thy dying hour or of whither thy sinful life will drive thee then  hast thou no conscience or having one is it rocked so fast asleep by sin or made so weary with an unsuccessful calling upon thee that it is laid down and cares for thee no more  poor man thy state is to be lamented  hast no judgment  art not able to conclude that to be saved is better than to burn in hell and that eternal life with gods favour is better than a temporal life in gods displeasure  hast no affection but what is brutish what none at all no affection for the god that made thee what none for his loving son that has shewed his love and died for thee  is not heaven worth thy affection  o poor man which is strongest thinkest thou god or thee  if thou art not able to overcome him thou art a fool for standing out against him matt v 25 26  it is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living god  he will gripe hard his fist is stronger than a lions paw take heed of him he will be angry if you despise his son and will you stand guilty in your trespasses when he offereth you his grace and favour  exod xxxiv 6 7 heb x 2931  now we come to the text beginning at jerusalem  this text though it be now one of the brightest stars that shineth in the bible because there is in it as full if not the fullest offer of grace that can be imagined to the sons of men yet to them that shall perish from under this word even this text will be to such one of the hottest coals in hell  this text therefore will save thee or sink thee  there is no shifting of it  if it saves thee it will set thee high if it sinks thee it will set thee low  but i say why so unconcerned  hast no soul or dost think thou mayst lose thy soul and save thyself  is it not pity had it otherwise been the will of god that ever thou wast made a man for that thou settest so little by thy soul  sinner take the invitation thou art called upon to come to christ nor art thou called upon but by order from the son of god though thou shouldst happen to come of the biggest sinners for he has bid us offer mercy as to all the world in general so in the first place to the sinners of jerusalem or to the biggest sinners  fifthly would jesus christ have mercy offered in thee first place to the biggest sinners then this shews how unreasonable a thing it is for men to despair of mercy  for those that presume i shall say something to them afterward  i now speak to them that despair  there are four sorts of despair  there is the despair of devils there is the despair of souls in hell there is the despair that is grounded upon mens deficiency and there is the despair that they are perplexed with that are willing to be saved but are too strongly borne down with the burthen of their sins  the despair of devils the damneds despair and that despair that a man has of attaining of life because of his own deficiency are all unreasonable  why should not devils and damned souls despair yea why should not man despair of getting to heaven by his own abilities i therefore am concerned only with the fourth sort of despair to wit with the despair of those that would be saved but are too strongly borne down with the burden of their sins  i say therefore to thee that art thus and why despair  thy despair if it were reasonable should flow from thee because found in the land that is beyond the grave or because thou certainly knowest that christ will not or cannot save thee  but for the first thou art yet in the land of the living and for the second thou hast ground to believe the quite contrary christ is able to save to the uttermost them that come to god by him and if he were not willing he would not have commanded that mercy in the first place should be offered to the biggest sinners  besides he hath said and let him that is athirst come and whosoever will let him take the water of life freely that is with all my heart  what ground now is here for despair  if thou sayst the number and burden of my sins i answer nay that is rather a ground for faith because such an one above all others is invited by christ to come unto him yea promised rest and forgiveness if they come matt xi 28  what ground then to despair  verily none at all  thy despair then is a thing unreasonable and without footing in the word  but i have no experience of gods love god hath given me no comfort or ground of hope though i have waited upon him for it many a day  thou hast experience of gods love for that he has opened thine eyes to see thy sins  and for that he has given thee desires to be saved by jesus christ  for by thy sense of sin thou art made to see thy poverty of spirit and that has laid thee under a sure ground to hope that heaven shall be thine hereafter  also thy desires to be saved by christ has put thee under another promise so there is two to hold thee up in them though thy present burden be never so heavy matt v 3 6  as for what thou sayst as to gods silence to thee perhaps he has spoken to thee once or twice already but thou hast not perceived it job xxxiii 14 15  however thou hast christ crucified set forth before thine eyes in the bible and an invitation to come unto him though thou be a jerusalem sinner though thou be the biggest sinner and so no ground to despair  what if god will be silent to thee is that ground of despair  not at all so long as there is a promise in the bible that god will in no wise cast away the coming sinner and so long as he invites the jerusalem sinner to come unto him john vi 37  build not therefore despair upon these things they are no sufficient foundations for it such plenty of promises being in the bible and such a discovery of his mercy to great sinners of old especially since we have withal a clause in the commission given to ministers to preach that they should begin with the jerusalem sinners in their offering of mercy to the world  besides god says they that wait upon the lord shall renew their strength they shall mount up with wings like eagles but perhaps it may be long first  i waited long saith david and did seek the lord and at length his cry was heard  wherefore he bids his soul wait on god and says for it is good so to do before thy saints psalm xl 1 lxii 5 lii 9  and what if thou waitest upon god all thy days  is it below thee and what if god will cross his book and blot out the handwriting that is against thee and not let thee know it as yet  is it fit to say unto god thou art hardhearted  despair not thou hast no ground to despair so long as thou livest in this world  it is a sin to begin to despair before one sets his foot over the threshold of hellgates  for them that are there let them despair and spare not but as for thee thou hast no ground to do it  what despair of bread in a land that is full of corn despair of mercy when our god is full of mercy despair of mercy when god goes about by his ministers beseeching of sinners to be reconciled unto him  2 cor v 1820  thou scrupulous fool where canst thou find that god was ever false to his promise or that he ever deceived the soul that ventured itself upon him  he often calls upon sinners to trust him though they walk in darkness and have no light isa 1 10  they have his promise and oath for their salvation that flee for refuge to the hope set before them heb vi 17 18  despair when we have a god of mercy and a redeeming christ alive for shame forbear  let them despair that dwell where there is no god and that are confined to those chambers of death which can be reached by no redemption  a living man despair when he is chid for murmuring and complaining lam iii 39  oh so long as we are where promises swarm where mercy is proclaimed where grace reigns and where jerusalem sinners are privileged with the first offer of mercy it is a base thing to despair  despair undervalues the promise undervalues the invitation undervalues the proffer of grace  despair undervalues the ability of god the father and the redeeming blood of christ his son  oh unreasonable despair  despair makes man gods judge it is a controller of the promise a contradicter of christ in his large offers of mercy  and one that undertakes to make unbelief the great manager of our reason and judgment in determining about what god can and will do for sinners  despair  it is the devils fellow the devils master yea the chains with which he is captivated and held under darkness for ever and to give way thereto in a land in a state and time that flows with milk and honey is an uncomely thing  i would say to my soul o my soul this is not the place of despair this is not the time to despair in  as long as mine eyes can find a promise in the bible as long as there is the least mention of grace as long as there is a moment left me of breath or life in this world so long will i wait or look for mercy so long will i fight against unbelief and despair  this is the way to honour god and christ this is the way to set the crown on the promise this is the way to welcome the invitation and inviter and this is the way to thrust thyself under the shelter and protection of the word of grace  never despair so long as our text is alive for that doth sound it outthat mercy by christ is offered in the first place to the biggest sinner  despair is an unprofitable thing it will make a man weary of waiting upon god 2 kings vi 33 it will make a man forsake god and seek his heaven in the good things of this world gen iv 1318  it will make a man his own tormentor and flounce and fling like a wild bull in a net isa ii 20  despair it drives a man to the study of his own ruin and brings him at last to be his own executioner 2 sam xvii 23 matt xxvii 35  besides i am persuaded also that despair is the cause that there are so many that would fain be atheists in the world  for because they have entertained a conceit that god will never be merciful to them therefore they labour to persuade themselves that there is no god at all as if their misbelief would kill god or cause him to cease to be  a poor shift for an immortal soul for a soul who liketh not to retain god in its knowledge  if this be the best that despair can do let it go man and betake thyself to faith to prayer to wait for god and to hope in despite of ten thousand doubts  and for thy encouragement take yet as an addition to what has already been said the following scripture the lord taketh pleasure in them that fear him in those that hope in his mercy psal cxlvii 11  whence note they fear not god that hope not in his mercy  also god is angry with them that hope not in his mercy  for he only taketh pleasure in them that hope  he that believeth or hath received his testimony hath set to his seal that god is true john iii 33 but he that receiveth it not hath made him a liar and that is a very unworthy thing 1 john v 10 11  let the wicked forsake his ways and the unrighteous man his thoughts and let him return to the lord and he will have mercy on him and to our god for he will abundantly multiply pardons  perhaps thou art weary of thy ways but art not weary of thy thoughts of thy unbelieving and despairing thoughts now god also would have thee cast away these thoughts as such which he deserveth not at thy hands for he will have mercy upon thee and he will abundantly pardon  o fools and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken luke xxiv 25  mark you here slowness to believe is a piece of folly  ay but sayst thou i do believe some and i believe what can make against me  ay but sinner christ jesus here calls thee fool for not believing all  believe all and despair if thou canst  he that believes all believes that text that saith christ would have mercy preached first to the jerusalem sinners  he that believeth all believeth all the promises and consolations of the word and the promises and consolations of the word weigh heavier than do all the curses and threatenings of the law and mercy rejoiceth against judgment  wherefore believe all and mercy will to thy conscience weigh judgment down and so minister comfort to thy soul  the lord take the yoke from off thy jaws since he has set meat before thee hos xi 4 and help thee to remember that he is pleased in the first place to offer mercy to the biggest sinners  sixthly since jesus christ would have mercy offered in the first place to the biggest sinners let souls see that they lay right hold thereof lest they notwithstanding indeed come short thereof faith only knows how to deal with mercy wherefore put not in the place thereof presumption  i have observed that as there are herbs and flowers in our gardens so there are their counterfeits in the field only they are distinguished from the other by the name of wild ones  why there is faith and wild faith and wild faith is this presumption  i call it wild faith because god never placed it in his garden his church it is only to be found in the field the world  i also call it wild faith because it only grows up and is nourished where other wild notions abound  wherefore take heed of this and all may be well for this presumuptuousness is a very heinous thing in the eyes of god  the soul saith he that doeth ought presumptuously whether he be born in the land or a stranger the same reproacheth the lord and that soul shall be cut off from among his people numb xv 30  the thoughts of this made david tremble and pray that god would hold him back from presumptuous sins and not suffer them to have dominion over him psal xix 13  now this presumption then puts itself in the place of faith when it tampereth with the promise for life while the soul is a stranger to repentance  wherefore you have in the text to prevent doing thus both repentance and remission of sins to be offered to jerusalem not remission without repentance  for all that repent not shall perish let them presume on grace and the promise while they will luke xiii 13  presumption then is that which severeth faith and repentance concluding that the soul shall be saved by grace though the man was never made sorry for his sins nor the love of the heart turned therefrom  this is to be selfwilled as peter has it and this is a despising the word of the lord for that has put repentance and faith together mark i 15  and because he hath despised the word of the lord and hath broken his commandment that soul shall utterly be cut off  his iniquity shall be upon him  numb xv 31  let such therefore look to it who yet are and abide in their sins for such if they hope as they are to be saved presume upon the grace of god  wherefore presumption and not hearkening to gods word are put together deut xvii 12  again then men presume when they are resolved to abide in their sins and yet expect to be saved by gods grace through christ  this is as much as to say god liketh sin as well as i do and careth not how men live if so be they lean upon his son  of this sort are they that build up zion with blood and jerusalem with iniquity that judge for reward and teach for hire and divine for money and lean upon the lord mic iii 10 11  this is doing things with an high hand against the lord our god and a taking him as it were at the catch  this is as we say among men to seek to put a trick upon god as if he had not sufficiently fortified his proposals of grace by his holy word against all such kind of fools as these  but look to it  such will be found at the day of god not among that great company of jerusalem sinners that shall be saved by grace but among those that have been the great abusers of the grace of god in the world  those that say let us sin that grace may abound and let us do evil that good may come their damnation is just  and if so they are a great way off of that salvation that is by jesus christ presented to the jerusalem sinners  i have therefore these things to propound to that jerusalem sinner that would know if he may be so bold as to venture himself upon this grace  first dost thou see thy sins  secondly art thou weary of them  thirdly wouldst thou with all thy heart be saved by jesus christ  i dare say no less i dare say no more  but if it be truly thus with thee how great soever thy sins have been how bad soever thou feelest thy heart how far soever thou art from thinking that god has mercy for these  thou art the man the jerusalem sinner that the word of god has conquered and to whom it offereth free remission of sins by the redemption that is in jesus christ  when the jailor cried out sirs what must i do to be saved  the answer was believe on the lord jesus christ and thou shalt be saved  he that sees his sins aright is brought to his wits end by them and he that is so is willing to part from them and to be saved by the grace of god  if this be thy case fear not give no way to despair thou presumest not if thou believest to life everlasting in jesus christ  yea christ is prepared for such as thou art  therefore take good courage and believe  the design of satan is to tell the presumptuous that their presuming on mercy is good but to persuade the believer that his believing is impudent bold dealing with god  i never heard a presumptuous man in my life say that he was afraid that he presumed but i have heard many an honest humble soul say that they have been afraid that their faith has been presumption  why should satan molest those whose ways he knows will bring them to him  and who can think that he should be quiet when men take the right course to escape his hellish snares  this therefore is the reason why the truly humbled is opposed while the presumptuous goes on by wind and tide  the truly humble satan hates but he laughs to see the foolery of the other  does thy hand and heart tremble  upon thee the promise smiles  to this man will i look says god even to him that is poor and of a contrite spirit and trembles at my word isa lxvi 2  what therefore i have said of presumption concerns not the humble in spirit at all  i therefore am for gathering up the stones and for taking the stumblingblocks out of the way of gods people  and forewarning of them that lay the stumblingblock of their iniquity before their faces and that are for presuming upon gods mercy and let them look to themselves ezek xiv 68  also our text stands firm as ever it did and our observation is still of force that jesus christ would have mercy offered in the first place to the biggest sinners  so then let none despair let none presume let none despair that are sorry for their sins and would be saved by jesus christ let none presume that abide in the liking of their sins though they seem to know the exceeding grace of christ for though the door stands wide open for the reception of the penitent yet it is fast enough barred and bolted against the presumptuous sinner  be not deceived god is not mocked whatsoever a man sows that he shall reap  it cannot be that god should be wheedled out of his mercy or prevailed upon by lips of dissimulation he knows them that trust in him and that sincerely come to him by christ for mercy nahum i 7  it is then not the abundance of sins committed but the not coming heartily to god by christ for mercy that shuts men out of doors and though their not coming heartily may be said to be but a sin yet it is such a sin as causeth that all thy other sins abide upon thee unforgiven  god complains of this  they have not cried unto me with their heart they turned but not to the most high  they turned feignedly jer iii 10 hos vii 14 16  thus doing his soul hates but the penitent humble brokenhearted sinner be his transgressions red as scarlet red like crimson in number as the sand though his transgressions cry to heaven against him for vengeance and seem there to cry louder than do his prayers or tears or groans for mercy yet he is safe  to this man god will look isa i 18 chap lxvi 2  seventhly would jesus christ have mercy offered in the first place to the biggest sinners  then here is ground for those that as to practice have not been such to come to him for mercy  although there is no sin little of itself because it is a contradiction of the nature and majesty of god yet we must admit of divers numbers and also of aggravations  two sins are not so many as three nor are three that are done in ignorance so big as one that is done against light against knowledge and conscience  also there is the child in sin and a man in sin that has his hairs gray and his skin wrinkled for very age  and we must put a difference betwixt these sinners also  for can it be that a child of seven or ten or sixteen years old should be such a sinnera sinner so vile in the eye of the law as he is who has walked according to the course of this world forty fifty sixty or seventy years  now the youth this stripling though he is a sinner is but a little sinner when compared with such  now i say if there be room for the first sort for those of the biggest size certainly there is room for the lesser size  if there be a door wide enough for a giant to go in at there is certainly room for a dwarf  if christ jesus has grace enough to save great sinners he has surely grace enough to save little ones  if he can forgive five hundred pence for certain he can forgive fifty luke vii 41 42  but you said before that the little sinners must stand by until the great ones have received their grace and that is discouraging  i answer there are two sorts of little sinners such as are so and such as feign themselves so  they are those that feign themselves so that i intended there and not those that are indeed comparatively so  such as feign themselves so may wait long enough before they obtain forgiveness  but again a sinner may be comparatively a little sinner and sensibly a great one  there are then two sorts of greatness in sin greatness by reason of number greatness by reason of thoroughness of conviction of the horrible nature of sin  in this last sense he that has but one sin if such a one could be found may in his own eyes find himself the biggest sinner in the world  let this man or this child therefore put himself among the great sinners and plead with god as great sinners do and expect to be saved with the great sinners and as soon and as heartily as they  yea a little sinner that comparatively is truly so if he shall graciously give way to conviction and shall in gods light diligently weigh the horrible nature of his own sins may yet sooner obtain forgiveness for them at the hands of the heavenly father than he that has ten times his sins and so cause to cry ten times harder to god for mercy  for the grievousness of the cry is a great thing with god for if he will hear the widow if she cries at all how much more if she cries most grievously  exod xxii 22 23  it is not the number but the true sense of the abominable nature of sin that makes the cry for pardon lamentable  he as i said that has many sins may not cry so loud in the ears of god as he that has far fewer he in our present sense that is in his own eyes the biggest sinner is he that soonest findeth mercy  the offer then is to the biggest sinner to the biggest sinner first and the mercy is first obtained by him that first confesseth himself to be such an one  there are men that strive at the throne of grace for mercy by pleading the greatness of their necessity  now their plea as to the prevalency of it lieth not in the counting up of the number but in the sense of the greatness of their sins and in the vehemency of their cry for pardon  and it is observable that though the birthright was rubens and for his foolishness given to the sons of joseph yet judah prevailed above his brethren and of him came the messias 1 chron v 1 2  there is a heavenly subtilty to be managed in this matter  thy brother came with subtilty and hath taken away thy blessing  the blessing belonged to esau but jacob by his diligence made it his own gen xxvii 33  the offer is to the biggest sinner to the biggest sinner first but if he forbear to cry the sinner that is a sinner less by far than he both as to number and the nature of transgression may get the blessing first if he shall have grace to bestir himself well for the loudest cry is heard furthest and the most lamentable pierces soonest  i therefore urge this head not because i would have little sinners go and tell god that they are little sinners thereby to think to obtain mercy for verily so they are never like to have it  for such words declare that such a one hath no true sense at all of the nature of his sins  sin as i said in the nature of it is horrible though it be but one single sin as to act yea though it be but a sinful thought and so worthily calls for the damnation of the soul  the comparison then of little and great sinners is to go for good sense among men  but to plead the fewness of thy sins or the comparative harmlessness of their quantity before god argueth no sound knowledge of the nature of thy sin and so no true sense of the nature or need of mercy  little sinner when therefore thou goest to god though thou knowest in thy conscience that thou as to acts art no thief no murderer no whore no liar no false swearer or the like and in reason must needs understand that thus thou art not so profanely vile as others yet when thou goest to god for mercy know no mans sins but thine own make mention of no mans sins but thine own  also labour not to lessen thy own but magnify and greaten them by all just circumstances and be as if there was never a sinner in the world but thyself  also cry out as if thou wast the only undone man and that is the way to obtain gods mercy  it is one of the comeliest sights in the world to see a little sinner commenting upon the greatness of his sins multiplying and multiplying them to himself till he makes them in his own eyes bigger and higher than he seeth any other mans sins to be in the world and as base a thing it is to see a man do otherwise and as basely will come on it luke xviii 1014  as therefore i said to the great sinner before let him take heed lest he presume i say now to the little sinner let him take heed that he do not dissemble  for there is as great an aptness in the little sinner to dissemble as there is in the great one  he that hideth his sins shall not prosper be he a sinner little or great prov xxviii 13  eighthly would jesus christ have mercy offered in the first place to the biggest sinners  then this shews the true cause why satan makes such head as he doth against him  the father and the holy spirit are well spoken of by all deluders and deceived persons christ only is the rock of offence  behold i lay in zion a stumblingstone and a rock of offence rom ix 33  not that satan careth for the father or the spirit more than he careth for the son but he can let men alone with their notions of the father and the spirit for he knows they shall never enjoy the father nor the spirit if indeed they receive not the merits of the son he that hath the son hath life he that hath not the son of god hath not life however they may boast themselves of the father and the spirit 1 john v 12  again whosoever transgresseth and abideth not in the doctrine of christ hath not god  he that abideth in the doctrine of christ hath both the father and the son 2 john i 9  christ and christ only is he that can make us capable to enjoy god with life and joy to all eternity  hence he calls himself the way to the father the true and living way john xiv 6 heb x 19 20 for we cannot come to the father but by him  satan knows this therefore he hates him  deluded persons are ignorant of this and therefore they are so led up and down by satan by the nose as they are  there are many things by which satan has taken occasion to greaten his rage against jesus christ  as first his love to man and then the many expressions of that love  he hath taken mans nature upon him he hath in that nature fulfilled the law to bring in righteousness for man and hath spilt his blood for the reconciling of men to god he hath broke the neck of death put away sin destroyed the works of the devil and got into his own hands the keys of death  and all these are heinous things to satan  he cannot abide christ for this  besides he hath eternal life in himself and that to bestow upon us and we in all likelihood are to possess the very places from which the satans by transgression fell if not places more glorious  wherefore he must needs be angry  and is it not a vexatious thing to him that we should be admitted to the throne of grace by christ while he stands bound over in chains of darkness to answer for his rebellions against god and his son at the terrible day of judgment  yea we poor dust and ashes must become his judges and triumph over him for ever  and all this long of jesus christ for he is the meritorious cause of all this  now though satan seeks to be revenged for this yet he knows it is in vain to attack the person of christ he has overcome him  therefore he tampers with a company of silly men that he may vilify him by them  and they bold fools as they are will not spare to spit in his face  they will rail at his person and deny the very being of it they will rail at his blood and deny the merit and worth of it they will deny the very end why he accomplished the law and by jiggs and tricks and quirks which he helpeth them to they set up fond names and images in his place and give the glory of a saviour to them  thus satan worketh under the name of christ and his ministers under the name of the ministers of righteousness  and by his wiles and stratagems he undoes a world of men but there is a seed and they shall serve him and it shall be counted to the lord for a generation  these shall see their sins and that christ is the way to happiness  these shall venture themselves both body and soul upon his worthiness  all this satan knows and therefore his rage is kindled the more wherefore according to his ability and allowance he assaulteth tempteth abuseth and stirs up what he can to be hurtful to these poor people that he may while his time shall last make it as hard and difficult for them to go to eternal glory as he can  oftentimes he abuses them with wrong apprehensions of god and with wrong apprehensions of christ  he also casts them into the mire to the reproach of religion the shame of their brethren the derision of the world and dishonour of god  he holds our hands while the world buffets us he puts bearskins upon us and then sets the dogs at us  he bedaubeth us with his own foam and then tempts us to believe that that bedaubing comes from ourselves  oh the rage and the roaring of this lion and the hatred that he manifests against the lord jesus and against them that are purchased with his blood  but yet in the midst of all this the lord jesus sends forth his herald to proclaim in the nations his love to the world and to invite them to come in to him for life  yea his invitation is so large that it offereth his mercy in the first place to the biggest sinners of every age which augments the devils rage the more  wherefore as i said before fret he fume he the lord jesus will divide the spoil with this great one yea he shall divide the spoil with the strong because he hath poured out his soul unto death and he was numbered with the transgressors and he bare the sin of many and made intercession for the transgressors isa liii 12  ninthly would jesus christ have mercy offered in the first place to the biggest sinners  let the tempted harp upon this string for their help and consolation  the tempted wherever he dwells always thinks himself the biggest sinner one most unworthy of eternal life  this is satans masterargument  thou art a horrible sinner a hypocrite one that has a profane heart and one that is an utter stranger to a work of grace  i say this is his maul his club his masterpiece he doth with this as some do with their most enchanting songs sings them everywhere  i believe there are but few saints in the world that have not had this temptation sounding in their ears but were they but aware satan by all this does but drive them to the gap out at which they should go and so escape his roaring  saith he thou art a great sinner a horrible sinner a profane hearted wretch one that cannot be matched for a vile one in the country  and all this while christ says to his ministers offer mercy in the first place to the biggest sinners  so that this temptation drives thee directly into the arms of jesus christ  were therefore the tempted but aware he might say ay satan so i am i am a sinner of the biggest size and therefore have most need of jesus christ yea because i am such a wretch therefore jesus christ calls me yea he calls me first  the first proffer of the gospel is to be made to the jerusalem sinner  i am he wherefore stand back satan make a lane my right is first to come to jesus christ  this now will be like for like  this would foil the devil  this would make him say i must not deal with this man thus for then i put a sword into his hand to cut off my head  and this is the meaning of peter when he saith resist him stedfast in the faith 1 pet v 9  and of paul when he saith take the shield of faith wherewith ye shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked eph vi 16  wherefore is it said begin at jerusalem if the jerusalem sinner is not to have the benefit of it  and if i am to have the benefit of it let me call it to mind when satan haunts me with the continual remembrance of my sins of my jerusalem sins  satan and my conscience say i am the biggest sinnerchrist offereth mercy in the first place to the biggest sinners  nor is the manner of the offer other but such as suiteth with my mind  i am sorry for my sin yea sorry at my heart that ever sinful thought did enter or find the least entertainment in my wicked mind and might i obtain my wish i would never more that my heart should be a place for ought but the grace and spirit and faith of the lord jesus  i speak not this to lessen my wickedness i would not for all the world but be placed by mine own conscience in the very front of the biggest sinners that i might be one of the first that are beckoned by the gracious hand of jesus the saviour to come to him for mercy  well sinner thou now speakest like a christian but say thus in a strong spirit in the hour of temptation and then thou wilt to thy commendation and comfort quit thyself well  this improving of christ in dark hours is the life though the hardest part of our christianity  we should neither stop at darkness nor at the raging of our lusts but go on in a way of venturing and casting the whole of our affairs for the next world at the foot of jesus christ  this is the way to make the darkness light and also to allay the raging of our corruption  the first time the passover was eaten was in the night and when israel took courage to go forward though the sea stood in their way like a devouring gulf and the host of the egyptians follow them at the heels yet the sea gives place and their enemies were as still as a stone till they were gone over exod xii 8 chap xiv 13 14 21 22 chap xv 16  there is nothing like faith to help at a pinch faith dissolves doubts as the sun drives away the mists  and that you may not be put out know your time as i said of believing it always  there are times when some graces may be out of use but there is no time wherein faith can be said to be so  wherefore faith must be always in exercise  faith is the eye is the mouth is the hand and one of these is of use all day long  faith is to see to receive to work or to eat and a christian should be seeing or receiving or working or feeding all day long  let it rain let it blow let it thunder let it lighten a christian must still believe  at what time said thee good man i am afraid i will trust in thee psal vi 2 3  nor can we have a better encouragement to do this than is by the text set before us even an open heart for a jerusalem sinner  and if for a jerusalem sinner to come then for such an one when come if for such a one to be saved then for such a one that is saved  if for such a one to be pardoned his great transgressions then for such a one who is pardoned these to come daily to jesus christ too to be cleansed and set free from his common infirmities and from the iniquities of his holy things  therefore let the poor sinner that would be saved labour for skill to make the best improvement of the grace of christ to help him against the temptations of the devil and his sins  tenthly would jesus christ have mercy offered in the first place to the biggest sinners  let those men consider this that have or may in a day of trial have spoken or done what their profession or conscience told them they should not and that have the guilt and burden thereof upon their consciences  whether a thing be wrong or right guilt may pursue him that doth contrary to his conscience  but suppose a man should deny his god or his christ or relinquish a good profession and be under the real guilt thereof shall he therefore conclude he is gone for ever  let him come again with peters tears and no doubt he shall obtain peters forgiveness  for the text includes the biggest sinners  and it is observable that before this clause was put into this commission peter was pardoned his horrible revolt from his master he that revolteth in the day of trial if he is not shot quite dead upon the place but is sensible of his wound and calls out for a surgeon shall find his lord at hand to pour wine and oil into his wounds that he may again be healed and to encourage him to think that there may be mercy for him  besides what we find recorded of peter you read in the acts some were through the violence of their trials compelled to blaspheme and yet are called saints acts xxvi 911  hence you have a promise or two that speak concerning such kind of men to encourage us to think that at least some of them shall come back to the lord their god  shall they fall saith he and not arise  shall they turn away and not return jer viii 4  and in that day i will assemble her that halteth and i will gather her that was driven out and her that i have afflicted  and i will make her that halteth a remnant and her that was cast off a strong nation and the lord shall reign over them in mount zion for ever  what we are to understand by her that halteth is best expressed by the prophet elijah mic iv 6 7 zeph iii 19 1 kings xviii 21  i will conclude then that for them that have halted or may halt the lord has mercy in the bank and is willing to accept them if they return to him again  perhaps they may never be after that of any great esteem in the house of god but if the lord will admit them to favour and forgiveness  o exceeding and undeserved mercy  see ezekiel xliv 1014  thou then that mayst be the man remember this that there is mercy also for thee  return therefore to god and to his son who hath yet in store for thee and who will do thee good  but perhaps thou wilt say he doth not save all revolters and therefore perhaps not me  answr  art thou returning to god  if thou art returning thou art the man return ye backsliding children and i will heal your backslidings jer iii 22  some as i said that revolt are shot dead upon the place and for them who can help them  but for them that cry out of their wounds it is a sign they are yet alive and if they use the means in time doubtless they may be healed  christ jesus has bags of mercy that were never yet broken up or unsealed  hence it is said he has goodness laid up things reserved in heaven for his  and if he breaks up one of these bags who can tell what he can do  hence his love is said to be such as passeth knowledge and that his riches are unsearchable  he has no body knows what for no body knows whom  he has by him in store for such as seem in the view of all men to be gone beyond recovery  for this the text is plain what man or angel could have thought that the jerusalem sinners had been yet on this side of an impossibility of enjoying life and mercy hadst thou seen their actions and what horrible things they did to the son of god yea how stoutly they backed what they did with resolves and endeavours to persevere when they had killed his person against his name and doctrine and that there was not found among them all that while as we read of the least remorse or regret for these their doings couldst thou have imagined that mercy would ever have took hold of them at least so soon  nay that they should of all the world be counted those only meet to have it offered to them in the very first place  for so my text commands saying preach repentance and remission of sins among all nations beginning at jerusalem  i tell you the thing is a wonder and must for ever stand for a wonder among the sons of men  it stands also for an everlasting invitation and allurement to the biggest sinners to come to christ for mercy  now since in the opinion of all men the revolter is such a one if he has as i said before any life in him let him take encouragement to come again that he may live by christ  eleventhly would jesus christ have mercy offered in the first place to the biggest sinners  then let gods ministers tell them so there is an incidence in us i know not how it doth come about when we are converted to contemn them that are left behind  poor fools as we are we forget that we ourselves were so tit iii 2 3  but would it not become us better since we have tasted that the lord is gracious to carry it towards them so that we may give them convincing ground to believe that we have found that mercy which also sets open the door for them to come and partake with us  ministers i say should do thus both by their doctrine and in all other respects  austerity doth not become us neither in doctrine nor in conversation  we ourselves live by grace let us give as we receive and labour to persuade our fellowsinners which god has left behind us to follow after that they may partake with us of grace  we are saved by grace let us live like them that are gracious  let all our things to the world be done in charity towards them pity them pray for them be familiar with them for their good  let us lay aside our foolish worldly carnal grandeur let us not walk the streets and have such behaviours as signify we are scarce for touching of the poor ones that are left behind no not with a pair of tongs  it becomes us not thus to do  remember your lord he was familiar with publicans and sinners to a proverb behold a gluttonous man and a winebibber a friend of publicans and sinners matt xi 19  the first part concerning his gluttonous eating and drinking to be sure was an horrible slander but for the other nothing was ever spoke truer of him by the world now why should we lay hands cross on this text  that is choose good victuals and love the sweet wine better than the salvation of the poor publican  why not familiar with sinners provided we hate their spots and blemishes and seek that they may be healed of them  why not fellowly with our carnal neighbours  if we do take occasion to do so that we may drop and be yet distilling some good doctrine upon their souls  why not go to the poor mans house and give him a penny and a scripture to think upon  why not send for the poor to fetch away at least the fragments of thy table that the bowels of thy fellowsinner may be refreshed as well as thine  ministers should be exemplary but i am an inferior man and must take heed of too much meddling  but might i i would meddle with them with their wives and with their children too  i mean not this of all but of them that deserve it though i may not name them  but i say let ministers follow the steps of their blessed lord who by word and deed shewed his love to the salvation of the world in such a carriage as declared him to prefer their salvation before his own private concern for we are commanded to follow his steps who did no sin neither was guile found in his mouth  and as i have said concerning ministers so i say to all the brethren carry it so that all the world may see that indeed you are the sons of love  love your saviour yea shew one to another that you love him not only by a seeming love of affection but with the love of duty practical love is best  many love christ with nothing but the lick of the tongue  alas  christ jesus the lord must not be put off thus  he that hath my commandments and keepeth them saith he he it is that loveth me john xiv 21  practical love which stands in selfdenial in charity to my neighbour and a patient enduring of affliction for his name this is counted love  right love to christ is that which carries in it a provoking argument to others of the brethren heb x 24  should a man ask me how he should know that he loveth the children of god  the best answer i could give him would be in the words of the apostle john by this saith he we know we love the children of god when we love god and keep his commandments 1 john v 2  love to god and christ is then shewn when we are tender of his name and then we shew ourselves tender of his name when we are afraid to break any the least of his commandments  and when we are here then do we shew our love to our brother also  now we have obligation sufficient thus to do for that our lord loved us and gave himself for us to deliver us from death that we might live through him  the world when they hear the doctrine that i have asserted and handled in this little book to wit that jesus christ would have mercy offered in the first place to the biggest sinners will be apt because themselves are unbelievers to think that this is a doctrine that leads to looseness and that gives liberty to the flesh but if you that believe love your brethren and your neighbours truly and as you should you will put to silence the ignorance of such foolish men and stop their mouths from speaking evil of you  and i say let the love of christ constrain us to this  who deserveth our heart our mouth our life our goods so much as jesus christ who has bought us to himself by his blood to this very end that we should be a peculiar people zealous of good works  there is nothing more seemly in the world than to see a christian walk as becomes the gospel nor any thing more unbecoming a reasonable creature than to hear a man say i believe in christ and yet see in his life debauchery and profaneness  might i such men should be counted the basest of men such men should be counted by all unworthy of the name of a christian and should be shunned by every good man as such who are the very plague of profession  for so it is written we should carry it towards them  whoso have a form of godliness and deny the power thereof from such we must turn away  it has ofttimes come into my mind to ask by what means it is that the gospel profession should be so tainted with loose and carnal gospellers and i could never arrive to better satisfaction in the matter than thissuch men are made professors by the devil and so by him put among the rest of the godly  a certain man had a fruitless figtree planted in his vineyard but by whom was it planted there  even by him that sowed the tares his own children among the wheat luke xiii 6 matt xiii 3740  and that was the devil  but why doth the devil do thus  not of love to them but to make of them offences and stumblingblocks to others  for he knows that a loose professor in the church does more mischief to religion than ten can do to it that are in the world  was it not think you the devil that stirred up the damsel that you read of in acts xvi to cry out these are the servants of the most high god that shew unto us the way of salvation  yes it was as is evident for paul was grieved to hear it  but why did the devil stir up her to cry so but because that was the way to blemish the gospel and to make the world think that it came from the same hand as did her soothsaying and witchery verse l618 holiness o lord becomes thy house for ever  let therefore whoever they be that profess the name of christ take heed that they scandal not that profession which they make of him since he has so graciously offered us as we are sinners of the biggest size in the first place his grace to save us  having thus far spoken of the riches of the grace of christ and of the freeness of his heart to embrace the jerusalem sinners it may not be amiss to give you yet as a caution an intimation of one thing namely that this grace and freeness of his heart is limited to time and day the which whoso overstandeth shall perish notwithstanding  for as a king who of grace sendeth out to his rebellious people an offer of pardon if they accept thereof by such a day yet beheadeth or hangeth those that come not in for mercy until the day or time be past so christ jesus has set the sinner a day a day of salvation an acceptable time but he who standeth out or goeth on in rebellion beyond that time is like to come off with the loss of his soul 2 cor vi 2 heb iii 13 16 17 18 19 chap iv 7 luke xix 41 42  since therefore things are thus it may be convenient here to touch a little upon these particulars  first that this day or time thus limited when it is considered with reference to this or that man is ofttimes undiscerned by the person concerned therein and always is kept secret as to the shutting up thereof  and this in the wisdom of god is thus to the end no man when called upon should put off turning to god to another time  now and today is that and only that which is revealed in holy writ psal 1 22 eccles xii 1 heb iii 13 16  and this shews us the desperate hazards which those men run who when invitation or conviction attends them put off turning to god to be saved till another and as they think a more fit season and time for many by so doing defer this to do till the day of gods patience and longsuffering is ended and then for their prayers and cries after mercy they receive nothing but mocks and are laughed at by the god of heaven prov i 2030 isaiah lxv 1216 chap lxvi 4 zech xii 1113  secondly another thing to be considered is this viz that the day of gods grace with some men begins sooner and also sooner ends than it doth with others  those at the first hour of the day had their call sooner than they who were called upon to turn to god at the sixth hour of the day yea and they who were hired at the third hour had their call sooner than they who were called at the eleventh matt xx 16  1  the day of gods patience began with ishmael and also ended before he was twenty years old  at thirteen years of age he was circumcised the next year after isaac was born and then ishmael was fourteen years old  now that day that isaac was weaned that day was ishmael rejected and suppose that isaac was three years old before he was weaned that was but the seventeenth year of ishmael wherefore the day of gods grace was ended with him betimes gen xvii 24 25 chap xxi 211 gal iv 30  2  cains day ended with him betimes for after god had rejected him he lived to beget many children and build a city and to do many other things  but alas all that while he was a fugitive and a vagabond  nor carried he any thing with him after the day of his rejection was come but this doleful language in his conscience from gods face shall i be hid gen iv 1015  3  esau through his extravagancies would needs go to sell his birthright not fearing as other confident fools but that yet the blessing would still be his after which he lived many years but all of them under the wrath of god as was when time came made appear to his destruction for when he would have inherited the blessing he was rejected for he found no place of repentance though he sought it carefully with tears heb xii 1416  many instances might be given as to such tokens of the displeasure of god against such as fool away as the wise man has it the prize which is put into their hand prov xvii 16  let these things therefore be a further caution to those that sit under the glorious sound of the gospel and hear of the riches of the grace of god in christ to poor sinners  to slight grace to despise mercy and to stop the ear when god speaks when he speaks such great things so much to our profit is a great provocation  he offereth he calls he woos he invites he prays he beseeches us in this day of his grace to be reconciled to him yea and has provided for us the means of reconciliation himself  now this despised must needs be provoking and it is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living god  but some man may say unto me fain i would be saved fain i would be saved by christ but i fear this day of grace is past and that i shall perish notwithstanding the exceeding riches of the grace of god  answer  to this doubt i would answer several things  first with respect to this day  secondly with respect to thy desires  thirdly with respect to thy fears  first with respect to the day that is whether it be ended with a man or no  1  art thou jogged and shaken and molested at the hearing of the word  is thy conscience awakened and convinced then that thou art at present in a perishing state and that thou hast need to cry to god for mercy  this is a hopeful sign that this day of grace is not past with thee  for usually they that are past grace are also in their conscience past feeling being seared with an hot iron eph iv 18 19 1 tim iv 1 2  consequently those past grace must be such as are denied the awakening fruits of the word preached  the dead that hear says christ shall live at least while christ has not quite done with them the day of gods patience is not at an end with them john v 25  2  is there in thy more retired condition arguings strugglings and strivings with thy spirit to persuade thee of the vanity of what vain things thou lovest and to win thee in thy soul to a choice of christ jesus and his heavenly things  take heed and rebel not for the day of gods grace and patience will not be past with thee till he saith his spirit shall strive no more with thee for then the woe comes when he shall depart from them and when he says to the means of grace let them alone hos iv 17 chap ix 12  3  art thou visited in the nightseasons with dreams about thy state and that thou art in danger of being lost  hast thou heart shaken apprehensions when deep sleep is upon thee of hell death and judgment to come  these are signs that god has not wholly left thee or cast thee behind his back for ever  for god speaketh once yea twice yet man perceiveth it not in a dream in a vision of the night when deep sleep falleth upon men in slumberings upon the bed then he openeth the ears of men and sealeth their instruction that he may withdraw man from his purpose his sinful purposes and hide pride from man job xxxiii 1417  all this while god has not left the sinner nor is come to the end of his patience towards him but stands at least with the door of grace ajar in his hand as being loth as yet to bolt it against him  4  art thou followed with affliction and dost thou hear gods angry voice in thy afflictions  doth he send with thy affliction an interpreter to shew thee thy vileness and why or wherefore the hand of god is upon thee and upon what thou hast to wit that it is for thy sinning against him and that thou mightest be turned to him if so thy summer is not quite ended thy harvest is not quite over and gone  take heed stand out no longer lest he cause darkness and lest thy feet stumble upon the dark mountains and lest while you look for light he turn it into the shadow of death and make it gross darkness jer viii 20 chap xiii 1517  5  art thou crossed disappointed and waylaid and overthrown in all thy foolish ways and doings  this is a sign god has not quite left thee but that he still waits upon thee to turn thee  consider i say has he made a hedge and a wall to stop thee  has he crossed thee in all thou puttest thy hand unto  take it as a call to turn to him for by his thus doing he shews he has a mind to give thee a better portion  for usually when god gives up men and resolves to let them alone in the broad way he gives them rope and lets them have their desires in all hurtful things hos ii 615 psalm lxxiii 313 rom xi 9  therefore take heed to this also that thou strive not against this hand of god but betake thyself to a serious inquiry into the causes of this hand of god upon thee and incline to think it is because the lord would have thee look to that which is better than what thou wouldst satisfy thyself withal  when god had a mind to make the prodigal go home to his father he sent a famine upon him and denied him a bellyful of the husks which the swine did eat  and observe it now he was in a strait he betook him to consideration of the good that there was in his fathers house yea he resolved to go home to his father and his father dealt well with him he received him with music and dancing because he had received him safe and sound luke xv 1432  6  hast then any enticing thoughts of the word of god upon thy mind doth as it were some holy word of god give a glance upon thee cast a smile upon thee let fall though it be but one drop of its savour upon thy spirit yea though it stays but one moment with thee  o then the day of grace is not past  the gate of heaven is not shut nor gods heart and bowels withdrawn from thee as yet  take heed therefore and beware that thou make much of the heavenly gift and of that good word of god of the which he has made thee taste beware i say and take heed there may be a falling away for all this but i say as yet god has not left thee as yet he has not cast thee off heb vi 19  secondly with respect to thy desires what are they  wouldst thou be saved  wouldst thou be saved with a thorough salvation  wouldst thou be saved from guilt and filth too  wouldst thou be the servant of thy saviour  art thou indeed weary of the service of thy old master the devil sin and the world  and have these desires put thy soul to flight  hast thou through desires betaken thyself to thy heels  dost fly to him that is a saviour from the wrath to come for life  if these be thy desires and if they be unfeigned fear not thou art one of those runaways which god has commanded our lord to receive and not to send thee back to the devil thy master again but to give thee a place in his house even the place which liketh thee best  thou shalt not deliver to his master says he the servant which is escaped from his master unto thee  he shall dwell with thee even among you in that place which he shall choose in one of thy gates where it liketh him best thou shalt not oppress him deut xxiii 15 16  this is a command to the church consequently to the head of the church for all commands from god come to her through her head whence i conclude that as israel of old was to receive the runaway servant who escaped from a heathen master to them and should not dare to send him back to his master again so christs church now and consequently christ himself may not will not refuse that soul that has made his escape from sin satan the world and hell unto him but will certainly let him dwell in his house among his saints in that place which he shall choose even where it liketh him best for he says in another place and him that cometh to me i will in no wise cast out  in no wise let his crimes be what they will either for nature multitude or the attendance of aggravating circumstances  wherefore if thy desires be firm sound and unfeigned to become the saved of christ and his servant fear not he will not he will in no wise put thee away or turn thee over to thy old master again  thirdly as to they fears whatever they are let that be supposed which is supposed before and they are groundless and so of no weight  object  but i am afraid i am not elected or chosen to salvation though you called me fool a little before for so fearing  ans  though election is in order before calling as to god yet the knowledge of calling must go before the belief of my election as to myself  wherefore souls that doubt of the truth of their effectual calling do but plunge themselves into a deeper labyrinth of confusion that concern themselves with their election i mean while they labour to know it before they prove their calling  make your calling and so your election sure 2 pet i 411  wherefore at present lay the thoughts of thy election by and ask thyself these questions  do i see my lost condition  do i see salvation is nowhere but in christ  would i share in this salvation by faith in him  and would i as was said before be thoroughly saved to wit from the filth as from the guilt  do i love christ his father his saints his words and ways  this is the way to prove we are elect  wherefore sinner when satan or thine own heart seeks to puzzle thee with election say thou i cannot attend to talk of this point now but stay till i know that i am called of god to the fellowship of his son and then i will shew you that i am elect and that my name is written in the book of life  if poor distressed souls would observe this order they might save themselves the trouble of an unprofitable labour under these unreasonable and soulsinking doubts  let us therefore upon the sight of our wretchedness fly and venturously leap into the arms of christ which are now as open to receive us into his bosom as they were when nailed to the cross this is coming to christ for life aright this is right running away from thy master to him as was said before  and for this we have multitudes of scriptures to support encourage and comfort us in our so doing  but now let him that doth thus be sure to look for it for satan will be with him tomorrow to see if he can get him again to his old service and if he cannot do that then will he enter into dispute with him to wit about whether he be elect to life and called indeed to partake of this christ to whom he is fled for succour or whether he comes to him of his own presumptuous mind  therefore we are bid as to come so to arm ourselves with that armour which god has provided that we may resist quench stand against and withstand all the fiery darts of the devil eph vi 1118  if therefore thou findest satan in this order to march against thee remember then thou hadst this item about it and betake thyself to faith and good courage and be sober and hope to the end  object  but how if i should have sinned the sin unpardonable or that called the sin against the holy ghost  answer  if thou hast thou art lost for ever but yet before it is concluded by thee that thou hast so sinned know that they that would be saved by jesus christ through faith in his blood cannot be counted for such  1  because of the promise for that must not be frustrated  and that says and him that cometh to christ he will in no wise cast out  and again whoso will let him take of the water of life freely john vi 37 rev xxi 6 chap xxii 17  but i say how can these scriptures be fulfilled if he that would indeed be saved as before has sinned the sin unpardonable  the scriptures must not be made void nor their truth be cast to the ground  here is a promise and here is a sinner a promise that says he shall not be cast out that comes and the sinner comes wherefore he must be received  consequently he that comes to christ for life has not cannot have sinned that sin for which there is no forgiveness  and this might suffice for an answer to any coming soul that fears though he comes that he has sinned the sin against the holy ghost  2  but again he that has sinned the sin against the holy ghost cannot come has no heart to come can by no means be made willing to come to jesus christ for life for that he has received such an opinion of him and of his things as deters and holds him back  1  he counteth this blessed person the son of god a magician a conjuror a witch or one that did when he was in the world what he did by the power and spirit of the devil matt ix 34 chap xii 24 25 c mark iii 2230  now he that has this opinion of this jesus cannot be willing to cast himself at his feet for life or to come to him as the only way to god and to salvation  and hence it is said again that such an one puts him to open shame and treadeth him under foot that is by contemning reproaching vilifying and despising of him as if he were the vilest one or the greatest cheat in the world  and has therefore as to his esteem of him called him accursed crucified him to himself or counted him one hanged as one of the worst of malefactors heb vi 6 chap x 29 1 cor xii 3  2  his blood which is the meritorious cause of mans redemption even the blood of the everlasting covenant he counteth an unholy thing or that which has no more virtue in it to save a soul from sin than has the blood of a dog heb x 29  for when the apostle says he counts it an unholy thing he means he makes it of less value than that of a sheep or cow which were clean according to the law and therefore must mean that his blood was of no more worth to him in his account than was the blood of a dog an ass or a swine which always was as to sacrifices rejected by the god of heaven as unholy or unclean  now he who has no better esteem of jesus christ and of his death and blood will not be persuaded to come to him for life or to trust in him for salvation  3  but further all this must be done against manifest tokens to prove the contrary or after the shining of gospel light upon the soul or some considerable profession of him as the messiah or that he was the saviour of the world  1  it must be done against manifest tokens to prove the contrary and thus the reprobate jews committed it when they saw the works of god which put forth themselves in him and called them the works of the devil and beelzebub  2  it must be done against some shining light of the gospel upon them  and thus it was with judas and with those who after they were enlightened and had tasted and had felt something of the powers of the world to come fell away from the faith of him and put him to open shame and disgrace heb vi 5 6  3  it must also be done after and in opposition to ones own open profession of him  for if after they have escaped the pollution of the world through the knowledge of our lord and saviour jesus christ they are again entangled therein and overcome the latter end is worse with them than the beginning for it had been better for them not to have known the way of righteousness than after they have known it to turn from the holy commandment which is the word of faith delivered unto them  4  all this must be done openly before witnesses in the face sight and view of the world by word and act  this is the sin that is unpardonable and he that hath thus done can never it is impossible he ever should be renewed again to repentance and that for a double reason for such an one doth say he will not and of him god says he shall not have the benefit of salvation by him  object  but if this be the sin unpardonable why is it called the sin against the holy ghost and not rather the sin against the son of god  answ  it is called the sin against the holy ghost because such count the works he did which were done by the spirit of god the works of the spirit of the devil  also because all such as so reject christ jesus the lord they do it in despite of that testimony which the holy ghost has given of him in the holy scriptures for the scriptures are the breathings of the holy ghost as in all other things so in that testimony they bear of the person of the works sufferings resurrection and ascension of jesus christ  sinner this is the sin against the holy ghost  what sayst thou hast thou committed it  nay i know thou hast not if thou wouldst be saved by christ  yea it is impossible that thou shouldst have done it if indeed thou wouldst be saved by him  no man can desire to be saved by him whom he yet judgeth to be an impostor a magician a witch  no man can hope for redemption by that blood which he yet counteth an unholy thing  nor will god ever suffer such an one to repent who has after light and profession of him thus horribly and devillike contemned and trampled upon him  true words and wars and blasphemies against this son of man are pardonable but then they must be done ignorantly and in unbelief also all blasphemous thoughts are likewise such as may be passed by if the soul afflicted with them indeed is sorry for them 1 tim i 1315 mar iii 28  all but this sinner all but this  if god had said he will forgive one sin it had been undeserved grace but when he says he will pardon all but one this is grace to the height  nor is that one unpardonable otherwise but because the saviour that should save them is rejected and put away  we read of jacobs ladder christ is jacobs ladder that reacheth up to heaven and he that refuseth to go by this ladder thither will scarce by other means get up so high  there is none other name given under heaven among men whereby we must be saved  there is none other sacrifice for sin than this he also and he only is the mediator that reconcileth men to god  and sinner if thou wouldst be saved by him his benefits are thine yea though thou art a great and jerusalem transgressor
