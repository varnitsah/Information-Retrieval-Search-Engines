little shop at new romney   §1  until he was nearly arrived at adolescence it did not become clear to kipps how it was that he was under the care of an aunt and uncle instead of having a father and mother like other boys yet he had vague memories of a somewhere else that was not new romneyof a dim room a window looking down on white buildingsand of a some one else who talked to forgotten people and who was his mother he could not recall her features very distinctly but he remembered with extreme definition a white dress she wore with a pattern of little sprigs of flowers and little bows of ribbon upon it and a girdle of straightribbed white ribbon about the waist linked with this he knew not how were clouded halfobliterated recollections of scenes in which there was weeping weeping in which he was inscrutably moved to join some terrible tall man with a loud voice played a part in these scenes and either before or after them there were impressions of looking for interminable periods out of the windows of railway trains in the company of these two people  he knew though he could not remember that he had ever been told that a certain faded wistful face that looked at him from a plush and gilt framed daguerreotype above the mantel of the sittingroom was the face of his mother but that knowledge did not touch his dim memories with any elucidation in that photograph she was a girlish figure leaning against a photographers stile and with all the selfconscious shrinking natural to that position she had curly hair and a face far younger and prettier than any other mother in his experience she swung a dolly varden hat by the string and looked with obedient respectful eyes on the photographergentleman who had commanded the pose she was very slight and pretty but the phantom mother that haunted his memory so elusively was not like that though he could not remember how she differed perhaps she was older or a little less shrinking or it may be only dressed in a different way  it is clear she handed him over to his aunt and uncle at new romney with explicit directions and a certain endowment one gathers she had something of that fine sense of social distinctions that subsequently played so large a part in kipps career he was not to go to a common school she provided but to a certain seminary in hastings that was not only a middleclass academy with mortar boards and every evidence of a higher social tone but also remarkably cheap she seems to have been animated by the desire to do her best for kipps even at a certain sacrifice of herself as though kipps were in some way a superior sort of person she sent pocketmoney to him from time to time for a year or more after hastings had begun for him but her face he never saw in the days of his lucid memory  his aunt and uncle were already high on the hill of life when first he came to them they had married for comfort in the evening or at any rate in the late afternoon of their days they were at first no more than vague figures in the background of proximate realities such realities as familiar chairs and tables quiet to ride and drive the newel of the staircase kitchen furniture pieces of firewood the boiler tap old newspapers the cat the high street the back yard and the flat fields that are always so near in that little town he knew all the stones in the yard individually the creeper in the corner the dustbin and the mossy wall better than many men know the faces of their wives there was a corner under the ironingboard which by means of a shawl could under propitious gods be made a very decent cubbyhouse a corner that served him for several years as the indisputable hub of the world and the stringy places in the carpet the knots upon the dresser and the several corners of the rag hearthrug his uncle had made became essential parts of his mental foundations the shop he did not know so thoroughlyit was a forbidden region to him yet somehow he managed to know it very well  his aunt and uncle were as it were the immediate gods of this world and like the gods of the world of old occasionally descended right into it with arbitrary injunctions and disproportionate punishments and unhappily one rose to their olympian level at meals then one had to say ones grace hold ones spoon and fork in mad unnatural ways called properly and refrain from eating even nice sweet things too fast if he gobbled there was trouble and at the slightest abandon with knife fork and spoon his aunt rapped his knuckles albeit his uncle always finished up his gravy with his knife sometimes moreover his uncle would come pipe in hand out of a sedentary remoteness in the most disconcerting way when a little boy was doing the most natural and attractive things with drat and drabbit that young rascal whats he adoing of now and his aunt would appear at door or window to interrupt interesting conversation with children who were upon unknown grounds considered low and undesirable and call him in the pleasantest little noises however softly you did themdrumming on teatrays trumpeting your fists whistling on keys ringing chimes with a couple of pails or playing tunes on the windowpanesbrought down the gods in anger yet what noise is fainter than your finger on the windowgently done sometimes however these gods gave him broken toys out of the shop and then one loved them betterfor the shop they kept was among other things a toy shop the other things included books to read and books to give away and local photographs it had some pretensions also to be a china shop and the fascia spoke of glass it was also a stationers shop with a touch of haberdashery about it and in the windows and odd corners were mats and terracotta dishes and milkingstools for painting and there was a hint of pictureframes and firescreens and fishing tackle and airguns and bathing suits and tents various things indeed but all cruelly attractive to a small boys fingers once his aunt gave him a trumpet if he would promise faithfully not to blow it and afterwards took it away again and his aunt made him say his catechism and something she certainly called the colic for the day every sunday in the year  as the two grew old while he grew up and as his impression of them modified insensibly from year to year it seemed to him at last that they had always been as they were when in his adolescent days his impression of things grew fixed his aunt he thought of as always lean rather worriedlooking and prone to a certain obliquity of cap and his uncle massive manychinned and careless about his buttons they neither visited nor received visitors they were always very suspicious about their neighbours and other people generally they feared the low and they hated and despised the stuckup and so they kept themselves to themselves according to the english ideal consequently little kipps had no playmates except through the sin of disobedience by inherent nature he had a sociable disposition when he was in the high street he made a point of saying hello to passing cyclists and he would put his tongue out at the quodling children whenever their nursemaid was not looking and he began a friendship with sid pornick the son of the haberdasher next door that with wide intermissions was destined to last his lifetime through  pornick the haberdasher i may say at once was according to old kipps a blaring jackass he was a teetotaller a nyar nyar imsinging methodis and altogether distasteful and detrimental he and his together to true kipps ideals so far as little kipps could gather them this pornick certainly possessed an enormous voice and he annoyed old kipps greatly by calling youarn and siddee up and down his house he annoyed old kipps by private choral services on sunday all his family nyar nyaring and by mushroom culture by behaving as though the pilaster between the two shops was common property by making a noise of hammering in the afternoon when old kipps wanted to be quiet after his midday meal by going up and down uncarpeted stairs in his boots by having a black beard by attempting to be friendly and byall that sort of thing in fact he annoyed old kipps he annoyed him especially with his shop doormat old kipps never beat his mat preferring to let sleeping dust lie and seeking a motive for a foolish proceeding he held that pornick waited until there was a suitable wind in order that the dust disengaged in that operation might defile his neighbours shop these issues would frequently develop into loud and vehement quarrels and on one occasion came so near to violence as to be subsequently described by pornick who read his newspaper as a disgraceful frackass on that occasion he certainly went into his own shop with extreme celerity  but it was through one of these quarrels that the friendship of little kipps and sid pornick came about the two small boys found themselves one day looking through the gate at the doctors goats together they exchanged a few contradictions about which goat could fight which and then young kipps was moved to remark that sids father was a blaring jackass sid said he wasnt and kipps repeated that he was and quoted his authority then sid flying off at a tangent rather alarmingly said he could fight young kipps with one hand an assertion young kipps with a secret want of confidence denied there were some vain repetitions and the incident might have ended there but happily a sporting butcher boy chanced on the controversy at this stage and insisted upon seeing fair play  the two small boys under his pressing encouragement did at last button up their jackets square and fight an edifying drawn battle until it seemed good to the butcher boy to go on with mrs holyers mutton then according to his directions and under his experienced stage management they shook hands and made it up subsequently a little tearstained perhaps but flushed with the butcher boys approval tough little kids and with cold stones down their necks as he advised they sat side by side on the doctors gate projecting very much behind staunching an honourable bloodshed and expressing respect for one another each had a bloody nose and a black eyethree days later they matched to a shadeneither had given in and though this was tacit neither wanted any more  it was an excellent beginning after this first encounter the attributes of their parents and their own relative value in battle never rose between them and if anything was wanted to complete the warmth of their regard it was found in a joint dislike of the eldest quodling the eldest quodling lisped had a silly sort of straw hat and a large pink face all covered over with selfsatisfaction and he went to the national school with a green baize baga contemptible thing to do they called him names and threw stones at him and when he replied by threatenings look ere young art kipth you better thtoppit they were moved to attack and put him to flight  and after that they broke the head of ann pornicks doll so that she went home weeping loudlya wicked and endearing proceeding sid was whacked but as he explained he wore a newspaper tactically adjusted during the transaction and really it didnt hurt him at all and mrs pornick put her head out of the shop door suddenly and threatened kipps as he passed   §2  cavendish academy the school that had won the limited choice of kipps vanished mother was established in a battered private house in the part of hastings remotest from the sea it was called an academy for young gentlemen and many of the young gentlemen had parents in india and other unverifiable places others were the sons of credulous widows anxious as kipps mother had been to get something a little superior to a board school education as cheaply as possible and others again were sent to demonstrate the dignity of their parents and guardians and of course there were boys from france  its principal was a lean long creature of indifferent digestion and temper who proclaimed himself on a giltlettered board in his front garden george garden woodrow fssc letters indicating that he had paid certain guineas for a bogus diploma a bleak whitewashed outhouse constituted his schoolroom and the scholastic quality of its carved and worn desks and forms was enhanced by a slippery blackboard and two large yellow outofdate maps one of africa and the other of wiltshire that he had picked up cheap at a sale there were other maps and globes in his study where he interviewed inquiring parents but these his pupils never saw and in a glass cupboard in the passage was several shillingsworth of test tubes and chemicals a tripod a glass retort and a damaged bunsen burner manifesting that the scientific laboratory mentioned in the prospectus was no idle boast  this prospectus which was in dignified but incorrect english laid particular stress on the sound preparation for a commercial career given in the academy but the army navy and civil service were glanced at in an ambiguous sentence there was something vague in the prospectus about examinational successesthough woodrow of course disapproved of cramand a declaration that the curriculum included art modern foreign languages and a sound technical and scientific training then came insistence upon the moral wellbeing of the pupils and an emphatic boast of the excellence of the religious instruction so often neglected nowadays even in schools of wide repute thats bound to fetch em mr woodrow had remarked when he drew up the prospectus and in conjunction with the mortarboards it certainly did attention was directed to the motherly care of mrs woodrowin reality a small partially effaced woman with a plaintive face and a mind above cookery and the prospectus concluded with a phrase intentionally vague fare unrestricted and our own milk and produce  the memories kipps carried from that school into after life were set in an atmosphere of stuffiness and mental muddle and included countless pictures of sitting on creaking forms bored and idle of blot licking and the taste of ink of torn books with covers that set ones teeth on edge of the slimy surface of the laboured slates of furtive marbleplaying whispered storytelling and of pinches blows and a thousand such petty annoyances being perpetually passed on according to the custom of the place of standing up in class and being hit suddenly and unreasonably for imaginary misbehaviour of mr woodrows raving days when a scarcely sane injustice prevailed of the cold vacuity of the hour of preparation before the breadandbutter breakfast and of horrible headaches and queer unprecedented internal feelings resulting from mrs woodrows motherly rather than intelligent cookery there were dreary walks when the boys marched two by two all dressed in the mortarboard caps that so impressed the widowed mothers there were dismal halfholidays when the weather was wet and the spirit of evil temper and evil imagination had the pent boys to work its will on there were unfair dishonourable fights and miserable defeats and victories there was bullying and being bullied a coward boy kipps particularly afflicted until at last he was goaded to revolt by incessant persecution and smote kipps to tolerance with whirling fists there were memories of sleeping three in a bed of the dense leathery smell of the schoolroom when one returned thither after ten minutes play of a playground of mud and incidental sharp flints and there was much furtive foul language  our sundays are our happiest days was one of woodrows formulæ with the inquiring parent but kipps was not called in evidence they were to him terrible gaps of inanityno work no play a drear expanse of time with the mystery of church twice and plum duff once in the middle the afternoon was given up to furtive relaxations among which torture chamber games with the less agreeable weaker boys figured it was from the difference between this day and common days that kipps derived his first definite conceptions of the nature of god and heaven his instinct was to evade any closer acquaintance as long as he could  the school work varied according to the prevailing mood of mr woodrow sometimes that was a despondent lethargy copybooks were distributed or sums were set or the great mystery of bookkeeping was declared in being and beneath these superficial activities lengthy conversations and interminable guessing games with marbles went on while mr woodrow sat inanimate at his desk heedless of school affairs staring in front of him at unseen things at times his face was utterly inane at times it had an expression of stagnant amazement as if he saw before his eyes with pitiless clearness the dishonour and mischief of his being  at other times the fssc roused himself to action and would stand up a wavering class and teach it goading it with bitter mockery and blows through a chapter of anns first french course or france and the french or a dialogue about a travellers washing or the parts of an operahouse his own knowledge of french had been obtained years ago in another english private school and he had refreshed it by occasional weeks of loafing and mean adventure in dieppe he would sometimes in their lessons hit upon some reminiscence of these brighter days and then he would laugh inexplicably and repeat french phrases of an unfamiliar type  among the commoner exercises he prescribed the learning of long passages of poetry from a poetry book which he would delegate an elder boy to hear and there was reading aloud from the holy bible verse by verseit was none of your godless schoolsso that you counted the verses up to your turn and then gave yourself to conversationand sometimes one read from a cheap history of this land they did as kipps reported loads of catechism also there was much learning of geographical names and lists and sometimes woodrow in an outbreak of energy would see these names were actually found on a map and once just once there was a chemistry lessona lesson of indescribable excitementglass things of the strangest shape a smell like bad eggs something bubbling in something a smash and stench and mr woodrow saying quite distinctlythey thrashed it out in the dormitory afterwardsdamn followed by the whole school being kept in with extraordinary severities for an hour  but interspersed with the memories of this grey routine were certain patches of brilliant colourthe holidays his holidays which in spite of the feud between their seniors he spent as much as possible with sid pornick the son of the irascible blackbearded haberdasher next door they seemed to be memories of a different world there were glorious days of mucking about along the beach the siege of unresisting martello towers the incessant interest of the mystery and motion of windmills the windy excursions with boarded feet over the yielding shingle to dungeness lighthousesid pornick and he far adrift from reality smugglers and armed men from the moment they left great stone behind themwanderings in the hedgeless reedy marsh long excursions reaching even to hythe where the machine guns of the empire are forever whirling and tapping and to rye and winchelsea perched like dreamcities on their little hills the sky in these memories was the blazing hemisphere of the marsh heavens in summer or its wintry tumult of sky and sea and there were wrecks real wrecks in it near dymchurch pitched high and blackened and rotting were the ribs of a fishing smack flung aside like an empty basket when the sea had devoured its crew and there was bathing all naked in the sea bathing to ones armpits and even trying to swim in the warm seawater spite of his aunts prohibition and with her indulgence the rare eating of dinner from a paper parcel miles away from home toke and cold ground rice pudding with plums it used to bethere is no better food at all and for the background in the place of woodrows mean fretting rule were his aunts spare but frequently quite amiable figurefor though she insisted on his repeating the english church catechism every sunday she had an easy way over dinners that one wanted to take abroadand his uncle corpulent and irascible but sedentary and easily escaped and freedom  the holidays were indeed very different from school they were free they were spacious and though he never knew it in these wordsthey had an element of beauty in his memory of his boyhood they shone like strips of stained glass window in a dreary waste of scholastic wall they grew brighter and brighter as they grew remoter there came a time at last and moods when he could look back to them with a feeling akin to tears  the last of these windows was the brightest and instead of the kaleidoscopic effects of its predecessors its glory was a single figure for in the last of his holidays before the moloch of retail trade got hold of him kipps made his first tentative essays at the mysterious shrine of love very tentative they were for he had become a boy of subdued passions and potential rather than actual affectionateness  and the objects of these first stirrings of the great desire was no other than ann pornick the head of whose doll he and sid had broken long ago and rejoiced over long ago in the days when he had yet to learn the meaning of a heart   §3  negotiations were already on foot to make kipps into a draper before he discovered the lights that lurked in ann pornicks eyes school was over absolutely over and it was chiefly present to him that he was never to go to school again it was high summer the breaking up of school had been hilarious and the excellent maxim last days pay day had been observed by him with a scrupulous attention to his honour he had punched the heads of all his enemies wrung wrists and kicked shins he had distributed all his unfinished copybooks all his school books his collection of marbles and his mortarboard cap among such as loved him and he had secretly written in obscure pages of their books remember art kipps he had also split the anæmic woodrows cane carved his own name deeply in several places about the premises and broken the scullery window he had told everybody so often that he was to learn to be a sea captain that he had come almost to believe the thing himself and now he was home and school was at an end for him for evermore  he was up before six on the day of his return and out in the hot sunlight of the yard he set himself to whistle a peculiarly penetrating arrangement of three notes supposed by the boys of the hastings academy and himself and sid pornick for no earthly reason whatever to be the original huron warcry as he did this he feigned not to be doing it because of the hatred between his uncle and the pornicks but to be examining with respect and admiration a new wing of the dustbin recently erected by his unclea pretence that would not have deceived a nestling tomtit  presently there came a familiar echo from the pornick huntingground then kipps began to sing ar pars eight trala in the lane beind the church to which an unseen person answered ar pars eight it is in the lane beind the church the trala was considered to render this sentence incomprehensible to the uninitiated in order to conceal their operations still more securely both parties to this duet then gave vent to a vocalisation of the huron warcry again and after a lingering repetition of the last and shrillest note dispersed severally as became boys in the enjoyment of holidays to light the house fires for the day  halfpast eight found kipps sitting on the sunlit gate at the top of the long lane that runs towards the sea clashing his boots in a slow rhythm and whistling with great violence all that he knew of an excruciatingly pathetic air there appeared along by the churchyard wall a girl in a short frock brownhaired quickcoloured and with dark blue eyes she had grown so that she was a little taller than kipps and her colour had improved he scarcely remembered her so changed was she since last holidaysif indeed he had seen her last holidays a thing he could not clearly remember some vague emotion arose at the sight of her he stopped whistling and regarded her oddly tonguetied  he cant come said ann advancing boldly not yet  whatnot sid  no fathers made him dust all his boxes again  what for  i dunno fathers in a stew smorning  oh  pause kipps looked at her and then was unable to look at her again she regarded him with interest you left school she remarked after a pause  yes  sos sid  the conversation languished ann put her hands on the top of the gate and began a stationary hopping a sort of ineffectual gymnastic experiment  can you run she said presently  run you any day said kipps  gimme a start  where for said kipps  ann considered and indicated a tree she walked towards it and turned gimme to here she called  kipps standing now and touching the gate smiled to express conscious superiority further he said  here  bit more said kipps and then repenting of his magnanimity said orf suddenly and so recovered his lost concession  they arrived abreast at the tree flushed and out of breath  tie said ann throwing her hair back from her face with her hand  i won panted kipps  they disputed firmly but quite politely  run it again then said kipps i dont mind  they returned towards the gate  you dont run bad said kipps temperately expressing sincere admiration im pretty good you know  ann sent her hair back by an expert toss of the head you give me a start she allowed  they became aware of sid approaching them  you better look out young ann said sid with that irreverent want of sympathy usual in brothers you been out nearly arfhour nothing aint been done upstairs father said he didnt know where you was but when he did hed warm yr young ear  ann prepared to go  how about that race asked kipps  lor cried sid quite shocked you aint been racing her  ann swung herself round the end of the gate with her eyes on kipps and then turned away suddenly and ran off down the lane  kipps eyes tried to go after her and came back to sids  i give her a lot of start said kipps apologetically it wasnt a proper race and so the subject was dismissed but kipps was distrait for some seconds perhaps and the mischief had begun in him   §4  they proceeded to the question of how two accomplished hurons might most satisfactorily spend the morning manifestly their line lay straight along the lane to the sea  theres a new wreck said sid and mydont it smell just  smell  fair make you sick its rotten wheat  they fell to talking of wrecks and so came to ironclads and wars and suchlike manly matters  halfway to the wreck kipps made a casual irrelevant remark your sister aint a bad sort he said offhandedly  i clout her a lot said sidney modestly and after a pause the talk reverted to more suitable topics  the new wreck was full of rotting grain and smelt abominably even as sid had said this was excellent they had it all to themselves they took possession of it in force at sids suggestion and had speedily to defend it against enormous numbers of imaginary natives who were at last driven off by loud shouts of bang bang and vigorous thrusting and shoving of sticks then also at sids direction they sailed with it into the midst of a combined french german and russian fleet demolishing the combination unassisted and having descended to the beach clambered up the side and cut out their own vessel in brilliant style they underwent a magnificent shipwreck with vocalised thunder and floated waterloggedso sid insistedupon an exhausted sea  these things drove ann out of mind for a time but at last as they drifted without food or water upon a stagnant ocean haggardeyed chins between their hands looking in vain for a sail she came to mind again abruptly  its rather nice aving sisters remarked one perishing mariner  sid turned round and regarded him thoughtfully not it he said  no  not a bit of it he grinned confidentially know too much he said and afterwards get out of things  he resumed his gloomy scrutiny of the hopeless horizon presently he fell to spitting jerkily between his teeth as he had read was the way with such ripe manhood as chews its quid  sisters he said is rot thats what sisters are girls if you like but sistersno  but aint sisters girls  neaow said sid with unspeakable scorn  and kipps answered of course i didnt mean i wasnt thinking of that  you got a girl asked sid spitting very cleverly again  kipps admitted his deficiency he felt compunction  you dont know who my girl is art kippsi bet  who is then asked kipps still chiefly occupied by his own poverty  ah  kipps let a moment elapse before he did his duty tell us  sid eyed him and hesitated secret he said  secret  dying solemn  dying solemn kipps selfconcentration passed into curiosity  sid administered a terrible oath even after that precaution he adhered lovingly to his facts it begins with a nem he said doling them out parsimoniously m a u d he spelt with a stern eye on kipps c h a r t e r i s  now maud charteris was a young person of eighteen and the daughter of the vicar of st bavonsbesides which she had a bicycleso that as her name unfolded the face of kipps lengthened with respect get out he gasped incredulously she aint your girl sid pornick  she is answered sid stoutly  whattruth  truth  kipps scrutinised his face reely  sid touched wood whistled and repeated a binding doggerel with great solemnity  kipps still struggled with the amazing new light on the world about him dyou meanshe knows  sid flushed deeply and his aspect became stern and gloomy he resumed his wistful scrutiny of the sunlit sea id die for that girl art kipps he said presently and kipps did not press a question he felt to be ill timed id do anything she asked me to do said sidjust anything if she was to ask me to chuck myself into the sea he met kipps eye i would he said  they were pensive for a space and then sid began to discourse in fragments of love a theme upon which kipps had already in a furtive way meditated a little but which apart from badinage he had never yet heard talked about in the light of day of course many and various aspects of life had come to light in the muffled exchange of knowledge that went on under the shadow of woodrow but this of sentimental love was not among them sid who was a boy with an imagination having once broached this topic opened his heart or at any rate a new wing of his heart to kipps and found no fault with kipps for a lack of return he produced a thumbed novelette that had played a part in his sentimental awakening he proffered it to kipps and confessed there was a character in it a baronet singularly like himself this baronet was a person of volcanic passions which he concealed beneath a demeanour of icy cynicism the utmost expression he permitted himself was to grit his teeth and now his attention was called to it kipps remarked that sid also had a habit of gritting his teethand indeed had had all the morning they read for a time and presently sid talked again the conception of love sid made evident was compact of devotion and much spirited fighting and a touch of mystery but through all that cloud of talk there floated before kipps a face that was flushed and hair that was tossed aside  so they budded sitting on the blackening old wreck in which men had lived and died looking out to sea talking of that other sea upon which they must presently embark  they ceased to talk and sid read but kipps falling behind with the reading and not wishing to admit that he read slowlier than sid whose education was of the inferior elementary school brand lapsed into meditation  i would like to ave a girl said kipps i mean just to talk to and all that  a floating object distracted them at last from this obscure topic they abandoned the wreck and followed the new interest a mile along the beach bombarding it with stones until it came to land they had inclined to a view that it would contain romantic mysteries but it was simply an illpreserved kittentoo much even for them and at last they were drawn dinnerward and went home hungry and pensive side by side   §5  but kipps imagination had been warmed by that talk of love and in the afternoon when he saw ann pornick in the high street and said hello it was a different hello from that of their previous intercourse and when they had passed they both looked back and caught each other doing so yes he did want a girl badly  afterwards he was distracted by a traction engine going through the town and his aunt had got some sprats for supper when he was in bed however sentiment came upon him again in a torrent quite abruptly and abundantly and he put his head under the pillow and whispered very softly i love ann pornick as a sort of supplementary devotion  in his subsequent dreams he ran races with ann and they lived in a wreck together and always her face was flushed and her hair about her face they just lived in a wreck and ran races and were very very fond of one another and their favourite food was rockchocolate dates such as one buys off barrows and spratsfried sprats  in the morning he could hear ann singing in the scullery next door he listened to her for some time and it was clear to him that he must put things before her  towards dusk that evening they chanced on one another at the gate by the church but though there was much in his mind it stopped there with a resolute shyness until he and ann were out of breath catching cockchafers and were sitting on that gate of theirs again ann sat up upon the gate dark against vast masses of flaming crimson and darkling purple and her eyes looked at kipps from a shadowed face there came a stillness between them and quite abruptly he was moved to tell his love  ann he said i do like you i wish you was my girl i say ann will you be my girl  ann made no pretence of astonishment she weighed the proposal for a moment with her eyes on kipps if you like artie she said lightly i dont mind if i am  all right said kipps breathless with excitement then you are  all right said ann  something seemed to fall between them and they no longer looked openly at one another lor cried ann suddenly see that one and jumped down and darted after a cockchafer that had boomed within a yard of her face and with that they were girl and boy again  they avoided their new relationship painfully  they did not recur to it for several days though they met twice both felt that there remained something before this great experience was complete but there was an infinite diffidence about the next step kipps talked in fragments of all sorts of matters telling particularly of the great things that were being done to make a man and a draper of him how he had two new pairs of trousers and a black coat and four new shirts and all the while his imagination was urging him to that unknown next step and when he was alone and in the dark he became even an enterprising wooer it became evident to him that it would be nice to take ann by the hand even the decorous novelettes sid affected egged him on to that greater nearness of intimacy  then a great idea came to him in a paragraph called lovers tokens that he read in a torn fragment of tit bits it fell in to the measure of his couragea divided sixpence he secured his aunts best scissors fished a sixpence out of his jejune tin moneybox and jabbed his finger in a varied series of attempts to get it in half when they met again the sixpence was still undivided he had not intended to mention the matter to her at that stage but it came up spontaneously he endeavoured to explain the theory of broken sixpences and his unexpected failure to break one  but what you break it for said ann its no good if its broke  its a token said kipps  like  oh you keep half and i keep half and when were seprated you look at your half and i look at minesee then we think of each other  oh said ann and appeared to assimilate this information  only i cant get it in arf nohow said kipps  they discussed this difficulty for some time without illumination then ann had a happy thought tell you what she said starting away from him abruptly and laying a hand on his arm you let me ave it artie i know where father keeps his file  kipps handed her the sixpence and they came upon a pause  ill easy do it said ann  in considering the sixpence side by side his head had come near her cheek quite abruptly he was moved to take his next step into the unknown mysteries of love  ann he said and gulped at his temerity i do love you straight id do anything for you ann reelyi would  he paused for breath she answered nothing but she was no doubt enjoying herself he came yet closer to herhis shoulder touched hers ann i wish youd  he stopped  what said ann  annlemme kiss you  things seemed to hang for a space his tone the drop of his courage made the thing incredible as he spoke kipps was not of that bold order of wooers who impose conditions  ann perceived that she was not prepared for kissing after all kissing she said was silly and when kipps would have displayed a belated enterprise she flung away from him he essayed argument he stood afar off as it werethe better part of a yardand said she might let him kiss her and then that he didnt see what good it was for her to be his girl if he couldnt kiss her  she repeated that kissing was silly a certain estrangement took them homeward they arrived in the dusky high street not exactly together and not exactly apart but struggling they had not kissed but all the guilt of kissing was between them when kipps saw the portly contours of his uncle standing dimly in the shop doorway his footsteps faltered and the space between our young couple increased above the window over pornicks shop was open and mrs pornick was visible taking the air kipps assumed an expression of extreme innocence he found himself face to face with his uncles advanced outposts of waistcoat buttons  where ye bin my boy  bin for a walk uncle  not along of that brat of pornicks  along of who  that gellindicating ann with his pipe  oh no unclevery faintly  run in my boy  old kipps stood aside with an oblique glance upward and his nephew brushed clumsily by him and vanished out of sight of the street into the vague obscurity of the little shop the door closed behind old kipps with a nervous jangle of its bell and he set himself to light the single oil lamp that illuminated his shop at nights it was an operation requiring care and watching or else it flared and smelt often it smelt after all kipps for some reason found the dusky livingroom with his aunt in it too populous for his feelings and went upstairs  that brat of pornicks it seemed to him that a horrible catastrophe had occurred he felt he had identified himself inextricably with his uncle and cut himself off from her for ever by saying oh no at supper he was so visibly depressed that his aunt asked him if he wasnt feeling well under this imminent threat of medicine he assumed an unnatural cheerfulness  he lay awake for nearly half an hour that night groaning because things had all gone wrongbecause ann wouldnt let him kiss her and because his uncle had called her a brat it seemed to kipps almost as though he himself had called her a brat  there came an interval during which ann was altogether inaccessible one two three days passed and he did not see her sid he met several times they went fishing and twice they bathed but though sid lent and received back two further love stories they talked no more of love they kept themselves in accord however agreeing that the most flagrantly sentimental story was proper kipps was always wanting to speak of ann but never daring to do so he saw her on sunday evening going off to chapel she was more beautiful than ever in her sunday clothes but she pretended not to see him because her mother was with her but he thought she pretended not to see him because she had given him up for ever bratwho could be expected ever to forgive that he abandoned himself to despair he ceased even to haunt the places where she might be found   §6  with paralysing unexpectedness came the end  mr shalford the draper at folkestone to whom he was to be bound apprentice had expressed a wish to shape the lad a bit before the autumn sale kipps became aware that his box was being packed and gathered the full truth of things on the evening before his departure he became feverishly eager to see ann just once more he made silly and needless excuses to go out into the yard he walked three times across the street without any excuse at all to look up at the pornick windows still she was hidden he grew desperate it was within half an hour of his departure that he came on sid  hello he said im orf  business  yes  pause  i say sid you going ome  straight now  dyou mind ask ann about that  about what  shell know  and sid said he would but even that it seemed failed to evoke ann  at last the folkestone bus rumbled up and he ascended his aunt stood in the doorway to see him off his uncle assisted with the box and portmanteau only furtively could he glance up at the pornick windows and still it seemed ann hardened her heart against him get up said the driver and the hoofs began to clatter noshe would not come out even to see him off the bus was in motion and old kipps was going back into his shop kipps stared in front of him assuring himself that he did not care  he heard a door slam and instantly craned out his neck to look back he knew that slam so well behold out of the haberdashers door a small untidy figure in homely pink print had shot resolutely into the road and was sprinting in pursuit in a dozen seconds she was abreast of the bus at the sight of her kipps heart began to beat very quickly but he made no immediate motion of recognition  artie she cried breathlessly artie artie you know i got that  the bus was already quickening its pace and leaving her behind again when kipps realized what that meant he became animated he gasped and gathered his courage together and mumbled an incoherent request to the driver to stop jest a jiff for sunthin the driver grunted as the disparity of their years demanded and then the bus had pulled up and ann was below  she leapt up upon the wheel kipps looked down into anns face and it was foreshortened and resolute he met her eyes just for one second as their hands touched he was not a reader of eyes something passed quickly from hand to hand something that the driver alert at the corner of his eye was not allowed to see kipps hadnt a word to say and all she said was i done it smorning it was like a blank space in which something pregnant should have been written and wasnt then she dropped down and the bus moved forward  after the lapse of about ten seconds it occurred to him to stand and wave his new bowler hat at her over the corner of the bus top and to shout hoarsely goobye ann don forget mewhile im away  she stood in the road looking after him and presently she waved her hand  he remained standing unstably his bright flushed face looking back at her and his hair fluffing in the wind and he waved his hat until at last the bend of the road hid her from his eyes then he turned about and sat down and presently he began to put the half sixpence he held clenched in his hand into his trouser pocket he looked sideways at the driver to judge how much he had seen  then he fell athinking he resolved that come what might when he came back to new romney at christmas he would by hook or by crook kiss ann  then everything would be perfect and right and he would be perfectly happy     chapter ii  the emporium   §1  when kipps left new romney with a small yellow tin box a still smaller portmanteau a new umbrella and a keepsake halfsixpence to become a draper he was a youngster of fourteen thin with whimsical drakes tails at the poll of his head smallish features and eyes that were sometimes very light and sometimes very dark gifts those of his birth and by the nature of his training he was indistinct in his speech confused in his mind and retreating in his manners inexorable fate had appointed him to serve his country in commerce and the same national bias towards private enterprise and leaving bad alone which entrusted his general education to mr woodrow now indentured him firmly into the hands of mr shalford of the folkestone drapery bazaar apprenticeship is still the recognised english way to the distributing branch of the social service if mr kipps had been so unfortunate as to have been born a german he might have been educated in an elaborate and costly special school overeducatedcrammed upold kipps to fit him for his endsuch being their pedagogic way he might but why make unpatriotic reflections in a novel there was nothing pedagogic about mr shalford  he was an irascible energetic little man with hairy hands for the most part under his coat tails a long shiny bald head a pointed aquiline nose a little askew and a neatly trimmed beard he walked lightly and with a confident jerk and he was given to humming he had added to exceptional business push bankruptcy under the old dispensation and judicious matrimony his establishment was now one of the most considerable in folkestone and he insisted on every inch of frontage by alternate stripes of green and yellow down the houses over the shops his shops were numbered 3 5 and 7 on the street and on his billheads 3 to 7 he encountered the abashed and awestricken kipps with the praises of his system and himself he spread himself out behind his desk with a grip on the lapel of his coat and made kipps a sort of speech we expect yr to work yr know and we expect yr to study our interests explained mr shalford in the regal and commercial plural our system here is the best system yr could have i made it and i ought to know i began at the very bottom of the ladder when i was fourteen and there isnt a step in it i dont know not a step mr booch in the desk will give yr the card of rules and fines jest wait a minute he pretended to be busy with some dusty memoranda under a paperweight while kipps stood in a sort of paralysis of awe regarding his new masters oval baldness two thousn three fortyseven pounds whispered mr shalford audibly feigning forgetfulness of kipps clearly a place of great transactions  mr shalford rose and handing kipps a blottingpad and an inkpot to carrymere symbols of servitude for he made no use of thememerged into a countinghouse where three clerks had been feverishly busy ever since his door handle had turned booch said mr shalford ave yr copy of the rules and a downtrodden shabby little old man with a ruler in one hand and a quill pen in his mouth silently held out a small book with green and yellow covers mainly devoted as kipps presently discovered to a voracious system of fines he became acutely aware that his hands were full and that everybody was staring at him he hesitated a moment before putting the inkpot down to free a hand  mustnt fumble like that said mr shalford as kipps pocketed the rules wont do here come along come along and he cocked his coat tails high as a lady might hold up her dress and led the way into the shop  a vast interminable place it seemed to kipps with unending shining counters and innumerable faultlessly dressed young men and presently hourilike young women staring at him here there was a long vista of gloves dangling from overhead rods there ribbons and babylinen a short young lady in black mittens was making out the account of a customer and was clearly confused in her addition by shalfords eagle eye  a thickset young man with a bald head and a round very wise face who was profoundly absorbed in adjusting all the empty chairs down the counter to absolutely equal distances awoke out of his preoccupation and answered respectfully to a few napoleonic and quite unnecessary remarks from his employer kipps was told that this young mans name was mr buggins and that he was to do whatever mr buggins told him to do  they came round a corner into a new smell which was destined to be the smell of kipps life for many years the vague distinctive smell of manchester goods a fat man with a large nose jumpedactually jumpedat their appearance and began to fold a pattern of damask in front of him exactly like an automaton that is suddenly set going  carshot see to this boy tomorrow said the master see he dont fumble smartn im up  yussir said carshot fatly glanced at kipps and resumed his patternfolding with extreme zeal  whatever mr carshot says yr to do ye do said mr shalford trotting onward and carshot blew out his face with an appearance of relief  they crossed a large room full of the strangest things kipps had ever seen ladylike figures surmounted by black wooden knobs in the place of the refined heads one might have reasonably expected stood about with a lifelike air of conscious fashion  costume room said shalford  two voices engaged in some sort of argumenti can assure you miss mergle you are entirely mistakenentirely in supposing i should do anything so unwomanlysank abruptly and they discovered two young ladies taller and fairer than any of the other young ladies and with black trains to their dresses who were engaged in writing at a little table whatever they told him to do kipps gathered he was to do he was also he understood to do whatever carshot and booch told him to do and there were also buggins and mr shalford and not to forget or fumble  they descended into a cellar called the warehouse and kipps had an optical illusion of errand boys fighting some aerial voice said teddy and the illusion passed he looked again and saw quite clearly that they were packing parcels and always would be and that the last thing in the world that they would or could possibly do was to fight yet he gathered from the remarks mr shalford addressed to their busy backs that they had been fightingno doubt at some past period of their lives  emerging in the shop again among a litter of toys and what are called fancy articles shalford withdrew a hand from beneath his coat tails to indicate an overhead changecarrier he entered into elaborate calculations to show how many minutes in one year were saved thereby and lost himself among the figures seven tums eight seven ninewas it or seven eight nine now now why when i was a boy your age i cd do a sum like that as soon as hear it well soon get yr into better shape than that make you fishent well yr must take my word it comes to pounds and pounds saved in the yearpounds and pounds system system everywhere fishency he went on murmuring fishency and system at intervals for some time  they passed into a yard and mr shalford waved his hand to his three delivery vans all striped green and yellowuniformgreen yellrsystem all over the premises were pinned absurd little cards this door locked after 730by order edwin shalford and the like  mr shalford always wrote by order though it conveyed no earthly meaning to him he was one of those people who collect technicalities upon them as the reduvius bug collects dirt he was the sort of man who is not only ignorant but absolutely incapable of english when he wanted to say he had a sixpennyhapenny longcloth to sell he put it thus to startled customers can do you one six half if y like he always omitted pronouns and articles and so forth it seemed to him the very essence of the efficiently businesslike his only preposition was as or the compound as per he abbreviated every word he could he would have considered himself the laughingstock of wood street if he had chanced to spell socks in any way but sox but on the other hand if he saved words here he wasted them there he never acknowledged an order that was not an esteemed favour nor sent a pattern without begging to submit it he never stipulated for so many months credit but bought in november as jan it was not only words he abbreviated in his london communications in paying his wholesalers his system admitted of a constant error in the discount of a penny or twopence and it facilitated business he alleged to ignore odd pence in the cheques he wrote his ledger clerk was so struck with the beauty of this part of the system that he started a private one on his own account with the stamp box that never came to shalfords knowledge  this admirable british merchant would glow with a particular pride of intellect when writing his london orders  ah do yr think youll ever be able to write london orders he would say with honest pride to kipps waiting impatiently long after closing time to take these triumphs of commercial efficiency to post and so end the interminable day  kipps shook his head anxious for mr shalford to get on  now here f example ive writtensee1 piece 1 in cott blk elas 1 or what do i mean by that or ehdye know  kipps promptly hadnt the faintest idea  and then 2 ea silk net as per patts herewith ea eh  dunno sir  it was not mr shalfords way to explain things dear dear pity you couldnt get some cmercial education at your school stid of all this litry stuff well my boy if y dont ussel a bit yll never write london orders thats pretty plain jest stick stamps on all those letters and mind yr stick em right way up and try and profit a little more by the opportunities your aunt and uncle have provided ye cant say whatll happen tye if ye dont  and kipps tired hungry and belated set about stamping with vigour and despatch  lick the envelope said mr shalford lick the envelope as though he grudged the youngster the postagestamp gum its the little things mount up he would say and indeed that was his philosophy of lifeto bustle and save always to bustle and save his political creed linked reform which meant nothing with efficiency which meant a sweated service and economy which meant a sweated expenditure and his conception of a satisfactory municipal life was to keep down the rates even his religion was to save his soul and to preach a similar cheeseparing to the world   §2  the indentures that bound kipps to mr shalford were antique and complex they insisted on the latter gentlemans parental privileges they forbade kipps to dice and game they made him over body and soul to mr shalford for seven long years the crucial years of his life in return there were vague stipulations about teaching the whole art and mystery of the trade to him but as there was no penalty attached to negligence mr shalford being a sound practical business man considered this a mere rhetorical flourish and set himself assiduously to get as much out of kipps and to put as little into him as he could in the seven years of their intercourse  what he put into kipps was chiefly bread and margarine infusions of chicory and teadust colonial meat by contract at threepence a pound potatoes by the sack and watered beer if however kipps chose to buy any supplementary material for growth mr shalford had the generosity to place his kitchen resources at his disposal freeif the fire chanced to be going he was also allowed to share a bedroom with eight other young englishmen and to sleep in a bed which except in very severe weather could be made with the help of his overcoat and private underlinen not to mention newspapers quite sufficiently warm for any reasonable soul in addition kipps was taught the list of fines and how to tie up parcels to know where goods were kept in mr shalfords systematised shop to hold his hands extended upon the counter and to repeat such phrases as what can i have the pleasure no trouble i ssure you and the like to block fold and measure materials of all sorts to lift his hat from his head when he passed mr shalford abroad and to practise a servile obedience to a large number of people but he was not of course taught the cost mark of the goods he sold nor anything of the method of buying such goods nor was his attention directed to the unfamiliar social habits and fashions to which his trade ministered the use of half the goods he saw sold and was presently to assist in selling he did not understand materials for hangings cretonnes chintzes and the like serviettes and all the bright hard white wear of a wellordered house pleasant dress materials linings stiffeningsthey were to him from first to last no more than things heavy and difficult to handle in bulk that one folded up unfolded cut in lengths and saw dwindle and pass away out into that mysterious happy world in which the customer dwells kipps hurried from piling linen tablecloths that were collectively as heavy as lead to eat off oilcloth in a gaslit diningroom underground and he dreamt of combing endless blankets beneath his overcoat spare undershirt and three newspapers so he had at least the chance of learning the beginnings of philosophy  in return for these benefits he worked so that he commonly went to bed exhausted and footsore his round began at halfpast six in the morning when he would descend unwashed and shirtless in old clothes and a scarf and dust boxes and yawn and take down wrappers and clean the windows until eight then in half an hour he would complete his toilet and take an austere breakfast of bread and margarine and what only an imperial englishman would admit to be coffee after which refreshment he ascended to the shop for the labours of the day commonly these began with a mighty running to and fro with planks and boxes and goods for carshot the windowdresser who whether he worked well or ill nagged persistently by reason of a chronic indigestion until the window was done sometimes the costume window had to be dressed and then kipps staggered down the whole length of the shop from the costume room with one after another of those ladylike shapes grasped firmly but shamefully each about her single ankle of wood such days as there was no windowdressing there was a mighty carrying and lifting of blocks and bales of goods into piles and stacks after this there were terrible exercises at first almost despairfully difficult certain sorts of goods that came in folded had to be rolled upon rollers and for the most part refused absolutely to be rolled at any rate by kipps and certain other sorts of goods that came from the wholesalers rolled had to be measured and folded which folding makes young apprentices wish they were dead all of it too quite avoidable trouble you know that is not avoided because of the cheapness of the genteeler sorts of labour and the dearness of forethought in the world and then consignments of new goods had to be marked off and packed into proper parcels and carshot packed like conjuring tricks and kipps packed like a boy with tastes in some other directionnot ascertained and always carshot nagged  he had a curious formula of appeal to his visceral oeconomy had carshot that the refinement of the times and the earnest entreaties of my friends induce me to render by an anæmic paraphrase  my heart and lungs i never see such a boy so i present carshots refrain and even when he was within a foot or so of the customers face the disciplined ear of kipps would still at times develop a featureless intercalary murmur intowell my heart and lungs  there came a blessed interval when kipps was sent abroad matching this consisted chiefly in supplying unexpected defects in buttons ribbon lining and so forth in the dressmaking department he was given a written paper of orders with patterns pinned thereto and discharged into the sunshine and interest of the street then until he thought it wise to return and stand the racket of his delay he was a free man clear of all reproach  he made remarkable discoveries in topography as for example that the most convenient way from the establishment of mr adolphus davis to the establishment of messrs plummer roddis  tyrrel two of his principal places of call is not as is generally supposed down the sandgate road but up the sandgate road round by west terrace and along the leas to the lift watch the lift up and down twice but not longer because that wouldnt do back along the leas watch the harbour for a short time and then round by the churchyard and so hurrying into church street and rendezvous street but on some exceptionally fine days the route lay through radnor park to the pond where the little boys sail ships and there are interesting swans  he would return to find the shop settling down to the business of serving customers and now he had to stand by to furnish any help that was necessary to the seniors who served to carry parcels and bills about the shop to clear away stuff after each engagement to hold up curtains until his arms ached and what was more difficult than all to do nothing and not stare disconcertingly at customers when there was nothing for him to do he plumbed an abyss of boredom or stood a mere carcass with his mind far away fighting the enemies of the empire or steering a dream ship perilously into unknown seas to be recalled sharply to our higher civilisation by some bustling seniors nar then kipps look alive ketch old my heart and lungs  at halfpast seven oclockexcept on late nightsa feverish activity of straightening up began and when the last shutter was up outside kipps with the speed of an arrow leaving a bow would start hanging wrappers over the fixtures and over the piles of wares upon the counters preparatory to a vigorous scattering of wet sawdust and the sweeping out of the shop  sometimes people would stay long after the shop was closedthey dont mind a bit at shalfords these ladies used to sayit is always ladies do this sort of thingand while they loitered it was forbidden to touch a wrapper or take any measures to conclude the day until the doors closed behind them  mr kipps would watch these later customers from the shadow of a stack of goods and death and disfigurement was the least he wished for them rarely much later than nine a supper of bread and cheese and watered beer awaited him upstairs and that consumed the rest of the day was entirely at his disposal for reading recreation and the improvement of his mind  the front door was locked at halfpast ten and the gas in the dormitory extinguished at eleven   §3  on sundays he was obliged to go to church once and commonly he went twice for there was nothing else to do he sat in the free seats at the back he was too shy to sing and not always clever enough to keep his place in the prayerbook and he rarely listened to the sermon but he had developed a sort of idea that going to church had a tendency to alleviate life his aunt wanted to have him confirmed but he evaded this ceremony for some years  in the intervals between services he walked about folkestone with an air of looking for something folkestone was not so interesting on sundays as on weekdays because the shops were shut but on the other hand there was a sort of confusing brilliance along the front of the leas in the afternoon sometimes the apprentice next above him would condescend to go with him but when the apprentice next but one above him condescended to go with the apprentice next above him then kipps being habited as yet in readymade clothes without tails and unsuitable therefore to appear in such company went alone  sometimes he would strike out into the countrystill as if looking for something he missedbut the rope of mealtimes haled him home again and sometimes he would invest the major portion of the weekly allowance of a shilling that old booch handed out to him in a sacred concert on the pier he would sometimes walk up and down the leas between twenty and thirty times after supper desiring much the courage to speak to some other person in the multitude similarly employed almost invariably he ended his sunday footsore  he never read a book there were none for him to read and besides in spite of mr woodrows guidance through a cheap and cheaply annotated edition of the tempest english literature he had no taste that way he never read any newspapers except occasionally titbits or a hapenny comic his chief intellectual stimulus was an occasional argeybargey that sprang up between carshot and buggins at dinner kipps listened as if to unparalleled wisdom and wit and treasured all the gems of repartee in his heart against the time when he too should be a buggins and have the chance and courage for speech  at times there came breaks in this routinesale times darkened by extra toil and work past midnight but brightened by a sprat supper and some shillings in the way of premiums and every yearnot now and then but every yearmr shalford with parenthetic admiration of his own generosity and glancing comparisons with the austerer days when he was apprenticed conceded kipps no less than ten days holidayten whole days every year many a poor soul at portland might well envy the fortunate kipps insatiable heart of man but how those days were grudged and counted as they snatched themselves away from him one after another  once a year came stocktaking and at intervals gusts of marking off goods newly arrived then the splendours of mr shalfords being shone with oppressive brilliancy system he would say system come ussel and issue sharp confusing contradictory orders very quickly carshot trotted about confused perspiring his big nose up in the air his little eye on mr shalford his forehead crinkled his lips always going to the formula oh my heart and lungs the smart junior and the second apprentice vied with one another in obsequious alacrity the smart junior aspired to carshots position and that made him almost violently subservient to shalford they all snapped at kipps kipps held the blottingpad and the safety inkpot and a box of tickets and ran and fetched things if he put the ink down before he went to fetch things mr shalford usually knocked it over and if he took it away mr shalford wanted it before he returned you make my tooth ache kipps mr shalford would say you gimme nralgia you got no more system in you than a bad potato and at the times when kipps carried off the inkpot mr shalford would become purple in the face and jab round with his dry pen at imaginary inkpots and swear and carshot would stand and vociferate and the smart junior would run to the corner of the department and vociferate and the second apprentice would pursue kipps vociferating look alive kipps look alive ink man ink  a vague selfdisgust that shaped itself as an intense hate of shalford and all his fellowcreatures filled the soul of kipps during these periods of storm and stress he felt that the whole business was unjust and idiotic but the why and the wherefore was too much for his unfortunate brain his mind was a welter one desire the desire to dodge some at least of a pelting storm of disagreeable comment guided him through a fumbling performance of his duties his disgust was infinite it was not decreased by the inflamed ankles and sore feet that form a normal incident in the business of making an english draper and the senior apprentice minton a gaunt sullenfaced youngster with closecropped wiry black hair a loose ugly mouth and a moustache like a smudge of ink directed his attention to deeper aspects of the question and sealed his misery  when you get too old to work they chuck you away said minton lor you find old drapers everywheretramps beggars dock labourers bus conductorsquod anywhere but in a crib  dont they get shops of their own  lord ow are they to get shops of their own they avent any capital hows a drapers shopman to save up five hundred pounds even i tell you it cant be done you got to stick to cribs until its over i tell you were in a blessed drainpipe and weve got to crawl along it till we die  the idea that fermented perpetually in the mind of minton was to hit the little beggar slap in the eyethe little beggar being mr shalfordand see how his blessed system met that  the threat filled kipps with splendid anticipations whenever shalford went marking off in mintons department he would look at minton and look at shalford and decide where he would best like shalford hit but for reasons known to himself shalford never pished and tushed with minton as he did at the harmless carshot and this interesting experiment upon the system was never attempted   §4  there were times when kipps would lie awake all others in the dormitory asleep and snoring and think dismally of the outlook minton pictured dimly he perceived the thing that had happened to himhow the great stupid machine of retail trade had caught his life into its wheels a vast irresistible force which he had neither strength of will nor knowledge to escape this was to be his life until his days should end no adventures no glory no change no freedom neitherthough the force of that came home to him latermight he dream of effectual love and marriage and there was a terrible something called the swap or the key of the street and crib hunting of which the talk was scanty but sufficient night after night he would resolve to enlist to run away to sea to set fire to the warehouse or drown himself and morning after morning he rose up and hurried downstairs in fear of a sixpenny fine he would compare his dismal round of servile drudgery with those windy sunlit days at littlestone those windows of happiness shining ever brighter as they receded the little figure of ann seemed in all these windows now  she too had happened on evil things when kipps went home for the first christmas after he was bound that great suspended resolve of his to kiss her flared up to hot determination and he hurried out and whistled in the yard there was a still silence and then old kipps appeared behind him  its no good your whistling there my boy said old kipps in a loud clear tone designed to be audible over the wall theyve cleared out all you ad any truck with shes gone as help to ashford my boy help slavey is what we used to call em but times are changed wonder they didnt say ladyelp while they was about it it ud be like em  and sid sid had gone too arrand boy or somethink said old kipps to one of these here brasted cicycle shops  has e said kipps with a feeling that he had been gripped about the chest and he turned quickly and went indoors  old kipps still supposing him present went on to further observations of an antipornick hue  when kipps got upstairs safe in his own bedroom he sat down on the bed and stared at nothing they were caughtthey were all caught all life took on the hue of one perpetual dismal monday morning the hurons were scattered the wrecks and the beach had passed away from him the sun of those warm evenings at littlestone had set for evermore  the only pleasure left for the brief remainder of his holiday after that was to think he was not in the shop even that was transient two more daysone more dayhalf a day when he went back there were one or two very dismal nights indeed he went so far as to write home some vague intimation of his feelings about business and his prospects quoting minton but mrs kipps answered him did he want the pornicks to say he wasnt good enough to be a draper this dreadful possibility was of course conclusive in the matter no he resolved they should not say he failed at that  he derived much help from a manly sermon delivered in an enormous voice by a large fat sunred clergyman just home from a colonial bishopric he had resigned on the plea of illhealth exhorting him that whatever his hand found to do he was to do with all his might and the revision of his catechism preparatory to his confirmation reminded him that it behooved him to do his duty in that state of life unto which it shall please god to call him  after a time the sorrows of kipps grew less acute and save for a miracle the brief tragedy of his life was over he subdued himself to his position even as his church required of him seeing moreover no way out of it  the earliest mitigation of his lot was that his soles and ankles became indurated to the perpetual standing the next was an unexpected weekly whiff of freedom that came every thursday mr shalford after a brave stand for what he called innyvishal libty and the idea of my system a stand which he explained he made chiefly on patriotic grounds was at last under pressure of certain of his customers compelled to fall in line with the rest of the local early closing association and mr kipps could emerge in daylight and go where he listed for long long hours moreover minton the pessimist reached the end of his appointed time and leftto enlist in a cavalry regiment and go about this planet leading an insubordinate but interesting life that ended at last in an intimate vivid and really you know by no means painful or tragic night grapple in the terah valley in a little while kipps cleaned windows no longer he was serving customers of the less important sort and taking goods out on approval and presently he was third apprentice and his moustache was visible and there were three apprentices whom he might legally snub and cuff but one was most dishonestly too big to cuff in spite of his greener years   §5  there came still other distractions the natural distractions of adolescence to take his mind off the inevitable his costume for example began to interest him more he began to realise himself as a visible object to find an interest in the costumeroom mirrors and the eyes of the girl apprentices  in this he was helped by counsel and example pierce his immediate senior was by way of being what was called a masher and preached his cult during slack times grave discussions about collars ties the cut of trouser legs and the proper shape of a boottoe were held in the manchester department in due course kipps went to a tailor and his short jacket was replaced by a morning coat with tails stirred by this he purchased at his own expense three standup collars to replace his former turndown ones they were nearly three inches high higher than those pierce wore and they made his neck quite sore and left a red mark under his ears so equipped he found himself fit company even for this fashionable apprentice who had now succeeded minton in his seniority  most potent help of all in the business of forgetting his cosmic disaster was this that so soon as he was in tail coats the young ladies of the establishment began to discover that he was no longer a horrid little boy hitherto they had tossed heads at him and kept him in his place now they discovered that he was a nice boy which is next door at least to being a feller and in some ways even preferable it is painful to record that his fidelity to ann failed at their first onset i am fully sensible how entirely better this story would be from a sentimental point of view if he had remained true to that early love only then it would have been a different story altogether and at least kipps was thus far true that with none of these later loves was there any of that particular quality that linked anns flushed face and warmth and the inner things of life so inseparably together though they were not without emotions of various sorts  it was one of the young ladies in the costumeroom who first showed by her manner that he was a visible object and capable of exciting interest she talked to him she encouraged him to talk to her she lent him a book she possessed and darned a sock for him and said she would be his elder sister she allowed him to escort her to church with a great air of having induced him to go then she investigated his eternal welfare overcame a certain affectation of virile indifference to religion and extorted a promise that he would undergo confirmation this excited the other young lady in the costumes her natural rival and she set herself with great charm and subtlety to the capture of the ripening heart of kipps she took a more worldly line she went for a walk with him to the pier on sunday afternoon and explained to him how a gentleman must always walk outside a lady on a pavement and how all gentlemen wore or at least carried gloves and generally the broad beginnings of the british social ideal afterwards the ladies exchanged words upon sabbatical grounds in this way was the toga virilis bestowed on kipps and he became recognised as a suitable object for that platonic eros whose blunted darts devastate even the very highestclass establishments in this way too did that pervading ambition of the british young man to be if not a gentleman at least mistakably like one take root in his heart  he took to these new interests with quite natural and personal zest he became initiated into the mysteries of flirting andat a slightly later stage and with some leading hints from pierce who was of a communicative disposition in these mattersof the milder forms of spooning very soon he was engaged before two years were out he had been engaged six times and was beginning to be rather a desperate fellow so far as he could make out desperate but quite gentlemanly be it understood and without let or hindrance to the fact that he was in four brief lessons prepared by a distantmannered and gloomy young curate and confirmed a member of the established church  the engagements in drapery establishments do not necessarily involve a subsequent marriage they are essentially more refined less coarsely practical and altogether less binding than the engagements of the vulgar rich these young ladies do not like not to be engagedit is so unnatural and mr kipps was as easy to get engaged to as one could wish there are from the young ladys point of view many conveniences in being engaged you get an escort for church and walks and so forth it is not quite the thing to walk abroad with a feller much more to spoon with him when he is neither ones fiancé nor an adopted brother it is considered either a little fast or else as savouring of the walkingout habits of the servant girls now such is the sweetness of human charity that the shop young lady in england has just the same horror of doing anything that savours of the servant girl as the lady journalist let us say has of anything savouring of the shop girl or the really quite nice young lady has of anything savouring of any sort of girl who has gone down into the economic battlefield to earn herself a living but the very deepest of these affairs was still among the shallow places of love at best it was paddling where it is decreed that men must sink or swim of the deep and dangerous places and of the huge buoyant lift of its waves he tasted nothing affairs of clothes and vanities they were jealousies about a thing said flatteries and mutual boastings climaxes in the answering grasp of hands the temerarious use of christian names culminations in a walk or a near confidence or a little pressure more or less closesitting on a seat after twilight with some little fondling was indeed the boldest of a lovers adventures the utmost limit of his enterprises in the service of that stark great lady who is daughter of uranus and the sea the young ladies who reigned in his heart came and went like people in an omnibus there was the vehicle so to speak upon the road and they entered and left it without any cataclysm of emotion for all that this development of the sex interest was continuously very interesting to kipps and kept him going as much as anything through all these servile years   §6  for a tailpiece to this chapter one may vignette one of those little affairs  it is a bright sunday afternoon the scene is a secluded little seat halfway down the front of the leas and kipps is four years older than when he parted from ann there is a quite perceptible down upon his upper lip and his costume is just as tremendous a mash as lies within his means his collar is so high that it scars his inaggressive jawbone and his hat has a curly brim his tie shows taste his trousers are modestly brilliant and his boots have light cloth uppers and button at the side he jabs at the gravel before him with a cheap cane and glances sideways at flo bates the young lady from the cash desk she is wearing a brilliant blouse and a gaily trimmed hat there is an air of fashion about her that might disappear under the analysis of a woman of the world but which is quite sufficient to make kipps very proud to be distinguished as her particular feller and to be allowed at temperate intervals to use her christian name  the conversation is light and gay in the modern style and flo keeps on smiling good temper being her special charm  ye see you don mean what i mean he is saying  well what do you mean  not what you mean  well tell me  ah thats another story  pause they look meaningly at one another  you are a one for being roundabout says the lady  well youre not so plain you know  not plain  no  you dont mean to say im roundabout  no i mean to say  though  pause  well  youre not a bit plainyoure his voice jumps up to a squeak pretty see  oh get out her voice lifts alsowith pleasure  she strikes at him with her glove then glances suddenly at a ring upon her finger her smile disappears momentarily another pause eyes meet and the smile returns  i wish i knew says kipps  knew  where you got that ring  she lifts the hand with the ring until her eyes just show very prettily over it youd just like to know she says slowly and smiles still more brightly with the sense of successful effect  i dessay i could guess  i dessay you couldnt  couldnt i  no  guess it in three  not the name  ah  ah  well anyhow lemme look at it  he looks at it pause giggles slight struggle and a slap on kipps coatsleeve a passerby appears down the path and she hastily withdraws her hand  she glances at the face of the approaching man they maintain a bashful silence until he has passed     chapter iii  the woodcarving class   §1  though these services to venus epipontia the seaside venus and these studies in the art of dress did much to distract his thoughts and mitigate his earlier miseries it would be mere optimism to present kipps as altogether happy a vague dissatisfaction with life drifted about him and every now and again enveloped him like a sea fog during these periods it was greyly evident that there was something something vital in life lacking for no earthly reason that kipps could discover he was haunted by a suspicion that life was going wrong or had already gone wrong in some irrevocable way the ripening selfconsciousness of adolescence developed this into a clearly felt insufficiency it was all very well to carry gloves open doors never say miss to a girl and walk outside but were there not other things conceivably even deeper things before the complete thing was attained for example certain matters of knowledge he perceived great bogs of ignorance about him fumbling traps where other people it was alleged real gentlemen and ladies for example and the clergy had knowledge and assurance bogs which it was sometimes difficult to elude a girl arrived in the millinery department who could she said speak french and german she snubbed certain advances and a realisation of inferiority blistered kipps but he tried to pass the thing off as a joke by saying parlezvous francey whenever he met her and inducing the junior apprentice to say the same  he even made some dim halfsecret experiments towards remedying the deficiencies he suspected he spent five shillings on five serial numbers of a home educator and bought and even thought of reading a shakespeare and a bacons advancement of learning and the poems of herrick from a chap who was hard up he battled with shakespeare all one sunday afternoon and found the english literature with which mr woodrow had equipped him had vanished down some crack in his mind he had no doubt it was very splendid stuff but he couldnt quite make out what it was all about there was an occult meaning he knew in literature and he had forgotten it moreover he discovered one day while taunting the junior apprentice with ignorance that his rivers of england had also slipped his memory and he laboriously restored that fabric of rote learning ty wear tees umber  i suppose some such phase of discontent is a normal thing in every adolescence the ripening mind seeks something upon which its will may crystallise upon which its discursive emotions growing more abundant with each year of life may concentrate for many though not for all it takes a religious direction but in those particular years the mental atmosphere of folkestone was exceptionally free from any revivalistic disturbance that might have reached kipps mental being sometimes they fall in love i have known this uneasiness end in different cases in a vow to read one book not a novel every week to read the bible through in a year to pass in the honours division of the london matriculation examination to become an accomplished chemist and never more to tell a lie it led kipps finally into technical education as we understand it in the south of england  it was in the last year of his apprenticeship that he had pursued his researches after that missing qualification into the folkestone young mens association where mr chester coote prevailed mr chester coote was a young man of semiindependent means who inherited a share in a house agency read mrs humphry ward and took an interest in social work he was a whitishfaced young man with a prominent nose pale blue eyes and a quivering quality in his voice he was very active upon committees he was very prominent and useful on all social occasions in evidence upon platforms and upon all those semipublic occasions when the great descend he lived with an only sister to kipps and his kind in the young mens association he read a stimulating paper on selfhelp he said it was the noblest of all our distinctive english characteristics and he was very much down upon the overeducated germans at the close a young german hairdresser made a few commendatory remarks which developed somehow into an oration on hanoverian politics as he became excited he became guttural and obscure the meeting sniggered cheerfully at such ridiculous english and kipps was so much amused that he forgot a private project to ask this chester coote how he might set about a little selfhelp on his own private account in such narrow margins of time as the system of mr shalford spared him but afterwards in the nighttime it came to him again  it was a few months later and after his apprenticeship was over and mr shalford had with depreciatory observations taken him on as an improver at twenty pounds a year that this question was revived by a casual article on technical education in a morning paper that a commercial traveller had left behind him it played the rôle of the word in season something in the nature of conversion a faint sort of concentration of purpose really occurred in him then the article was written with penetrating vehemence and it stimulated him to the pitch of inquiring about the local science and art classes and after he had told everybody in the shop about it and taken the advice of all who supported his desperate resolution he joined at first he attended the class in freehand that being the subject taught on early closing night and he had already made some progress in that extraordinary routine of reproducing freehand copies which for two generations had passed with english people for instruction in art when the dates of the classes were changed thereby just as the march winds were blowing he was precipitated into the woodcarving class and his mind diverted first to this useful and broadening pursuit and then to its teacher   §2  the class in woodcarving was an extremely select class conducted at that time by a young lady named walshingham and as this young lady was destined by fortune to teach kipps a great deal more than wood carving it will be well if the reader gets the picture of her correctly in mind she was only a year or so older than he was she had a pale intellectual face dark grey eyes and black hair which she wore over her forehead in an original and striking way that she had adopted from a picture by rossetti in the south kensington museum she was slender so that without ungainliness she had an effect of being tall and her hands were shapely and white when they came into contrast with hands much exercised in rolling and blocking she dressed in those loose and pleasant forms and those soft and tempered shades that arose in england in the socialisticæsthetic epoch and remain to this day among us as the badge of those who read turgenevs novels scorn current fiction and think on higher planes i think she was as beautiful as most beautiful people and to kipps she was altogether beautiful she had kipps learnt matriculated at london university an astounding feat to his imagination and the masterly way in which she demonstrated how to prod and worry honest pieces of wood into useless and unedifying patterns in relief extorted his utmost admiration  at first when kipps had learnt he was to be taught by a girl he was inclined to resent it the more so as buggins had recently been very strong on the gross injustice of feminine employment  we have to keep wives said buggins though as a matter of fact he did not keep even one and how are we to do it with a lot of girls coming in to take the work out of our mouths  afterwards kipps in conjunction with pierce looked at it from another point of view and thought it would be rather a lark finally when he saw her and saw her teaching and coming nearer to him with an impressive deliberation he was breathless with awe and the quality of her dark slender femininity  the class consisted of two girls and a maiden lady of riper years friends of miss walshinghams and anxious rather to support her in an interesting experiment than to become really expert woodcarvers an oldish young man with spectacles and a black beard who never spoke to any one and who was evidently too shortsighted to see his work as a whole a small boy who was understood to have a gift for woodcarving and a lodginghouse keeper who took classes every winter she told mr kipps as though they were a tonic and found they did her good and occasionally mr chester cooterefined and gentlemanlywould come into the class with or without papers ostensibly on committee business but in reality to talk to the less attractive one of the two girl students and sometimes a brother of miss walshinghams a slender dark young man with a pale face and fluctuating resemblances to the young napoleon would arrive just at the end of the classtime to see his sister home  all these personages impressed kipps with a sense of inferiority that in the case of miss walshingham became positively abysmal the ideas and knowledge they appeared to have their personal capacity and freedom opened a new world to his imagination these people came and went with a sense of absolute assurance against an overwhelming background of plaster casts diagrams and tables benches and a blackboarda background that seemed to him to be saturated with recondite knowledge and the occult and jealously guarded tips and secrets that constitute art and the higher life they went home he imagined to homes where the piano was played with distinction and freedom and books littered the tables and foreign languages were habitually used they had complicated meals no doubtwith serviettes they knew etiquette and how to avoid all the errors for which kipps bought penny manuals what to avoid common errors in speaking and the like he knew nothing about it allnothing whatever he was a creature of the outer darkness blinking in an unsuspected light  he heard them speak easily and freely to one another of examinations of books and paintings of last years academya little contemptuously and once just at the end of the classtime mr chester coote and young walshingham and the two girls argued about something or other called he fancied vagner or vargnerthey seemed to say it both waysand which presently shaped itself more definitely as the name of a man who made up music carshot and buggins werent in it with them young walshingham it appeared said something or other that was an epigram and they all applauded him kipps i say felt himself a creature of outer darkness an inexcusable intruder in an altitudinous world when the epigram happened he first of all smiled to pretend he understood and instantly suppressed the smile to show he did not listen then he became extremely hot and uncomfortable though nobody had noticed either phase  it was clear his only chance of concealing his bottomless baseness was to hold his tongue and meanwhile he chipped with earnest care and abased his soul before the very shadow of miss walshingham she used to come and direct and advise him with he felt an effort to conceal the scorn she had for him and indeed it is true that at first she thought of him chiefly as the clumsy young man with the red ears  and as soon as he emerged from the first effect of pure and awestricken humilityhe was greatly helped to emerge from that condition to a perception of human equality by the need the lodginghouse keeper was under to talk while she worked and as she didnt like miss walshingham and her friends very much and the young man with spectacles was deaf she naturally talked to kippshe perceived that he was in a state of adoration for miss walshingham that it seemed almost a blasphemous familiarity to speak of us being in love  this state you must understand had nothing to do with flirting or spooning and that superficial passion that flashes from eye to eye upon the leas and pierabsolutely nothing that he knew from the first her rather pallid intelligent young face beneath those sombre clouds of hair put her in a class apart towards her the thought of attentions paled and vanished to approach such a being to perform sacrifices and to perish obviously for her seemed the limit he might aspire to he or any man for if his love was abasement at any rate it had this much of manliness that it covered all his sex it had not yet come to kipps to acknowledge any man as his better in his heart of hearts when one does that the game is played and one grows old indeed  the rest of his sentimental interests vanished altogether in this great illumination he meditated about her when he was blocking cretonne her image was before his eyes at teatime and blotted out the more immediate faces and made him silent and preoccupied and so careless in his bearing that the junior apprentice sitting beside him mocked at and parodied his enormous bites of bread and butter unreproved he became conspicuously less popular on the fancy side the costumes was chilly with him and the millinery cutting but he did not care an intermittent correspondent with flo bates that had gone on since she left mr shalfords desk for a position at tunbridge nearer home and which had roused kipps in its earlier stages to unparalleled heights of epistolatory effort died out altogether by reason of his neglect he heard with scarcely a pang that as a consequence perhaps of his neglect flo was carrying on with a chap who managed a farm  every thursday he jabbed and gouged at his wood jabbing and gouging intersecting circles and diamond traceries and that laboured inane which our mad world calls ornament and he watched miss walshingham furtively whenever she turned away the circles in consequence were jabbed crooked and his panels losing their symmetry became comparatively pleasing to the untrained eyeand once he jabbed his finger he would cheerfully have jabbed all his fingers if he could have found some means of using the opening to express himself of the vague emotions that possessed him but he shirked conversation just as earnestly as he desired it he feared that profound general ignorance of his might appear   §3  there came a time when she could not open one of the classroom windows the man with the black beard pored over his chipping heedlessly  it did not take kipps a moment to grasp his opportunity he dropped his gouge and stepped forward lem me he said  he could not open the window either  oh please dont trouble she said  sno trouble he gasped  still the sash stuck he felt his manhood was at stake he gathered himself together for a tremendous effort and the pane broke with a snap and he thrust his hand into the void beyond  there said miss walshingham and the glass fell ringing into the courtyard below  then kipps made to bring his hand back and felt the keen touch of the edge of the broken glass at his wrist he turned dolefully im tremendously sorry he said in answer to the accusation in miss walshinghams eyes i didnt think it would break like thatas if he had expected it to break in some quite different and entirely more satisfactory manner the boy with the gift of woodcarving having stared at kipps face for a moment became involved in a laocoon struggle with a giggle  youve cut your wrist said one of the girl friends standing up and pointing she was a pleasantfaced greatly freckled girl with a helpful disposition and she said youve cut your wrist as brightly as if she had been a trained nurse  kipps looked down and saw a swift line of scarlet rush down his hand he perceived the other man student regarding this with magnified eyes you have cut your wrist said miss walshingham and kipps regarded his damage with greater interest  hes cut his wrist said the maiden lady to the lodginghouse keeper and seemed in doubt what a lady should do its she hesitated at the word bleeding and nodded to the lodginghouse keeper instead  dreadfully said the maiden lady and tried to look and tried not to look at the same time  of course hes cut his wrist said the lodginghouse keeper momentarily quite annoyed at kipps and the other young lady who thought kipps rather common went on quietly with her woodcutting with an air of its being the proper thing to dothough nobody else seemed to know it  you must tie it up said miss walshingham  we must tie it up said the freckled girl  i adnt the slightest idea that window was going to break like that said kipps with candour nort the slightest  he glanced again at the blood on his wrist and it seemed to him that it was on the very point of dropping on the floor of that cultured classroom so he very neatly licked it off feeling at the same time for his handkerchief oh dont said miss walshingham as he did so and the girl with the freckles made a movement of horror the giggle got the better of the boy with the gift and celebrated its triumph by unseemly noises in spite of which it seemed to kipps at the moment that the act that had made miss walshingham say oh dont was rather a desperate and manly treatment of what was after all a creditable injury  it ought to be tied up said the lodginghouse keeper holding her chisel upright in her hand its a bad cut to bleed like that  we must tie it up said the freckled girl and hesitated in front of kipps have you got a handkerchief she said  i dunno ow i managed not to bring one said kipps i not aving a cold i suppose someow i didnt think  he checked a further flow of blood  the girl with the freckles caught miss walshinghams eye and held it for a moment both glanced at kipps injury the boy with the gift who had reappeared with a chastened expression from some noisy pursuit beneath his desk made the neglected motions of one who proffers shyly miss walshingham under the spell of the freckled girls eye produced a handkerchief the voice of the maiden lady could be heard in the background ive been through all the technical education ambulance classes twice and i know you go so if its a vein and so if its an arteryat least you go so for one and so for the other whichever it may be but  if you will give me your hand said the freckled girl and proceeded with miss walshinghams assistance to bandage kipps in a most businesslike way yes they actually bandaged kipps they pulled up his cuffshappily they were not a very frayed pairand held his wrist and wrapped the soft handkerchief round it and tightened the knot together and miss walshinghams face the face of that almost divine overhuman came close to the face of kipps  were not hurting you are we she said  not a bit said kipps as he would have said if they had been sawing his arm off  were not experts you know said the freckled girl  im sure its a dreadful cut said miss walshingham  it aint much reely said kipps and youre taking a lot of trouble im sorry i broke that window i cant think what i could have been doing  it isnt so much the cut at the time its the poisoning afterwards came the voice of the maiden lady  of course im quite willing to pay for the window panted kipps opulently  we must make it just as tight as possible to stop the bleeding said the freckled girl  i dont think its much reely said kipps im awful sorry i broke that window though  put your finger on the knot dear said the freckled girl  eh said kipps i mean  both the young ladies became very intent on the knot and mr kipps was very red and very intent upon the two young ladies  mortified and had to be sawn off said the maiden lady  sawn off said the lodginghouse keeper  sawn right off said the maiden lady and jabbed at her mangled design  there said the freckled girl i think that ought to do youre sure its not too tight  not a bit said kipps  he met miss walshinghams eye and smiled to show how little he cared for wounds and pain its only a little cut he added  the maiden lady appeared as an addition to their group you should have washed the wound dear she said i was just telling miss collis she peered through her glasses at the bandage that doesnt look quite right she remarked critically you should have taken the ambulance classes but i suppose it will have to do are you hurting  not a bit said kipps and he smiled at them all with the air of a brave soldier in hospital  im sure it must hurt said miss walshingham  anyhow youre a very good patient said the girl with the freckles  mr kipps became quite pink im only sorry i broke the windowthats all he said but who would have thought it was going to break like that  pause  im afraid you wont be able to go on carving tonight said miss walshingham  ill try said kipps it reelly doesnt hurtnot anything to matter  presently miss walshingham came to him as he carved heroically with his hand bandaged in her handkerchief there was a touch of a novel interest in her eyes im afraid youre not getting on very fast she said  the freckled girl looked up and regarded miss walshingham  im doing a little anyhow said kipps i dont want to waste any time a feller like me hasnt much time to spare  it struck the girls that there was a quality of modest disavowal about that feller like me it gave them a light into this obscure person and miss walshingham ventured to commend his work as promising and to ask whether he meant to follow it up kipps didnt altogether knowthings depended on so much but if he was in folkestone next winter he certainly should it did not occur to miss walshingham at the time to ask why his progress in art depended upon his presence in folkestone there was some more questions and answersthey continued to talk to him for a little time even when mr chester coote had come into the roomand when at last the conversation had died out it dawned upon kipps just how much his cut wrist had done for him  he went to sleep that night revising that conversation for the twentieth time treasuring this and expanding that and inserting things he might have said to miss walshingham things he might still say about himselfin relation more or less explicit to her he wasnt quite sure if he wouldnt like his arm to mortify a bit which would make him interesting or to heal up absolutely which would show the exceptional purity of his blood   §4  the affair of the broken window happened late in april and the class came to an end in may in that interval there were several small incidents and great developments of emotion i have done kipps no justice if i have made it seem that his face was unsightly it was as the freckled girl pointed out to helen walshingham an interesting face and that aspect of him which presented chiefly erratic hair and glowing ears ceased to prevail  they talked him over and the freckled girl discovered there was something wistful in his manner they detected a natural delicacy and the freckled girl set herself to draw him out from that time forth the freckled girl was nineteen and very wise and motherly and benevolent and really she greatly preferred drawing out kipps to woodcarving it was quite evident to her that kipps was in love with helen walshingham and it struck her as a queer and romantic and pathetic and extremely interesting phenomenon and as at that time she regarded helen as simply lovely it seemed only right and proper that she should assist kipps in his modest efforts to place himself in a state of absolute abandon upon her altar  under her sympathetic management the position of kipps was presently defined quite clearly he was unhappy in his positionmisunderstood he told her he didnt seem to get on like with customers and she translated this for him as too sensitive the discontent with his fate in life the dreadful feeling that education was slipping by him troubles that time and usage were glazing over a little revived to their old acuteness but not to their old hopelessness as a basis for sympathy indeed they were even a source of pleasure  and one day at dinner it happened that carshot and buggins fell talking of these here writers and how dickens had been a labeller of blacking and thackeray an artist who couldnt sell a drawing and how samuel johnson had walked to london without any boots having thrown away his only pair out of pride its luck said buggins to a very large extent they just happen to hit on something that catches on and there you are  nice easy life they have of it too said miss mergle write just an hour or so and done for the day almost like gentlefolks  theres more work in it than youd think said carshot stooping to a mouthful  i wouldnt mind changing for all that said buggins id like to see one of these here authors marking off with jimmy  i think they copy from each other a good deal said miss mergle  even then chup chup chup said carshot theres writing it out in their own hands  they proceeded to enlarge upon the literary life on its ease and dignity on the social recognition accorded to those who led it and on the ample gratifications their vanity achieved pictures everywherenever get a new suit without being photographedalmost like royalty said miss mergle  and all this talk impressed the imagination of kipps very greatly here was a class that seemed to bridge the gulf on the one hand essentially low but by factitious circumstances capable of entering upon those levels of social superiority to which all true englishmen aspire those levels from which one may tip a butler scorn a tailor and even commune with those who lead men into battle almost like gentlefolksthat was it he brooded over these things in the afternoon until they blossomed into daydreams suppose for example he had chanced to write a book a wellknown book under an assumed name and yet kept on being a draper all the time impossible of course but supposeit made quite a long dream  and at the next woodcarving class he let it be drawn from him that his real choice in life was to be a nawtheronly one doesnt get a chance  after that there were times when kipps had that pleasant sense that comes of attracting interest he was a mute inglorious dickens or at any rate something of that sort and they were all taking him at that the discovery of this indefinable something in him the development of which was now painfully restricted and impossible did much to bridge the gulf between himself and miss walshingham he was unfortunate he was futile but he was not common even now with help the two girls and the freckled girl in particular tried to stir him up to some effort to do his imputed potentialities justice they were still young enough to believe that to nice and niceish members of the male sexmore especially when under the stimulus of feminine encouragementnothing is finally impossible  the freckled girl was i say the stage manager of this affair but miss walshingham was the presiding divinity a touch of proprietorship came in her eyes at times when she looked at him he was hersunconditionallyand she knew it  to her directly kipps scarcely ever made a speech the enterprising things that he was continually devising to say to her he usually did not say or he said them in a suitably modified form to the girl with the freckles and one day the girl with the freckles smote him to the heart she said to him with the faintest indication of her head across the classroom to where her friend reached a cast from the shelf i do think helen walshingham is sometimes the most lovely person in the world look at her now  kipps gasped for a moment the moment lengthened and she regarded him as an intelligent young surgeon might regard an operation without anæsthetics  youre right he said and then looked at her with an entire abandonment of visage  she coloured under his glare of silent avowal and he blushed brightly  i think so too he said hoarsely cleared his throat and after a meditative moment proceeded sacramentally with his woodcarving  you are wonderful said the freckled girl to miss walshingham apropos of nothing as they went on their way home together he simply adores you  but my dear what have i done said helen  thats just it said the freckled girl what have you done  and then with a terrible swiftness came the last class of the course to terminate this relationship altogether kipps was careless of dates and the thing came upon him with an effect of abrupt surprise just as his petals were expanding so hopefully finis and the thing was at an end but kipps did not fully appreciate that the end was indeed and really and truly the end until he was back in the emporium after the end was over  the end began practically in the middle of the last class when the freckled girl broached the topic of terminations she developed the question of just how he was going on after the class ended she hoped he would stick to certain resolutions of selfimprovement he had breathed she said quite honestly that he owed it to himself to develop his possibilities he expressed firm resolve but dwelt on difficulties he had no books she instructed him how to get books from the public library he was to get a form of application for a ticket signed by a ratepayer and he said of course when she said mr shalford would do that though all the time he knew perfectly well it would never do to ask mr shalford for anything of the sort she explained that she was going to north wales for the summer information he received without immediate regret at intervals he expressed his intention of going on with woodcarving when the summer was over and once he added if  she considered herself extremely delicate not to press for the completion of that if  after that talk there was an interval of languid woodcarving and watching miss walshingham  then presently there came a bustle of packing a great ceremony of handshaking all round by miss collis and the maiden lady of ripe years and then kipps found himself outside the classroom on the landing with his two friends it seemed to him he had only just learnt that this was the last class of all there came a little pause and the freckled girl suddenly went back into the classroom and left kipps and miss walshingham alone together for the first time kipps was instantly breathless she looked at his face with a glance that mingled sympathy and curiosity and held out her white hand  well goodbye mr kipps she said  he took her hand and held it id do anything said kipps and had not the temerity to add for you he stopped awkwardly he shook her hand and said goodbye  there was a little pause  i hope you will have a pleasant holiday she said  i shall come back to the class next year anyhow said kipps valiantly and turned abruptly to the stairs  i hope you will said miss walshingham  he turned back towards her reelly he said  i hope everybody will come back  i willanyhow said kipps you may count on that and he tried to make his tones significant  they looked at one another through a little pause  goodbye she said  kipps lifted his hat she turned towards the classroom  well said the freckled girl coming back towards her  nothing said helen at leastpresently and she became very energetic about some scattered tools on a desk  the freckled girl went out and stood for a moment at the head of the stairs when she came back she looked very hard at her friend the incident struck her as importantwonderfully important it was unassimilable of course and absurd but there it was the thing that is so cardinal to a girl the emotion the subservience the crowning triumph of her sex she could not help feeling that helen took it on the whole a little too hardly     chapter iv  chitterlow   §1  the hour of the class on the following thursday found kipps in a state of nearly incredible despondency he was sitting with his eyes on the reading room clock his chin resting on his fists and his elbows on the accumulated comic papers that were comic alas in vain he paid no heed to the little man in spectacles glaring opposite to him famishing for fun in this place it was he had sat night after night each night more blissful than the last waiting until it should be time to go to her and thenbliss and now the hour had come and there was no class there would be no class now until next october it might be there would never be a class so far as he was concerned again  it might be there would never be a class again for shalford taking exception at a certain absentmindedness that led to mistakes and more particularly to the ticketing of several articles in kipps manchester window upside down had been on to him for the past few days in an exceedingly onerous manner  he sighed profoundly pushed the comic papers backthey were rent away from him instantly by the little man in spectaclesand tried the old engravings of folkestone in the past that hang about the room but these too failed to minister to his bruised heart he wandered about the corridors for a time and watched the library indicator for awhile wonderful thing that but it did not hold him for long people came and laughed near him and that jarred with him dreadfully he went out of the building and a beastly cheerful barrel organ mocked him in the street he was moved to a desperate resolve to go down to the beach there it might be he would be alone the sea might be roughand attuned to him it would certainly be dark  if i ad a penny im blest if i wouldnt go and chuck myself off the end of the pier shed never miss me he followed a deepening vein of thought  penny though its tuppence he said after a space  he went down dover street in a state of profound melancholiaat the pace and mood as it were of his own funeral processionand he crossed at the corner of tontine street heedless of all mundane things and there it was that fortune came upon him in disguise and with a loud shout the shout of a person endowed with an unusually rich full voice followed immediately by a violent blow in the back  his hat was over his eyes and an enormous weight rested on his shoulders and something kicked him in the back of his calf  then he was on all fours in some mud that fortune in conjunction with the folkestone corporation and in the pursuit of equally mysterious ends had heaped together even lavishly for his reception  he remained in that position for some seconds awaiting further developments and believing almost anything broken before his heart gathering at last that this temporary violence of things in general was over and being perhaps assisted by a clutching hand he arose and found himself confronting a figure holding a bicycle and thrusting forward a dark face in anxious scrutiny  you arent hurt matey gasped the figure  was that you it me said kipps  its these handles you know said the figure with an air of being a fellow sufferer theyre too low and when i go to turn if i dont remember bifand im in to something  wellyou give me a oner in the backanyhow said kipps taking stock of his damages  i was coming down hill you know explained the bicyclist these little folkestone hills are a fair treat it isnt as though id been on the level i came rather a whop  you did that said kipps  i was back pedalling for all i was worth anyhow said the bicyclist not that i am worth much back pedalling  he glanced round and made a sudden movement almost as if to mount his machine then he turned as rapidly to kipps again who was now stooping down pursuing the tale of his injuries  heres the back of my trouser leg all tore down said kipps and i believe im bleeding you reely ought to be more careful  the stranger investigated the damage with a rapid movement holy smoke so you are he laid a friendly hand on kipps arm i saylook here come up to my diggings and sew it up im of course im to blame and i say his voice sank to a confidential friendliness heres a slop dont let on i ran you down havent a lamp you know might be a bit awkward for me  kipps looked up towards the advancing policeman the appeal to his generosity was not misplaced he immediately took sides with his assailant he stood up as the representative of the law drew nearer he assumed an air which he considered highly suggestive of an accident not having happened  all right he said go on  right you are said the cyclist promptly and led the way and then apparently with some idea of deception called over his shoulder im tremendous glad to have met you old chap  it really isnt a hundred yards he said after they had passed the policeman its just round the corner  of course said kipps limping slightly i dont want to get a chap into trouble accidents will happen still  oh rather i believe you accidents will happen especially when you get me on a bicycle he laughed you arent the first ive run down not by any manner of means i dont think you can be hurt much either it isnt as though i was scorching you didnt see me coming i was back pedalling like anything only naturally it seems to you i must have been coming fast and i did all i could to ease off the bump as i hit you it was just the treadle i think came against your calf but it was all right of you about that policeman you know that was a fair bit of all right under the circs if youd told him i was riding it might have been forty bob forty bob id have had to tell em time is money just now for mr h c  i shouldnt have blamed you either you know most men after a bump like that might have been spiteful the least i can do is to stand you a needle and thread and a clothes brush it isnt everyone whod have taken it like you  scorching why if id been scorching youd havecoming as we didyoud have been knocked silly  but i tell you the way you caught on about that slop was something worth seeing when i asked you i didnt half expect it bif right off cool as a cucumber had your line at once i tell you that there isnt many men would have acted as you have done i will say that you acted like a gentleman over that slop  kipps first sense of injury disappeared he limped along a pace or so behind making depreciatory noises in response to these flattering remarks and taking stock of the very appreciative person who uttered them  as they passed the lamps he was visible as a figure with a slight anterior plumpness progressing buoyantly on knickerbockered legs with quite enormous calves legs that contrasting with kipps own narrow practice were even exuberantly turned out at the knees and toes a cycling cap was worn very much on one side and from beneath it protruded carelessly straight wisps of dark red hair and ever and again an ample nose came into momentary view round the corner the muscular cheeks of this person and a certain generosity of chin he possessed were blue shaven and he had no moustache his carriage was spacious and confident his gestures up and down the narrow deserted back street they traversed were irresistibly suggestive of ownership a suggestion of broadly gesticulating shadows were born squatting on his feet and grew and took possession of the road and reunited at last with the shadows of the infinite as lamp after lamp was passed kipps saw by the flickering light of one of them that they were in little fenchurch street and then they came round a corner sharply into a dark court and stopped at the door of a particularly ramshackle looking little house held up between two larger ones like a drunken man between policemen  the cyclist propped his machine carefully against the window produced a key and blew down it sharply the locks a bit tricky he said and devoted himself for some moments to the task of opening the door some mechanical catastrophe ensued and the door was open  youd better wait here a bit while i get the lamp he remarked to kipps very likely it isnt filled and vanished into the blackness of the passage thank god for matches he said and kipps had an impression of a passage in the transitory pink flare and the bicyclist disappearing into a further room kipps was so much interested by these things that for the time he forgot his injuries altogether  an interval and kipps was dazzled by a pink shaded kerosene lamp you go in said the redhaired man and ill bring in the bike and for a moment kipps was alone in the lamplit room he took in rather vaguely the shabby ensemble of the little apartment the round table covered with a torn red glassstained cover on which the lamp stood a mottled lookingglass over the fireplace reflecting this a disused gas bracket an extinct fire a number of dusty postcards and memoranda stuck round the glass a dusty crowded paper rack on the mantel with a number of cabinet photographs a table littered with papers and cigarette ash and a syphon of soda water then the cyclist reappeared and kipps saw his blueshaved rather animated face and brightreddish brown eyes for the first time he was a man perhaps ten years older than kipps but his beardless face made them in a way contemporary  you behaved all right about that policemananyhow he repeated as he came forward  i dont see ow else i could ave done said kipps quite modestly the cyclist scanned his guest for the first time and decided upon hospitable details  wed better let that mud dry a bit before we brush it whiskey there is good old methusaleh canadian rye and theres some brandy thats all right whichll you have  i dunno said kipps taken by surprise and then seeing no other course but acceptance wellwhiskey then  right you are old boy and if youll take my advice youll take it neat i may not be a particular judge of this sort of thing but i do know old methusaleh pretty well old methusalehfour stars thats me good old harry chitterlow and good old methusaleh leave em together bif hes gone  he laughed loudly looked about him hesitated and retired leaving kipps in possession of the room and free to make a more precise examination of its contents   §2  he particularly remarked the photographs that adorned the apartment they were chiefly photographs of ladies in one case in tights which kipps thought a bit ot but one represented the bicyclist in the costume of some remote epoch it did not take kipps long to infer that the others were probably actresses and that his host was an actor and the presence of the half of a large coloured playbill seemed to confirm this a note framed in an oxford frame that was a little too large for it he presently demeaned himself to read dear mr chitterlow it ran its brief course if after all you will send the play you spoke of i will endeavour to read it followed by a stylish but absolutely illegible signature and across this was written in pencil what price harry now and in the shadow by the window was a rough and rather able sketch of the bicyclist in chalk on brown paper calling particular attention to the curvature of the forward lines of his hull and calves and the jaunty carriage of his nose and labelled unmistakably chitterlow kipps thought it rather a takeoff the papers on the table by the syphon were in manuscript kipps observed manuscript of a particularly convulsive and blottesque sort and running obliquely across the page  presently he heard the metallic clamour as if of a series of irreparable breakages with which the lock of the front door discharged its function and then chitterlow reappeared a little out of breath as if from running and with a starry labelled bottle in his large freckled hand  sit down old chap he said sit down i had to go out for it after all wasnt a solitary bottle left however its all right now were here no dont sit on that chair theres sheets of my play on that thats the onewith the broken arm i think this glass is clean but anyhow wash it out with a squizz of syphon and shy it in the fireplace here ill do it lend it here  as he spoke mr chitterlow produced a corkscrew from a table drawer attached and overcame good old methusalehs cork in a style a bartender might envy washed out two tumblers in his simple effectual manner and poured a couple of inches of the ancient fluid into each kipps took his tumbler said thenks in an offhand way and after a momentary hesitation whether he should say heres to you or not put it to his lips without that ceremony for a space fire in his throat occupied his attention to the exclusion of other matters and then he discovered mr chitterlow with an intensely bulldog pipe alight seated on the opposite side of the empty fireplace and pouring himself out a second dose of whiskey  after all said mr chitterlow with his eye on the bottle and a little smile wandering to hide amidst his larger features this accident might have been worse i wanted someone to talk to a bit and i didnt want to go to a pub leastways not a folkestone pub because as a matter of fact id promised mrs chitterlow whos away not to for various reasons though of course if id wanted to im just that sort i should have all the same and here we are its curious how one runs up against people out bicycling  isnt it said kipps feeling that the time had come for him to say something  here we are sitting and talking like old friends and half an hour ago we didnt know we existed leastways we didnt know each other existed i might have passed you in the street perhaps and you might have passed me and how was i to tell that put to the test you would have behaved as decently as you have behaved only it happened otherwise thats all youre not smoking he said have a cigarette  kipps made a confused reply that took the form of not minding if he did and drank another sip of old methusaleh in his confusion he was able to follow the subsequent course of that sip for quite a long way it was as though the old gentleman was brandishing a burning torch through his vitals lighting him here and lighting him there until at last his whole being was in a glow chitterlow produced a tobacco pouch and cigarette papers and with an interesting parenthesis that was a little difficult to follow about some lady named kitty something or other who had taught him the art when he was as yet only what you might call a nice boy made kipps a cigarette and with a consideration that won kipps gratitude suggested that after all he might find a little soda water an improvement with the whiskey some people like it that way said chitterlow and then with voluminous emphasis i dont  emboldened by the weakened state of his enemy kipps promptly swallowed the rest of him and had his glass at once hospitably replenished he began to feel he was of a firmer consistency than he commonly believed and turned his mind to what chitterlow was saying with the resolve to play a larger part in the conversation than he had hitherto done also he smoked through his nose quite successfully an art he had only very recently acquired  meanwhile chitterlow explained that he was a playwright and the tongue of kipps was unloosened to respond that he knew a chap or rather one of their fellows knew a chap or at least to be perfectly correct this fellows brother did who had written a play in response to chitterlows enquiries he could not recall the title of the play nor where it had appeared nor the name of the manager who produced it though he thought the title was something about loves ransom or something like that  he made five undred pounds by it though said kipps i know that  thats nothing said chitterlow with an air of experience that was extremely convincing nothing may seem a big sum to you but i can assure you its just what one gets any day theres any amount of money anny amount in a good play  i dessay said kipps drinking  any amount of money  chitterlow began a series of illustrative instances he was clearly a person of quite unequalled gift for monologue it was as though some conversational dam had burst upon kipps and in a little while he was drifting along upon a copious rapid of talk about all sorts of theatrical things by one who knows all about them and quite incapable of anticipating whither that rapid meant to carry him presently somehow they had got to anecdotes about wellknown theatrical managers little teddy bletherskite artful old chumps and the magnificent behemoth petted to death you know fair sickened by all these society women chitterlow described various personal encounters with these personages always with modest selfdepreciation and gave kipps a very amusing imitation of old chumps in a state of intoxication then he took two more stiff doses of old methusaleh in rapid succession  kipps reduced the hither end of his cigarette to a pulp as he sat dessaying and quite believing chitterlow in the sagest manner and admiring the easy way in which he was getting on with this very novel and entertaining personage he had another cigarette made for him and then chitterlow assuming by insensible degrees more and more of the manner of a rich and successful playwright being interviewed by a young admirer set himself to answer questions which sometimes kipps asked and sometimes chitterlow about the particulars and methods of his career he undertook this selfimposed task with great earnestness and vigour treating the matter indeed with such fulness that at times it seemed lost altogether under a thicket of parentheses footnotes and episodes that branched and budded from its stem but it always emerged again usually by way of illustration to its own degressions practically it was a mass of material for the biography of a man who had been everywhere and done everything including the hon thomas norgate which was a record and in particular had acted with great distinction and profit he dated various anecdotes when i was getting thirty or forty or fifty dollars a week throughout america and the entire civilised world  and as he talked on and on in that full rich satisfying voice he had and as old methusaleh indisputably a most drunken old reprobate of a whiskey busied himself throughout kipps lighting lamp after lamp until the entire framework of the little draper was illuminated and glowing like some public building on a festival behold chitterlow and kipps with him and the room in which they sat were transfigured chitterlow became in very truth that ripe full man of infinite experience and humour and genius fellow of shakespeare and ibsen and maeterlinck three names he placed together quite modestly far above his own and no longer ambiguously dressed in a sort of yachting costume with cycling knickerbockers but elegantly if unconventionally attired and the room ceased to be a small and shabby room in a folkestone slum and grew larger and more richly furnished and the flyblown photographs were curious old pictures and the rubbish on the walls the most rare and costly bricàbrac and the indisputable paraffin lamp a soft and splendid light a certain youthful heat that to many minds might have weakened old methusalehs starry claim to a ripe antiquity vanished in that glamour two burnt holes and a claimant darn in the table cloth moreover became no more than the pleasing contradictions natural in the house of genius and as for kippskipps was a bright young man of promise distinguished by recent quick courageous proceedings not too definitely insisted upon and he had been rewarded by admission to a sanctum and confidences for which the common prosperous for which society women even were notoriously sighing in vain dont want them my boy theyd simply play old harry with the work you know chaps outside bank clerks and university fellows think the lifes all that sort of thing dont you believe em dont you believe em  and then  boom boom boom boom right in the middle of a most entertaining digression on flats who join touring companies under the impression that they are actors kipps much amused at their flatness as exposed by chitterlow  lor said kipps like one who awakens thats not eleven  must be said chitterlow it was nearly ten when i got that whiskey its early yet  all the same i must be going said kipps and stood up even nowmaybe fact isi ad no idea the ouse door shuts at arf past ten you know i ought to ave thought before  well if you must go i tell you what ill come too why theres your leg old man clean forgot it you cant go through the streets like that ill sew up the tear and meanwhile have another whiskey  i ought to be getting on now protested kipps feebly and then chitterlow was showing him how to kneel on a chair in order that the rent trouser leg should be attainable and old methusaleh on his third round was busy repairing the temporary eclipse of kipps arterial glow then suddenly chitterlow was seized with laughter and had to leave off sewing to tell kipps that the scene wouldnt make a bad bit of business in a farcical comedy and then he began to sketch out the farcical comedy and that led him to a digression about another farcical comedy of which he had written a ripping opening scene which wouldnt take ten minutes to read it had something in it that had never been done on the stage before and was yet perfectly legitimate namely a man with a live beetle down the back of his neck trying to seem at his ease in a roomful of people  they wont lock you out he said in a singularly reassuring tone and began to read and act what he explained to be not because he had written it but simply because he knew it was so on account of his exceptional experience of the stage and what kipps also quite clearly saw to be one of the best opening scenes that had ever been written  when it was over kipps who rarely swore was inspired to say the scene was damned fine about six times over whereupon as if by way of recognition chitterlow took a simply enormous portion of the inspiring antediluvian declaring at the same time that he had rarely met a finer intelligence than kipps stronger there might be that he couldnt say with certainty as yet seeing how little after all they had seen of each other but a finer never that it was a shame such a gallant and discriminating intelligence should be nightly either locked up or locked out at tenwell ten thirty thenand that he had half a mind to recommend old somebody or other apparently the editor of a london daily paper to put on kipps forthwith as a dramatic critic in the place of the current incapable  i dont think ive ever made up anything for print said kipps ever id have a thundering good try though if ever i got a chance i would that ive written window tickets often enough made em up and everything but thats different  youd come to it all the fresher for not having done it before and the way you picked up every point in that scene my boy was a fair treat i tell you youd knock william archer into fits not so literary of course youd be but i dont believe in literary critics any more than in literary playwrights plays arent literaturethats just the point they miss plays are plays no that wont hamper you anyhow youre wasted down here i tell you just as i was before i took to acting im hanged if i wouldnt like your opinion on these first two acts of that tragedy im on to i havent told you about that it wouldnt take me more than an hour to read   §3  then so far as he could subsequently remember kipps had another and then it would seem that suddenly regardless of the tragedy he insisted that he reelly must be getting on and from that point his memory became irregular certain things have remained quite clearly and as it is a matter of common knowledge that intoxicated people forget what happens to them it follows that he was not intoxicated chitterlow came with him partly to see him home and partly for a freshener before turning in kipps recalled afterwards very distinctly how in little fenchurch street he discovered that he could not walk straight and also that chitterlows needle and thread in his still unmended trouser leg was making an annoying little noise on the pavement behind him he tried to pick up the needle suddenly by surprise and somehow tripped and fell and then chitterlow laughing uproariously helped him up it wasnt a bicycle this time old boy said chitterlow and that appeared to them both at the time as being a quite extraordinarily good joke indeed they punched each other about on the strength of it  for a time after that kipps certainly pretended to be quite desperately drunk and unable to walk and chitterlow entered into the pretence and supported him after that kipps remembered being struck with the extremely laughable absurdity of going down hill to tontine street in order to go up hill again to the emporium and trying to get that idea into chitterlows head and being unable to do so on account of his own merriment or chitterlows evident intoxication and his next memory after that was of the exterior of the emporium shut and darkened and as it were frowning at him with all its stripes of yellow and green the chilly way in which shalford glittered in the moonlight printed itself with particular vividness on his mind it appeared to kipps that that establishment was closed to him for evermore those gilded letters in spite of appearances spelt finis for him and exile from folkestone he would never do woodcarving never see miss walshingham again not that he had ever hoped to see her again but this was the knife this was final he had stayed out he had got drunk there had been that row about the manchester window dressing only three days ago in the retrospect he was quite sure that he was perfectly sober then and at bottom extremely unhappy but he kept a brave face on the matter nevertheless and declared stoutly he didnt care if he was locked out  whereupon chitterlow slapped him on the back very hard and told him that was a bit of all right and assured him that when he himself had been a clerk in sheffield before he took to acting he had been locked out sometimes for six nights running  whats the result said chitterlow i could go back to that place now and theyd be glad to have me glad to have me he repeated and then added that is to say if they remember mewhich isnt very likely  kipps asked a little weakly what am i to do  keep out said chitterlow you cant knock em up nowthat would give you right away youd better try and sneak in in the morning with the cat thatll do you youll probably get in all right in the morning if nobody gives you away  then for a timeperhaps as the result of that slap in the backkipps felt decidedly queer and acting on chitterlows advice went for a bit of a freshener upon the leas after a time he threw off the temporary queerness and found chitterlow patting him on the shoulder and telling him that hed be all right now in a minute and all the better for itwhich he was and the wind having dropped and the night being now a really very beautiful moonlight night indeed and all before kipps to spend as he liked and with only a very little tendency to spin round now and again to mar its splendour they set out to walk the whole length of the leas to the sandgate lift and back and as they walked chitterlow spoke first of moonlight transfiguring the sea and then of moonlight transfiguring faces and so at last he came to the topic of love and upon that he dwelt a great while and with a wealth of experience and illustrative anecdote that seemed remarkably pungent and material to kipps he forgot his lost miss walshingham and his outraged employer again he became as it were a desperado by reflection  chitterlow had had adventures a quite astonishing variety of adventures in this direction he was a man with a past a really opulent past and he certainly seemed to like to look back and see himself amidst its opulence  he made no consecutive history but he gave kipps vivid momentary pictures of relations and entanglements one moment he was in flightonly too worthily in flightbefore the husband of a malay woman in cape town at the next he was having passionate complications with the daughter of a clergyman in york then he passed to a remarkable grouping at seaford  they say you cant love two women at once said chitterlow but i tell you he gesticulated and raised his ample voice its rot rot  i know that said kipps  why when i was in the smalls with bessie hoppers company there were three he laughed and decided to add not counting bessie that is  he set out to reveal life as it is lived in touring companies a quite amazing jungle of interwoven affairs it appeared to be a mere amorous winepress for the crushing of hearts  people say this sort of things a nuisance and interferes with work i tell you it isnt the work couldnt go on without it they must do it they havent the temperament if they dont if they hadnt the temperament they wouldnt want to act if they havebif  youre right said kipps i see that  chitterlow proceeded to a close criticism of certain historical indiscretions of mr clement scott respecting the morals of the stage speaking in confidence and not as one who addresses the public he admitted regretfully the general truth of these comments he proceeded to examine various typical instances that had almost forced themselves upon him personally and with especial regard to the contrast between his own character towards women and that of the hon thomas norgate with whom it appeared he had once been on terms of great intimacy  kipps listened with emotion to these extraordinary recollections they were wonderful to him they were incredibly credible of course the tumultuous passionate course was the way life ranexcept in highclass establishments such things happened in novels in playsonly he had been fool enough not to understand they happened his share in the conversation was now indeed no more than faint writing in the margin chitterlow was talking quite continuously he expanded his magnificent voice into huge guffaws he drew it together into a confidential intensity it became drawlingly reminiscent he was frank frank with the effect of a revelation reticent also with the effect of a revelation a stupendously gesticulating moonlit black figure wallowing in itself preaching adventure and the flesh to kipps yet withal shot with something of sentiment with a sort of sentimental refinement very coarsely and egotistically done the times he had hadeven before he was as old as kipps he had had innumerable times  well he said with a sudden transition he had sown his wild oatsone had to somewhenand now he fancied he had mentioned it earlier in the evening he was happily married she was he indicated a born lady her father was a prominent lawyer a solicitor in kentish town done a lot of public house business her mother was second cousin to the wife of abel jones the fashionable portrait painteralmost society people in a way that didnt count with chitterlow he was no snob what did count was that she possessed what he ventured to assert without much fear of contradiction was the very finest completely untrained contralto voice in all the world but to hear it properly said chitterlow you want a big hall he became rather vague and jerked his head about to indicate when and how he had entered matrimony she was it seemed away with her people it was clear that chitterlow did not get on with these people very well it would seem they failed to appreciate his playwright regarding it as an unremunerative pursuit whereas as he and kipps knew wealth beyond the dreams of avarice would presently accrue only patience and persistence were needful  he went off at a tangent to hospitality kipps must come down home with him they couldnt wander about all night with a bottle of the right sort pining at home for them you can sleep on the sofa you wont be worried by broken springs anyhow for i took em all out myself two or three weeks ago i dont see what they even put em in for its a point i know about i took particular notice of it when i was with bessie hopper three months we were and all over england north wales and the isle of man and i never struck a sofa in diggings anywhere that hadnt a broken spring not onceall the time  he added almost absently it happens like that at times  they descended the slant road towards harbour street and went on past the pavilion hotel   §4  they came into the presence of old methusaleh again and that worthy under chitterlows direction at once resumed the illumination of kipps interior with the conscientious thoroughness that distinguished him chitterlow took a tall portion to himself with an air of asbestos lit the bulldog pipe again and lapsed for a space into meditation from which kipps roused him by remarking that he expected an acter as a lot of ups and downs like now and then  at which chitterlow seemed to bestir himself rather he said and sometimes its his own fault and sometimes it isnt usually it is if it isnt one thing its another if it isnt the managers wife its barbragging i tell you things happen at times im a fatalist the fact is character has you you cant get away from it you may think you do but you dont  he reflected for a moment its that what makes tragedy psychology really its the greek ironyibsen andall that up to date  he emitted this exhaustive summary of hightoned modern criticism as if he was repeating a lesson while thinking of something else but it seemed to rouse him as it passed his lips by including the name of ibsen  he became interested in telling kipps who was indeed open to any information whatever about this quite novel name exactly where he thought ibsen fell short points where it happened that ibsen was defective just where it chanced that he chitterlow was strong of course he had no desire to place himself in any way on an equality with ibsen still the fact remained that his own experience in england and america and the colonies was altogether more extensive than ibsen could have had ibsen had probably never seen one decent bar scrap in his life that of course was not ibsens fault or his own merit but there the thing was genius he knew was supposed to be able to do anything or to do without anything still he was now inclined to doubt that he had a play in hand that might perhaps not please william archerwhose opinion after all he did not value as he valued kipps opinionbut which he thought was at any rate as well constructed as anything ibsen ever did  so with infinite deviousness chitterlow came at last to his play he decided he would not read it to kipps but tell him about it this was the simpler because much of it was still unwritten he began to explain his plot it was a complicated plot and all about a nobleman who had seen everything and done everything and knew practically all that chitterlow knew about women that is to say all about women and suchlike matters it warmed and excited chitterlow presently he stood up to act a situationwhich could not be explained it was an extremely vivid situation  kipps applauded the situation vehemently thas dam fine said the new dramatic critic quite familiar with his part now striking the table with his fist and almost upsetting his third portion in the second series of old methusaleh thas dam fine chitlow  you see it said chitterlow with the last vestiges of that incidental gloom disappearing good old boy i thought youd see it but its just the sort of thing the literary critic cant see however its only a beginning  he replenished kipps and proceeded with his exposition  in a little while it was no longer necessary to give that overadvertised ibsen the purely conventional precedence he had hitherto had kipps and chitterlow were friends and they could speak frankly and openly of things not usually admitted any ow said kipps a little irrelevantly and speaking over the brim of the replenishment what you read jus now was dam fine nothing cant alter that  he perceived a sort of faint buzzing vibration about things that was very nice and pleasant and with a little care he had no difficulty whatever in putting his glass back on the table then he perceived chitterlow was going on with the scenario and then that old methusaleh had almost entirely left his bottle he was glad there was so little more methusaleh to drink because that would prevent his getting drunk he knew that he was not now drunk but he knew that he had had enough he was one of those who always know when they have had enough he tried to interrupt chitterlow to tell him this but he could not get a suitable opening he doubted whether chitterlow might not be one of those people who did not know when they had had enough he discovered that he disapproved of chitterlow highly it seemed to him that chitterlow went on and on like a river for a time he was inexplicably and quite unjustly cross with chitterlow and wanted to say to him you got the gift of the gab but he only got so far as to say the gift and then chitterlow thanked him and said he was better than archer any day so he eyed chitterlow with a baleful eye until it dawned upon him that a most extraordinary thing was taking place chitterlow kept mentioning someone named kipps this presently began to perplex kipps very greatly dimly but decidedly he perceived this was wrong  look ere he said suddenly what kipps  this chap kipps im telling you about  what chap kipps youre telling which about  i told you  kipps struggled with a difficulty in silence for a space then he reiterated firmly what chap kipps  this chap in my playman who kisses the girl  never kissed a girl said kipps leastwise and subsided for a space he could not remember whether he had kissed ann or nothe knew he had meant to then suddenly in a tone of great sadness and addressing the hearth he said my names kipps  eh said chitterlow  kipps said kipps smiling a little cynically  what about him  hes me he tapped his breastbone with his middle finger to indicate his essential self  he leant forward very gravely towards chitterlow look ere chitlow he said you havent no business putting my name into play you mustnt do things like that youd lose me my crib right away and they had a little argumentso far as kipps could remember chitterlow entered upon a general explanation of how he got his names these he had for the most part got out of a newspaper that was still he believed lying about he even made to look for it and while he was doing so kipps went on with the argument addressing himself more particularly to the photograph of the girl in tights he said that at first her costume had not commended her to him but now he perceived she had an extremely sensible face he told her she would like buggins if she met him he could see she was just that sort she would admit all sensible people would admit that using names in plays was wrong you could for example have the law of him  he became confidential he explained that he was already in sufficient trouble for stopping out all night without having his name put in plays he was certain to be in the deuce of a row the deuce of a row why had he done it why hadnt he gone at ten because one thing leads to another one thing he generalized always does lead to another  he was trying to tell her that he was utterly unworthy of miss walshingham when chitterlow gave up the search and suddenly accused him of being drunk and talking rot     chapter v  swapped   §1  he awoke on the thoroughly comfortable sofa that had had all its springs removed and although he had certainly not been intoxicated he awoke with what chitterlow pronounced to be quite indisputably a head and a mouth he had slept in his clothes and he felt stiff and uncomfortable all over but the head and mouth insisted that he must not bother over little things like that in the head was one large angular idea that it was physically painful to have there if he moved his head the angular idea shifted about in the most agonising way this idea was that he had lost his situation and was utterly ruined and that it really mattered very little shalford was certain to hear of his escapade and that coupled with that row about the manchester window  he raised himself into a sitting position under chitterlows urgent encouragement  he submitted apathetically to his hosts attentions chitterlow who admitted being a bit off it himself and in need of an eggcupful of brandy just an eggcupful neat dealt with that head and mouth as a mother might deal with the fall of an only child he compared it with other heads and mouths that he had met and in particular to certain experienced by the hon thomas norgate right up to the last said chitterlow he couldnt stand his liquor it happens like that at times and after chitterlow had pumped on the young beginners head and given him some anchovy paste piping hot on buttered toast which he preferred to all the other remedies he had encountered kipps resumed his crumpled collar brushed his clothes tacked up his knee and prepared to face mr shalford and the reckoning for this wild unprecedented night the first night out that ever he had taken  acting on chitterlows advice to have a bit of a freshener before returning to the emporium kipps walked some way along the leas and back and then went down to a shop near the harbour to get a cup of coffee he found that extremely reinvigorating and he went on up the high street to face the inevitable terrors of the office a faint touch of pride in his depravity tempering his extreme selfabasement after all it was not an unmanly headache he had been out all night and he had been drinking and his physical disorder was there to witness the fact if it wasnt for the thought of shalford he would have been even a proud man to discover himself at last in such a condition but the thought of shalford was very dreadful he met two of the apprentices snatching a walk before shop began at the sight of them he pulled his spirits together put his hat back from his pallid brow thrust his hands into his trouser pockets and adopted an altogether more dissipated carriage he met their innocent faces with a wan smile just for a moment he was glad that his patch at the knee was after all visible and that some at least of the mud on his clothes had refused to move at chitterlows brushing what wouldnt they think he had been up to he passed them without speaking he could imagine how they regarded his back then he recollected mr shalford  the deuce of a row certainly and perhaps he tried to think of plausible versions of the affair he could explain he had been run down by rather a wild sort of fellow who was riding a bicycle almost stunned for the moment even now he felt the effects of the concussion in his head and had been given whiskey to restore him and the fact is sirwith an upward inflection of the voice an upward inflection of the eyebrows and an air of its being the last thing one would have expected whiskey to do the manifestation indeed of a practically unique physiological weaknessit got into my ed  put like that it didnt look so bad  he got to the emporium a little before eight and the housekeeper with whom he was something of a favourite theres no harm in mr kipps she used to say seemed to like him if anything better for having broken the rules and gave him a piece of dry toast and a good hot cup of tea  i suppose the g v began kipps  he knows said the housekeeper  he went down to shop a little before time and presently booch summoned him to the presence  he emerged from the private office after an interval of ten minutes  the junior clerk scrutinised his visage buggins put the frank question  kipps answered with one word  swapped said kipps   §2  kipps leant against the fixtures with his hands in his pockets and talked to the two apprentices under him  i dont care if i am swapped said kipps i been sick of teddy and his system some time i was a good mind to chuck it when my time was up wish i ad now  afterwards pierce came round and kipps repeated this  whats it for said pierce that row about the window tickets  no fear said kipps and sought to convey a perspective of splendid depravity i wasnt in las night he said and made even pierce man about town pierce open his eyes  why where did you get to asked pierce  he conveyed that he had been fair round the town with a nactor chap i know  one cant always be living like a curit he said  no fear said pierce trying to play up to him  but kipps had the top place in that conversation  my lor said kipps when pierce had gone but wasnt my mouth and ed bad this morning before i ad a pickmeup  whad jer ave  anchovy on ot buttered toast its the very best pickmeup there is you trust me rodgers i never take no other and i dont advise you to see  and when pressed for further particulars he said again he had been fair all round the town with a nactor chap he knew they asked curiously all he had done and he said well what do you think and when they pressed for still further details he said there were things little boys ought not to know and laughed darkly and found them some huckaback to roll  and in this manner for a space did kipps fend off the contemplation of the key of the street that shalford had presented him   §3  this sort of thing was all very well when junior apprentices were about but when kipps was alone with himself it served him not at all he was uncomfortable inside and his skin was uncomfortable and head and mouth palliated perhaps but certainly not cured were still with him he felt to tell the truth nasty and dirty and extremely disgusted with himself to work was dreadful and to stand still and think still more dreadful his patched knee reproached him these were the second best of his three pairs of trousers and they had cost him thirteen and sixpence practically ruined they were his dusting pair was unfit for shop and he would have to degrade his best when he was under inspection he affected the slouch of a desperado but directly he found himself alone this passed insensibly into the droop  the financial aspect of things grew large before him his whole capital in the world was the sum of five pounds in the post office savings bank and four and sixpence cash besides there would be two months screw his little tin box upstairs was no longer big enough for his belongings he would have to buy another let alone that it was not calculated to make a good impression in a new crib then there would be paper and stamps needed in some abundance for answering advertisements and railway fares when he went crib hunting he would have to write letters and he never wrote letters there was spelling for example to consider probably if nothing turned up before his month was up he would have to go home to his uncle and aunt  how would they take it  for the present at any rate he resolved not to write to them  such disagreeable things as this it was that lurked below the fair surface of kipps assertion ive been wanting a chance if e adnt swapped me i should very likely ave swapped im  in the perplexed privacies of his own mind he could not understand how everything had happened he had been the victim of fate or at least of one as inexorablechitterlow he tried to recall the successive steps that had culminated so disastrously they were difficult to recall  buggins that night abounded in counsel and reminiscence  curious thing said buggins but every time ive had the swap ive never believed i should get another cribnever but i have said buggins always so dont lose heart whatever you do  whatever you do said buggins keep hold of your collars and cuffsshirts if you can but collars anyhow spout them last and anyhow its summeryou wont want your coat you got a good umbrella  youll no more get a shop from new romney thananything go straight up to london get the cheapest room you can findand hang out dont eat too much many a chaps put his prospects in his stomach get a cup o coffee and a sliceegg if you likebut remember you got to turn up at the warehouse tidy the best places now i believe are the old cabmens eating houses keep your watch and chain as long as you can  theres lots of shops going said buggins lots  and added reflectively but not this time of year perhaps  he began to recall his own researches stonishing lot of chaps you see he said all sorts look like dukes some of em high hat patent boots frock coat all there all right for a west end crib otherslord its a caution kipps boots been inked in some reading roomsi used to write in a reading room in fleet street regular penny clubhat been wetted collar frayed tail coat buttoned up black chestplaster tiespread out shirt you know gone buggins pointed upward with a pious expression  no shirt i expect  eat it said buggins  kipps meditated i wonder where old merton is he said at last i often wondered about im   §4  it was the morning following kipps notice of dismissal that miss walshingham came into the shop she came in with a dark slender lady rather faded rather tightly dressed whom kipps was to know some day as her mother he discovered them in the main shop at the counter of the ribbon department he had come to the opposite glove counter with some goods enclosed in a parcel that he had unpacked in his own department the two ladies were both bent over a box of black ribbon  he had a moment of tumultuous hesitations the etiquette of the situation was incomprehensible he put down his goods very quietly and stood hands on counter staring at these two ladies then as miss walshingham sat back the instinct of flight seized him  he returned to his manchester shop wildly agitated directly he was out of sight of her he wanted to see her he fretted up and down the counter and addressed some snappish remarks to the apprentice in the window he fumbled for a moment with a parcel untied it needlessly began to tie it up again and then bolted back again into the main shop he could hear his own heart beating  the two ladies were standing in the manner of those who have completed their purchases and are waiting for their change mrs walshingham regarded some remnants with impersonal interest helens eyes searched the shop they distinctly lit up when they discovered kipps  he dropped his hands to the counter by habit and stood for a moment regarding her awkwardly what would she do would she cut him she came across the shop to him  how are you mr kipps she said in her clear distinct tones and she held out her hand  very well thank you said kipps how are you  she said she had been buying some ribbon  he became aware of mrs walshingham very much surprised this checked something allusive about the class and he said instead that he supposed she was glad to be having her holidays now she said she was it gave her more time for reading and that sort of thing he supposed that she would be going abroad and she thought that perhaps they would go to knocke or bruges for a time  then came a pause and kipps soul surged within him he wanted to tell her he was leaving and would never see her again he could find neither words nor voice to say it the swift seconds passed the girl in the ribbons was handing mrs walshingham her change well said miss walshingham goodbye and gave him her hand again  kipps bowed over her hand his manners his counter manners were the easiest she had ever seen upon him she turned to her mother it was no good now no good her mother you couldnt say a thing like that before her mother all was lost but politeness kipps rushed for the door he stood at the door bowing with infinite gravity and she smiled and nodded as she went out she saw nothing of the struggle within him nothing but a satisfactory emotion she smiled like a satisfied goddess as the incense ascends  mrs walshingham bowed stiffly and a little awkwardly  he remained holding the door open for some seconds after they had passed out then rushed suddenly to the back of the costume window to watch them go down the street his hands tightened on the window rack as he stared her mother appeared to be asking discreet questions helens bearing suggested the offhand replies of a person who found the world a satisfactory place to live in really mumsie you cannot expect me to cut my own students dead she was in fact saying  they vanished round hendersons corner  gone and he would never see her againnever  it was as though someone had struck his heart with a whip never never never and she didnt know he turned back from the window and the department with its two apprentices was impossible the whole glaring world was insupportable  he hesitated and made a rush head down for the cellar that was his manchester warehouse rodgers asked him a question that he pretended not to hear  the manchester warehouse was a small cellar apart from the general basement of the building and dimly lit by a small gas flare he did not turn that up but rushed for the darkest corner where on the lowest shelf the sale window tickets were stored he drew out the box of these with trembling hands and upset them on the floor and so having made himself a justifiable excuse for being on the ground with his head well in the dark he could let his poor bursting little heart have its way with him for a space  and there he remained until the cry of kipps forward summoned him once more to face the world     chapter vi  the unexpected   §1  now in the slack of that same day after the midday dinner and before the coming of the afternoon customers this disastrous chitterlow descended upon kipps with the most amazing coincidence in the world he did not call formally entering and demanding kipps but privately in a confidential and mysterious manner  kipps was first aware of him as a dark object bobbing about excitedly outside the hosiery window he was stooping and craning and peering in the endeavour to see into the interior between and over the socks and stockings then he transferred his attention to the door and after a hovering scrutiny tried the babylinen display his movements and gestures suggested a suppressed excitement  seen by daylight chitterlow was not nearly such a magnificent figure as he had been by the subdued nocturnal lightings and beneath the glamour of his own interpretation the lines were the same indeed but the texture was different there was a quality about the yachting cap an indefinable finality of dustiness a shiny finish on all the salient surfaces of the reefer coat the red hair and the profile though still forcible and fine were less in the quality of michael angelo and more in that of the merely picturesque but it was a bright brown eye still that sought amidst the interstices of the babylinen  kipps was by no means anxious to interview chitterlow again if he had felt sure that chitterlow would not enter the shop he would have hid in the warehouse until the danger was past but he had no idea of chitterlows limitations he decided to keep up the shop in the shadows until chitterlow reached the side window of the manchester department and then to go outside as if to inspect the condition of the window and explain to him that things were unfavourable to immediate intercourse he might tell him he had already lost his situation  ullo chitlow he said emerging  very man i want to see said chitterlow shaking with vigour very man i want to see he laid a hand on kipps arm how old are you kipps  one and twenty said kipps why  talk about coincidences and your name now wait a minute he held out a finger is it arthur  yes said kipps  youre the man said chitterlow  what man  its about the thickest coincidence i ever struck said chitterlow plunging his extensive hand into his breast coat pocket half a jiff and ill tell you your mothers christian name he laughed and struggled with his coat for a space produced a washing book and two pencils which he deposited in his side pocket then in one capacious handful a bent but by no means finally disabled cigar the rubber proboscis of a bicycle pump some twine and a ladys purse and finally a small pocket book and from this after dropping and recovering several visiting cards he extracted a carelessly torn piece of newspaper euphemia he read and brought his face close to kipps eh he laughed noisily its about as fair a bit of all right as anyone could haveoutside a coincidence play dont say her name wasnt euphemia kipps and spoil the whole blessed show  whose nameeuphemia asked kipps  your mothers  lemme see what it says on the paper  chitterlow handed him the fragment and turned away you may say what you like he said addressing a vast deep laugh to the street generally  kipps attempted to read waddy or kipps if arthur waddy or arthur kipps the son of margaret euphemia kipps who  chitterlows finger swept over the print i went down the column and every blessed name that seemed to fit my play i took i dont believe in madeup names as i told you im all with zola in that documents whenever you can i like em hot and real see who was waddy  never heard his name  not waddy  no  kipps tried to read again and abandoned the attempt what does it mean he said i dont understand  it means said chitterlow with a momentary note of lucid exposition so far as i can make out that youre going to strike it rich never mind about the waddythats a detail what does it usually mean youll hear of something to your advantagevery well i took that newspaper up to get my names by the merest chance directly i saw it again and read thati knew it was you i believe in coincidences people say they dont happen i say they do everythings a coincidence seen properly here you are heres one incredible not a bit of it see its you kipps waddy be damned its a mascot theres luck in my play bif youre there im there fair in it snap and he discharged his fingers like a pistol never you mind about the waddy  eh said kipps with a nervous eye on chitterlows fingers  youre all right said chitterlow you may bet the seat of your only breeches on that dont you worry about the waddythats as clear as day youre about as right side up as a billiard ballwhatever you do dont stand there gaping man read the paper if you dont believe me read it  he shook it under kipps nose  kipps became aware of the second apprentice watching them from the shop his air of perplexity gave place to a more confident bearing   who was born at east grinstead i certainly was born there ive eard my aunt say  i knew it said chitterlow taking hold of one edge of the paper and bringing his face close alongside kipps  on september the first eighteen hundred and seventyeight  thats all right said chitterlow its all all right and all you have to do is write to watson and bean and get it  get what  whatever it is  kipps sought his moustache youd write he asked  rather  but what dyou think it is  thats the fun of it said chitterlow taking three steps in some as yet uninvented dance thats where the joke comes in it may be anythingit may be a million if so where does little harry come in eh  kipps was trembling slightly but he said and thought if you was me he began about that waddy  he glanced up and saw the second apprentice disappear with amazing swiftness from behind the goods in the window  what asked chitterlow but he never had an answer  lor theres the guvnor said kipps and made a prompt dive for the door  he dashed in only to discover that shalford with the junior apprentice in attendance had come to mark off remnants of kipps cotton dresses and was demanding him hullo kipps he said outside  seein if the window was straight sir said kipps  umph said shalford  for a space kipps was too busily employed to think at all of chitterlow or the crumpled bit of paper in his trouser pocket he was however painfully aware of a suddenly disconcerted excitement at large in the street there came one awful moment when chitterlows nose loomed interrogatively over the ground glass of the department door and his bright little redbrown eye sought for the reason of kipps disappearance and then it became evident that he saw the high light of shalfords baldness and grasped the situation and went away and then kipps with that advertisement in his pocket was able to come back to the business in hand  he became aware that shalford had asked a question yessir nosir rightsir im sorting up zephyrs tomorrow sir said kipps  presently he had a moment to himself again and taking up a safe position behind a newly unpacked pile of summer lace curtains he straightened out the piece of paper and reperused it it was a little perplexing that arthur waddy or arthur kippsdid that imply two persons or one he would ask pierce or buggins only  it had always been impressed upon him that there was something demanding secrecy about his mother  dont you answer no questions about your mother his aunt had been wont to say tell them you dont know whatever it is they ask you  now this  kipps face became portentously careful and he tugged at his moustache such as it was hard  he had always represented his father as being a gentleman farmer it didnt pay he used to say with a picture in his own mind of a penny magazine aristocrat prematurely worn out by worry im a norfan both sides he would explain with the air of one who had seen trouble he said he lived with his uncle and aunt but he did not say that they kept a toy shop and to tell anyone that his uncle had been a butlera servantwould have seemed the maddest of indiscretions almost all the assistants in the emporium were equally reticent and vague so great is their horror of lowness of any sort to ask about this waddy or kipps would upset all these little fictions he was not as a matter of fact perfectly clear about his real status in the world he was not as a matter of fact perfectly clear about anything but he knew that there was a quality about his status that wasdetrimental  under the circumstances  it occurred to him that it would save a lot of trouble to destroy the advertisement there and then  in which case he would have to explain to chitterlow  eng said mr kipps  kipps cried carshot who was shopwalking kipps forward  he thrust back the crumpled paper into his pocket and sallied forth to the customers  i want said the customer looking vaguely about her through glasses a little bit of something to cover a little stool i have anything would doa remnant or anything  the matter of the advertisement remained in abeyance for half an hour and at the end the little stool was still a candidate for covering and kipps had a thoroughly representative collection of the textile fabrics in his department to clear away he was so angry about the little stool that the crumpled advertisement lay for a space in his pocket absolutely forgotten   §2  kipps sat on his tin box under the gas bracket that evening and looked up the name euphemia and learnt what it meant in the enquire within about everything that constituted buggins reference library he hoped buggins according to his habit would ask him what he was looking for but buggins was busy turning out his weeks washing two collars said buggins half pair socks two dickeys shirt mm there ought to be another collar somewhere  euphemia said kipps at last unable altogether to keep to himself this suspicion of a high origin that floated so delightfully about him euphemia it isnt a name common people would give to a girl is it  it isnt the name any decent people would give to a girl said buggins common or not  lor said kipps why  its giving girls names like that said buggins that nine times out of ten makes em go wrong it unsettles em if ever i was to have a girl if ever i was to have a dozen girls id call em all jane every one of em you couldnt have a better name than that euphemia indeed what next good lord that isnt one of my collars there is it under your bed  kipps got him the collar  i dont see no great arm in euphemia he said as he did so  after that he became restless im a good mind to write that letter he said and then finding buggins preoccupied wrapping his washing up in the half sox added to himself a thundering good mind  so he got his penny bottle of ink borrowed the pen from buggins and with no very serious difficulty in spelling or composition did as he had resolved  he came back into the bedroom about an hour afterwards a little out of breath and pale where you been said buggins who was now reading the daily world manager which came to him in rotation from carshot  out to post some letters said kipps hanging up his hat  crib hunting  mostly said kipps  rather he added with a nervous laugh what else  buggins went on reading kipps sat on his bed and regarded the back of the daily world manager thoughtfully  buggins he said at last  buggins lowered his paper and looked  i say buggins what do these here advertisements mean that say soandso will hear of something greatly to his advantage  missin people said buggins making to resume reading  how dyer mean asked kipps money left and that sort of thing  buggins shook his head debts he said more often than not  but that aint to his advantage  they put that to get old of em said buggins often its wives  what you mean  deserted wives try and get their husbands back that way  i suppose it is legacies sometimes eh perhaps if someone was left a hundred pounds by someone  hardly ever said buggins  well ow began kipps and hesitated  buggins resumed reading he was very much excited by a leader on indian affairs by jove he said it wont do to give these here blacks votes  no fear said kipps  theyre different altogether said buggins they avent the sound sense of englishmen and they avent the character theres a sort of tricky dishonesty about emfalse witness and all thatof which an englishman has no idea outside their courts of lawits a postive fact kippstheres witnesses waitin to be ired reglar trade touch their ats as you go in englishmen ave no idea i tell younot ordnary englishmen its in their blood theyre too timid to be honest too slavish they arent used to being free like we are and if you gave em freedom they wouldnt make a proper use of it now we oh damn  for the gas had suddenly gone out and buggins had the whole column of society club chat still to read  buggins could talk of nothing after that but shalfords meanness in turning off the gas and after being extremely satirical indeed about their employer undressed in the dark hit his bare toe against a box and subsided after unseemly ejaculations into silent illtemper  though kipps tried to get to sleep before the affair of the letter he had just posted resumed possession of his mind he could not do so he went over the whole thing again quite exhaustively now that his first terror was abating he couldnt quite determine whether he was glad or sorry that he had posted that letter if it should happen to be a hundred pounds  it must be a hundred pounds  if it was he could hold out for a year for a couple of years even before he got a crib  even if it was fifty pounds  buggins was already breathing regularly when kipps spoke again buggins he said  buggins pretended to be asleep and thickened his regular breathing a little too hastily to a snore  i say buggins said kipps after an interval  whats up now said buggins unamiably  spose you saw an advertisement in a paper with your name in it see asking you to come and see someone like so as to hear of something very much to your  hide said buggins shortly  but  id hide  er  goonight o man said buggins with convincing earnestness kipps lay still for a long time then blew profoundly turned over and stared at the other side of the dark  he had been a fool to post that letter  lord hadnt he been a fool   §3  it was just five days and a half after the light had been turned out while buggins was reading that a young man with a white face and eyes bright and wideopen emerged from a side road upon the leas front he was dressed in his best clothes and although the weather was fine he carried his umbrella just as if he had been to church he hesitated and turned to the right he scanned each house narrowly as he passed it and presently came to an abrupt stop hughenden said the gateposts in firm black letters and the fanlight in gold repeated hughenden it was a stucco house fit to take your breath away and its balcony was painted a beautiful seagreen enlivened with gilding he stood looking up at it  gollys he said at last in an awestricken whisper  it had richlooking crimson curtains to all the lower windows and brass railed blinds above there was a splendid tropical plant in a large artistic pot in the drawingroom window there was a splendid bronzed knocker ring also and two bellsone marked servants gollys servants eh  he walked past away from it with his eyes regarding it and then turned and came back he passed through a further indecision and finally drifted away to the sea front and sat down on a seat a little way along the leas and put his arm over the back and regarded hughenden he whistled an air very softly to himself put his head first on one side and then on the other then for a space he scowled fixedly at it  a very stout old gentleman with a very red face and very protuberant eyes sat down beside kipps removed a panama hat of the most abandoned desperado cut and mopped his brow and blew then he began mopping the inside of his hat kipps watched him for a space wondering how much he might have a year and where he bought his hat then hughenden reasserted itself  an impulse overwhelmed him i say he said leaning forward to the old gentleman  the old gentleman started and stared  whad do you say he asked fiercely  you wouldnt think said kipps indicating with his forefinger that that ouse there belongs to me  the old gentleman twisted his neck round to look at hughenden then he came back to kipps looked at his mean little garments with apoplectic intensity and blew at him by way of reply  it does said kipps a little less confidently  dont be a fool said the old gentleman and put his hat on and wiped out the corners of his eyes its hot enough panted the old gentleman indignantly without fools kipps looked from the old gentleman to the house and back to the old gentleman the old gentleman looked at kipps and snorted and looked out to sea and again snorting very contemptuously at kipps  mean to say it doesnt belong to me said kipps  the old gentleman just glanced over his shoulder at the house in dispute and then fell to pretending kipps didnt exist its been lef me this very morning said kipps it aint the only one thats been lef me neither  aw said the old gentleman like one who is sorely tried he seemed to expect the passersby presently to remove kipps  it as said kipps he made no further remark to the old gentleman for a space but looked with a little less certitude at the house  i got he said and stopped  its no good telling you if you dont believe he said  the old gentleman after a struggle with himself decided not to have a fit try that game on with me he panted give you in charge  what game  wasnt born yesterday said the old gentleman and blew besides he added look at you i know you and the old gentleman coughed shortly and nodded to the horizon and coughed again  kipps looked dubiously from the house to the old gentleman and back to the house their conversation he gathered was over presently he got up and went slowly across the grass to its stucco portal again he stood and his mouth shaped the precious word hughenden it was all right he looked over his shoulder as if in appeal to the old gentleman then turned and went his way the old gentleman was so evidently past all reason  he hung for a moment some distance along the parade as though some invisible string was pulling him back when he could no longer see the house from the pavement he went out into the road then with an effort he snapped the string  he went on down a quiet side street unbuttoned his coat furtively took out three bank notes in an envelope looked at them and replaced them then he fished up five new sovereigns from his trouser pocket and examined them to such a confidence had his exact resemblance to his dead mothers portrait carried messrs watson and bean  it was right enough  it really was all right  he replaced the coins with grave precaution and went his way with a sudden briskness it was all righthe had it nowhe was a rich man at large he went up a street and round a corner and along another street and started towards the pavilion and changed his mind and came round back resolved to go straight to the emporium and tell them all  he was aware of someone crossing a road far off ahead of him someone curiously relevant to his present extraordinary state of mind it was chitterlow of course it was chitterlow who had told him first of the whole thing the playwright was marching buoyantly along a cross street his nose was in the air the yachting cap was on the back of his head and the large freckled hand grasped two novels from the library a morning newspaper a new hat done up in paper and a ladys net bag full of onions and tomatoes  he passed out of sight behind the wine merchants at the corner as kipps decided to hurry forward and tell him of the amazing change in the order of the universe that had just occurred  kipps uttered a feeble shout arrested as it began and waved his umbrella then he set off at a smart pace in pursuit he came round the corner and chitterlow had gone he hurried to the next and there was no chitterlow he turned back unavailingly and his eyes sought some other possible corner his hand fluttered to his mouth and he stood for a space at the pavement edge staring about him no good  but the sight of chitterlow was a wholesome thing it connected events together joined him on again to the past at a new point and that was what he so badly needed  it was all rightall right  he became suddenly very anxious to tell everybody at the emporium absolutely everybody all about it that was what wanted doing he felt that telling was the thing to make this business real he gripped his umbrella about the middle and walked very eagerly  he entered the emporium through the manchester department he flung open the door over whose ground glass he had so recently in infinite apprehension watched the nose of chitterlow and discovered the second apprentice and pierce in conversation pierce was prodding his hollow tooth with a pin and talking in fragments about the distinctive characteristics of good style  kipps came up in front of the counter  i say he said what dyer think  what said pierce over the pin  guess  youve slipped out because teddys in london  something more  what  been left a fortune  garn  i ave  get out  straight i been lef twelve undred poundstwelve undred pounds a year  he moved towards the little door out of the department into the house moving as heralds say regardant passant pierce stood with mouth wide open and pin poised in air no he said at last  its right said kipps and im going  and he fell over the doormat into the house   §4  it happened that mr shalford was in london buying summer sale goodsand no doubt also interviewing aspirants to succeed kipps  so that there was positively nothing to hinder a wild rush of rumour from end to end of the emporium all the masculine members began their report with the same formula heard about kipps  the new girl in the cash desk had had it from pierce and had dashed out into the fancy shop to be the first with the news on the fancy side kipps had been left a thousand pounds a year twelve thousand pounds a year kipps had been left twelve hundred thousand pounds the figures were uncertain but the essential facts they had correct kipps had gone upstairs kipps was packing his box he said he wouldnt stop another day in the old emporium not for a thousand pounds it was said that he was singing ribaldry about old shalford  he had come down he was in the counting house there was a general movement thither poor old buggins had a customer and couldnt make out what the deuce it was all about completely out of it was buggins  there was a sound of running to and fro and voices saying this that and the other thing about kipps ringadinger ringadinger went the dinner bell all unheeded the whole of the emporium was suddenly brighteyed excited hungry to tell somebody to find at any cost somebody who didnt know and be first to tell them kipps has been left thirtyfortyfifty thousand pounds  what cried the senior porter him and ran up to the counting house as eagerly as though kipps had broken his neck  one of our chaps just been left sixty thousand pounds said the first apprentice returning after a great absence to his customer  unexpectedly said the customer  quite said the first apprentice  im sure if anyone deserves it its mr kipps said miss mergle and her train rustled as she hurried to the counting house  there stood kipps amidst a pelting shower of congratulations his face was flushed and his hair disordered he still clutched his hat and best umbrella in his left hand his right hand was anyones to shake rather than his own ringadinger ringadinger ding ding ding dang you went the neglected dinner bell  good old kipps said pierce shaking good old kipps  booch rubbed one anæmic hand upon the other youre sure its all right mr kipps he said in the background  im sure we all congratulate him said miss mergle  great scott said the new young lady in the glove department twelve hundred a year great scott you arent thinking of marrying anyone are you mr kipps  three pounds five and ninepence a day said mr booch working in his head almost miraculously  everyone it seemed was saying how glad they were it was kipps except the junior apprentice upon whomhe being the only son of a widow and used to having the best of everything as a rightan intolerable envy a sense of unbearable wrong had cast its gloomy shade all the rest were quite honestly and simply gladgladder perhaps at that time than kipps because they were not so overpowered  kipps went downstairs to dinner emitting fragmentary disconnected statements never expected anything of the sort when this here old bean told me you could have knocked me down with a feather he says you ben lef money even then i didnt expect itd be morn a hundred pounds perhaps something like that  with the sitting down to dinner and the handing of plates the excitement assumed a more orderly quality the housekeeper emitted congratulations as she carved and the maidservant became dangerous to clothes with the platesshe held them anyhow one expected to see one upside down evenshe found kipps so fascinating to look at everyone was the brisker and hungrier for the news except the junior apprentice and the housekeeper carved with unusual liberality it was high old times there under the gaslight high old times im sure if anyone deserves it said miss merglepass the salt pleaseits kipps  the babble died away a little as carshot began barking across the table at kipps youll be a bit of a swell kipps he said you wont hardly know yourself  quite the gentleman said miss mergle  many real gentlemens families said the housekeeper have to do with less  see you on the leas said carshot my gu he met the housekeepers eye she had spoken about that before my eye he said tamely lest words should mar the day  youll go to london i reckon said pierce youll be a man about town we shall see you mashing em with violets in your buttonole down the burlington arcade  one of these west end flats thatd be my style said pierce and a firstclass club  arent these clubs a bit ard to get into asked kipps openeyed over a mouthful of potato  no fear not for money said pierce and the girl in the laces who had acquired a cynical view of modern society from the fearless exposures of miss marie corelli said money goes everywhere nowadays mr kipps  but carshot showed the true british strain  if i was kipps he said pausing momentarily for a knifeful of gravy i should go to the rockies and shoot bears  id certainly ave a run over to boulogne said pierce and look about a bit im going to do that next easter myself anyhowsee if i dont  go to oireland mr kipps came the soft insistence of biddy murphy who managed the big workroom flushed and shining in the irish way as she spoke go to oireland uts the loveliest country in the world outside carrs fishin shootin huntin an pretty gals eh you should see the lakes of killarney mr kipps and she expressed ecstasy by a facial pantomime and smacked her lips  and presently they crowned the event  it was pierce who said kipps you ought to stand sham  and it was carshot who found the more poetical word champagne  rather said kipps hilariously and the rest was a question of detail and willing emissaries here it comes they said as the apprentice came down the staircase how about the shop said someone oh hang the shop said carshot and made gruntulous demands for a corkscrew with a thing to cut the wire pierce the dog had a wire cutter in his pocket knife how shalford would have stared at the gold tipped bottles if he had chanced to take an early train bang with the corks and bang gluck gluck gluck and sizzle  when kipps found them all standing about him under the gas flare saying almost solemnly kipps with tumblers upheldhave it in tumblers carshot had said have it in tumblers it isnt a wine like you have in glasses not like port and sherry it cheers you up but you dont get drunk it isnt hardly stronger than lemonade they drink it at dinner some of em every day  what at three and six a bottle said the housekeeper incredulously  they dont stick at that said carshot not the champagne sort  the housekeeper pursed her lips and shook her head  when kipps i say found them all standing up to toast him in that manner there came such a feeling in his throat and face that for the life of him he scarcely knew for a moment whether he was not going to cry kipps they all said with kindly eyes it was very good of them it was very good of them and hard there wasnt a stroke of luck for them all  but the sight of upturned chins and glasses pulled him together again  they did him honour unenviously and freely they did him honour  for example carshot being subsequently engaged in serving cretonne and desiring to push a number of rejected blocks up the counter in order to have space for measuring swept them by a powerful and illcalculated movement of the arm with a noise like thunder partly on to the floor and partly on to the foot of the still gloomily preoccupied junior apprentice and buggins whose place it was to shopwalk while carshot served shopwalked with quite unparalleled dignity dangling a new seasons sunshade with a crooked handle on one finger he arrested each customer who came down the shop with a grave and penetrating look showing very tractive line new sheasons shunshade he would remark and after a suitable pause markable thing one our sistant legsy twelve undred a year vry tractive nothing more today mum no and he would then go and hold the door open for them with perfect decorum and with the sunshade dangling elegantly from his left hand  and the second apprentice serving a customer with cheap ticking and being asked suddenly if it was strong answered remarkably  oo no mum strong why it aint ardly stronger than lemonade  the head porter moreover was filled with a virtuous resolve to break the record as a lightning packer and make up for lost time mr swaffenham of the sandgate riviera for example who was going out to dinner that night at seven received at halfpast six instead of the urgently needed dress shirt he expected a corset specially adapted to the needs of persons inclined to embonpoint a parcel of summer underclothing selected by the elder miss waldershawe was somehow distributed in the form of gratis additions throughout a number of parcels of a less intimate nature and a box of millinery on approval to lady pamshort at wampachs was enriched by the addition of the junior porters cap  these little things slight in themselves witness perhaps none the less eloquently to the unselfish exhilaration felt throughout the emporium at the extraordinary and unexpected enrichment of mr kipps   §5  the bus that plies between new romney and folkestone is painted a british red and inscribed on either side with the word tiptop in gold amidst voluptuous scrolls it is a slow and portly bus below it swings a sort of hold hung by chains between the wheels and in the summer time the top has garden seats the front over the two dauntless unhurrying horses rises in tiers like a theatre there is first a seat for the driver and his company and above that a seat and above that unless my memory plays me false a seat there are days when this bus goes and days when it doesnt goyou have to find out and so you get to new romney  this bus it was this ruddy venerable and immortal bus that came down the folkestone hill with unflinching deliberation and trundled through sandgate and hythe and out into the windy spaces of the marsh with kipps and all his fortunes on its brow you figure him there he sat on the highest seat diametrically above the driver and his head was spinning and spinning with champagne and this stupendous tomfoolery of luck and his heart was swelling swelling indeed at times as though it would burst him and his face towards the sunlight was transfigured he said never a word but ever and again as he thought of this or that he laughed he seemed full of chuckles for a time detached and independent chuckles chuckles that rose and burst in him like bubbles in a wine he held a banjo sceptrefashion and restless on his knee he had always wanted a banjo and now he had got one at malchiors while he was waiting for the bus  there sat beside him a young servant who was sucking peppermint and a little boy with a sniff whose flitting eyes showed him curious to know why ever and again kipps laughed and beside the driver were two young men in gaiters talking about tegs and there sat kipps all unsuspected twelve hundred a year as it were disguised as a common young man and the young man in gaiters to the left of the driver eyed kipps and his banjo and especially his banjo ever and again as if he found it and him with his rapt face an insoluble enigma and many a king has ridden into a conquered city with a lesser sense of splendour than kipps  their shadows grew long behind them and their faces were transfigured in gold as they rumbled on towards the splendid west the sun set before they had passed dymchurch and as they came lumbering into new romney past the windmill the dusk had come  the driver handed down the banjo and the portmanteau and kipps having paid himthats aw right he said to the change as a gentleman shouldturned about and ran the portmanteau smartly into old kipps whom the sound of the stopping of the bus had brought to the door of the shop in an aggressive mood and with his mouth full of supper  ullo uncle didnt see you said kipps  blunderin ninny said old kipps whats brought you here aint early closing is it not toosday  got some news for

quickly showing a table equipped with elaborate simplicity for supper and mrs kipps appeared  if it aint young artie she said why whatevers brought you ome  ullo aunt said artie im coming in i got somethin to tell you ive ad a bit of luck  he wouldnt tell them all at once he staggered with the portmanteau round the corner of the counter set a bundle of childrens tin pails into clattering oscillation and entered the little room he deposited his luggage in the corner beside the tall clock and turned to his aunt and uncle again his aunt regarded him doubtfully the yellow light from the little lamp on the table escaped above the shade and lit her forehead and the tip of her nose it would be all right in a minute he wouldnt tell them all at once old kipps stood in the shop door with the banjo in his hand breathing noisily the fact is aunt ive ad a bit of luck  you aint been backin gordless orses artie she asked  no fear  its a draw hes been in said old kipps still panting from the impact of the portmanteau its a dratted draw jest look here molly hes won this ere trashy banjer and thrown up his situation on the strength of itthats what hes done goin about singing dash and

drinking  they regarded their nephew across the supper table with long faces kipps exploded with laughter and broke out again when his aunt shook her head very sadly at him then suddenly he fell grave he felt he could keep it up no longer its all right aunt reely i aint mad and i aint been drinking i been lef money i been left twentysix fousand pounds  pause  and you thrown up your place said old kipps  yes said kipps rather  and bort this banjer put on your best noo trousers and come right on ere  well said mrs kipps i never did  these aint my noo trousers aunt said kipps regretfully my noo

to come and tell you  how dyer know the ouse  they told me  well said old kipps and nodded his head portentously towards his nephew with the corners of his mouth pulled down in a portentous discouraging way well you are a young gaby  i didnt think it of you artie said mrs kipps  wadjer mean asked kipps faintly looking from one to the other with a withered face  old kipps closed the shop door they been avin a lark with you said old kipps in a mournful undertone thats what i mean my boy they jest been seein what a gaby like you ud do  i dessay that young quodling was in it said mrs kipps es jest that sort  for quodling of the green baize bag had grown up to be a fearful dog the terror of new romney  its somebody after your place very likely said old kipps  kipps looked from one sceptical reproving face to the other and round him at the familiar shabby little room with his familiar cheap portmanteau on the mended chair and that banjo amidst the supper things like some irrevocable deed could he be rich indeed could it be that these things had really happened or had some insane fancy whirled him hither  stillperhaps a hundred pounds  but he said its all right reely uncle you dont think i ad a letter  got up said old kipps  but i answered it and went to a norfis  old kipps felt staggered for a moment but he shook his head and chins sagely from side to side as the memory of old bean and shalford revived the confidence of kipps came back to him  i saw a nold gent uncleperfect gentleman and e told me all about it mos respectable e was said is name was watson and beanleastways e was bean said it was lef me kipps suddenly dived into his breast pocket by my grandfather  the old people started  old kipps uttered an exclamation and wheeled round towards the mantel shelf above which the daguerreotype of his lost younger sister smiled its fading smile upon the world  waddy is name was said kipps with his hand still deep in his pocket it was is son was my father  waddy said old kipps  waddy said mrs kipps  shed never say said old kipps  there was a long silence  kipps fumbled with a letter a crumpled advertisement and three bank notes he hesitated between these items  why that young chap what was arsting questions said old kipps and regarded his wife with an eye of amazement  must ave been said mrs kipps  must ave been said old kipps  james said mrs kipps in an awestricken voice after allperhapsits true  ow much did you say asked old kipps ow much did you say ed lef you me by  it was thrilling though not quite in the way kipps had expected he answered almost meekly across the meagre supper things with his documentary evidence in his hand  twelve undred pounds proximately he said twelve undred pounds a year e made is will jest before e diednot moren a month ago when e was dying e seemed to change like mr bean said ed never forgiven is son nevernot till then is son ad died in australia years and years ago and then e adnt forgiven im you knowis son what was my father but jest when e was ill and dying e seemed to get worried like and longing for someone of is own and e told mr bean it was im that had prevented them marrying so e thought thats ow it all come about   §6  at last kipps flaring candle went up the narrow uncarpeted staircase to the little attic that had been his shelter and refuge during all the days of his childhood and youth his head was whirling he had been advised he had been warned he had been flattered and congratulated he had been given whiskey and hot water and lemon and sugar and his health had been drunk in the same he had also eaten two welsh rabbitsan unusual supper his uncle was chiefly for his going into parliament his aunt was consumed with a great anxiety im afraid hell go and marry beneath im  yought to ave a bit o shootin somewheer said old kipps  its your duty to marry into a county family artie remember that  theres lots of young noblemenll be glad to ang on to you said old kipps you mark my words and borry your money and then good day to ye  i got to be precious careful said kipps mr bean said that  and you got to be precious careful of this old bean said old kipps we may be out of the world in noo romney but ive eard a bit about slicitors for all that you keep your eye on old bean me by  ow do we know what es up to with your money even now said old kipps pursuing this uncomfortable topic  e looked very respectable said kipps  kipps undressed with great deliberation and with vast gaps of pensive margin twentysix thousand pounds  his aunts solicitude had brought back certain matters into the foreground that his twelve undred a year had for a time driven away altogether his thoughts went back to the woodcarving class twelve hundred a year he sat on the edge of the bed in profound meditation and his boots fell whop and whop upon the floor with a long interval between each whop twentyfive thousand pounds by gum he dropped the remainder of his costume about him on the floor got into bed pulled the patchwork quilt over him and put his head on the pillow that had been first to hear of ann pornicks accession to his heart but he did not think of ann pornick now  it was about everything in the world except ann pornick that he seemed to be trying to think ofsimultaneously all the vivid happenings of the day came and went in his overtaxed brain that old bean explaining and explaining the fat man who wouldnt believe an overpowering smell of peppermint the banjo miss mergle saying he deserved it chitterlows vanishing round a corner the wisdom and advice and warnings of his aunt and uncle she was afraid he would marry beneath him was she she didnt know  his brain made an excursion into the woodcarving class and presented kipps with the picture of himself amazing that class by a modest yet clearly audible remark i been left twentysix thousand pounds  then he told them all quietly but firmly that he had always loved miss walshingham always and so he had brought all his twentysix thousand pounds with him to give to her there and then he wanted nothing in return yes he wanted nothing in return he would give it to her all in an envelope and go of course he would keep the banjoand a little present for his aunt and uncleand a new suit perhapsand one or two other things she would not miss he went off at a tangent he might buy a motor car he might buy one of these here things that will play you a pianothat would make old buggins sit up he could pretend he had learnt to playhe might buy a bicycle and a cyclist suit  a terrific multitude of plans of what he might do and in particular of what he might buy came crowding into his brain and he did not so much fall asleep as pass into a disorder of dreams in which he was driving a fourhorse tiptop coach down sandgate hill i shall have to be precious careful wearing innumerable suits of clothes and through some terrible accident wearing them all wrong consequently he was being laughed at the coach vanished in the interest of the costume he was wearing golfing suits and a silk hat this passed into a nightmare that he was promenading on the leas in a highland costume with a kilt that kept shrinking and shalford was following him with three policemen hes my assistant shalford kept repeating hes escaped hes an escaped improver keep by him and in a minute youll have to run him in i know em we say they wash but they wont he could feel the kilt creeping up his legs he would have tugged at it to pull it down only his arms were paralysed he had an impression of giddy crisis he uttered a shriek of despair now said shalford he woke in horror his quilt had slipped off the bed  he had a fancy he had just been called that he had somehow overslept himself and missed going down for dusting then he perceived it was still night and light by reason of the moonlight and that he was no longer in the emporium he wondered where he could be he had a curious fancy that the world had been swept and rolled up like a carpet and that he was nowhere it occurred to him that perhaps he was mad buggins he said there was no answer not even the defensive snore no room no buggins nothing  then he remembered better he sat on the edge of his bed for some time could anyone have seen his face they would have seen it white and drawn with staring eyes then he groaned weakly twentysix thousand pounds he whispered  just then it presented itself in an almost horribly overwhelming mass  he remade his bed and returned to it he was still dreadfully wakeful it was suddenly clear to him that he need never trouble to get up punctually at seven again that fact shone out upon him like a star through clouds he was free to lie in bed as long as he liked get up when he liked go where he liked have eggs every morning for breakfast or rashers or bloater paste or also he was going to astonish miss walshingham  astonish her and astonish her                                       he was awakened by a thrush singing in the fresh dawn the whole room was flooded with warm golden sunshine i say said the thrush i say i say twelve undred a year twelve undred a year twelve undred a year i say i say i say  he sat up in bed and rubbed the sleep from his eyes with his knuckles then he jumped out of bed and began dressing very eagerly he did not want to lose any time in beginning the new life   end of book i     book ii  mr coote the chaperon     chapter i  the new conditions   §1  there comes a gentlemanly figure into these events and for a space takes a leading part therein a good influence a refined and amiable figure mr chester coote you must figure him as about to enter our story walking with a curious rectitude of bearing through the evening dusk towards the public library erect largeheadedhe had a great big head full of the suggestion of a powerful mind well under controlwith a large officiallooking envelope in his white and knuckly hand in the other he carries a goldhandled cane he wears a silken grey jacket suit buttoned up and anon he coughs behind the official envelope he has a prominent nose slatey grey eyes and a certain heaviness about the mouth his mouth hangs breathing open with a slight protrusion of the lower jaw his straw hat is pulled down a little in front and he looks each person he passes in the eye and directly his look is answered looks away  thus mr chester coote as he was on the evening when he came upon kipps he was a local house agent and a most active and gentlemanly person a conscious gentleman equally aware of society and the serious side of life from amateur theatricals of a nice refined sort to science classes few things were able to get along without him he supplied a fine full bass a little flat and quavery perhaps but very abundant to the st stylites choir  he passes on towards the public library lifts the envelope in salutation to a passing curate smiles and enters  it was in the public library that he came upon kipps  by that time kipps had been rich a week or more and the change in his circumstances was visible upon his person he was wearing a new suit of drab flannels a panama hat and a red tie for the first time and he carried a silvermounted stick with a tortoise shell handle he felt extraordinarily different perhaps more different than he really was from the meek improver of a week ago he felt as he felt dukes must feel yet at bottom he was still modest he was leaning on his stick and regarding the indicator with a respect that never palled he faced round to meet mr cootes overflowing smile  what are you doang hea said mr chester coote  kipps was momentarily abashed oh he said slowly and then mooching round a bit  that coote should address him with this easy familiarity was a fresh reminder of his enhanced social position jes mooching round he said i been back in folkestone free days now at my ouse you know  ah said mr coote i havent yet had an opportunity of congratulating you on your good fortune  kipps held out his hand it was the cleanest surprise that ever was he said when mr bean told me of ityou could have knocked me down with a feather  it must mean a tremendous change for you  oo rather change why im like the chap in the song they sing i dont ardly know where i are you know  an extraordinary change said mr coote i can quite believe it are you stopping in folkestone  for a bit i got a ouse you know what my granfather ad im stopping there his housekeeper was kep on fancybeing in the same town and everything  precisely said mr coote thats it and coughed like a sheep behind four straight fingers  mr bean got me to come back to see to things else i was out in new romney where my uncle and aunt live but its a lark coming back in a way  the conversation hung for a moment  are you getting a book asked coote  well i avent got a ticket yet but i shall get one all right and have a go in at reading ive often wanted to rather i was just aving a look at this indicator firstclass idea tells you all you want to know  its simple said coote and coughed again keeping his eyes fixed on kipps for a moment they hung evidently disinclined to part then kipps jumped at an idea he had cherished for a day or morenot particularly in relation to coote but in relation to anyone  you doing anything he asked  just called with a papah about the classes  because would you care to come up and look at my ouse and ave a smoke and a chat eh he made indicative back jerks of the head and was smitten with a horrible doubt whether possibly this invitation might not be some hideous breach of etiquette was it for example the correct hour id be awfully glad if you would he added  mr coote begged for a moment while he handed the officiallooking envelope to the librarian and then declared himself quite at kipps service they muddled a moment over precedence at each door they went through and so emerged to the street  it feels awful rum to me at first all this said kipps aving a ouse of my own and all that its strange you know aving all day reely i dont ardly know what to do with my time  dju smoke he said suddenly proffering a magnificent gold decorated pigskin cigarette case which he produced from nothing almost as though it was some sort of trick coote hesitated and declined and then with great liberality dont let me hinder you  they walked a little way in silence kipps being chiefly concerned to affect ease in his new clothes and keeping a wary eye on coote its rather a big windfall said coote presently it yields you an income  twelve undred a year said kipps bit overif anything  do you think of living in folkestone  dont know ardly yet i may then again i may not i got a furnished ouse but i may let it  your plans are undecided  thats jest it said kipps  very beautiful sunset it was tonight said coote and kipps said wasnt it and they began to talk of the merits of sunsets did kipps paint not since he was a boy he didnt believe he could now coote said his sister was a painter and kipps received this intimation with respect coote sometimes wished he could find time to paint himselfbut one couldnt do everything and kipps said that was jest it  they came out presently upon the end of the leas and looked down to where the squat dark masses of the harbour and harbour station gemmed with pinpoint lights crouched against the twilit grey of the sea if one could do that said coote and kipps was inspired to throw his head back cock it on one side regard the harbour with one eye shut and say that it would take some doing then coote said something about abend which kipps judged to be in a foreign language and got over by lighting another cigarette from his by no means completed first one youre right puff puff  he felt that so far he had held up his end of the conversation in a very creditable manner but that extreme discretion was advisable  they turned away and coote remarked that the sea was good for crossing and asked kipps if he had been over the water very much kipps said he hadnt beenmuch but he thought very likely hed have a run over to boulogne soon and coote proceeded to talk of the charms of foreign travel mentioning quite a number of unheardof places by name he had been to them kipps remained on the defensive but behind his defences his heart sank it was all very well to pretend but presently it was bound to come out he didnt know anything of all this  so they drew near the house at his own gate kipps became extremely nervous it was a fine impressive door he knocked neither a single knock nor a double but about one and a halfan apologetic half they were admitted by an irreproachable housemaid with a steady eye before which kipps cringed dreadfully he hung up his hat and fell about over hall chairs and things theres a fire in the study mary he had the audacity to ask though evidently he knew and led the way upstairs panting he tried to shut the door and discovered the housemaid behind him coming to light his lamp this enfeebled him further he said nothing until the door closed behind her meanwhile to show his sang froid he hummed and flitted towards the window and here and there  coote went to the big hearthrug and turned and surveyed his host his hand went to the back of his head and patted his occiputa gesture frequent with him  ere we are said kipps hands in his pockets and glancing round him  it was a gaunt victorian room with a heavy dirty cornice and the ceiling enriched by the radiant plaster ornament of an obliterated gas chandelier it held two large glass fronted bookcases one of which was surmounted by a stuffed terrier encased in glass there was a mirror over the mantel and hangings and curtains of magnificent crimson patternings on the mantel were a huge black clock of classical design vases in the burslem etruscan style spills and toothpicks in large receptacles of carved rock large lava ash trays and an exceptionally big box of matches the fender was very great and brassy in a favourable position under the window was a spacious rosewood writing desk and all the chairs and other furniture were of rosewood and well stuffed  this said kipps in something near an undertone was the o gentlemans studymy grandfather that was e used to sit at that desk and write  books  no letters to the times and things like that es got em all cut outstuck in a book leastways he ad its in that bookcase wont you sit down  coote did bowing very slightly and kipps secured his vacated position on the extensive black skin rug he spread out his legs compassfashion and tried to appear at his ease the rug the fender the mantel and mirror conspired with great success to make him look a trivial and intrusive little creature amidst their commonplace hauteur and his own shadow on the opposite wall seemed to think everything a great lark and mocked and made tremendous fun of him   §2  for a space kipps played a defensive game and coote drew the lines of the conversation they kept away from the theme of kipps change of fortune and coote made remarks upon local and social affairs you must take an interest in these things now was as much as he said in the way of personalities but it speedily became evident that he was a person of wide and commanding social relationships he spoke of society being mixed in the neighbourhood and of the difficulty of getting people to work together and do things they were cliquish incidentally he alluded quite familiarly to men with military titles and once even to someone with a title a lady punnet not snobbishly you understand nor deliberately but quite in passing he had it appeared talked to lady punnet about private theatricals in connection with the hospitals she had been unreasonable and he had put her right gently of course but firmly if you stand up to these people said coote they like you all the better it was also very evident he was at his ease with the clergy my friend mr densemorea curate you know and rather curious the reverend and honourable coote grew visibly in kipps eyes as he said these things he became not only the exponent of vagner or vargner the man whose sister had painted a picture to be exhibited at the royal academy the type of the hidden thing called culture but a delegate as it were or at least an intermediary from that great world up there where there were men servants where there were titles where people dressed for dinner drank wine at meals wine costing very often as much as three and sixpence the bottle and followed through a maze of etiquette the most stupendous practices  coote sat back in the armchair smoking luxuriously and expanding pleasantly with the delightful sense of savoir faire kipps sat forward his elbows on his chair arm alert and his head a little on one side you figure him as looking little and cheap and feeling smaller and cheaper amidst his new surroundings but it was a most stimulating and interesting conversation and soon it became less general and more serious and intimate coote spoke of people who had got on and of people who hadnt of people who seemed to be in everything and people who seemed to be out of everything and then he came round to kipps  youll have a good time he said abruptly with a smile that would have interested a dentist  i dunno said kipps  theres mistakes of course  thats jest it  coote lit a new cigarette one cant help being interested in what you will do he remarked of coursefor a young man of spirit come suddenly into wealththeres temptations  i got to go careful said kipps o bean told me that at the very first  coote went on to speak of pitfalls of betting of bad companions i know said kipps i know theres doubt again said coote i know a young fellowa solicitorhandsome gifted and yet you knowutterly sceptical practically altogether a sceptic  lor said kipps not a natheist  i fear so said coote really you know an awfully fine young fellowgifted but full of this dreadful modern spiritcynical all this overman stuff nietzsche and all that i wish i could do something for him  ah said kipps and knocked the ash off his cigarette i know a chapone of our apprentices he wasonce always scoffing he lef  he paused never wrote for his refs he said in the deep tone proper to a moral tragedy and then after a pauseenlisted  ah said coote  and often he said after a pause its just the most spirited chaps just the chaps one likes best who go wrong  its temptation kipps remarked  he glanced at coote leant forward knocked the ash from his cigarette into the mighty fender thats jest it he said you get tempted before you know where you are  modern life said coote is socomplex it isnt everyone is strong half the young fellows who go wrong arent really bad  thats jest it said kipps  one gets a tone from ones surroundings  thats exactly it said kipps  he meditated i picked up with a chap he said a nacter leastways he writes plays clever fellow but  he implied extensive moral obloquy by a movement of his head of course its seeing life he added  coote pretended to understand the full implications of kipps remark is it worth it he asked  thats jest it said kipps  he decided to give some more one gets talking he said then its ave a drink old methusaleh four starsand where are you i been drunk he said in a tone of profound humility and added lots of times  tt tt said coote  dozens of times said kipps smiling sadly and added lately  his imagination became active and seductive one thing leads to another cards praps girls  i know said coote i know  kipps regarded the fire and flushed slightly he borrowed a sentence that chitterlow had recently used one cant tell tales out of school he said  i can imagine it said coote  kipps looked with a confidential expression into cootes face it was bad enough when money was limited he remarked but now he spoke with raised eyebrows i got to steady down  you must said coote protruding his lips into a sort of whistling concern for a moment  i must said kipps nodding his head slowly with raised eyebrows he looked at his cigarette end and threw it into the fender he was beginning to think he was holding his own in this conversation rather well after all  kipps was never a good liar he was the first to break silence i dont mean to say i been reely bad or reely bad drunk a eadache perhapsthree or four times say but there it is  i have never tasted alcohol in my life said coote with an immense frankness never  no  never i dont feel i should be likely to get drunk at allit isnt that and i dont go so far as to say even that in small quantitiesat mealsit does one harm but if i take it someone else who doesnt know where to stopyou see  thats jest it said kipps with admiring eyes  i smoke admitted coote one doesnt want to be a pharisee  it struck kipps what a tremendously good chap this coote was not only tremendously clever and educated and a gentleman and one knowing lady punnet but good he seemed to be giving all his time and thought to doing good things to other people a great desire to confide certain things to him arose at first kipps hesitated whether he should confide an equal desire for benevolent activities or for further depravityeither was in his mind he rather affected the pose of the good intentioned dog then suddenly his impulses took quite a different turn fell indeed into what was a far more serious rut in his mind it seemed to him coote might be able to do for him something he very much wanted done  companionship accounts for so much said coote  thats jest it said kipps of course you know in my new position thats just the difficulty  he plunged boldly at his most secret trouble he knew that he wanted refinementculture it was all very wellbut he knew but how was one to get it he knew no one knew no people he rested on the broken sentence the shop chaps were all very well very good chaps and all that but not what one wanted i feel beind said kipps i feel out of it and consequently i feel its no good and then if temptation comes along  exactly said coote  kipps spoke of his respect for miss walshingham and her freckled friend he contrived not to look too selfconscious you know id like to talk to people like that but i cant a chaps afraid of giving himself away  of course said coote of course  i went to a middleclass school you know you mustnt fancy im one of these here boardschool chaps but you know it reely wasnt a firstclass affair leastways he didnt take pains with us if you didnt want to learn you neednti dont believe it was much better than one of these here national schools we wore mortarboards o course but whats that  im a regular fish out of water with this money when i got itits a week agoreely i thought id got everything i wanted but i dunno what to do  his voice went up into a squeak practically he said its no good shuttin my eyes to thingsim a gentleman  coote indicated a serious assent  and theres the responsibilities of a gentleman he remarked  thats jest it said kipps  theres calling on people said kipps if you want to go on knowing someone you knew before like people thats refined he laughed nervously im a regular fish out of water he said with expectant eyes on coote  but coote only nodded for him to go on  this actor chap he meditated is a good sort of chap but e isnt what i call a gentleman i got to old myself in with im ed make me go it wild in no time es pretty near the ony chap i know except the shop chaps theyve come round to ave supper once already and a bit of a sing song afterwards i sang i got a banjo you know and i vamp a bit vampingyou know havent got far in the bookow to vampbut still im getting on jolly of course in a way but what does it lead to besides that theres my aunt and uncle theyre very good old peopleveryjest a bit interfering praps and thinking one isnt grown up but right enough only it isnt what i want i feel ive got beind with everything i want to make it up again i want to get with educated people who know ow to do thingsin the regular proper way  his beautiful modesty awakened nothing but benevolence in the mind of chester coote  if i had someone like you said kipps that i knew regular like  from that point their course ran swift and easy if i could be of any use to you said coote  but youre so busy and all that  not too busy you know your case is a very interesting one it was partly that made me speak to you and draw you out here you are with all this money and no experience a spirited young chap  thats jest it said kipps  i thought id see what you were made of and i must confess ive rarely talked to anyone that ive found quite so interesting as you have been  i seem able to say things to you like somehow said kipps  im glad im tremendously glad  i want a friend thats itstraight  my dear chap if i  yes but  i want a friend too  reely  yes you know my dear kippsif i may call you that  go on said kipps  im rather a lonely dog myself this tonight ive not had anyone ive spoken to so freely of my work for months  no  you and my dear chap if i can do anything to guide or help you  coote displayed all his teeth in a kindly tremulous smile and his eyes were shiny shake ands said kipps deeply moved and he and coote rose and clasped with mutual emotion  its reely too good of you said kipps  whatever i can do i will said coote  and so their compact was made from that moment they were friends intimate confidential highthinking sotto voce friends all the rest of their talk and it inclined to be interminable was an expansion of that for that night kipps wallowed in selfabandonment and coote behaved as one who had received a great trust that sinister passion for pedagoguery to which the good intentioned are so fatally liable that passion of infinite presumption that permits one weak human being to arrogate the direction of another weak human beings affairs had coote in its grip he was to be a sort of lay confessor and director of kipps he was to help kipps in a thousand ways he was in fact to chaperon kipps into the higher and better sort of english life he was to tell him his faults advise him about the right thing to do  its all these things i dont know said kipps i dont know for instance whats the right sort of dress to weari dont even know if im dressed right now  all these thingscoote stuck out his lips and nodded rapidly to show he understoodtrust me for that he said trust me  as the evening wore on cootes manner changed became more and more the manner of a proprietor he began to take up his rôle to survey kipps with a new with a critical affection it was evident the thing fell in with his ideas it will be awfully interesting he said you know kipps youre really good stuff every sentence now he said kipps or my dear kipps with a curiously authoritative intonation  i know said kipps only theres such a lot of things i dont seem to be up to someow thats where the trouble comes in  they talked and talked and now kipps was talking freely they rambled over all sorts of things among others kipps character was dealt with at length kipps gave valuable lights on it when im reely excited he said i dont seem to care what i do im like that and again i dont like to do anything underand i must speak out  he picked a piece of cotton from his knee the fire grimaced behind his back and his shadow on the wall and ceiling was disrespectfully convulsed   §3  kipps went to bed at last with an impression of important things settled and he lay awake for quite a long time he felt he was lucky he had knownin fact buggins and carshot and pierce had made it very clear indeedthat his status in life had changed and that stupendous adaptations had to be achieved but how they were to be effected had driven that adaptation into the incredible here in the simplest easiest way was the adapter the thing had become possible not of course easy but possible  there was much to learn sheer intellectual toil methods of address bowing an enormous complexity of laws one broken you are an outcast how for example would one encounter lady punnet it was quite possible some day he might really have to do that coote might introduce him lord he said aloud to the darkness between grinning and dismay he figured himself going into the emporium to buy a tie for example and there in the face of buggins carshot pierce and the rest of them meeting my friend lady punnet it might not end with lady punnet his imagination plunged and bolted with him galloped took wings and soared to romantic to poetical altitudes  suppose some day one met royalty by accident say he soared to that after alltwelve hundred a year is a lift a tremendous lift how did one address royalty your majestys goodness it will be no doubtsomething like thatand on the knees he became impersonal over a thousand a year made him an esquire didnt it he thought that was it in which case wouldnt he have to be presented at court velvet cycling breeches like you wear cycling and a sword what a curious place a court must be kneeling and bowing and what was it miss mergle used to talk about of courseladies with long trains walking about backward everybody walked about backward at court he knew when not actually on their knees perhaps though some people regular stood up to the king talked to him just as one might talk to buggins say cheek of course dukes it might be did thatby permission millionnaires  from such thoughts this free citizen of our crowned republic passed insensibly into dreams turgid dreams of that vast ascent which constitutes the trueborn britons social scheme which terminates with retrogressive progression and a bending back   §4  the next morning he came down to breakfast looking gravea man with much before him in the world  kipps made a very special thing of his breakfast daily once hopeless dreams came true then it had been customary in the emporium to supplement shalfords generous indeed unlimited supply of bread and buttersubstitute by private purchases and this had given kipps very broad artistic conceptions of what the meal might be now there would be a cutlet or so or a mutton chopthis splendour buggins had reported from the great london clubshaddock kipper whiting or fishballs eggs boiled or scrambled or eggs and bacon kidney also frequently and sometimes liver amidst a garland of such themes sausages black and white puddings bubbleandsqueak fried cabbage and scallops came and went always as camp followers came potted meat in all varieties cold bacon german sausage brawn marmalade and two sorts of jam and when he had finished these he would sit among his plates and smoke a cigarette and look at all these dishes crowded round him with a beatific approval it was his principal meal he was sitting with his cigarette regarding his apartment with that complacency begotten of a generous plan of feeding successfully realized when newspapers and post arrived  there were several things by the post tradesmens circulars and cards and two pathetic begging lettershis luck had got into the papersand there was a letter from a literary man and a book to enforce his request for 10to put down socialism the book made it very clear that prompt action on the part of property owners was becoming urgent if property was to last out the year kipps dipped in it and was seriously perturbed and there was a letter from old kipps saying it was difficult to leave the shop and come over and see him again just yet but that he had been to a sale at lydd the previous day and bought a few good old books and things it would be difficult to find the equal of in folkestone they dont know the value of these things out here wrote old kipps but you may depend upon it they are valuable and a brief financial statement followed there is an engraving someone might come along and offer you a lot of money for one of these days depend upon it these old things are about the best investment you could make  old kipps had long been addicted to sales and his nephews good fortune had converted what had once been but a looking and a cravinghe had rarely even bid for anything in the old days except the garden tools or the kitchen gallipots or things like that things one gets for sixpence and finds a use forinto a very active pleasure sage and penetrating inspection a certain mystery of bearing tactical bids and purchasepurchasethe old man had had a good time  while kipps was rereading the begging letters and wishing he had the sound clear common sense of buggins to help him a little the parcels post brought along the box from his uncle it was a large insecure looking case held together by a few still loyal nails and by what the british war office would have recognised at once as an army corps of string rags and odds and ends tied together kipps unpacked it with a table knife assisted at a critical point by the poker and found a number of books and other objects of an antique type  there were three bound volumes of early issues of chambers journal a copy of punchs pocket book for 1875 sturms reflections an early version of gills geography slightly torn an illustrated work on spinal curvature an early edition of kirkes human physiology the scottish chiefs and a little volume on the language of flowers there was a fine steel engraving oakframed and with some rusty spots done in the colossal style and representing the handwriting on the wall there were also a copper kettle a pair of candle snuffers a brass shoehorn a tea caddy to lock two decanters one stoppered and what was probably a portion of an eighteenth century childs rattle  kipps examined these objects one by one and wished he knew more about them turning over the pages of the physiology again he came upon a striking plate in which a youth of agreeable profile displayed his interior in an unstinted manner to the startled eye it was a new view of humanity altogether for kipps and it arrested his mind  this anatomised figure made him forget for a space that he was practically a gentleman altogether and he was still surveying its extraordinary complications when another reminder of a world quite outside those spheres of ordered gentility into which his dreams had carried him overnight arrived following the servant in the person of chitterlow   §5  ullo said kipps rising  not busy said chitterlow enveloping kipps hand for a moment in one of his own and tossing the yachting cap upon the monumental carved oak sideboard  only a bit of reading said kipps  reading eh chitterlow cocked the red eye at the books and other properties for a moment and then ive been expecting you round again one night  i been coming round said kipps ony theres a chap ere i was coming round last night ony i met im  he walked to the hearthrug chitterlow drifted around the room for a time glancing at things as he talked ive altered that play tremendously since i saw you he said pulled it all to pieces  what plays that chitlow  the one we were talking about you know you said somethingi dont know if you meant itabout buying half of it not the tragedy i wouldnt sell my twin brother a share in that thats my investment thats my serious work no i mean that new farce ive been on to thing with the business about a beetle  oo yes said kipps i remember  i thought you would said youd take a fourth share for a hundred pounds you know  i seem to remember something  well its all different every bit of it ill tell you you remember what you said about a butterfly you got confused you knowold meth kept calling the beetle a butterfly and that set me off ive made it quite different quite different instead of popplewaddlethundering good farce name that you know for all that it came from a visitors listinstead of popplewaddle getting a beetle down his neck and rushing about ive made him a collectorcollects butterflies and this one you knows a rare one comes in at window centre chitterlow began to illustrate with appropriate gestures pop rushes about after it forgets he mustnt let on hes in the house after that tells em rare butterfly worth lots of money some are you know everyones on to it after that butterfly cant get out of room every time it comes out to have a try rush and scurry well ive worked on that only  he came very close to kipps he held up one hand horizontally and tapped it in a striking and confidential manner with the fingers of the other something else he said thats given me a real ibsenish touchlike the wild duck you know that womanive made her lighterand she sees it when theyre chasing the butterfly the third time shes on she looks thats me she says bif pestered butterfly shes the pestered butterfly its legitimate much more legitimate than the wild duckwhere there isnt a duck  knock em the very title ought to knock em ive been working like a horse at it youll have a gold mine in that quarter share kipps i dont mind its suited me to sell it and suited you to buy bif  chitterlow interrupted his discourse to ask you havent any brandy in the house have you not to drink you know but i want just an eggcupful to pull me steady my livers a bit queer it doesnt matter if you havent not a bit im like that yes whiskeyll do better  kipps hesitated for a moment then turned and fumbled in the cupboard of his sideboard presently he disinterred a bottle of whiskey and placed it on the table then he put out first one bottle of soda water and after the hesitation of a moment another chitterlow picked up the bottle and read the label good old methusaleh he said kipps handed him the corkscrew and then his hand fluttered up to his mouth ill have to ring now he said to get glasses he hesitated for a moment before doing so leaning doubtfully as it were towards the bell  when the housemaid appeared he was standing on the hearthrug with his legs wide apart with the bearing of a desperate fellow and after they had both had whiskeysyou know a decent whiskey chitterlow remarked and took another just to drinkkipps produced cigarettes and the conversation flowed again  chitterlow paced the room he was he explained taking a day off that was why he had come around to see kipps whenever he thought of any extensive change in a play he was writing he always took a day off in the end it saved time to do so it prevented his starting rashly upon work that might have to be rewritten there was no good in doing work when you might have to do it over again none whatever  presently they were descending the steps by the parade en route for the warren with chitterlow doing the talking and going with a dancing drop from step to step  they had a great walk not a long one but a great one they went up by the sanatorium and over the east cliff and into that queer little wilderness of slippery and tumbling clay and rock under the chalk cliffs a wilderness of thorn and bramble wild rose and wayfaring tree that adds so greatly to folkestones charm they traversed its intricacies and clambered up to the crest of the cliffs at last by a precipitous path that chitterlow endowed in some mysterious way with suggestions of alpine adventure every now and then he would glance aside at sea and cliffs with a fresh boyishness of imagination that brought back new romney and the stranded wrecks to kipps memory but mostly he bored on with his great obsession of plays and playwriting and that empty absurdity that is so serious to his kind his art that was a thing that needed a monstrous lot of explaining along they went sometimes abreast sometimes in single file up the little paths and down the little paths and in among the bushes and out along the edge above the beach and kipps went along trying ever and again to get an insignificant word in edgeways and the gestures of chitterlow flew wide and far and his great voice rose and fell and he said this and he said that and he biffed and banged into the circumambient inane  it was assumed that they were embarked upon no more trivial enterprise than the reform of the british stage and kipps found himself classed with many opulent and even royal and noble amateursthe honourable thomas norgate came in herewho had interested themselves in the practical realisation of high ideals about the drama only he had a finer understanding of these things and instead of being preyed upon by the common professionaland they are a lot said chitterlow i havent toured for nothinghe would have chitterlow kipps gathered few details it was clear he had bought the quarter of a farcical comedypractically a gold mineand it would appear it would be a good thing to buy the half a suggestion or the suggestion of a suggestion floated out that he should buy the whole play and produce it forthwith it seemed he was to produce the play upon a royalty system of a new sort whatever a royalty system of any sort might be then there was some doubt after all whether that farcical comedy was in itself sufficient to revolutionise the present lamentable state of the british drama better perhaps for such a purpose was that tragedyas yet unfinishedwhich was to display all that chitterlow knew about women and which was to centre about a russian nobleman embodying the fundamental chitterlow personality then it became clearer that kipps was to produce several plays kipps was to produce a great number of plays kipps was to found a national theatre  it is probable that kipps would have expressed some sort of disavowal if he had known how to express it occasionally his face assumed an expression of whistling meditation but that was as far as he got towards protest  in the clutch of chitterlow and the incalculable kipps came round to the house in fenchurch street and was there made to participate in the midday meal he came to the house forgetting certain confidences and was reminded of the existence of a mrs chitterlow with the finest completely untrained contralto voice in england by her appearance she had an air of being older than chitterlow although probably she wasnt and her hair was a reddish brown streaked with gold she was dressed in one of those complaisant garments that are dressing gowns or tea gowns or bathing wraps or rather original evening robes according to the exigencies of the momentfrom the first kipps was aware that she possessed a warm and rounded neck and her wellmoulded arms came and vanished from the sleevesand she had large expressive brown eyes that he discovered ever and again fixed in an enigmatical manner upon his own  a simple but sufficient meal had been distributed with careless spontaneity over the little round table in the room with the photographs and looking glass and when a plate had by chitterlows direction been taken from under the marmalade in the cupboard and the kitchen fork and a knife that was not loose in its handle had been found for kipps they began and she had evidently heard of kipps before and he made a tumultuous repast chitterlow ate with quiet enormity but it did not interfere with the flow of his talk he introduced kipps to his wife very briefly made it vaguely evident that the production of the comedy was the thing chiefly settled his reach extended over the table and he troubled nobody when mrs chitterlow who for a little while seemed socially selfconscious reproved him for taking a potato with a jab of his fork he answered well you shouldnt have married a man of genius and from a subsequent remark it was perfectly clear that chitterlows standing in this respect was made no secret of in his household  they drank old methusaleh and syphon soda and there was no clearing away they just sat among the plates and things and mrs chitterlow took her husbands tobacco pouch and made a cigarette and smoked and blew smoke and looked at kipps with her large brown eyes kipps had seen cigarettes smoked by ladies before for fun but this was real smoking it frightened him rather he felt he must not encourage this ladyat any rate in chitterlows presence  they became very cheerful after the repast and as there was now no waste to deplore such as one experiences in the windy open air chitterlow gave his voice full vent he fell to praising kipps very highly and loudly he said he had known kipps was the right sort he had seen it from the first almost before he got up out of the mud on that memorable night you can he said sometimes that was why he stopped but he seemed on the verge of explaining that it was his certainty of kipps being the right sort had led him to confer this great fortune upon him he left that impression he threw out a number of long sentences and material for sentences of a highly philosophical and incoherent character about coincidences it became evident he considered dramatic criticism in a perilously low condition  about four kipps found himself stranded as it were by a receding chitterlow on a seat upon the leas  he was chiefly aware that chitterlow was an overwhelming personality he puffed his cheeks and blew  no doubt this was seeing life but had he particularly wanted to see life that day in a way chitterlow had interrupted him the day he had designed for himself was altogether different from this he had been going to read through a precious little volume called dont that coote had sent round for him a book of invaluable hints a summary of british deportment that had only the one defect of being at points a little out of date  that reminded him he had intended to perform a difficult exercise called an afternoon call upon the cootes as a preliminary to doing it in deadly earnest upon the walshinghams it was no good today anyhow now  he came back to chitterlow he would have to explain to chitterlow he was taking too much for granted he would have to do that it was so difficult to do in chitterlows presence though in his absence it was easy enough this half share and taking a theatre and all of it was going too far  the quarter share was right enough he supposed but even that a hundred pounds what wealth is there left in the world after one has paid out a hundred pounds from it  he had to recall that in a sense chitterlow had indeed brought him his fortune before he could face even that  you must not think too hardly of him to kipps you see there was as yet no such thing as proportion in these matters a hundred pounds went to his horizon a hundred pounds seemed to him just exactly as big as any other large sum of money     chapter ii  the walshinghams   §1  the cootes live in a little house in bouverie square with a tangle of virginia creeper up the verandah  kipps had been troubled in his mind about knocking double or singleit is these things show what a man is made ofbut happily there was a bell  a queer little maid with a big cap admitted kipps and took him through a bead curtain and a door into a little drawingroom with a black and gold piano a glazed bookcase a moorish cosy corner and a draped looking glass overmantel bright with regent street ornaments and photographs of various intellectual lights a number of cards of invitation to meetings and the match list of a band of hope cricket club were stuck into the looking glass frame with cootes name as a vicepresident there was a bust of beethoven over the bookcase and the walls were thick with conscientiously executed but carelessly selected views in oil and water colours and gilt frames at the end of the room facing the light was a portrait that struck kipps at first as being coote in spectacles and feminine costume and that he afterwards decided must be cootes mother then the original appeared and he discovered that it was cootes elder and only sister who kept house for him she wore her hair in a knob behind and the sight of the knob suggested to kipps an explanation for a frequent gesture of cootes a patting exploratory movement to the back of his head and then it occurred to him that this was quite an absurd idea altogether  she said mr kipps i believe and kipps laughed pleasantly and said thats it and then she told him that chester had gone down to the art school to see about sending off some drawings or other and that he would be back soon then she asked kipps if he painted and showed him the pictures on the wall kipps asked her where each one was of and when she showed him some of the leas slopes he said he never would have recognised them he said it was funny how things looked in a picture very often but theyre awfully good he said did you do them he would look at them with his neck arched like a swans his head back and on one side and then suddenly peer closely into them they are good i wish i could paint thats what chester says she answered i tell him he has better things to do kipps seemed to get on very well with her  then coote came in and they left her and went upstairs together and had a good talk about reading and the rules of life or rather coote talked and the praises of thought and reading were in his mouth  you must figure cootes study a little bedroom put to studious uses and over the mantel an array of things he had been led to believe indicative of culture and refinement an autotype of rossettis annunciation an autotype of watts minotaur a swiss carved pipe with many joints and a photograph of amiens cathedral these two the spoils of travel a phrenological bust and some broken fossils from the warren a rotating bookshelf carried the encyclopædia britannica tenth edition and on the top of it a large official looking age grubby envelope bearing the mystic words on his majestys service a number or so of the bookman and a box of cigarettes were lying a table under the window bore a little microscope some dust in a saucer some grimy glass slips and broken cover glasses for coote had gone in for biology a little the longer side of the room was given over to bookshelves neatly edged with pinked american cloth and with an array of booksno worse an array of books than you find in any public library an almost haphazard accumulation of obsolete classics contemporary successes the hundred best books including samuel warrens ten thousand a year old school books directories the times atlas ruskin in bulk tennyson complete in one volume longfellow charles kingsley smiles and mrs humphry ward a guide book or so several medical pamphlets odd magazine numbers and much indescribable rubbishin fact a compendium of the contemporary british mind and in front of this array stood kipps illtaught and untrained respectful awestricken and for a moment at any rate willing to learn while coote the exemplary coote talked to him like a bishop of reading and the virtue in books  nothing enlarges the mind said coote like travel and books and theyre both so easy nowadays and so cheap  ive often wanted to ave a good go in at reading kipps replied  youd hardly believe coote said how much you can get out of books provided you avoid trashy reading that is you ought to make a rule kipps and read one serious book a week of course we can learn even from novels nace novels that is but it isnt the same thing as serious reading i made a rule one serious book and one novelno more theres some of the serious books ive been reading latelyon that table sartor resartusmrs twaddletomes pond life the scottish chiefs life and letters of dean farrar   §2  there came at last the sound of a gong and kipps descended to tea in that state of nervous apprehension at the difficulties of eating and drinking that his aunts knuckle rappings had implanted in him forever over cootes shoulder he became aware of a fourth person in the moorish cosy corner and he turned leaving incomplete something incoherent he was saying to miss coote about his modest respect and desire for literature to discover this fourth person was miss helen walshingham hatless and looking very much at home  she rose at once with an extended hand to meet his hesitation  youre stopping in folkestone mr kipps  ere on a bit of business said kipps i thought you was away in bruges  thats later said miss walshingham were stopping until my brothers holiday begins and were trying to let our house where are you staying in folkestone  i got a ouse of mineon the leas  ive heard all about your good fortunethis afternoon  isnt it a go said kips i avent nearly got to believe its reely appened yet when that mr bean told me of it you could ave knocked me down with a feather its a tremenjous change for me  he discovered miss coote was asking him whether he took milk and sugar i dont mind said kipps just as you like  coote became active handing tea and bread and butter it was thinly cut and the bread was rather new and the half of the slice that kipps took fell upon the floor he had been holding it by the edge for he was not used to this migratory method of taking tea without plates or table this little incident ruled him out of the conversation for a time and when he came to attend to it again they were talking about something or other prodigiousa performer of some sortthat was coming called it seemed padrooski so kipps who had quietly dropped into a chair ate his bread and butter said no thenk you to any more and by this discreet restraint got more freedom with his cup and saucer  apart from the confusion natural to tea he was in a state of tremulous excitement on account of the presence of miss walshingham he glanced from miss coote to her brother and then at helen he regarded her over the top of his cup as he drank here she was solid and real it was wonderful he remarked as he had done at times before the easy flow of the dark hair back from her brow over her ears the shapeliness of the white hands that came out from her simple white cuffs the delicate pencilling of her brow  presently she turned her face to him almost suddenly and smiled with the easiest assurance of friendship  you will go i suppose she said and added to the recital  if im in folkestone i shall said kipps clearing away a little hoarseness i dont know much about music but what i do know i like  im sure youll like paderewski she said  if you do he said i dessay i shall  he found coote very kindly taking his cup  do you think of living in folkestone asked miss coote in a tone of proprietorship from the hearthrug  no said kipps thats jest iti hardly know he also said that he wanted to look around a bit before doing anything theres so much to consider said coote smoothing the back of his head  i may go back to new romney for a bit said kipps i got an uncle and aunt there i reely dont know  helen regarded him thoughtfully for a moment  you must come and see us she said before we go to bruges  oo rather said kipps if i may  yes do she said and suddenly stood up before kipps could formulate an enquiry when he should call  youre sure you can spare that drawing board she said to miss coote and the conversation passed out of range  and when he had said goodbye to miss walshingham and she had repeated her invitation to call he went upstairs again with coote to look out certain initiatory books they had had under discussion and then kipps blowing very resolutely went back to his own place bearing in his arm 1 sesame and lilies 2 sir george tressady 3 an anonymous book on vitality that coote particularly esteemed and having got to his own sittingroom he opened sesame and lilies and read it with ruthless determination for some time   §3  presently he leant back and gave himself up to the business of trying to imagine just exactly what miss walshingham could have thought of him when she saw him doubts about the precise effect of the grey flannel suit began to trouble him he turned to the mirror over the mantel and then got into a chair to study the hang of the trousers it looked all right luckily she had not seen the panama hat he knew that he had the brim turned up wrong but he could not find out which way the brim was right however that she had not seen he might perhaps ask at the shop where he bought it  he meditated for awhile on his reflected facedoubtful whether he liked it or notand then got down again and flitted across to the sideboard where there lay two little books one in a cheap magnificent cover of red and gold and the other in green canvas the former was called as its cover witnessed manners and rules of good society by a member of the aristocracy and after the cover had indulged in a band of gilded decoration lighthearted but natural under the circumstances it added twentyfirst edition the second was that admirable classic the art of conversing kipps returned with these to his seat placed the two before him opened the latter with a sigh and flattened it under his hand  then with knitted brows he began to read onward from a mark his lips moving  having thus acquired possession of an idea the little ship should not be abruptly launched into deep waters but should be first permitted to glide gently and smoothly into the shallows that is to say the conversation should not be commenced by broadly and roundly stating a fact or didactically expressing an opinion as the subject would be thus virtually or summarily disposed of or perhaps be met with a really or indeed or some equally brief monosyllabic reply if an opposite opinion were held by the person to whom the remark were addressed he might not if a stranger care to express it in the form of a direct contradiction or actual dissent to glide imperceptibly into conversation is the object to be attained  at this point mr kipps rubbed his fingers through his hair with an expression of some perplexity and went back to the beginning   §4  when kipps made his call on the walshinghams it all happened so differently from the manners and rules prescription paying calls that he was quite lost from the very outset instead of the footman or maidservant proper in these cases miss walshingham opened the door to him herself im so glad youve come she said with one of her rare smiles  she stood aside for him to enter the rather narrow passage  i thought id call he said retaining his hat and stick  she closed the door and led the way to a little drawingroom which impressed kipps as being smaller and less emphatically coloured than that of the cootes and in which at first only a copper bowl of white poppies upon the brown tablecloth caught his particular attention  you wont think it unconventional to come in mr kipps will you she remarked mother is out  i dont mind he said smiling amiably if you dont  she walked around the table and stood regarding him across it with that same look between speculative curiosity and appreciation that he remembered from the last of the art class meetings  i wondered whether you would call or whether you wouldnt before you left folkestone  im not leaving folkestone for a bit and anyow i should have called on you  mother will be sorry she was out ive told her about you and she wants i know to meet you  i saw erif that was erin the shop said kipps  yesyou did didnt you she has gone out to make some duty calls and i didnt go i had something to write i write a little you know  reely said kipps  its nothing much she said and it comes to nothing she glanced at a little desk near the window on which there lay some paper one must do something she broke off abruptly have you seen our outlook she asked and walked to the window and kipps came and stood beside her we look on the square it might be worse you know that outporters truck there is horridand the railings but its better than staring ones social replica in the face isnt it its pleasant in early springbright green laid on with a dry brushand its pleasant in autumn  i like it said kipps that laylock there is pretty isnt it  children come and pick it at times she remarked  i dessay they do said kipps  he rested on his hat and stick and looked appreciatively out of the window and she glanced at him for one swift moment a suggestion that might have come from the art of conversing came into his head have you a garden he said  she shrugged her shoulders only a little one she said and then perhaps you would like to see it  i like gardenin said kipps with memories of a pennyworth of nasturtiums he had once trained over his uncles dustbin  she led the way with a certain relief  they emerged through a four seasons coloured glass door to a little iron verandah that led by iron steps to a minute walled garden there was just room for a patch of turf and a flowerbed one sturdy variegated euonymus grew in the corner but the early june flowers the big narcissus snow upon the mountains and a fine show of yellow wallflowers shone gay  thats our garden said helen its not a very big one is it  i like it said kipps  its small she said but this is the day of small things  kipps didnt follow that  if you were writing when i came he remarked im interrupting you  she turned round with her back to the railing and rested leaning on her hands i had finished she said i couldnt get on  were you making up something asked kipps  there was a little interval before she smiled i tryquite vainlyto write stories she said one must do something i dont know whether i shall ever do any goodat thatanyhow it seems so hopeless and of course one must study the popular taste but now my brother has gone to london i get a lot of leisure  i seen your brother avent i  he came to the class once or twice very probably you have hes gone to london to pass his examinations and become a solicitor and then i suppose hell have a chance not much perhaps even then but hes luckier than i am  you got your classes and things  they ought to satisfy me but they dont i suppose im ambitious we both are and we hadnt much of a springboard she glanced over his shoulder at the cramped little garden with an air of reference in her gesture  i should think you could do anything if you wanted to said kipps  as a matter of fact i cant do anything i want to  you done a good deal  what  well didnt you pass one of these here university things  oh i matriculated  i should think i was no end of a swell if i did i know that  mr kipps do you know how many people matriculate into london university every year  how many then  between two and three thousand  well just think how many dont  her smile came again and broke into a laugh oh they dont count she said and then realising that might penetrate kipps if he was left with it she hurried on to the fact is im a discontented person mr kipps folkestone you know is a sea front and it values people by sheer vulgar prosperity were not prosperous and we live in a back street we have to live here because this is our house its a mercy we havent to let one feels one hasnt opportunities if one had i suppose one wouldnt use them still  kipps felt he was being taken tremendously into her confidence thats jest it he said very sagely  he leant forward on his stick and said very earnestly i believe you could do anything you wanted to if you tried  she threw out her hands in disavowal  i know said he very sagely and nodding his head i watched you once or twice when you were teaching that woodcarving class  for some reason this made her laugha rather pleasant laugh and that made kipps feel a very witty and successful person its very evident she said that youre one of those rare people who believe in me mr kipps to which he answered oo i do and then suddenly they became aware of mrs walshingham coming along the passage in another moment she appeared through the four seasons door bonneted and ladylike and a little faded exactly as kipps had seen her in the shop kipps felt a certain apprehension at her appearance in spite of the reassurances he had had from coote  mr kipps has called on us said helen and mrs walshingham said it was very kind of him and added that new people didnt call on them very much nowadays there was nothing of the scandalised surprise kipps had seen in the shop she had heard perhaps he was a gentleman now in the shop he had thought her rather jaded and haughty but he had scarcely taken her hand which responded to his touch with a friendly pressure before he knew how mistaken he had been she then told her daughter that someone called mrs wace had been out and turned to kipps again to ask him if he had had tea kipps said he had not and helen moved towards some mysterious interior but i say said kipps dont you on my account  helen vanished and he found himself alone with mrs walshingham which of course made him breathless and boreaslooking for a moment  you were one of helens pupils in the woodcarving class asked mrs walshingham regarding him with the quiet watchfulness proper to her position  yes said kipps thats ow i ad the pleasure  she took a great interest in her woodcarving class she is so energetic you know and it gives her an outlet  i thought she taught something splendid  everyone says she did very well helen i think would do anything well that she undertook to do shes so very clever and she throws herself into things so  she untied her bonnet strings with a pleasant informality  she has told me all about her class she used to be full of it and about your cut hand  lor said kipps fancy telling that  oh yes and how brave you were  though indeed helens chief detail had been his remarkable expedient for checking bloodshed  kipps became bright pink she said you didnt seem to feel it a bit  kipps felt he would have to spend weeks over the art of conversing  while he still hung fire helen returned with the apparatus for afternoon tea upon a tray  do you mind pulling out the table asked mrs walshingham  that again was very homelike kipps put down his hat and stick in the corner and amidst an iron thunder pulled out a little rusty greenpainted table and then in the easiest manner followed helen in to get chairs  so soon as he had got rid of his teacuphe refused all food of course and they were mercifulhe became wonderfully at his ease presently he was talking he talked quite modestly and simply about his changed condition and his difficulties and plans he spread what indeed had an air of being all his simple little soul before his eyes in a little while his clipped defective accent had become less perceptible to their ears and they began to realise as the girl with the freckles had long since realised that there were passable aspects of kipps he confided he submitted and for both of them he had the realest the most seductively flattering undertone of awe and reverence  he stopped about two hours having forgotten how terribly incorrect it is to stay at such a length they did not mind at all     chapter iii  engaged   §1  within two months within a matter of three and fifty days kipps had clambered to the battlements of hearts desire  it all became possible by the walshinghamsit would seem at cootes instigationdeciding after all not to spend the holidays at bruges instead they remained in folkestone and this happy chance gave kipps just all these opportunities of which he stood in need  his crowning day was at lympne and long before the summer warmth began to break while indeed august still flamed on high they had organizedno one seemed to know who suggested it firsta water party on the still reaches of the old military canal at hythe the canal that was to have stopped napoleon if the sea failed us and they were to picnic by the brick bridge and afterwards to clamber to lympne castle the host of the gathering it was understood very clearly was kipps  they went a merry party the canal was weedy with only a few inches of water at the shallows and so they went in three canadian canoes kipps had learned to paddleit had been his first athletic accomplishment and his secondwith the last three or four of ten private lessons still to comewas to be cycling but kipps did not paddle at all badly muscles hardened by lifting pieces of cretonne could cut a respectable figure by the side of cootes executions and the girl with the freckles the girl who understood him came in his canoe they raced the walshinghams brother and sister and coote in a liquefying state and blowing mightily but still persistent and always quite polite and considerate toiled behind with mrs walshingham she could not be expected to paddle though of course she offered and she reclined upon specially adjusted cushions under a black and white sunshade and watched kipps and her daughter and feared at intervals that coote was getting hot  they were all more or less in holiday costume the eyes of the girls looked out under the shade of widebrimmed hats even the freckled girl was unexpectedly pretty and helen swinging sunlit to her paddle gave kipps almost for the first time the suggestion of a graceful body kipps was arrayed in the completest boating costume and when his fashionable panama was discarded and his hair blown into disorder he became in his white flannels as sightly as most young men his complexion was a notable asset  things favoured him the day favoured him everyone favoured him young walshingham the girl with the freckles coote and mrs walshingham were playing up to him in the most benevolent way and between the landing place and lympne fortune to crown their efforts had placed a small convenient field entirely at the disposal of an adolescent bull not a big real resolute bull but on the other hand no calf a young bull in the same stage of emotional development as kipps standing where the two rivers meet detachedly our party drifted towards him  when they landed young walshingham with the simple directness of a brother abandoned his sister to kipps and secured the freckled girl leaving coote to carry mrs walshinghams light wool wrap he started at once in order to put an effectual distance between himself and his companion on the one hand and a certain persuasive chaperonage that went with coote on the other young walshingham i think i have said was dark with a napoleonic profile and it was natural for him therefore to be a bold thinker and an epigrammatic speaker and he had long ago discovered great possibilities of appreciation in the freckled girl he was in a very happy frame that day because he had just been entrusted with the management of kipps affairs old bean inexplicably dismissed and that was not a bad beginning for a solicitor of only a few months standing and moreover he had been reading nietzsche and he thought that in all probability he was the nonmoral overman referred to by that writer he wore fairly largesized hats he wanted to expand the theme of the nonmoral overman in the ear of the freckled girl to say it over so to speak and in order to seclude his exposition they went aside from the direct path and trespassed through a coppice avoiding the youthful bull they escaped to these higher themes but narrowly for coote and mrs walshingham subtle chaperones both and each indisposed for excellent reasons to encumber kipps and helen were hot upon their heels these two kept direct route to the stile of the bulls field and the sight of the animal at once awakened cootes innate aversion to brutality in any shape or form he said the stiles were too high and that they could do better by going around by the hedge and mrs walshingham nothing loath agreed  this left the way clear for kipps and helen and they encountered the bull helen did not observe the bull but kipps did but that afternoon at any rate he was equal to facing a lion and the bull really came at them it was not an affair of the bullring exactly no desperate rushes and gorings but he came he regarded them with a large wicked bluish eye opened a mouth below his moistly glistening nose and booed at any rate if he did not exactly bellow and he shook his head wickedly and showed that tossing was in his mind helen was frightened without any loss of dignity and kipps went extremely white but he was perfectly calm and he seemed to her to have lost the last vestiges of his accent and his social shakiness he directed her to walk quietly towards the stile and made an oblique advance towards the bull  you be orf he said  when helen was well over the stile kipps withdrew in good order he got over the stile under cover of a feint and the thing was donea small thing no doubt but just enough to remove from helens mind an incorrect deduction that a man who was so terribly afraid of a teacup as kipps must necessarily be abjectly afraid of everything else in the world in her moment of reaction she went perhaps too far in the opposite direction hitherto kipps had always had a certain flimsiness of effect for her now suddenly he was discovered solid he was discovered possible in many new ways here after all was the sort of back a woman can get behind  as so these heirs of the immemorial ages went past the turfcrowned mass of portus lemanus up the steep slopes towards the mediæval castle on the crest the thing was also manifest in her eyes   §2  everyone who stays in folkestone gets sooner or later to lympne the castle became a farmhouse long ago and the farmhouse itself now ripe and venerable wears the walls of the castle as a little man wears a big mans coat the kindliest of farm ladies entertains a perpetual stream of visitors and shows her vast mangle and her big kitchen and takes you out upon the sunniest little terrace garden in all the world and you look down the sheepdotted slopes to where beside the canal and under the trees the crumpled memories of rome sleep forever for hither to this lonely spot the galleys once came the legions the emperors masters of the world the castle is but a thing of yesterday king stephens time or thereabout in that retrospect one climbs the pitch of perforation and there one is lifted to the centre of far more than a hemisphere of view away below ones feet almost at the bottom of the hill the marsh begins and spreads and spreads in a mighty crescent that sweeps about the sea the marsh dotted with the church towers of forgotten mediæval towns and breaking at last into the low blue hills of winchelsea and hastings east hangs france between the sea and the sky and round the north bounding the wide prospectives of farms and houses and woods the downs with their hangers and chalk pits sustain the passing shadows of the sailing clouds  and here it was high out of the world of everyday and in the presence of spacious beauty that kipps and helen found themselves agreeably alone all six it had seemed had been coming for the keep but mrs walshingham had hesitated at the horrid little stairs and then suddenly felt faint and so she and the freckled girl had remained below walking up and down in the shadow of the house and coote had remembered they were all out of cigarettes and had taken off young walshingham into the village there had been shouting to explain between ground and parapet and then helen and kipps turned again to the view and commended it and fell silent  helen sat fearlessly in an embrasure and kipps stood beside her  ive always been fond of scenery kipps repeated after an interval  then he went off at a tangent dyou reely think that was right what coote was saying  she looked interrogation  about my name  being really cuyps i have my doubts i thought at first what makes mr coote add an s to cuyp  i dunno said kipps foiled i was jest thinking  she shot one wary glance at him and then turned her eyes to the sea  kipps was out for a space he had intended to lead from this question to the general question of surnames and change of names it had seemed a light and witty way of saying something he had in mind and suddenly he perceived that this was an unutterably vulgar and silly project the hitch about that s had saved him he regarded her profile for a moment framed in weatherbeaten stone and backed by the blue elements  he dropped the question of his name out of existence and spoke again of the view when i see scenery and things that are beautiful it makes me feel  she looked at him suddenly and saw him fumbling for his words  silly like he said  she took him in with her glance the old look of proprietorship it was touched with a certain warmth she spoke in a voice as unambiguous as her eyes you neednt she said you know mr kipps you hold yourself too cheap  her eyes and words smote him with amazement he stared at her like a man who awakens she looked down  you mean he said and then dont you hold me cheap  she glanced up again and shook her head  butfor instanceyou dont think of meas an equal like  why not  oo but reely  his heart beat very fast  if i thought he said and then you know so much  thats nothing she said  then for a long time as it seemed to them both kept silence a silence that said and accomplished many things  i know what i am he said at length if i thought it was possible if i thought you i believe i could do anything  he stopped and she sat downcast and strikingly still  miss walshingham he said is it possible that you  could care for me enough toto elp me miss walshingham do you care for me at all  it seemed she was never going to answer she looked up at him i think she said you are the most generouslook at what you have done for my brotherthe most generous and the most modest of men and this afternooni thought you were the bravest  she turned her head glanced down waved her hand to someone on the terrace below and stood up  mother is signalling she said we must go down  kipps became polite and deferential by habit but his mind was a tumult that had nothing to do with that  he moved before her towards the little door that opened on the winding stairsalways precede a lady down or up stairsand then on the second step he turned resolutely but he said looking up out of the shadow flannelclad and singularly like a man  she looked down on him with her hand upon the stone lintel  he held out his hand as if to help her can you tell me he said you must know  what  if you care for me  she did not answer for a long time it was as if everything in the world had drawn to the breaking point and in a minute must certainly break  yes she said at last i know  abruptly by some impalpable sign he knew what the answer would be and he remained still  she bent down over him and softened to her wonderful smile  promise me she insisted  he promised with his still face  if i do not hold you cheap you will never hold yourself cheap  if you do not hold me cheap you mean  she bent down quite close beside him i hold you she said and then whispered dear  me  she laughed aloud  he was astonished beyond measure he stipulated lest there might be some misconception you will marry me  she was laughing inundated by the sense of bountiful power of possession and success he looked quite a nice little man to have yes she laughed what else could i mean and yes  he felt as a praying hermit might have felt snatched from the midst of his quiet devotions his modest sackcloth and ashes and hurled neck and crop over the glittering gates of paradise smack among the iridescent wings the brighteyed cherubim he felt like some lowly and righteous man dynamited into bliss  his hand tightened upon the rope that steadies one upon the stairs of stone he was for kissing her hand and did not  he said not a word more he turned about and with something very like a scared expression on his face led the way into the obscurity of their descent   §3  everyone seemed to understand nothing was said nothing was explained the merest touch of the eyes sufficed as they clustered in the castle gateway coote kipps remembered afterwards laid hold of his arm as if by chance and pressed it it was quite evident he knew his eyes his nose shone with benevolent congratulations shone too with the sense of a good thing conducted to its climax mrs walshingham who had seemed a little fatigued by the hill recovered and was even obviously stirred by affection for her daughter there was in passing a motherly caress she asked kipps to give her his arm in walking down the steep kipps in a sort of dream obeyed he found himself trying to attend to her and soon he was attending  she and kipps talked like sober responsible people and went slowly while the others drifted down the hill together a loose little group of four he wondered momentarily what they would talk about and then sank into his conversation with mrs walshingham he conversed as it were out of his superficial personality and his inner self lay stunned in unsuspected depths within it had an air of being an interesting and friendly talk almost their first long talk together hitherto he had had a sort of fear of mrs walshingham as of a person possibly satirical but she proved a soul of sense and sentiment and kipps for all of his abstraction got on with her unexpectedly well they talked a little upon scenery and the inevitable melancholy attaching to the old ruins and the thought of vanished generations  perhaps they jousted here said mrs walshingham  they was up to all sorts of things said kipps and then the two came round to helen she spoke of her daughters literary ambitions she will do something i feel sure you know mr kipps its a great responsibility to a mother to feel her daughter isexceptionally clever  i dessay it is said kipps theres no mistake about that  she spoke too of her sonalmost like helens twinalike yet different she made kipps feel quite fatherly they are so quick so artistic she said so full of ideas almost they frighten me one feels they need opportunitiesas other people need air  she spoke of helens writing even when she was quite a little dot she wrote verse  kipps sensation  her father had just the same tastes mrs walshingham turned a little beam of halfpathetic reminiscence on the past he was more artist than business man that was the trouble he was misled by his partner and when the crash came everyone blamed him well it doesnt do to dwell on horrid thingsespecially today there are bright days mr kipps and dark days and mine have not always been bright  kipps presented a face of cootelike sympathy  she diverged to talk of flowers and kipps mind was filled with the picture of helen bending down towards him in the keep  they spread the tea under the trees before the little inn and at a certain moment kipps became aware that everyone in the party was simultaneously and furtively glancing at him there might have been a certain tension had it not been first of all for coote and his tact and afterwards for a number of wasps coote was resolved to make this memorable day pass off well and displayed an almost boisterous sense of fun then young walshingham began talking of the roman remains below lympne intending to lead up to the overman these old roman chaps he said and then the wasps arrived they killed three in the jam alone  kipps killed wasps as if it were in a dream and handed things to the wrong people and maintained a thin surface of ordinary intelligence with the utmost difficulty at times he became aware aware with an extraordinary vividness of helen helen was carefully not looking at him and behaving with amazing coolness and ease but just for that one time there was the faintest suggestion of pink beneath the ivory of her cheeks  tacitly the others conceded to kipps the right to paddle back with helen he helped her into the canoe and took his paddle and paddling slowly dropped behind the others and now his inner self stirred again he said nothing to her how could he ever say anything to her again she spoke to him at rare intervals about reflections and the flowers and the trees and he nodded in reply but his mind moved very slowly forward now from the point at which it had fallen stunned in the lympne keep moving forward to the beginnings of realisation as yet he did not say even in the recesses of his heart that she was his but he perceived that the goddess had come from her altar amazingly and had taken him by the hand  the sky was a vast splendour and then close to them were the dark protecting trees and the shining smooth still water he was an erect black outline to her he plied his paddle with no unskilful gesture the water broke to snaky silver and glittered far behind his strokes indeed he did not seem bad to her youth calls to youth the wide world through and her soul rose in triumph over his subjection and behind him was money and opportunity freedom and london a great background of seductively indistinct hopes to him her face was a warm dimness in truth he could not see her eyes but it seemed to his lovewitched brain he did and that they shone out at him like dusky stars  all the world that evening was no more than a shadowy frame of darkling sky and water and dripping bows about helen he seemed to see through things with an extraordinary clearness she was revealed to him certainly as the cause and essence of it all  he was indeed at his hearts desire it was one of those times when there seems to be no future when time has stopped and we are at an end kipps that evening could not have imagined a tomorrow all that his imagination had pointed towards was attained his mind stood still and took the moments as they came   §4  about nine that night coote came around to kipps new apartment in the upper sandgate roadthe house on the leas had been let furnishedand kipps made an effort toward realisation he was discovered sitting at the open window and without a lamp quite still coote was deeply moved and he pressed kipps palm and laid a knobby white hand on his shoulder and displayed the sort of tenderness becoming in a crisis kipps was too moved that night and treated coote like a very dear brother  shes splendid said coote coming to it abruptly  isnt she said kipps  i couldnt help noticing her face said coote you know my dear kipps that this is better than a legacy  i dont deserve it said kipps  you cant say that  i dont i cant ardly believe it i cant believe it at all no  there followed an expressive stillness  its wonderful said kipps it takes me like that  coote made a faint blowing noise and so again they came for a time of silence  and it beganbefore your money  when i was in er class said kipps solemnly  coote speaking out of a darkness which he was illuminating strangely with efforts to strike a match said that it was beautiful he could not have wished kipps a better fortune  he lit a cigarette and kipps was moved to do the same with a sacramental expression presently speech flowed more freely  coote began to praise helen and her mother and brother he talked of when it might be he presented the thing as concrete and credible its a county family you know he said she is connected you know with the beaupres familyyou know lord beaupres  no said kipps reely  distantly of course said coote still  he smiled a smile that glimmered in the twilight  its too much said kipps overcome its so all like that  coote exhaled for a time kipps listened to helens praises and matured a point of view  i say coote he said what ought i to do now  what do you mean said coote  i mean about calling on er and all that  he reflected naturally i want to do it all right  of course said coote  it would be awful to go and do somethingnowall wrong  cootes cigarette glowed as he meditated you must call of course he decided youll have to speak to mrs walshingham  ow said kipps  tell her you mean to marry her daughter  i dessay she knows said kipps with defensive penetration  cootes head was visible shaking itself judiciously  then theres the ring said kipps what ave i to do about that  what ring do you mean  ngagement ring there isnt anything at all about that in manners and rules of good societynot a word  of course you must get somethingtasteful yes  what sort of a ring  something nace theyll show you in the shop  of course i spose i got to take it to er eh put it on her finger  oh no send it much better  ah said kipps for the first time with a note of relief  then ow about this callon mrs walshingham i mean ow ought one to go  rather a ceremonial occasion reflected coote  wadyer mean frock coat  i think so said coote with discrimination  light trousers and all that  yes  rose  i think it might run to a buttonhole  the curtain that hung over the future became less opaque to the eyes of kipps tomorrow and then other days became perceptible at least as existing frock coat silk hat and a rose with a certain solemnity he contemplated himself in the process of slow transformation into an english gentleman arthur cuyps frockcoated on occasions of ceremony the familiar acquaintance of lady punnet the recognised wooer of a distant connection of the earl of beaupres  something like awe at the magnitude of his own fortune came upon him he felt the world was opening out like a magic flower in a transformation scene at the touch of this wand of gold and helen nestling beautiful in the red heart of the flower only ten weeks ago he had been no more than the shabbiest of improvers and shamefully dismissed for dissipation the mere soilburned seed as it were of these glories he resolved the engagement ring should be of expressively excessive quality and appearance in fact the very best they had  ought i to send er flowers he speculated  not necessarily said coote though of course its an attention  kipps meditated on flowers  when you see her said coote youll have to ask her to name the day  kipps started that wont be just yet a bit will it  dont know any reason for delay  oo buta year say  rather a long time said coote  is it said kipps turning his head sharply but  there was quite a long pause  i say he said at last and in an unaltered voice youll ave to elp me about the wedding  only too happy said coote  of course said kipps i didnt think he changed his line of thought coote he asked wots a stateehtate  a tateahtay said coote improvingly is a conversation alone together  lor said kipps but i thought it says strictly we oughtnt to enjoy a tatertay not sit together walk together ride together or meet during any part of the day that dont leave much time for meeting does it  the books says that asked coote  i jest learnt it by eart before you came i thought that was a bit rum but i spose its all right  you wont find miss walshingham so strict as all that said coote i think thats a bit extreme theyd only do that now in very strict old aristocratic families besides the walshinghams are so modernadvanced you might say i expect youll get plenty of chances of talking together  theres a tremendous lot to think about said kipps blowing a profound sigh dyou meanpraps we might be married in a few months or so  youll have to be said coote why not  midnight found kipps alone looking a little tired and turning over the leaves of the redcovered textbook with a studious expression he paused for a moment on page 233 his eye caught by the words  for an uncle or aunt by marriage the period is six weeks black with jet trimmings  no said kipps after a vigorous mental effort thats not it the pages rustled again he stopped and flattened out the little book decisively at the beginning of the chapter on weddings  he became pensive he stared at the lamp wick i suppose i ought to go over and tell them he said at last   §5  kipps called on mrs walshingham attired in the proper costume for ceremonial occasions in the day he carried a silk hat and he wore a deepskirted frock coat his boots were patent leather and his trousers dark grey he had generous white cuffs with gold links and his grey gloves one thumb in which had burst when he put them on he held loosely in his hand he carried a small umbrella rolled to an exquisite tightness a sense of singular correctness pervaded his being and warred with the enormity of the occasion for possession of his soul anon he touched his silk cravat the world smelt of his rosebud  he seated himself on a new recovered chintz armchair and stuck out the elbow of the arm that held his hat  i know said mrs walshingham i know everything and helped him out most amazingly she deepened the impression he had already received of her sense and refinement she displayed an amount of tenderness that touched him  this is a great thing she said to a mother and her hand rested for a moment on his impeccable coat sleeve  a daughter arthur she explained is so much more than a son  marriage she said was a lottery and without love and toleration there was much unhappiness her life had not always been brightthere had been dark days and bright days she smiled rather sweetly this is a bright one she said  she said very kind and flattering things to kipps and she thanked him for his goodness to her son that wasnt anything said kipps and then she expanded upon the theme of her two children both so accomplished she said so clever i call them my twin jewels  she was repeating a remark that she had made at lympne that she always said her children needed opportunities as other people needed air when she was abruptly arrested by the entry of helen they hung on a pause helen perhaps surprised by kipps weekday magnificence then she advanced with outstretched hand  both the young people were shy i jest called round began kipps and became uncertain how to end  wont you have some tea asked helen  she walked to the window looked out at the familiar outporters barrow turned surveyed kipps for a moment ambiguously said i will get some tea and so departed again  mrs walshingham and kipps looked at one another and the lady smiled indulgently you two young people mustnt be shy of each other said mrs walshingham which damaged kipps considerably  she was explaining how sensitive helen always had been even about quite little things when the servant appeared with the tea things and then helen followed and taking up a secure position behind the little banboo tea table broke the ice with officious teacup clattering then she introduced the topic of a forthcoming openair performance of as you like it and steered past the worst of the awkwardness they discussed stage illusion i mus say said kipps i dont quite like a play in a theayter it seems sort of unreal someow  but most plays are written for the stage said helen looking at the sugar  i know admitted kipps  they finished tea well said kipps and rose  you mustnt go yet said mrs walshingham rising and taking his hand im sure you two must have heaps to say to each other and so she escaped towards the door   §6  among other projects that seemed almost equally correct to kipps at that exalted moment was one of embracing helen with ardour as soon as the door closed behind her mother and one of headlong flight through the open window then he remembered he ought to hold the door open for mrs walshingham and turned from that duty to find helen still standing beautifully inaccessible behind the tea things he closed the door and advanced toward her with his arms akimbo and his hands upon his coat skirts then feeling angular he moved his right hand to his moustache anyhow he was dressed all right somewhere at the back of his mind dim and mingled with doubt and surprise appeared the perception that he felt now quite differently towards her that something between them had been blown from lympne keep to the four winds of heaven  she regarded him with an eye of critical proprietorship  mother has been making up to you she said smiling slightly  she added it was nice of you to come around to see her  they stood through a brief pause as though each had expected something different in the other and was a little perplexed at its not being there kipps found he was at the corner of the brown covered table and he picked up a little flexible book that lay upon it to occupy his mind  i bought you a ring today he said bending the book and speaking for the sake of saying something and then he was moved to genuine speech you know he said i cant ardly believe it  her face relaxed slightly again no she said and may have breathed nor i  no he went on its as though everything ad changed more even than when i got my money ere we are going to marry its like being someone else what i feel is  he turned a flushed and earnest face to her he seemed to come alive to her with one natural gesture i dont know things im not good enough im not refined the more youll see of me the more youll find me out  but im going to help you  youll ave to elp me a fearful lot  she walked to the window glanced out of it made up her mind turned and came towards him with her hands clasped behind her back  all these things that trouble you are very little things if you dont mindif you will let me tell you things  i wish you would  then i will  theyre little things to you but they arent to me  it all depends if you dont mind being told  by you  i dont expect you to be told by strangers  oo said kipps expressing much  you know there are just a few little things for instance you know you are careless with your pronunciation you dont mind my telling you  i like it said kipps  theres aitches  i know said kipps and then endorsingly i been told fact is i know a chap a nacter hes told me hes told me and hes going to give me a lesso nor so  im glad of that it only requires a little care  of course on the stage they got to look out they take regular lessons  of course said helen a little absently  i dessay i shall soon get into it said kipps  and then theres dress said helen taking up her thread again  kipps became pink but he remained respectfully attentive  you dont mind she said  oo no  you mustnt be tootoo dressy its possible to be overconventional overelaborate it makes you look like a shoplike a common welloff person theres a sort of easiness that is better a real gentleman looks right without looking as though he had tried to be right  jest as though ed put on what came first said the pupil in a faded voice  not exactly that but a sort of ease  kipps nodded his head intelligently in his heart he was kicking his silk hat about the room in an ecstasy of disappointment  and you must accustom yourself to be more at your ease when you are with people said helen youve only got to forget yourself a little and not be anxious  ill try said kipps looking rather hard at the teapot ill do my best to try  i know you will she said and laid a hand for an instant upon his shoulder and withdrew it  he did not perceive her caress one has to learn he said his attention was distracted by the strenuous efforts that were going on in the back of his head to translate i say didnt you ought to name the day into easy as well as elegant english a struggle that was still undecided when the time came for them to part  he sat for a long time at the open window of his sittingroom with an intent face recapitulating that interview his eyes rested at last almost reproachfully on the silk hat beside him ow is one to know he asked his attention was caught by a rubbed place in the nap and still thoughtful he rolled up his handkerchief skilfully into a soft ball and began to smooth this down  his expression changed slowly  ow the juice is one to know he said putting down the hat with some emphasis  he rose up went across the room to the sideboard and standing there opened and began to read manners and rules     chapter iv  the bicycle manufacturer   §1  so kipps embarked upon his engagement steeled himself to the high enterprise of marrying above his breeding the next morning found him dressing with a certain quiet severity of movement and it seemed to his landladys housemaid that he was unusually dignified at breakfast he meditated profoundly over his kipper and his kidney and bacon he was going to new romney to tell the old people what had happened and where he stood and the love of helen had also given him courage to do what buggins had once suggested to him as a thing he would do were he in kipps place and that was to hire a motor car for the afternoon he had an early cold lunch and then with an air of quiet resolution assumed a cap and coat he had purchased to this end and thus equipped strolled around blowing slightly to the motor shop the transaction was unexpectedly easy and within the hour kipps spectacled and wrapped about was tootling through dymchurch  they came to a stop smartly and neatly outside the little toy shop make that thing oot a bit will you said kipps yes thats it whup said the motor car whurrup  both his aunt and uncle came out on the pavement why its artie cried his aunt and kipps had a moment of triumph  he descended to hand claspings removed wraps and spectacles and the motor driver retired to take an hour off old kipps surveyed the machinery and disconcerted kipps for a moment by asking him in a knowing tone what they asked him for a thing like that the two men stood inspecting the machine and impressing the neighbours for a time and then they strolled through the shop into the little parlour for a drink  they aint settled old kipps had said to the neighbours they aint got no further than experiments theres a bit of takein about each you take my advice and wait me boy even if its a year or two before you buy one for your own use  though kipps had said nothing of doing anything of the sort  ow dyou like that whiskey i sent asked kipps dodging the old familiar bunch of childrens pails  old kipps became tactful its a very good whiskey my boy said old kipps i avent the slightest doubt its a very good whiskey and cost you a tidy price butdashed if it soots me they put this here foozle ile in it my boy and it ketches me jest ere he indicated his centre of figure gives me the heartburn he said and shook his head rather sadly  its a very good whiskey said kipps its what the actor manager chaps drink in london i appen to know  i dessay they do my boy said old kipps but then theyve ad their livers burnt out and i avent they aint dellicat like me my stummik always as been extrey dellicat sometimes its almost been as though nothing would lay on it but thats in passing i liked those segars you can send me some of them segars  you cannot lead a conversation straight from the gastric consequences of foozle ile to love and so kipps after a friendly inspection of a rare old engraving after morland perfect except for a hole kicked through the centre that his uncle had recently purchased by private haggle came to the topic of the old peoples removal  at the outset of kipps great fortunes there had been much talk of some permanent provision for them it had been conceded they were to be provided for comfortably and the phrase retire from business had been very much in the air kipps had pictured an ideal cottage with a creeper always in exuberant flower about the door where the sun shone forever and the wind never blew and a perpetual welcome hovered in the doorway it was an agreeable dream but when it came to the point of deciding upon this particular cottage or that and on this particular house or that kipps was surprised by an unexpected clinging to the little home which he had always understood to be the worst of all possible houses  we dont want to move in a urry said mrs kipps  when we want to move we want to move for life ive had enough moving about in my time said old kipps  we can do here a bit more now we done here so long said mrs kipps  you lemme look about a bit fust said old kipps  and in looking about old kipps found perhaps a finer joy than any mere possession could have given he would shut his shop more or less effectually against the intrusion of customers and toddle abroad seeking new matter for his dream no house was too small and none too large for his knowing enquiries occupied houses took his fancy more than vacancies and he would remark you wont be a livin ere forever even if you think you will when irate householders protested against the unsolicited examination of their more intimate premises  remarkable difficulties arose of a totally unexpected sort  if we ave a larger ouse said mrs kipps with sudden bitterness we shall want a servant and i dont want no gells in the place larfin at me sniggerin and larfin and prancin and trapesin lardy da if we ave a smaller ouse there wont be room to swing a cat  room to swing a cat it seemed was absolutely essential it was an infrequent but indispensable operation  when we do move said old kipps if we could get a bit of shootin i dont want to sell off all this here stock for nothin its took years to cumulate i put a ticket in the winder sayin sellin orf but it asnt brought nothing like a roosh one of these ere dratted visitors pretendin to want an air gun was all we ad in yesterday jest an excuse for spyin round and then go away and larf at you nothanky to everything it didnt matter what thats ow i look at it artie  they pursued meandering fancies about the topic of their future settlement for a space and kipps became more and more hopeless of any proper conversational opening that would lead to his great announcement and more and more uncertain how such an opening should be taken once indeed old kipps anxious to get away from this dangerous subject of removals began and what are you adoin of in folkestone i shall have to come over and see you one of these days but before kipps could get in upon that his uncle had passed into a general exposition of the proper treatment of landladies and their humbugging cheating ways and so the opportunity vanished it seemed to kipps the only thing to do was to go out into the town for a stroll compose an effectual opening at leisure and then come back and discharge it at them in its consecutive completeness and even out of doors and alone he found his mind distracted by irrelevant thoughts   §2  his steps led him out of the high street towards the church and he leant for a time over the gate that had once been the winning post of his race with ann pornick and presently found himself in a sitting position on the top rail he had to get things smooth again he knew his mind was like a mirror of water after a breeze the image of helen and his great future was broken and mingled into fragmentary reflections of remoter things of the good name of old methusaleh three stars of long dormant memories the high street saw fit by some trick of light and atmosphere to arouse that afternoon  abruptly a fine full voice from under his elbow shouted whato art and behold sid pornick was back in his world leaning over the gate beside him and holding out a friendly hand  he was oddly changed and yet oddly like the sid that kipps had known he had the old broad face and mouth abundantly freckled the same short nose and the same blunt chin the same odd suggestion of his sister ann without a touch of her beauty but he had quite a new voice loud and a little hard and his upper lip carried a stiff and very fair moustache  kipps shook hands i was jest thinking of you sid he said jest this very moment and wondering if ever i should see you again ever and ere you are  one likes a look round at times said sid how are you old chap  all right said kipps i just been lef  you arent changed much interrupted sid  ent i said kipps foiled  i knew your back directly i came round the corner spite of that at you got on hang it i said thats art kipps or the devil and so it was  kipps made a movement of his neck as if he would look at his back and judge then he looked sid in the face you got a moustache sid he said  i spose youre having your holidays said sid  well partly but i just been lef  im taking a bit of a holiday sid went on but the fact is i have to give myself holidays nowadays ive set up for myself  not down here  no fear im not a turnip ive started in hammersmith manufacturing sid spoke offhand as though there was no such thing as pride  not drapery  no fear engineer manufacture bicycles he clapped his hand to his breast pocket and produced a number of pink handbills he handed one to kipps and prevented him reading it by explanations and explanatory dabs of a pointing finger thats our make my make to be exact the red flag seei got a transfer with my namepantocrat tyres eight poundsyes thereclinchers ten dunlops eleven ladies one pound morethats the ladys best machine at a democratic price in london no guineas and no discountshonest trade i build emto order ive built he reflected looking away seawardseventeen counting orders in and come down to look at the old place a bit mother likes it at times  thought youd all gone away  what after my fathers death no my mothers come back and shes living at muggetts cottages the sea air suits er she likes the old place better than hammersmith  and i can afford it got an old crony or so here gossip  have tea spose you aint married kipps  kipps shook his head i he began  i am said sid married these two years and got a nipper proper little chap  kipps got his word in at last i got engaged day before yesterday he said  ah said sid airily thats all right whos the fortunate lady  kipps tried to speak in an offhand way he stuck his hands in his pockets as he spoke shes a solicitors daughter he said in folkestone ratherr nice set county family related to the earl of beaupres  steady on cried sid  you see ive ad a bit of luck sid been lef money  sids eye travelled instinctively to mark kipps garments how much he asked  bout twelve undred a year said kipps more offhandedly than ever  lord said sid with a note of positive dismay and stepped back a pace or two  my granfaver it was said kipps trying hard to be calm and simple ardly knew i ad a granfaver and thenbang when o bean the solicitor told me of it you could ave knocked me down  ow much demanded sid with a sharp note in his voice  twelve undred pound a yearproximately that is  sids attempt at genial unenvious congratulation did not last a minute he shook hands with an unreal heartiness and said he was jolly glad its a blooming stroke of luck he said  its a bloomin stroke of luck he repeated thats what it is with the smile fading from his face of course better you ave it than me o chap so i dont envy you anyhow i couldnt keep it if i did ave it  ows that said kipps a little hipped by sids patent chagrin  im a socialist you see said sid i dont old with wealth what is wealth labour robbed out of the poor at most its only yours in trust leastways that ow i should take it he reflected the present distribution of wealth he said and stopped  then he let himself go with unmasked bitterness its no sense at all its jest damn foolishness whos going to work and care in a muddle like this here first you dosomething anyhowof the worlds work and it pays you hardly anything and then it invites you to do nothing nothing whatever and pays you twelve hundred pounds a year whos going to respect laws and customs when they come to damn silliness like that he repeated twelve hundred pounds a year  at the sight of kipps face he relented slightly  its not you im thinking of o man its the system better you than most people still  he laid both hands on the gate and repeated to himself twelve undred a year geewhizz kipps youll be a swell  i shant said kipps with imperfect conviction no fear  you cant ave money like that and not swell out youll soon be too big to speak toow do they put ita mere mechanic like me  no fear siddee said kipps with conviction i aint that sort  ah said sid with a sort of unwilling scepticism moneyll be too much for you besidesyoure caught by a swell already  ow dyou mean  that girl youre going to marry masterman says  oos masterman  rare good chap i knowtakes my first floor front room masterson says its always the wife pitches the key always theres no social differencestill women come in  ah said kipps profoundly you dont know  sid shook his head fancy he reflected art kipps twelve undred a year  kipps tried to bridge that opening gulf remember the hurons sid  rather said sid  remember that wreck  i can smell it nowsort of sour smell  kipps was silent for a moment with reminiscent eyes on sids still troubled face  i say sid ows ann  shes all right said sid  where is she now  in a place  ashford  oh  sids face had become a shade sulkier than before  the fact is he said we dont get on very well together i dont hold with service were common people i suppose but i dont like it i dont see why a sister of mine should wait at other peoples tables no not even if they got twelve undred a year  kipps tried to change the point of application remember ow you came out once when we were racing here she didnt run bad for a girl  and his own words raised an image brighter than he could have supposed so bright it seemed to breathe before him and did not fade altogether even when he was back in folkestone an hour or so later  but sid was not to be deflected from that other rankling theme by any reminiscences of ann  i wonder what you will do with all that money he speculated i wonder if you will do any good at all i wonder what you could do you should hear masterman hed tell you things suppose it came to me what should i do its no good giving it back to the state as things are start an owenite profitsharing factory perhaps or a new socialist paper we want a new socialist paper  he tried to drown his personal chagrin in elaborate exemplary suggestions   §3  i must be gettin on to my motor said kipps at last having to a large extent heard him out  what got a motor  no said kipps apologetically only jobbed for the day  ow much  five pounds  keep five families for a week good lord that seemed to crown sids disgust  yet drawn by a sort of fascination he came with kipps and assisted at the mounting of the motor he was pleased to note it was not the most modern of motors but that was the only grain of comfort kipps mounted at once after one violent agitation of the little shopdoor to set the bell ajingle and warn his uncle and aunt sid assisted with the great furlined overcoat and examined the spectacles  goodbye o chap said kipps  goodbye o chap said sid  the old people came out to say goodbye  old kipps was radiant with triumph pon my sammy artie im a goo mind to come with you he shouted and then i got something you might take with you  he dodged back into the shop and returned with the perforated engraving after morland  you stick to this my boy he said you get it repaired by someone who knows its the most vallyble thing i got you so far you take my word  warrup said the motor and tuff tuff tuff and backed and snorted while old kipps danced about on the pavement as if foreseeing complex catastrophes and told the driver thats all right  he waved his stout stick to his receding nephew then he turned to sid now if you could make something like that young pornick you might blow a bit  ill make a doocid sight better than that before i done said sid hands deep in his pockets  not you said old kipps  the motor set up a prolonged sobbing moan and vanished around the corner sid stood motionless for a space unheeding some further remark from old kipps the young mechanic had just discovered that to have manufactured seventeen bicycles including orders in hand is not so big a thing as he had supposed and such discoveries try ones manhood  oh well said sid at last and turned his face towards his mothers cottage  she had got a hot teacake for him and she was a little hurt that he was dark and preoccupied as he consumed it he had always been such a boy for teacake and then when one went out specially and got him one  he did not tell herhe did not tell anyonehe had seen young kipps he did not want to talk about kipps for a bit to anyone at all     chapter v  the pupil lover   §1  when kipps came to reflect upon his afternoons work he had his first inkling of certain comprehensive incompatibilities lying about the course of true love in his particular case he had felt without understanding the incongruity between the announcement he had failed to make and the circle of ideas of his aunt and uncle it was this rather than the want of a specific intention that had silenced him the perception that when he travelled from folkestone to new romney he travelled from an atmosphere where his engagement to helen was sane and excellent to an atmosphere where it was only to be regarded with incredulous suspicion coupled and associated with this jar was his sense of the altered behaviour of sid pornick the evident shock to that ancient alliance caused by the fact of his enrichment the touch of hostility in his youll soon be swelled too big to speak to a poor mechanic like me kipps was unprepared for the unpleasant truth that the path of social advancement is and must be strewn with broken friendships this first protrusion of that fact caused a painful confusion in his mind it was speedily to protrude in a far more serious fashion in relation to the hands from the emporium and chitterlow  from the day at lympne castle his relations with helen had entered upon a new footing he had prayed for helen as good souls pray for heaven with as little understanding of what it was he prayed for and now that period of standing humbly in the shadows before the shrine was over and the goddess her veil of mystery flung aside had come down to him and taken hold of him a good strong firm hold and walked by his side she liked him what was singular was that very soon she had kissed him thrice whimsically upon the brow and he had never kissed her at all he could not analyse his feelings only he knew the world was wonderfully changed about them but the truth was that though he still worshipped and feared her though his pride in his engagement was ridiculously vast he loved her now no more that subtle something woven of the most delicate strands of selflove and tenderness and desire had vanished imperceptibly and was gone now for ever but that she did not suspect in him nor as a matter of fact did he  she took him in hand in perfect good faith she told him things about his accent she told him things about his bearing about his costume and his way of looking at things she thrust the blade of her intelligence into the tenderest corners of kipps secret vanity she slashed his most intimate pride to bleeding tatters he sought very diligently to anticipate some at least of these informing thrusts by making great use of coote but the unanticipated made a brave number  she found his simple willingness a very lovable thing  indeed she liked him more and more there was a touch of motherliness in her feelings towards him but his upbringing and his associations had been she diagnosed awful at new romney she glanced but little that was remote but in her inventoryshe went over him as one might go over a newly taken house with impartial thoroughnessshe discovered more proximate influences surprising intimations of nocturnal singsongsshe pictured it as almost shocking that kipps should sing to the banjomuch lowgrade wisdom treasured from a person called bugginswho is buggins said helenvague figures of indisputable vulgarity pierce and carshot and more particularly a very terrible social phenomenon chitterlow  chitterlow blazed upon them with unheralded oppressive brilliance the first time they were abroad together  they were going along the front of the leas to see a school play in sandgateat the last moment mrs walshingham had been unable to come with themwhen chitterlow loomed up into the new world he was wearing the suit of striped flannel and the straw hat that had followed kipps payment in advance for his course in elocution his hands were deep in his side pockets and animated the corners of his jacket and his attentive gaze at the passing loungers the faint smile under his boldly drawn nose showed him engaged in studying characterno doubt for some forthcoming play  what ho said he at the sight of kipps and swept off the straw hat with so ample a clutch of his great flat hand that it suggested to helens startled mind a conjurer about to palm a halfpenny  ello chittlow said kipps a little awkwardly and not saluting  chitterlow hesitated half a mo my boy he said and arrested kipps by extending a large hand over his chest excuse me my dear he said bowing like his russian count by way of apology to helen and with a smile that would have killed at a hundred yards he affected a semiconfidential grouping of himself and kipps while helen stood in white amazement  about that play he said  ow about it asked kipps acutely aware of helen  its all right said chitterlow theres a strong smell of syndicate in the air i may tell youstrong  thats aw right said kipps  you neednt tell everybody said chitterlow with a transitory confidential hand to his mouth which pointed the application of the everybody just a trifle too strongly but i think its coming off however i mustnt detain you now so long youll come round eh  right you are said kipps  tonight  at eight  and then and more in the manner of a russian prince than any common count chitterlow bowed and withdrew just for a moment he allowed a conquering eye to challenge helens and noted her for a girl of quality  there was a silence between our lovers for a space  that said kipps with an allusive movement of the head was chitterlow  is hea friend of yours  in a way you seei met im leastways e met me run into me with a bicycle e did and so we got talking together  he tried to appear at his ease the young lady scrutinised his profile  what is he  es a nacter chap said kipps leastways e writes plays  and sells them  partly  whom to  different people shares he sells its all right reelyi meant to tell you about him before  helen looked over her shoulder to catch a view of chitterlows retreating aspect it did not compel her complete confidence  she turned to her lover and said in a tone of quiet authority you must tell me all about chitterlow now  the explanation began  the school play came almost as a relief to kipps in the flusterment of going in he could almost forget for a time his laocoon struggle to explain and in the intervals he did his best to keep forgetting but helen with a gentle insistence resumed the explanation of chitterlow as they returned towards folkestone  chitterlow was confoundedly difficult to explain you could hardly imagine  there was an almost motherly anxiety in helens manner blended with the resolution of a schoolmistress to get to the bottom of the affair kipps ears were soon quite brightly red  have you seen one of his plays  es tole me about one  but on the stage  no he asnt ad any on the stage yet thats all coming  promise me she said in conclusion you wont do anything without consulting me  and of course kipps promised oono  they went on their way in silence  one cant know everybody said helen in general  of course said kipps in a sort of way it was him that helped me to my money and he indicated in a confused manner the story of the advertisement i dont like to drop im all at once he added  helen was silent for a space and when she spoke she went off at a tangent we shall live in londonsoon she remarked its only while we are here  it was the first intimation she gave him of their postnuptial prospects  we shall have a nice little flat somewhere not too far west and there we shall build up a circle of our own   §2  all that declining summer kipps was the pupil lover he made an extraordinarily open secret of his desire for selfimprovement indeed helen had to hint once or twice that his modest frankness was excessive and all this new circle of friends did each after his or her manner everything that was possible to supplement helens efforts and help him to ease and skill in the more cultivated circles to which he had come coote was still the chief teacher the tutorthere are so many little difficulties that a man may take to another man that he would not care to propound to the woman he lovesbut they were all so to speak upon the staff even the freckled girl said to him once in a pleasant way you mustnt say contre temps you must say contraytom when he borrowed that expression from manners and rules and she tried at his own suggestion to give him clear ideas upon the subject of as and has a certain confusion between these words was becoming evident the first fruits of a lesson from chitterlow on the aspirate hitherto he had discarded that dangerous letter almost altogether but now he would pull up at words beginning with h and draw a sawing breathrather like a startled kittenand then aspirate with vigour  said kipps one day as ei should say ahhas e ye know i got a lot of difficulty over them two words which is which  well as is a conjunction and has is a verb  i know said kipps but when is has a conjunction and when is as a verb  well said the freckled girl preparing to be very lucid its has when it means one has meaning having but if it isnt its as as for instance one says ei mean hehe has but one says as he has  i see said kipps so i ought to say as e  no if you are asking a question you say has ei mean heas he she blushed quite brightly but still clung to her air of lucidity  i see said kipps he was about to say something further but he desisted i got it much clearer now has e has e as yes  if you remember about having  oo i will said kipps  miss coote specialised in kipps artistic development she had early found an opinion that he had considerable artistic sensibility his remarks on her work had struck her as decidedly intelligent and whenever he called around to see them she would show him some work of art now an illustrated book now perhaps a colour print of a botticelli now the hundred best paintings now academy pictures now a german art handbook and now some magazine of furniture and design i know you like these things she used to say and kipps said oo i do he soon acquired a little armoury of appreciative sayings when presently the walshinghams took him up to the arts and crafts his deportment was intelligent in the extreme for a time he kept a wary silence and suddenly pitched upon a colour print thats rather nace he said to mrs walshingham that lill thing there he always said things like that by preference to the mother rather than the daughter unless he was perfectly sure  he quite took to mrs walshingham he was impressed by her conspicuous tact and refinement it seemed to him that the ladylike could go no further she was always dressed with a delicate fussiness that was never disarranged and even a sort of faded quality about her hair and face and bearing and emotions contributed to her effect kipps was not a big man and commonly he did not feel a big man but with mrs walshingham he always felt enormous and distended as though he was a navvy who had taken some disagreeable poison which puffed him up inside his skin as a preliminary to bursting he felt too as though he had been rolled in clay and his hair dressed with gum and he felt that his voice was strident and his accent like somebody swinging a crowded pigs pail in a free and careless manner all this increased and enforced his respect for her her hand which flitted often and again to his hand and arm was singularly well shaped and cool arthur she called him from the very beginning  she did not so much positively teach and tell him as tactfully guide and infect him her conversation was not so much didactic as exemplary she would say i do like people to do so and so she would tell him anecdotes of nice things done of gentlemanly feats of graceful consideration she would record her neat observations of people in trains and omnibuses how for example a man had passed her change to the conductor quite a common man he looked but he had lifted his hat she stamped kipps so deeply with the hatraising habit that he would uncover if he found himself in the same railway ticket office with a lady had to stand ceremoniously until the difficulties of change drove him to an apologetic provisional oblique resumption of his headgear and robbing these things of any air of personal application she threw about them an abundant talk about her two childrenshe called them her twin jewels quite frequentlyabout their gifts their temperaments their ambition their need of opportunity they needed opportunity she would say as other people needed air  in his conversations with her kipps always assumed and she seemed to assume that she was to join that home in london helen foreshadowed but he was surprised one day to gather that this was not to be the case it wouldnt do said helen with decision we want to make a circle of our own  but wont she be a bit lonely down here asked kipps  theres the waces and mrs prebble and mrs bindon botting andlots of people she knows and helen dismissed this possibility  young walshinghams share in the educational syndicate was smaller but he shone out when they went to london on that arts and crafts expedition then this rising man of affairs showed kipps how to buy the more theatrical weeklies for consumption in the train how to buy and what to buy in the way of cigarettes with gold tips and shilling cigars and how to order hock for lunch and sparkling moselle for dinner how to calculate the fare of a hansom cabpenny a minute while he goeshow to look intelligently at an hotel tape and how to sit still in a train like a thoughtful man instead of talking like a fool and giving yourself away and he too would glance at the good time coming when they were to be in london for good and all  that prospect expanded and developed particulars it presently took up a large part of helens conversation her conversations with kipps were never of a grossly sentimental sort there was a shyness of speech in that matter with both of them but these new adumbrations were at least as interesting and not so directly disagreeable as the clearcut intimations of personal defect that for a time had so greatly chastened kipps delight in her presence the future presented itself with an almost perfect frankness as a joint campaign of mrs walshinghams twin jewels upon the great world with kipps in the capacity of baggage and supply they would still be dreadfully poor of coursethis amazed kipps but he said nothinguntil brudderkins began to succeed but if they were clever and lucky they might do a great deal  when helen spoke of london a brooding look as of one who contemplates a distant country came into her eyes already it seemed they had the nucleus of a set brudderkins was a member of the theatrical judges an excellent and influential little club of journalists and literary people and he knew shimer and stargate and whiffle of the red dragon and besides these were the revels they knew the revels quite well sidney revel before his rapid rise to prominence as a writer of epigrammatic essays that were quite above the ordinary public had been an assistant master at one of the best folkestone schools brudderkins had brought him home to tea several times and it was he had first suggested helen should try and write its perfectly easy sidney had said he had been writing occasional things for the evening papers and for the weekly reviews even at that time then he had gone up to london and had almost unavoidedly become a dramatic critic those brilliant essays had followed and then red hearts abeating the romance that had made him it was a tale of spirited adventure full of youth and beauty and naïve passion and generous devotion bold as the bookman said and frank in places but never in the slightest degree morbid he had met and married an american widow with quite a lot of money and they had made a very distinct place for themselves kipps learnt in the literary and artistic society of london helen seemed to dwell on the revels a great deal it was her exemplary story and when she spoke of sidneyshe often called him sidneyshe would become thoughtful she spoke most of him naturally because she had still to meet mrs revel certainly they would be in the world in no time even if the distant connection with the beaupres family came to nothing  kipps gathered that with his marriage and the movement to london they were to undergo that subtle change of name coote had first adumbrated they were to become cuyps mr and mrs cuyps or was it cuyp  itll be rum at first said kipps i dessay i shall soon get into it  so in their several ways they all contributed to enlarge and refine and exercise the intelligence of kipps and behind all these other influences and as it were presiding over and correcting these influences was kipps nearest friend coote a sort of master of the ceremonies you figure his face blowing slightly with solicitude his slate coloured projecting but not unkindly eye intent upon our hero the thing he thought was going off admirably he studied kipps character immensely he would discuss him with his sister with mrs walshingham with the freckled girl with anyone who would stand it he is an interesting character he would say likablea sort of gentleman by instinct he takes to all these things he improves every day hell soon get sang froid we took him up just in time he wants nowwell next year perhaps if there is a good extension literature course he might go in for it he wants to go in for something like that  hes going in for his bicycle now said mrs walshingham  thats all right for summer said coote but he wants to go in for some serious intellectual interest something to take him out of himself a little more savoir faire and selfforgetfulness is more than half the secret of sang froid   §3  the world as coote presented it was in part an endorsement in part an amplification and in part a rectification of the world of kipps the world that derived from the old couple in new romney and had been developed in the emporium the world in fact of common british life there was the same subtle sense of social graduation that had moved mrs kipps to prohibit intercourse with labourers children and the same dread of anything common that had kept the personal quality of mr shalfords establishment so high but now a certain disagreeable doubt about kipps own position was removed and he stood with coote inside the sphere of gentlemen assured within the sphere of gentlemen there are distinctions of rank indeed but none of class there are the big people and the modest refined gentlemanly little people like coote who may even dabble in the professions and counterless trades there are lords and magnificences and there are gentle folk who have to manage but they can all call on one another they preserve a general equality of deportment throughout they constitute that great state within the state society or at any rate they make believe they do  but reely said the pupil not what you call being in society  yes said coote of course down here one doesnt see much of it but theres local society it has the same rules  calling and all that  precisely said coote  kipps thought whistled a bar and suddenly broached a question of conscience i often wonder he said whether i oughtnt to dress for dinnerwhen im alone ere  coote protruded his lips and reflected not full dress he adjudicated that would be a little excessive but you should change you know put on a mess jacket and that sort of thingeasy dress that is what i should do certainly if i wasnt in harnessand poor  he coughed modestly and patted his hair behind  and after that the washing bill of kipps quadrupled and he was to be seen at times by the bandstand with his light summer overcoat unbuttoned to give a glimpse of his nice white tie he and coote would be smoking the goldtipped cigarettes young walshingham had prescribed as chic and appreciating the music highly thatspuffa very nice bit kipps would say or better thats nace and at the first grunts of the loyal anthem up they stood with religiously uplifted hats whatever else you might call them you could never call them disloyal  the boundary of society was admittedly very close to coote and kipps and a leading solicitude of the true gentleman was to detect clearly those beneath him and to behave towards them in a proper spirit its jest there its so ard for me said kipps he had to cultivate a certain distance to acquire altogether the art of checking the presumption of bounders and old friends it was difficult coote admitted thats what so harkwardi mean awkward  i got mixed up with this lot ere said kipps  you could give them a hint said coote  ow  ohthe occasion will suggest something  the occasion came one early closing night when kipps was sitting in a canopy chair near the bandstand with his summer overcoat fully open and a new gibus pulled slightly forward over his brow waiting for coote they were to hear the band for an hour and then go down to assist miss coote and the freckled girl in trying over some of beethovens duets if they remembered them that is sufficiently well and as kipps lounged back in his chair and occupied his mind with his favourite amusement on such evenings which consisted chiefly in supposing that everyone about him was wondering who he was came a rude rap at the canvas back and the voice of pierce  its nice to be a gentleman said pierce and swung a penny chair into position while buggins appeared smiling agreeably on the other side and leant upon his stick he was smoking a common briar pipe  two real ladies very fashionably dressed and sitting close at hand glanced quickly at pierce and then away again and it was evident their wonder was at an end  hes all right said buggins removing his pipe and surveying kipps  ello buggins said kipps not too cordially ow goes it  all right holidays next week if you dont look out kipps i shall be on the continong before you eh  you going t boologne  rather parley vous francey you bet  i shall ave a bit of a run over there one of these days said kipps  there came a pause pierce applied the top of his stick to his mouth for a space and regarded kipps then he glanced at the people about them  i say kipps he said in a distinct loud voice see er ladyship lately  kipps perceived the audience was to be impressed but he responded halfheartedly no i avent he said  she was along of sir william the other night said pierce still loud and clear and she asked to be remembered to you  it seemed to kipps that one of the two ladies smiled faintly and said something to the other and then certainly they glanced at pierce kipps flushed scarlet did she he answered  buggins laughed goodhumouredly over his pipe  sir william suffers a lot from his gout pierce continued unabashed  buggins much amused with his pipe between his teeth  kipps became aware of coote at hand  coote nodded rather distantly to pierce hope i havent kept you waiting kipps he said  i kep a chair for you said kipps and removed a guardian foot  but youve got your friends said coote  oh we dont mind said pierce cordially the more the merrier and why dont you get a chair buggins buggins shook his head in a sort of aside to pierce and coote coughed behind his hand  been kep late at business asked pierce  coote turned quite pale and pretended not to hear his eyes sought in space for a time and with a convulsive movement he recognised a distant acquaintance and raised his hat  pierce had also become a little pale he addressed himself to kipps in an undertone  mr coote isnt he he asked  coote addressed himself to kipps directly and exclusively his manner had the calm of extreme tension  im rather late he said i think we ought almost to be going on now  kipps stood up thats all right he said  which way are you going said pierce standing also and brushing some crumbs of cigarette ash from his sleeve  for a moment coote was breathless thank you he said and gasped then he delivered the necessary blow i dont think were in need of your society you know and turned away  kipps found himself falling over chairs and things in the wake of coote and then they were clear of the crowd  for a space coote said nothing then he remarked abruptly and quite angrily for him i think that was awful cheek  kipps made no reply  the whole thing was an interesting little object lesson in distance and it stuck in the front of kipps mind for a long time he had particularly vivid the face of pierce with an expression between astonishment and anger he felt as though he had struck pierce in the face under circumstances that gave pierce no power to reply he did not attend very much to the duets and even forgot at the end of one of them to say how perfectly lovely it was   §4  but you must not imagine that the national ideal of a gentleman as coote developed it was all a matter of deportment and selectness a mere isolation from debasing associations there is a serious side a deeper aspect of the true true gentleman the true gentleman does not wear his heart on his sleeve he is a polished surface above deeps for example he is deeply religious as coote was as mrs walshingham was but outside the walls of a church it never appears except perhaps now and then in a pause in a profound look in a sudden avoidance in quite a little while kipps also had learnt the pause the profound look the sudden avoidance that final refinement of spirituality impressionistic piety  and the true gentleman is patriotic also when one saw coote lifting his hat to the national anthem then perhaps one got a glimpse of what patriotic emotions what worship the polish of a gentleman may hide or singing out his deep notes against the hosts of midian in the st stylites choir then indeed you plumbed his spiritual side        christian dost thou heed them        on the holy ground      how the hosts of midian        prowl and prowl around      christian up and smaiit them   but these were but gleams for the rest religion nationality passion money politics much more so those cardinal issues birth and death the true gentleman skirted about and became facially rigid towards and ceased to speak and panted and blew  one doesnt talk of that sort of thing coote would say with a gesture of the knuckly hand  o course kipps would reply with an equal significance  profundities deep as it were blowing to deep  one does not talk but on the other hand one is punctilious to do actions speak kippsin spite of the fact that the walshinghams were more than a little laxkipps who had formerly flitted sunday after sunday from one folkestone church to another had now a sitting of his own paid for duly at saint stylites there he was to be seen always at the surplice evening service and sometimes of a morning dressed with a sober precision and with an eye on coote in the chancel no difficulties now about finding the place in his book he became a communicant againhe had lapsed soon after his confirmation when the young lady in the costumeroom who was his adopted sister left the emporiumand he would sometimes go around to the vestry for coote after the service one evening he was introduced to the hon and rev densemore he was much too confused to say anything and the noble cleric had nothing to say but indisputably they were introduced  no you must not imagine our national ideal of a gentleman is without its serious side without even its stern and uncompromising side the imagination no doubt refuses to see coote displaying extraordinary refinements of courage upon the stricken field but in the walks of peace there is sometimes sore need of sternness charitable as one may be one must admit there are people who do things impossible things people who place themselves out of it in countless ways people moreover who are by a sort of predestination out of it from the beginning and against these society has invented a terrible protection for its cootery the cut the cut is no joke for anyone it is excommunication you may be cut by an individual you may be cut by a set or you may beand this is so tragic that beautiful romances have been written about itcut by the county one figures coote discharging this last duty and cutting somebodycoote erect and pale never speaking going past with eyes of pitiless slate lower jaw protruding a little face pursed up and cold and stiff  it never dawned upon kipps that he would one day have to face this terrible front to be to coote not only as one dead but as one gone more than a stage or so in decay cut and passed banned and outcast for ever  yet so it was to be  one cannot hide any longer that all this fine progress of kipps is doomed to end in collapse so far indeed you have seen him ascend you have seen him becoming more refined and careful day by day more carefully dressed less clumsy in the ways and methods of social life you have seen the gulf widening between himself and his former low associates i have brought you at last to the vision of him faultlessly dressed and posed in an atmosphere of candlelight and chanting in his own sitting in one of the most fashionable churches in folkestone all the time i have refrained from the lightest touch upon the tragic note that must now creep into my tale yet the net of his low connections has been about his feet and moreover there was something interwoven in his being     chapter vi  discords   §1  one day kipps set out upon his newlymastered bicycle to new romney to break the news of his engagement to his uncle and auntthis time positively he was now a finished cyclist but as yet an unseasoned one the southwest wind even in its summer guise as one meets it in the marsh is the equivalent of a reasonable hill and ever and again he got off and refreshed himself by a spell of walking he was walking just outside new romney preparatory to his triumphal entry one hand off when abruptly he came upon ann pornick  it chanced he was thinking about her at the time he had been thinking curious things whether after all the atmosphere of new romney and the marsh had not some difference some faint impalpable quality that was missing in the great and fashionable world of folkestone behind there on the hill here there was a homeliness a familiarity he had noted as he passed that old mr cliffordowns gate had been mended with a fresh piece of string in folkestone he didnt take notice and he didnt care if they built three hundred houses come to think of it that was odd it was fine and grand to have twelve hundred a year it was fine to go about on trams and omnibuses and think not a person aboard was as rich as oneself it was fine to buy and order this and that and never have any work to do and to be engaged to a girl distantly related to the earl of beauprés but yet there had been a zest in the old time out here a rare zest in the holidays in sunlight on the sea beach and in the high street that failed from these new things he thought of those bright windows of holiday that had seemed so glorious to him in the retrospect from his apprentice days it was strange that now amidst his present splendours they were glorious still  all those things were over nowperhaps that was it something had happened to the world and the old light had been turned out he himself was changed and sid was changed terribly changed and ann no doubt was changed  he thought of her with the hair blown about her flushed cheeks as they stood together after their race  certainly she must be changed and all the magic she had been fraught with to the very hem of her short petticoats gone no doubt for ever and as he thought that or before and while he thought it for he came to all these things in his own vague and stumbling way he looked up and there was ann  she was seven years older and greatly altered yet for the moment it seemed to him that she had not changed at all ann he said and she with a lifting note its art kipps  then he became aware of changesimprovements she was as pretty as she had promised to be her blue eyes as dark as his memory of them and with a quick high colour but now kipps by several inches was the taller again she was dressed in a simple grey dress that showed her very clearly as a straight and healthy little woman and her hat was sundayfied with pink flowers she looked soft and warm and welcoming her face was alight to kipps with her artless gladness at their encounter  its art kipps she said  rather said kipps  you got your holidays  it flashed upon kipps that sid had not told her of his great fortune much regretful meditation upon sids behaviour had convinced him that he himself was to blame for exasperating boastfulness in that affair and this time he took care not to err in that direction he erred in the other  im taking a bit of a oliday he said  som i said ann  you been for a walk asked kipps  ann showed him a bunch of wayside flowers  its a long time since i seen you ann why ow long must it be seveneight years nearly  it dont do to count said ann  it dont look like it said kipps with the slightest emphasis  you got a moustache said ann smelling her flowers and looking at him over them not without admiration  kipps blushed  presently they came to the bifurcation of the roads  im going down this way to mothers cottage said ann  ill come a bit your way if i may  in new romney social distinctions that are primary realities in folkestone are absolutely nonexistent and it seemed quite permissible for him to walk with ann for all that she was no more than a servant they talked with remarkable ease to one another they slipped into a vein of intimate reminiscence in the easiest manner in a little while kipps was amazed to find ann and himself at this  you rember that half sixpence what you cut for me  yes  i got it still  she hesitated funny wasnt it she said and then you got yours artie  rather said kipps what do you think and wondered in his heart of hearts why he had never looked at that sixpence for so long  ann smiled at him frankly  i didnt expect youd keep it she said i thought oftenit was silly to keep mine besides she reflected it didnt mean anything really  she glanced at him as she spoke and met his eye  oh didnt it said kipps a little late with his response and realising his infidelity to helen even as he spoke  it didnt mean much anyhow said ann you still in the drapery  im living at folkestone began kipps and decided that that sufficed didnt sid tell you he met me  no here  yes the other day bout a week or more ago  that was before i came  ah that was it said kipps  es got on said ann got is own shop now artie  e tole me  they found themselves outside muggetts cottages you going in said kipps  i spose so said ann  they both hung upon the pause ann took a plunge  dyou often come to new romney she said  i ride over a bit at times said kipps  another pause ann held out her hand  im glad i seen you she said  extraordinary impulses arose in neglected parts of kipps being ann he said and stopped  yes said she and was bright to him  they looked at one another  all and more than all of those first emotions of his adolescence had come back to him her presence banished a multitude of countervaling considerations it was ann more than ever she stood breathing close to him with her softlooking lips a little apart and gladness in her eyes  im awful glad to see you again he said it brings back old times  doesnt it  another pause he would have liked to have had a long talk to her to have gone for a walk with her or something to have drawn nearer to her in any conceivable way and above all to have had some more of the appreciation that shone in her eyes but a vestige of folkestone still clinging to him told him it wouldnt do well he said i must be getting on and turned away reluctantly with a will under compulsion  when he looked back from the corner she was still at the gate she was perhaps a little disconcerted by his retreat he felt that he hesitated for a moment half turned stood and suddenly did great things with his hat that hat the wonderful hat of our civilisation  in another minute he was engaged in a singularly absentminded conversation with his uncle about the usual topics  his uncle was very anxious to buy him a few upright clocks as an investment for subsequent sale and there were also some very nice globes one terrestrial and the other celestial in a shop at lydd that would look well in a drawingroom and inevitably increase in value kipps either did or did not agree to this purchase he was unable to recollect  the southwest wind perhaps helped him back at any rate he found himself through dymchurch without having noticed the place there came an odd effect as he drew near hythe the hills on the left and the trees on the right seemed to draw together and close in upon him until his way was straight and narrow he could not turn around on that treacherous halftamed machine but he knew that behind him he knew so well spread the wide vast flatness of the marsh shining under the afternoon sky in some way this was material to his thoughts and as he rode through hythe he came upon the idea that there was a considerable amount of incompatibility between the existence of one who was practically a gentleman and of ann  in the neighbourhood of seabrook he began to think he had in some subtle way lowered himself by walking along by the side of ann after all she was only a servant  ann  she called out all the least gentlemanly instincts of his nature there had been a moment in their conversation when he had quite distinctly thought it would really be an extremely nice thing for someone to kiss her lips there was something warming about annat least for kipps she impressed him as having somewhen during their vast interval of separation contrived to make herself in some distinctive way his  fancy keeping that half sixpence all this time  it was the most flattering thing that had ever happened to kipps   §2  he found himself presently sitting over the art of conversing lost in the strangest musings he got up walked about became stagnant at the window for a space roused himself and by way of something lighter tried sesame and lilies from that too his attention wandered he sat back anon he smiled anon sighed he arose pulled his keys from his pocket looked at them decided and went upstairs he opened the little yellow box that had been the nucleus of all his possessions in the world and took out a small escritoire the very humblest sort of present and opened itkneeling and there in the corner was a little packet of paper sealed as a last defence against any prying invader with red sealing wax it had gone untouched for years he held this little packet between finger and thumb for a moment regarding it and then put down the escritoire and broke the seal  as he was getting into bed that night he remembered something for the first time  dash it he said dashed if i told em this time well i shall ave to go over to new romney again  he got into bed and remained sitting pensively on the pillow for a space  its a rum world he reflected after a vast interval  then he recalled that she had noticed his moustache and embarked upon a sea of egotistical musings  he imagined himself telling ann how rich he was what a surprise that would be for her  finally he sighed profoundly blew out his candle and snuggled down and in a little while he was asleep  but the next morning and at intervals afterwards he found himself thinking of annann the bright the desirable the welcoming and with an extraordinary streakiness he wanted quite badly to go and then as badly not to go over to new romney again  sitting on the leas in the afternoon he had an idea i ought to ave told er i suppose about my being engaged  ann  all sorts of dreams and impressions that had gone clean out of his mental existence came back to him changed and brought up to date to fit her altered presence he thought of how he had gone back to new romney for his christmas holidays determined to kiss her and of the awful blankness of the discovery that she had gone away  it seemed incredible now and yet not wholly incredible that he had cried real tears for herhow many years was it ago   §3  daily i should thank my maker that he did not appoint me censor of the world of men i should temper a fierce injustice with a spasmodic indecision that would prolong rather than mitigate the bitterness of the day for human dignity for all conscious human superiority i should lack the beginnings of charity for bishops prosperous schoolmasters judges and all large respectpampered souls and more especially bishops towards whom i bear an atavistic viking grudge dreaming not infrequently and with invariable zest of galleys and landings and well known living ornaments of the episcopal bench sprinting inland on twinkling gaiters before my thirsty bladeall these people i say should treat below their deserts but on the other hand for such as kipps there the exasperating indecisions would come in the judgment would be arrested at kipps everyone and everything would wait you would wait the balance would sway and sway and whenever it heeled towards an adverse decision my finger would set it swaying again kings warriors statesmen brilliant women of our first families personalities gallants panting with indignation headline humanity in general would stand undamned unheeded or be damned in the most casual manner for their importunity while my eye went about for anything possible that could be said on behalf of kipps albeit i fear nothing can save him from condemnation upon this present score that within two days he was talking to ann again  one seeks excuses overnight there had been an encounter of chitterlow and young walshingham in his presence that had certainly warped his standards they had called within a few minutes of each other and the two swayed by virile attentions to old methuselah four stars had talked against each other over and at the hospitable presence of kipps walshingham had seemed to win at the beginning but finally chitterlow had made a magnificent display of vociferation and swept him out of existence at the beginning chitterlow had opened upon the great profits of playwrights and young walshingham had capped him at once with a cynical but impressive display of knowledge of the high finance if chitterlow boasted his thousands young walshingham boasted his hundreds of thousands and was for a space left in sole possession of the stage juggling with the wealth of nations he was going on by way of financial politics to the overman before chitterlow recovered from his first check and came back to victory talking of women said chitterlow coming in abruptly upon some things not generally known beyond walshinghams more immediate circle about a recently departed empirebuilder talking of women and the way they get at a man  though as a matter of fact they had been talking of the corruption of society by speculation  upon this new topic chitterlow was soon manifestly invincible he knew so much he had known so many young walshingham did his best with epigrams and reservations but even to kipps it was evident that this was a booklearned depravity one felt walshingham had never known the inner realities of passion but chitterlow convinced and amazed he had run away with girls he had been run away with by girls he had been in love with several at a timenot counting bessiehe had loved and lost he had loved and refrained and he had loved and failed he threw remarkable lights upon the moral state of americain which country he had toured with great success he set his talk to the tune of one of mr kiplings best known songs he told an incident of simple romantic passion a delirious dream of love and beauty in a saturday to monday steamboat trip up the hudson and tagged his end with i learnt about women from er after that he adopted the refrain and then lapsed into the praises of kipling little kipling said chitterlow with the familiarity of affection he knows and broke into quotation        ive taken my fun where i found it      ive rogued and ive ranged in my time      ive ad my picking of sweetearts      an four of the lot was prime   these things i say affect the moral standards of the best of us  id have liked to have written that said chitterlow thats life that is but go and put it on the stage put even a bit of the realities of life on the stage and see what theyll do to you only kipling could venture on a job like that that poem knocked me i dont say kipling hasnt knocked me before and since but that was a fair knock out and yetyou knowtheres one thing in it  this        ive taken my fun where ive found it      and now i must pay for my fun      for the more you ave known o the others      the less will you settle to one   well in my case anyhowi dont know how much that proves seeing im exceptional in so many things and theres no good denying itbut so far as im concernedi tell you two but of course you neednt let it go any fartherive been perfectly faithful to muriel ever since i married herever since not once not even by accident have i ever said or done anything in the slightest his little brown eye became pensive after this flattering intimacy and the gorgeous draperies of his abundant voice fell into graver folds i learnt about women from er he said impressively  yes said walshingham getting into the hinder spaces of that splendid pause a man must know about women and the only sound way of learning is the experimental method  if you want to know about the experimental method my boy said chitterlow resuming  so they talked ex pede herculem as coote that cultivated polyglot would have put it and in the small hours kipps went to bed with his brain whirling with words and whiskey and sat for an unconscionable time upon his bed edge musing sadly upon the unmanly monogamy of soul that had cast its shadow upon his career musing with his thoughts pointing around more and more certainly to the possibility of at least duplicity with ann   §4  for some days he had been refraining with some insistence from going off to new romney again  i do not know if this may count in palliation of his misconduct men real strongsouled healthy men should be i suppose impervious to conversational atmospheres but i have never claimed for kipps a place at these high levels the unquenchable fact remains that the next day he spent the afternoon with ann and found no scruple in displaying himself a budding lover  he had met her in the high street had stopped her and almost on the spur of the moment had boldly proposed a walk for the sake of old times  i dont mind said ann  her consent almost frightened kipps his imagination had not carried him to that it would be a lark said kipps and looked up the street and down now he said  i dont mind a bit artie i was just going for a walk along towards st marys  lets go that way beind the church said kipps and presently they found themselves drifting seaward in a mood of pleasant commonplace for a while they talked of sid it went clean out of kipps head at that early stage even that ann was a girl according to the exposition of chitterlow and for a time he remembered only that she was ann but afterwards with the reek of that talk in his head he lapsed a little from that personal relation they came out upon the beach and sat down in a tumbled pebbly place where a meagre grass and patches of sea poppy were growing and kipps reclined on his elbow and tossed pebbles in his hand and ann sat up sunlit regarding him they talked in fragments they exhausted sid they exhausted ann and kipps was chary of his riches  he declined to a faint lovemaking i got that arf sixpence still he said  reely  that changed the key i always kept mine someow said ann and there was a pause  they spoke of how often they had thought of each other during those intervening years kipps may have been untruthful but ann perhaps was not i met people here and there said ann but i never met anyone quite like you artie  its jolly our meeting again anyhow said kipps look at that ship out there shes pretty close in  he had a dull period became indeed almost pensive and then he was enterprising for a while he tossed up his pebbles so that as if by accident they fell on anns hand then very penitently he stroked the place that would have led to all sorts of coquetries on the part of flo banks for example but it disconcerted and checked kipps to find ann made no objection smiled pleasantly down on him with eyes half shut because of the sun she was taking things very much for granted  he began to talk and chitterlow standards resuming possession of him he said he had never forgotten her  i never forgotten you either artie she said funny isnt it  it impressed kipps also as funny  he became reminiscent and suddenly a warm summers evening came back to him remember them cockchafers ann he said but the reality of the evening he recalled was not the chase of cockchafers the great reality that had suddenly arisen between them was that he had never kissed ann in his life he looked up and there were her lips  he had wanted to very badly and his memory leaped and annihilated an interval that old resolution came back to him and all sorts of new resolutions passed out of mind and he had learnt something since those boyish days this time he did not ask he went on talking his nerves began very faintly to quiver and his mind grew bright  presently having satisfied himself that there was no one to see he sat up beside her and remarked upon the clearness of the air and how close dungeness seemed to them then they came upon a pause again  ann he whispered and put an arm that quivered about her  she was mute and unresisting and as he was to remember solemn  he turned her face towards him and kissed her lips and she kissed him back againkisses frank and tender as a childs   §5  it was curious that in the retrospect he did not find nearly the satisfaction in this infidelity he had imagined was there it was no doubt desperately doggish doggish to an almost chitterlowesque degree to recline on the beach at littlestone with a girl to make love to her and to achieve the triumph of kissing her when he was engaged to another girl at folkestone but somehow these two people were not girls they were ann and helen particularly helen declined to be considered as a girl and there was something in anns quietly friendly eyes in her frank smile in the naïve pressure of her hand there was something undefended and welcoming that imparted a flavour to the business upon which he had not counted he had learnt about women from her that refrain ran through his mind and deflected his thoughts but as a matter of fact he had learnt about nothing but himself  he wanted very much to see ann some more and explain he did not clearly know what it was he wanted to explain  he did not clearly know anything it is the last achievement of the intelligence to get all of ones life into one coherent scheme and kipps was only in a measure more aware of himself as a whole than is a tree his existence was an affair of dissolving and recurring moods when he thought of helen or ann or any of his friends he thought sometimes of this aspect and sometimes of thatand often one aspect was finally incongruous with another he loved helen he revered helen he was also beginning to hate her with some intensity when he thought of that expedition to lympne profound vague beautiful emotions flooded his being when he thought of paying calls with her perforce or of her latest comment on his bearing he found himself rebelliously composing fierce and pungent insults couched in the vernacular but ann whom he had seen so much less of was a simpler memory she was pretty she was almost softly feminine and she was possible to his imagination just exactly where helen was impossible more than anything else she carried the charm of respect for him the slightest glance of her eyes was balm for his perpetually wounded selfconceit  chance suggestions it was set the tune of his thoughts and his state of health and repletion gave the colour yet somehow he had this at least almost clear in his mind that to have gone to see ann a second time to have implied that she had been in possession of his thoughts through all this interval and above all to have kissed her was shabby and wrong only unhappily this much of lucidity had come now just a few hours after it was needed   §6  four days after this it was that kipps got up so late he got up late cut his chin while shaving kicked a slipper into his sponge bath and said desh  perhaps you know those intolerable mornings dear reader when you seem to have neither the heart nor the strength to rise and your nervous adjustments are all wrong and your fingers thumbs and you hate the very birds for singing you feel inadequate to any demand whatever often such awakenings follow a poor nights rest and commonly they mean indiscriminate eating or those subtle mental influences old kipps ascribed to foozle ile in the system or worry and with kippsalbeit chitterlow had again been his guest overnightassuredly worry had played a leading rôle troubles had been gathering upon him for days there had been a sort of concentration of these hosts of midian overnight and in the grey small hours kipps had held his review  the predominating trouble marched under this banner        mr kipps                mrs bindon botting                       at home              thursday september 16th       anagrams 4 to 630            r s v p   a banner that was the facsimile of a card upon his looking glass in the room below and in relation to this terribly significant document things had come to a pass with helen that he could only describe in his own expressive idiom as words  it had long been a smouldering issue between them that kipps was not availing himself with any energy or freedom of the opportunities he had of social exercises much less was he seeking additional opportunities he had it was evident a peculiar dread of that universal afternoon enjoyment the call and helen made it unambiguously evident that this dread was silly and had to be overcome his first display of this unmanly weakness occurred at the cootes on the day before he kissed ann they were all there chatting very pleasantly when the little servant with the big cap announced the younger miss wace  whereupon kipps manifested a lively horror and rose partially from his chair o gum he protested carnt i go upstairs  then he sank back for it was too late very probably the younger miss wace had heard him as she came in  helen said nothing of that though her manner may have shown her surprise but afterwards she told kipps he must get used to seeing people and suggested that he should pay a series of calls with mrs walshingham and herself kipps gave a reluctant assent at the time and afterwards displayed a talent for evasion that she had not suspected in him at last she did succeed in securing him for a call upon miss punchafer of radnor parka particularly easy call because miss punchafer being so deaf one could say practically what one likedand then outside the gate he shirked again i cant go in he said in a faded voice  you must said helen beautiful as ever but even more than a little hard and forbidding  i cant  he produced his handkerchief hastily thrust it to his face and regarded her over it with rounded hostile eyes  possible he said in a hoarse strange voice out of the handkerchief nozzez bleedin  but that was the end of his power of resistance and when the rally for the anagram tea occurred she bore down his feeble protests altogether she insisted she said frankly i am going to give you a good talking to about this and she did  from coote he gathered something of the nature of anagrams and anagram parties an anagram coote explained was a word spelt the same way as another only differently arranged as for instance t o c o e would be an anagram for his own name coote  t o c o e repeated kipps very carefully  or t o e c o said coote  or t o e c o said kipps assisting his poor head by nodding it at each letter  toe company like he said in his efforts to comprehend  when kipps was clear what an anagram meant coote came to the second heading the tea kipps gathered there might be from thirty to sixty people present and that each one would have an anagram pinned on they give you a card to put your guesses on rather like a dance programme and then you know you go around and guess said coote its rather good fun  oo rather said kipps with simulated gusto  it shakes everybody up together said coote  kipps smiled and nodded  in the small hours all his painful meditations were threaded by the vision of that anagram tea it kept marching to and fro and in and out of all his other troubles from thirty to sixty people mostly ladies and callers and a great number of the letters of the alphabet and more particularly p i k p s and t o e c o and he was trying to make one word out of the whole interminable procession  this word as he finally gave it with some emphasis to the silence of the night was demn  then wreathed as it were in this lettered procession was the figure of helen as she had appeared at the moment of words her face a little hard a little irritated a little disappointed he imagined himself going around and guessing under her eye  he tried to think of other things without lapsing upon a still deeper uneasiness that was wreathed with yellow sea poppies and the figures of buggins pierce and carshot three murdered friendships rose reproachfully in the stillness and changed horrible apprehensions into unspeakable remorse last night had been their customary night for the banjo and kipps with a certain tremulous uncertainty had put old methuselah amidst a retinue of glasses on the table and opened a box of choice cigars in vain they were in no need it seemed of his society but instead chitterlow had come anxious to know if it was all right about that syndicate plan he had declined anything but a very weak whiskey and soda just to drink at least until business was settled and had then opened the whole affair with an effect of great orderliness to kipps soon he was taking another whiskey by sheer inadvertency and the complex fabric of his conversation was running more easily from the broad loom of his mind into that pattern had interwoven a narrative of extensive alterations in the pestered butterflythe neck and beetle business was to be restoredthe story of a grave difference of opinion with mrs chitterlow where and how to live after the play had succeeded the reasons why the hon thomas norgate had never financed a syndicate and much matter also about the syndicate now under discussion but if the current of their conversation had been vortical and crowded the outcome was perfectly clear kipps was to be the chief participator in the syndicate and his contribution was to be two thousand pounds kipps groaned and rolled over and found helen as it were on the other side promise me she had said you wont do anything without consulting me  kipps at once rolled back to his former position and for a space lay quite still he felt like a very young rabbit in a trap  then suddenly with extraordinary distinctness his heart cried out for ann and he saw her as he had seen her at new romney sitting amidst the yellow sea poppies with the sunlight on her face his heart called out for her in the darkness as one calls for rescue he knew as though he had known it always that he loved helen no more he wanted ann he wanted to hold her and be held by her to kiss her again and again to turn his back forever on all these other things  he rose late but this terrible discovery was still there undispelled by cockcrow or the day he rose in a shattered condition and he cut himself while shaving but at last he got into his diningroom and could pull the bell for the hot constituents of his multifarious breakfast and then he turned to his letters there were two real letters in addition to the customary electric belt advertisement continental lottery circular and betting touts card one was in a slight mourning envelope and addressed in an unfamiliar hand this he opened first and discovered a note                     mrs raymond wace                requests the pleasure of                      mr kipps                  company at dinner       on tuesday september 21st at 8 oclock   with a hasty movement kipps turned his mind to the second letter it was an unusually long one from his uncle and ran as follows   my dear nephew  we are considerably startled by your letter though expecting something of the sort and disposed to hope for the best if the young lady is a relation to the earl of beauprés well and good but take care you are not being imposed upon for there are many who will be glad enough to snap you up now your circumstances are alteredi waited on the old earl once while in service and he was remarkably close with his tips and suffered from corns a hasty old gent and hard to pleasei daresay he has forgotten me altogetherand anyhow there is no need to rake up bygones tomorrow is bus day and as you say the young lady is living near by we shall shut up shop for there is really nothing doing now what with all the visitors bringing everything with them down to their very childrens pails and say how de do to her and give her a bit of a kiss and encouragement if we think her suitableshe will be pleased to see your old unclewe wish we could have had a look at her first but still there is not much mischief done and hoping that all will turn out well yet i am  your affectionate uncle      edward george kipps   my heartburn still very bad i shall bring over a few bits of rhubub i picked up a sort you wont get in folkestone and if possible a good bunch of flowers for the young lady   comin over today said kipps standing helplessly with the letter in his hand  ow the juice  i carnt  kiss er  i carnt even face er  a terrible anticipation of that gathering framed itself in his minda hideous impossible disaster  his voice went up to a note of despair and its too late to telegrarf and stop em  about twenty minutes after this an outporter in castle hill avenue was accosted by a young man with a pale desperate face an exquisitely rolled umbrella and a heavy gladstone bag  carry this to the station will you said the young man i want to ketch the nex train to london youll ave to look sharpi avent very much time     chapter vii  london   §1  london was kipps third world there were no doubt other worlds but kipps knew only these three firstly new romney and the emporium constituting his primary world his world of origin which also contained ann secondly the world of culture and refinement the world of which coote was chaperon and into which kipps was presently to marry a world it was fast becoming evident absolutely incompatible with the first and thirdly a world still to a large extent unexplored london london presented itself as a place of great grey spaces and incredible multitudes of people centring about charing cross station and the royal grand hotel and containing at unexpected arbitrary points shops of the most amazing sort statuary squares restaurantswhere it was possible for clever people like walshingham to order a lunch item by item to the waiters evident respect and sympathyexhibitions of incredible thingsthe walshinghams had taken him to the arts and crafts and to a picture galleryand theatres london moreover is rendered habitable by hansom cabs young walshingham was a natural cab taker he was an allround large minded young man and he had in the course of their two days stay taken kipps into no less than nine so that kipps was singularly not afraid of these vehicles he knew that whereever you were so soon as you were thoroughly lost you said hi to a cab and then royal grand hotel day and night these trusty conveyances are returning the strayed londoner back to his point of departure and were it not for their activity in a little while the whole population so vast and incomprehensible is the intricate complexity of this great city would be hopelessly lost forever at any rate that is how the thing presented itself to kipps and i have heard much the same from visitors from america  his train was composed of corridor carriages and he forgot his trouble for a time in the wonders of this modern substitute for railway compartments he went from the nonsmoking to the smoking carriage and smoked a cigarette and strayed from his secondclass carriage to a first and back but presently black care got aboard the train and came and sat beside him the exhilaration of escape had evaporated now and he was presented with a terrible picture of his aunt and uncle arriving at his lodgings and finding him fled he had left a hasty message that he was called away suddenly on business ver important business and they were to be sumptuously entertained his immediate motive had been his passionate dread of an encounter between these excellent but unrefined old people and the walshinghams but now that end was secured he could see how thwarted and exasperated they would be  how to explain to them  he ought never to have written to tell them  he ought to have got married and told them afterwards  he ought to have consulted helen  promise me she had said  oh desh said kipps and got up and walked back into the smoking car and began to consume cigarettes  suppose after all they found out the walshinghams address and went there  at charing cross however there were distractions again he took a cab in an entirely walshingham manner and was pleased to note the enhanced respect of the cabman when he mentioned the royal grand he followed walshinghams routine on their previous visit with perfect success they were very nice in the office and gave him an excellent room at fourteen shillings the night  he went up and spent a considerable time in examining the furniture of his room scrutinising himself in its various mirrors and sitting on the edge of the bed whistling it was a vast and splendid apartment and cheap at fourteen shillings but finding the figure of ann inclined to resume possession of his mind he roused himself and descended by the staircase after a momentary hesitation before the lift he had thought of lunch but he drifted into the great drawingroom and read a guide to the hotels of europe for a space until a doubt whether he was entitled to use this palatial apartment without extra charge arose in his mind he would have liked something to eat very much now but his inbred terror of the table was very strong he did at last get by a porter in uniform towards the diningroom but at the sight of a number of waiters and tables with remarkable complications of knives and glasses terror seized him and he backed out again with a mumbled remark to the waiter in the doorway about this not being the way  he hovered in the hall and lounge until he thought the presiding porter regarded him with suspicion and then went up to his room again by the staircase got his hat and umbrella and struck boldly across the courtyard he would go to a restaurant instead  he had a moment of elation in the gateway he felt all the strand must notice him as he emerged through the great gate of the hotel one of these here rich swells they would say dont they do it just a cabman touched his hat no fear said kipps pleasantly  then he remembered he was hungry again  yet he decided he was in no great hurry for lunch in spite of an internal protest and turned eastward along the strand in a leisurely manner he tried to find a place to suit him soon enough he tried to remember the sort of things walshingham had ordered before all things he didnt want to go into a place and look like a fool some of these places rook you dreadful besides making fun of you there was a place near essex street where there was a window brightly full of chops tomatoes and lettuce he stopped at this and reflected for a time and then it occurred to him that you were expected to buy these things raw and cook them at home anyhow there was sufficient doubt in the matter to stop him he drifted on to a neat window with champagne bottles a dish of asparagus and a framed menu of a two shilling lunch he was about to enter when fortunately he perceived two waiters looking at him over the back screen of the window with a most ironical expression and he sheered off at once there was a wonderful smell of hot food half way down fleet street and a nice looking tavern with several doors but he could not decide which door his nerve was going under the strain  he hesitated at farringdon street and drifted up to st pauls and round the church yard full chiefly of dead bargains in the shop windows to cheapside but now kipps was getting demoralised and each house of refreshment seemed to promise still more complicated obstacles to food he didnt know how you went in and what was the correct thing to do with your hat he didnt know what you said to the waiter or what you called the different things he was convinced absolutely he would fumble as shalford would have said and look like a fool somebody might laugh at him the hungrier he got the more unendurable was the thought that anyone should laugh at him for a time he considered an extraordinary expedient to account for his ignorance he would go in and pretend to be a foreigner and not know english then they might understand presently he had drifted into a part of london where there did not seem to be any refreshment places at all  oh desh said kipps in a sort of agony of indecisiveness the very nex place i see in i go  the next place was a fried fish shop in a little side street where there were also sausages on a gaslit grill  he would have gone in but suddenly a new scruple came to him that he was too well dressed for the company he could see dimly through the steam sitting at the counter and eating with a sort of nonchalant speed   §2  he was half minded to resort to a hansom and brave the terrors of the diningroom of the royal grandthey wouldnt know why he had gone out reallywhen the only person he knew in london appeared as the only person one does know will do in london and slapped him on the shoulder kipps was hovering at a window at a few yards from the fish shop pretending to examine some really strikingly cheap pink baby linen and trying to settle finally about those sausages  hullo kipps cried sid spending the millions  kipps turned and was glad to perceive no lingering vestige of the chagrin that had been so painful at new romney sid looked grave and important and he wore a quite new silk hat that gave a commercial touch to a generally socialistic costume for a moment the sight of sid uplifted kipps wonderfully he saw him as a friend and helper and only presently did it come clearly into his mind that this was the brother of ann  he made amiable noises  ive just been up this way sid explained buying a secondhand namelling stove im going to namel myself  lor said kipps  yes do me a lot of good let the customer choose his colour see what brings you up  kipps had a momentary vision of his foiled uncle and aunt jest a bit of a change he said  sid came to a swift decision come down to my little show i got someone id like to see talking to you  even then kipps did not think of ann in this connection  well he said trying to invent an excuse on the spur of the moment fact is he explained i was jest looking round to get a bit of lunch  dinner we call it said sid but thats all right you cant get anything to eat hereabout if youre not too haughty to do a bit of slumming theres some mutton spoiling for me now  the word mutton affected kipps greatly  it wont take us arf an hour said sid and kipps was carried  he discovered another means of london locomotion in the underground railway and recovered his selfpossession in that interest you dont mind going third asked sid and kipps said nort a bit of it they were silent in the train for a time on account of strangers in the carriage and then sid began to explain who it was that he wanted kipps to meet its a chap named mastermando you no end of good  he occupies our first floor front room you know it isnt so much for gain i let as company we dont want the whole ouse and another i knew the man before met him at our sociological and after a bit he said he wasnt comfortable where he was thats how it came about hes a firstclass chapfirstclass science you should see his books  properly hes a sort of journalist hes written a lot of things but hes been too ill lately to do very much poetry hes written all sorts he writes for the commonweal sometimes and sometimes he reviews books es got eaps of bookseaps besides selling a lot  he knows a regular lot of people and all sorts of things hes been a dentist and hes a qualified chemist an i seen him often reading german and french taught imself he was here  sid indicated south kensington which had come opportunely outside the carriage windows with a nod of his head three years studying science but youll see im when he really gets to talkinghe pours it out  ah said kipps nodding sympathetically with his two hands on his umbrella knob  hell do big things some day said sid hes written a book on science already physiography its called elementary physiography some day hell write an advancedwhen he gets time  he let this soak into kipps  i cant introduce you to lords and swells he went on but i can show you a famous man thats going to be i can do that leastwaysunless  sid hesitated  hes got a frightful cough he said  he wont care to talk with me weighed kipps  thats all right he wont mind hes fond of talking hed talk to anyone said sid reassuringly and added a perplexing bit of londonized latin he doesnt pute anything non alienum you know  i know said kipps intelligently over his umbrella knob though of course that was altogether untrue   §3  kipps found sids shop a practical looking establishment stocked with the most remarkable collection of bicycles and pieces of bicycle that he had ever beheld my hiring stock said sid with a wave to this ironmongery and theres the best machine at a democratic price in london the redflag built by me see  he indicated a graceful greybrown framework in the window and theres my stock of accessoriesstore prices  go in for motors a bit added sid  mutton said kipps not hearing him distinctly  motors i said owever mutton department ere and he opened a door that had a curtain guarded window in its upper panel to reveal a little room with red walls and green furniture with a white clothed table and the generous promise of a meal fanny he shouted heres art kipps  a brighteyed young woman of five or six and twenty in a pink print appeared a little flushed from cooking and wiped a hand on an apron and shook hands and smiled and said it would all be ready in a minute she went on to say she had heard of kipps and his luck and meanwhile sid vanished to draw the beer and returned with two glasses for himself and kipps  drink that said sid and kipps felt all the better for it  i give mr masterman is upstairs a hour ago said mrs sid i didnt think e ought to wait  a rapid succession of brisk movements on the part of everyone and they were all four at dinnerthe fourth person being master walt whitman pornick a cheerful young gentleman of one and a half who was given a spoon to hammer on the table with to keep him quiet and who got kipps right at the first effort and kept it all through the meal combining it first with this previous acquisition and then that peacock kipps said master walt at which there was great laughter and also more mutton kipps  hes a regular oner said mrs sid for catching up words you cant say a word but what es on to it  there were no serviettes and less ceremony and kipps thought he had never enjoyed a meal so much everyone was a little excited by the meeting and chatting and disposed to laugh and things went off easily from the very beginning if there was a pause master walt filled it in mrs sid who tempered her enormous admiration for sids intellect and his socialism and his severe business methods by a motherly sense of her sex and seniority spoke of them both as you boys and dilatedwhen she was not urging kipps to have some more of this or thaton the disparity between herself and her husband  shouldnt ha thought there was a year between you said kipps you seem jest a match  im his match anyhow said mrs sid and no epigram of young walshinghams was ever better received  match said young walt coming in on the trail of the joke and getting a round for himself  any sense of superior fortune had long vanished from kipps mind and he found himself looking at host and hostess with enormous respect really old sid was a wonderful chap here in his own house at two and twenty carving his own mutton and lording it over wife and child no legacies needed by him and mrs sid so kind and bright and hearty and the child old sids child old sid had jumped round a bit it needed the sense of his fortune at the back of his mind to keep kipps from feeling abject he resolved hed buy young walt something tremendous in toys at the first opportunity  drop more beer art  right you are old man  cut mr kipps a bit more bread sid  cant i pass you a bit  sid was all right sid was and there was no mistake about that  it was growing up in his mind that sid was the brother of ann but he said nothing about her for excellent reasons after all because he remembered sids irritation at her name when they had met in new romney seemed to show a certain separation they didnt tell each other much he didnt know how things might be between ann and sid either  still for all that sid was anns brother  the furniture of the room did not assert itself very much above the cheerful business at the table but kipps was impressed with the idea that it was pretty there was a dresser at the end with a number of gay plates and a mug or so a labour day poster by walter crane on the wall and through the glass and over the blind of the shop door one had a glimpse of the bright coloured advertisement cards of bicycle dealers and a shelfful of boxes labelled the paragon bell the scarum bell and the patent omi horn  it seemed incredible that he had been in folkestone that morning and even now his aunt and uncle  brrr it didnt do to think of his aunt and uncle   §4  when sid repeated his invitation to come and see masterman kipps now flushed with beer and irish stew said he didnt mind if he did and after a preliminary shout from sid that was answered by a voice and a cough the two went upstairs  mastermans a rare one said sid over his arm and in an undertone you should hear him speak at a meeting if hes in form that is  he rapped and went into a large untidy room  this is kipps he said you know the chap i told you of with twelve undred a year  masterman sat gnawing at an empty pipe and as close to the fire as though it was alight and the season midwinter kipps concentrated upon him for a space and only later took in something of the frowsy furniture the little bed half behind and evidently supposed to be wholly behind a careless screen the spittoon by the fender the remains of a dinner on the chest of drawers and the scattered books and papers mastermans face showed him a man of forty or more with curious hollows at the side of his forehead and about his eyes his eyes were very bright there was a spot of red in his cheeks and the wiry black moustache under his short red nose had been trimmed with scissors into a sort of brush along his upper lip his teeth were darkened ruins his jacket collar was turned up about a knitted white neck wrap and his sleeves betrayed no cuffs he did not rise to greet kipps but held out a thin wristed hand and pointed with the other to a bedroom arm chair  glad to see you he said sit down and make yourself at home will you smoke  kipps said he would and produced his store he was about to take one and then with a civil afterthought handed the packet first to masterman and sid masterman pretended surprise to find his pipe out before he took one there was an interlude of matches sid pushed the end of the screen out of his way sat down on the bed thus frankly admitted and prepared with a certain quiet satisfaction of manner to witness mastermans treatment of kipps  and how does it feel to have twelve hundred a year asked masterman holding his cigarette to his nose tip in a curious manner  its rum confided kipps after a reflective interval it feels juiced rum  i never felt it said masterman  it takes a bit of getting into said kipps i can tell you that  masterman smoked and regarded kipps with curious eyes  i expect it does he said presently  and has it made you perfectly happy he asked abruptly  i couldnt ardly say that said kipps  masterman smiled no he said has it made you much happier  it did at first  yes but you got used to it how long for example did the real delirious excitement last  oo that perhaps a week said kipps  masterman nodded his head thats what discourages me from amassing wealth he said to sid you adjust yourself it doesnt last ive always had an inkling of that and its interesting to get it confirmed i shall go on sponging for a bit longer on you i think  you dont said sid no fear  twentyfour thousand pounds said masterman and blew a cloud of smoke lord doesnt it worry you  it is a bit worrying at times things appen  going to marry  yes  hm lady i guess of a superior social position  rather said kipps cousin to the earl of beauprés  masterman readjusted his long body with an air of having accumulated all the facts he needed he snuggled his shoulderblades down into the chair and raised his angular knees i doubt he said flicking cigarette ash into the atmosphere if any great gain or loss of money doesas things are at presentmake more than the slightest difference in ones happiness it ought toif money was what it ought to be the token for given service one ought to get an increase in power and happiness for every pound one got but the plain fact is the times are out of joint and moneymoney like everything else is a deception and a disappointment  he turned his face to kipps and enforced his next words with the index finger of his lean lank hand if i thought otherwise he said i should exert myself to get some but if one sees things clearly one is so discouraged so confoundedly discouraged when you first got your money you thought that it meant you might buy just anything you fancied  i was a bit that way said kipps  and you found that you couldnt you found that for all sorts of things it was a question of where to buy and how to buy and what you didnt know how to buy with your money straight away this world planted something else upon you  i got rather done over a banjo first day said kipps leastways my uncle says  exactly said masterman  sid began to speak from the bed thats all very well masterman he said but after all money is power you know you can do all sorts of things  im talking of happiness said masterman you can do all sorts of things with a loaded gun in the hammersmith broadway but nothingpracticallythat will make you or any one else very happy nothing powers a different matter altogether as for happiness you want a world in order before money or property or any of those things that have any real value and this world i tell you is hopelessly out of joint man is a social animal with a mind nowadays that goes around the globe and a community cannot be happy in one part and unhappy in another its all or nothing no patching any more for ever it is the standing mistake of the world not to understand that consequently people think there is a class or order somewhere just above them or just below them or a country or place somewhere that is really safe and happy the fact is society is one body and it is either well or ill thats the law this society we live in is ill its a fractious feverish invalid gouty greedy and illnourished you cant have a happy left leg with neuralgia or a happy throat with a broken leg thats my position and thats the knowledge youll come to im so satisfied of it that i sit here and wait for my end quite calmly sure that i cant better things by botheringin my time and so far as i am concerned that is im not even greedy any moremy egotisms at the bottom of a pond with a philosophical brick around its neck the world is ill my time is short and my strength is small im as happy here as anywhere  he coughed and was silent for a moment then brought the index finger around to kipps again youve had the opportunity of sampling two grades of society and you dont find the new people youre among much better or any happier than the old  no said kipps reflectively no i avent seen it quite like that before but no theyre not  and you might go all up the scale and down the scale and find the same thing mans a gregarious beast a gregarious beast and no money will buy you out of your own timeany more than out of your own skill all the way up and all the way down the scale theres the same discontent no one is quite sure where they stand and everyones fretting the herds uneasy and feverish all the old tradition goes or has gone and theres no one to make a new tradition where are your nobles now where are your gentlemen they vanished directly the peasant found out he wasnt happy and ceased to be a peasant theres big men and little men mixed up together thats all none of us know where we are your cads in a bank holiday train and your cads on a two thousand pound motor except for a difference in scale theres not a pin to choose between them your smart society is as low and vulgar and uncomfortable for a balanced soul as a gin palace no more and no less theres no place or level of honour or fine living left in the world so whats the good of climbing  ear ear said sid  its true said kipps  i dont climb said masterman and accepted kipps silent offer of another cigarette  no he said this world is out of joint its broken up and i doubt if it will heal i doubt very much if itll heal were in the beginning of the sickness of the world  he rolled his cigarette in his lean fingers and repeated with satisfaction the sickness of the world  its weve got to make it better said sid and looked at kipps  ah sids an optimist said masterman  so are you most times said sid  kipps lit another cigarette with an air of intelligent participation  frankly said masterman recrossing his legs and expelling a jet of smoke luxuriously frankly i think this civilisation of ours is on the topple  theres socialism said sid  theres no imagination to make use of it  weve got to make one said sid  in a couple of centuries perhaps said masterman but meanwhile were going to have a pretty acute attack of confusion universal confusion like one of those crushes when men are killed and maimed for no reason at all going into a meeting or crowding for a train commercial and industrial stresses political exploitation tariff wars revolutions all the bloodshed that will come of some fools calling half the white world yellow these things alter the attitude of everybody to everybody everybodys going to feel em every fool in the world panting and shoving were all going to be as happy and comfortable as a household during a removal what else can we expect  kipps was moved to speak but not in answer to mastermans enquiry ive never rightly got the eng of this socialism he said whats it going to do like  they had been imagining that he had some elementary idea in the matter but as soon as he had made it clear that he hadnt sid plunged at exposition and in a little while masterman abandoning his pose of the detached man ready to die joined in at first he joined in only to correct sids version but afterwards he took control his manner changed he sat up and rested his elbow on his knees and his cheek flushed a little he expanded his case against property and the property class with such vigour that kipps was completely carried away and never thought of asking for a clear vision of the thing that would fill the void this abolition might create for a time he quite forgot his own private opulence and it was as if something had been lit in masterman his languor passed he enforced his words by gestures of his long thin hands and as he passed swiftly from point to point of his argument it was evident he grew angry  today he said the world is ruled by rich men they may do almost anything they like with the world and what are they doing laying it waste  hear hear said sid very sternly  masterman stood up gaunt and long thrust his hands in his pockets and turned his back to the fireplace  collectively the rich today have neither heart nor imagination no they own machinery they have knowledge and instruments and powers beyond all previous dreaming and what are they doing with them think what they are doing with them kipps and think what they might do god gives them a power like the motor car and all they can do with it is to go careering about the roads in goggled masks killing children and making machinery hateful to the soul of man true said sid true god gives them means of communication power unparalleled of every sort time and absolute liberty they waste it all in folly here under their feet and kipps eyes followed the direction of a lean index finger to the hearthrug under their accursed wheels the great mass of men festers and breeds in darkness darkness those others make by standing in the light the darkness breeds and breeds it knows no better unless you can crawl or pander or rob you must stay in the stew you are born in and those rich beasts above claw and clutch as though they had nothing they grudge us our schools they grudge us a gleam of light and air they cheat us and then seek to forget us there is no rule no guidance only accidents and happy flukes our multitudes of poverty increase and this crew of rulers makes no provision foresees nothing anticipates nothing  he paused and made a step and stood over kipps in a white heat of anger kipps nodded in a noncommital manner and looked hard and rather gloomily at his hosts slipper as he talked  it isnt as though they had something to show for the waste they make of us kipps they havent they are ugly and cowardly and mean look at their women painted dyed and drugged hiding their ugly shapes under a load of dress there isnt a woman in the swim of society at the present time wouldnt sell herself body and soul who wouldnt lick the boots of a jew or marry a nigger rather than live decently on a hundred a year on what would be wealth for you and me they know it they know we know it no one believes in them no one believes in nobility any more nobody believes in kingship any more nobody believes there is justice in the law but people have habits people go on in the old grooves as long as theres work as long as theres weekly money it wont last kipps  he coughed and paused wait for the lean years he cried wait for the lean years and suddenly he fell into a struggle with his cough and spat a gout of blood its nothing he said to kipps note of startled horror  he went on talking and the protests of his cough interlaced with his words and sid beamed in an ecstasy of painful admiration  look at the fraud they have let life become the miserable mockery of the hope of ones youth what have i had i found myself at thirteen being forced into a factory like a rabbit into a chloroformed box thirteenwhen their children are babies but even a child of that age could see what it meant that hell of a factory monotony and toil and contempt and dishonour and then death so i foughtat thirteen  mintons crawling up a drain pipe until you die echoed in kipps mind but masterman instead of mintons growl spoke in a high indignant tenor  i got out at lastsomehow he said quietly suddenly plumping back in his chair he went on after a pause for a bit some of us get out by luck some by cunning and crawl on to the grass exhausted and crippled to die thats a poor mans success kipps most of us dont get out at all i worked all day and studied half the night and here i am with the common consequences beaten and never once have i had a fair chance never once his lean clenched fist flew out in a gust of tremulous anger these skunks shut up all the university scholarships at nineteen for fear of men like me and thendo nothin were wasted for nothing by the time id learnt something the doors were locked i thought knowledge would do iti did think that ive fought for knowledge as other men fight for bread ive starved for knowledge ive turned my back on women ive done even that ive burst my accursed lung his voice rose with impotent anger im a better man than any ten princes alive and im beaten and wasted ive been crushed trampled and defiled by a drove of hogs im no use to myself or the world ive thrown my life away to make myself too good for use in this hucksters scramble if i had gone in for business if i had gone in for plotting to cheat my fellow menah well its too late its too late for that anyhow its too late for anything now and i couldnt have done it and over in new york now theres a pet of society making a corner in wheat  by god he cried hoarsely with a clutch of the lean hand by god if i had his throat even now i might do something for the world  he glared at kipps his face flushed deep his sunken eyes glowing with passion and then suddenly he changed altogether  there was a sound of tea things rattling upon a tray outside the door and sid rose to open it  all of which amounts to this said masterman suddenly quiet and again talking against time the world is out of joint and there isnt a soul alive who isnt half waste or more youll find it the same with you in the end wherever your luck may take you i suppose you wont mind my having another cigarette  he took kipps cigarette with a hand that trembled so violently it almost missed its object and stood up with something of guilt in his manner as mrs sid came into the room  her eye met his and marked the flush upon his face  been talking socialism said mrs sid a little severely   §5  six oclock that day found kipps drifting eastward along the southward margin of rotten row you figure him a small respectably attired figure going slowly through a sometimes immensely difficult and always immense world at times he becomes pensive and whistles softly at times he looks about him there are a few riders in the row a carriage flashes by every now and then along the roadway and among the great rhododendrons and laurels and upon the greensward there are a few groups and isolated people dressed in the style kipps adopted to call upon the walshinghams when first he was engaged amid the complicated confusion of kipps mind was a regret that he had not worn his other things  presently he perceived that he would like to sit down a green chair tempted him he hesitated at it took possession of it and leant back and crossed one leg over the other  he rubbed his under lip with his umbrella handle and reflected upon masterman and his denunciation of the world  bit orf is ead poor chap said kipps and added i wonder  he thought intently for a space  i wonder what he meant by the lean years  the world seemed a very solid and prosperous concern just here and well out of reach of mastermans dying clutch and yet  it was curious he should have been reminded of minton  his mind turned to a far more important matter just at the end sid had said to him seen ann and as he was about to answer youll see a bit more of her now shes got a place in folkestone  it had brought him back from any concern about the world being out of joint or anything of that sort  ann  one might run against her any day  he tugged at his little moustache  he would like to run against ann very much  and it would be juiced awkward if i did  in folkestone it was a jolly sight too close  then at the thought that he might run against ann in his beautiful evening dress on the way to the band he fluttered into a momentary dream that jumped abruptly into a nightmare  suppose he met her when he was out with helen oh lor said kipps life had developed a new complication that would go on and go on for some time he wished with the utmost fervour that he had not kissed ann that he had not gone to new romney the second time he marvelled at his amazing forgetfulness of helen on that occasion helen took possession of his mind he would have to write to helen an easy offhand letter to say that he had come to london for a day or so he tried to imagine her reading it he would write just such another letter to the old people and say he had had to come up on business that might do for them all right but helen was different she would insist on explanations  he wished he could never go back to folkestone again that would settle the whole affair  a passing group attracted his attention two faultlessly dressed gentlemen and a radiantly expensive lady they were talking no doubt very brilliantly his eyes followed them the lady tapped the arm of the left hand gentleman with a daintily tinted glove swells no end  his soul looked out upon life in general as a very small nestling might peep out of its nest what an extraordinary thing life was to be sure and what a remarkable variety of people there were in it  he lit a cigarette and speculated upon that receding group of three and blew smoke and watched them they seemed to do it all right probably they all had incomes of very much over twelve hundred a year perhaps not probably none of them suspected as they went past that he too was a gentleman of independent means dressed as he was without distinction of course things were easier for them they were brought up always to dress well and do the right thing from their very earliest years they started clear of all his perplexities they had never got mixed up with all sorts of different people who didnt go together if for example that lady there got engaged to that gentleman she would be quite safe from any encounter from a corpulent osculatory uncle or chitterlow or the dangerously insignificant eye of pierce  his thoughts came round to helen  when they were married and cuyps or cuypcoote had failed to justify his sand in that west end flat and shaken free of all these low class associations would he and she parade here of an afternoon dressed like that it would be rather fine to do so if ones dress was all right  helen  she was difficult to understand at times  he blew extensive clouds of cigarette smoke  there would be teas there would be dinners there would be calls of course he would get into the way of it  but anagrams were a bit stiff to begin with  it was beastly confusing at first to know when to use your fork at dinner and all that still  he felt an extraordinary doubt whether he would get into the way of it he was interested for a space by a girl and groom on horseback and then he came back to his personal preoccupations  he would have to write to helen what could he say to explain his absence from the anagram tea she had been pretty clear she wanted him to come he recalled her resolute face without any great tenderness he knew he would look like a silly ass at that confounded tea suppose he shirked it and went back in time for the dinner dinners were beastly difficult too but not as bad as anagrams the very first thing that might happen when he got back to folkestone would be to run against ann suppose after all he did meet ann when he was with helen  what queer encounters were possible in the world  thank goodness they were going to live in london  but that brought him around to chitterlow the chitterlows were coming to london too if they didnt get money theyd come after it they werent the sort of people to be choked off easily and if they did theyd come to london to produce their play he tried to imagine some seemly social occasion invaded by chitterlow and his rhetoric by his torrential thunder of selfassertion the whole company flattened thereunder like wheat under a hurricane  confound and hang chitterlow yet somehow somewhen one would have to settle accounts with him and there was sid sid was anns brother he realised with sudden horror the social indiscretion of accepting sids invitation to dinner  sid wasnt the sort of chap one could snub or cut and besidesanns brother he didnt want to cut him it would be worse than cutting buggins and piercea sight worse and after that lunch  it would be the next thing to cutting ann herself and even as to ann  suppose he was with helen or coote  oh blow he said at last and then viciously blow and so rose and flung away his cigarette end and pursued his reluctant dubiating way towards the really quite uncongenial splendours of the royal grand  and it is vulgarly imagined that to have money is to have no troubles at all   §6  kipps endured splendour at the royal grand hotel for three nights and days and then he retreated in disorder the royal grand defeated and overcame and routed kipps not of intention but by sheer royal grandeur grandeur combined with an organisation for his comfort carried to excess on his return he came upon a difficulty he had lost his circular piece of cardboard with the number of his room and he drifted about the hall and passages in a state of perplexity for some time until he thought all the porters and officials in gold lace caps must be watching him and jesting to one another about him finally in a quiet corner down below the hairdressers shop he found a kindly looking personage in bottle green to whom he broached his difficulty i say he said with a pleasant smile i cant find my room nohow the personage in bottle green instead of laughing in a nasty way as he might well have done became extremely helpful showed kipps what to do got his key and conducted him by lift and passage to his chamber kipps tipped him half a crown  safe in his room kipps pulled himself together for dinner he had learnt enough from young walshingham to bring his dress clothes and now he began to assume them unfortunately in the excitement of his flight from his aunt and uncle he had forgotten to put in his other boots and he was some time deciding between his purple cloth slippers with a golden marigold and the prospect of cleaning the boots he was wearing with the towel but finally being a little footsore he took the slippers  afterwards when he saw the porters and waiters and the other guests catch a sight of the slippers he was sorry he had not chosen the boots however to make up for any want of style at that end he had his crush hat under his arm  he found the diningroom without excessive trouble it was a vast and splendidly decorated place and a number of people evidently quite au fait were dining there at little tables lit with electric red shaded candles gentlemen in evening dress and ladies with dazzling astonishing necks kipps had never seen evening dress in full vigour before and he doubted his eyes and there were also people not in evening dress who no doubt wondered what noble family kipps represented there was a band in a decorated recess and the band looked collectively at the purple slippers and so lost any chance they may have had of a collection so far as kipps was concerned the chief drawback to this magnificent place was the excessive space of floor that had to be crossed before you got your purple slippers hid in under a table  he selected a little tablenot the one where a rather impudent looking waiter held a chair but anothersat down and finding his gibus in his hand decided after a moment of thought to rise slightly and sit on it it was discovered in his abandoned chair at a late hour by a supper party and restored to him next day  he put the napkin carefully on one side selected his soup without difficulty clear please but he was rather floored by the presentation of a quite splendidly bound wine card he turned it over discovered a section devoted to whiskey and had a bright idea  ere he said to the waiter with an encouraging movement of his head and then in a confidential manner you havent any old methuselah three stars ave you  the waiter went away to enquire and kipps went on with his soup with an enhanced selfrespect finally old methuselah being unobtainable he ordered a claret from about the middle of the list lets ave some of this he said he knew claret was a good sort of wine  a half bottle said the waiter  right you are said kipps  he felt he was getting on he leant back after his soup a man of the world and then slowly brought his eyes around to the ladies in evening dress on his right  he couldnt have thought it  they were scorchers jest a bit of black velvet over the shoulders  he looked again one of them was laughing with a glass of wine half raisedwickedlooking woman she wasthe other the black velvet one was eating bits of bread with nervous quickness and talking fast  he wished old buggins could see them  he found a waiter regarding him and blushed deeply he did not look again for some time and became confused about his knife and fork over the fish presently he remarked a lady in pink to the left of him eating the fish with an entirely different implement  it was over the vol au vent that he began to go to pieces he took a knife to it then saw the lady in pink was using a fork only and hastily put down his knife with a considerable amount of rich creaminess on the blade upon the cloth then he found that a fork in his inexperienced hand was an instrument of chase rather than capture his ears became violently red and then he looked up to discover the lady in pink glancing at him and then smiling as she spoke to the man beside her  he hated the lady in pink very much  he stabbed a large piece of the vol au vent at last and was too glad of his luck not to take a mouthful of it but it was an extensive fragment and pieces escaped him shirt front desh it he said and had resort to his spoon his waiter went and spoke to two other waiters no doubt jeering at him he became very fierce suddenly ere he said gesticulating and then clear this away  the entire dinner party on his right the party of the ladies in advanced evening dress looked at him he felt that everyone was watching him and making fun of him and the injustice of this angered him after all they had every advantage he hadnt and then when they got him there doing his best what must they do but glance and sneer and nudge one another he tried to catch them at it and then took refuge in a second glass of wine  suddenly and extraordinarily he found himself a socialist he did not care how close it was to the lean years when all these things would end  mutton came with peas he arrested the hand of the waiter no peas he said he knew something of the difficulty and danger of eating peas then when the peas went away again he was embittered again echoes of mastermans burning rhetoric began to reverberate in his mind nice lot of people these were to laugh at anyone women half undressed it was that made him so beastly uncomfortable how could one eat ones dinner with people about him like that nice lot they were he was glad he wasnt one of them anyhow yes they might look he resolved if they looked at him again he would ask one of the men who he was staring at his perturbed and angry face would have concerned anyone the band by an unfortunate accident was playing truculent military music the mental change kipps underwent was in its way what psychologists call a conversion in a few moments all kipps ideals were changed he who had been practically a gentleman the sedulous pupil of coote the punctilious raiser of hats was instantly a rebel an outcast the hater of everything stuck up the foe of society and the social order of today here they were among the profits of their robbery these people who might do anything with the world  no thenks he said to a dish  he addressed a scornful eye at the shoulders of the lady to his left  presently he was refusing another dish he didnt like itfussed up food probably cooked by some foreigner he finished up his wine and his bread  no thenks  no thenks  he discovered the eye of a diner fixed curiously upon his flushed face he responded with a glare couldnt he go without things if he liked  whats this said kipps to a great green cone  ice said the waiter  ill ave some said kipps  he seized a fork and spoon and assailed the bombe it cut rather stiffly come up said kipps with concentrated bitterness and the truncated summit of the bombe flew off suddenly travelling eastward with remarkable velocity flop it went upon the floor a yard away and for awhile time seemed empty  at the adjacent table they were laughing together  shy the rest of the bombe at them  flight  at any rate a dignified withdrawal  no said kipps no more arresting the polite attempt of the waiter to serve him with another piece he had a vague idea he might carry off the affair as though he had meant the ice to go on the floornot liking ice for example and being annoyed at the badness of his dinner he put both hands on the table thrust back his chair disengaged a purple slipper from his napkin and rose he stepped carefully over the prostrate ice kicked the napkin under the table thrust his hands deep into his pockets and marched outshaking the dust of the place as it were from his feet he left behind him a melting fragment of ice upon the floor his gibus hat warm and compressed in his chair and in addition every social ambition he had ever entertained in the world   §7  kipps went back to folkestone in time for the anagram tea but you must not imagine that the change of heart that came to him in the diningroom of the royal grand hotel involved any change of attitude toward this promised social and intellectual treat he went back because the royal grand was too much for him  outwardly calm or at most a little flushed and ruffled inwardly kipps was a horrible tormented battleground of scruples doubts shames and selfassertions during that three days of silent desperate grappling with the big hotel he did not intend the monstrosity should beat him without a struggle but at last he had sullenly to admit himself overcome the odds were terrific on the one hand himselfwith among other things only one pair of boots on the other a vast wilderness of rooms covering several acres and with over a thousand people staff and visitors all chiefly occupied in looking queerly at kipps in laughing at him behind his back in watching for difficult corners at which to confront and perplex him and inflict humiliations upon him for example the hotel scored over its electric light after the dinner the chambermaid a hard unsympathetic young woman with a superior manner was summoned by a bell kipps had rung under the impression the button was the electric light switch look ere said kipps rubbing a shin that had suffered during his search in the dark why arent there any candles or matches the hotel explained and scored heavily  it isnt everyone is up to these things said kipps  no it isnt said the chambermaid with illconcealed scorn and slammed the door at him  spose i ought to have tipped her said kipps  after that kipps cleaned his boots with a pockethandkerchief and went for a long walk and got home in a hansom but the hotel scored again by his not putting out his boots and so having to clean them again in the morning the hotel also snubbed him by bringing him hot water when he was fully dressed and looking surprised at his collar but he got a breakfast i must admit with scarcely any difficulty  after that the hotel scored heavily by the fact that there are twentyfour hours in the day and kipps had nothing to do in any of them he was a little footsore from his previous days pedestrianism and he could make up his mind for no long excursions he flitted in and out of the hotel several times and it was the polite porter who touched his hat every time that first set kipps tipping  what e wants is a tip said kipps  so at the next opportunity he gave the man an unexpected shilling and having once put his hand in his pocket there was no reason why he should not go on he bought a newspaper at the bookstall and tipped the boy the rest of the shilling and then went up by the lift and tipped the man a sixpence leaving his newspaper inadvertently in the lift he met his chambermaid in the passage and gave her half a crown he resolved to demonstrate his position to the entire establishment in this way he didnt like the place he disapproved of it politically socially morally but he resolved no taint of meanness should disfigure his sojourn in its luxurious halls he went down by the lift tipping again and being accosted by a waiter with his gibus tipped the finder half a crown he had a vague sense that he was making a flank movement upon the hotel and buying over its staff they would regard him as a character they would get to like him he found his stock of small silver diminishing and replenished it at a desk in the hall he tipped a man in bottle green who looked like the man who had shown him his room the day before and then he saw a visitor eyeing him and doubted whether he was in this instance doing right finally he went out and took chance buses to their destinations and wandered a little in remote wonderful suburbs and returned he lunched at a chop house in islington and found himself back in the royal grand now unmistakably footsore and london weary about three he was drawn towards the drawingroom by a neat placard about afternoon tea  it occurred to him that the campaign of tipping upon which he had embarked was perhaps after all a mistake he was confirmed in this by observing that the hotel officials were watching him not respectfully but with a sort of amused wonder as if to see whom he would tip next however if he backed out now they would think him an awful fool everyone wasnt so rich as he was it was his way to tip still  he grew more certain the hotel had scored again  he pretended to be lost in thought and so drifted by and having put hat and umbrella in the cloakroom went into the drawingroom for afternoon tea  there he did get what for a time he held to be a point in his favour the room was large and quiet at first and he sat back restfully until it occurred to him that his attitude brought his extremely dusty boots too prominently into the light so instead he sat up and then people of the upper and upper middle classes began to come and group themselves about him and have tea likewise and so revive the class animosities of the previous day  presently a fluffy fairhaired lady came into prominent existence a few yards away she was talking to a respectful lowvoiced clergyman whom she was possibly entertaining at tea no she said dear lady jane wouldnt like that  mumble mumble mumble from the clergyman  poor dear lady jane was always so sensitive the voice of the lady sang out clear and emphatic  a fat hairless importantlooking man joined this group took a chair and planted it firmly with its back in the face of kipps a thing that offended kipps mightily are you telling him gurgled the fat hairless man about dear lady janes affliction a young couple lady brilliantly attired and the man in a magnificently cut frock coat arranged themselves to the right also with an air of exclusion towards kipps ive told him said the gentleman in a flat abundant voice my said the young lady with an american smile no doubt they all thought kipps was out of it a great desire to assert himself in some way surged up in his heart he felt he would like to cut in on the conversation in some dramatic way a monologue something in the manner of masterman at any rate abandoning that as impossible he would like to appear selfcentred and at ease his eyes wandering over the black surfaces of a noble architectural mass close by discovered a slotan enamelled plaque of directions  it was some sort of musical box as a matter of fact it was the very best sort of harmonicon and specially made to the scale of the hotel  he scrutinised the plaque with his head at various angles and glanced about him at his neighbours  it occurred to kipps that he would like some music that to inaugurate some would show him a man of taste and at his ease at the same time he rose read over a list of tunes selected one haphazard pressed his sixpenceit was sixpencehome and prepared for a confidential refined little melody  considering the high social tone of the royal grand it was really a very loud instrument indeed it gave vent to three deafening brays and so burst the dam of silence that had long pent it in it seemed to be chiefly full of the greatuncles of trumpets megalotrombones and railway brakes it made sounds like shunting trains it did not so much begin as blow up your counterscarp or rush forward to storm under cover of melodious shrapnel it had not so much an air as a ricochette the music had in short the inimitable quality of sousa it swept down upon the friend of lady jane and carried away something socially striking into the eternal night of the unheard the american girl to the left of it was borne shrieking into the inaudible high cockalorum tootletootle tootle loo high cockalorum tootle lootle loo bump bump bumpbump joyous exorbitant music it was from the gigantic nursery of the future bearing the hearer along upon its torrential succession of sounds as if he was in a cask on niagara whiroo yah and have at you the strenuous life yaha stop a reprieve a reprieve no bang bump  everybody looked around conversation ceased and gave place to gestures  the friend of lady jane became terribly agitated  cant it be stopped she vociferated pointing a gloved finger and saying something to the waiter about that dreadful young man  ought not to be working said the clerical friend of lady jane  the waiter shook his head at the fat hairless gentleman people began to move away kipps leant back luxurious and then tipped with a half crown to pay he paid tipped like a gentleman rose with an easy gesture and strolled towards the door his retreat evidently completed the indignation of the friend of lady jane and from the door he could still discern her gestures as asking cant it be stopped the music followed him into the passage and pursued him to the lift and only died away completely in the quiet of his own room and afterwards from his window he saw the friend of lady jane and her party having their tea carried out to a little table in the court bump bump bump bump floated up to him and certainly that was a point to him but it was his only score all the rest of the game lay in the hands of the upper classes and the big hotel and presently he was doubting whether even this was really a point it seemed a trifle vulgar come to think it over to interrupt people when they were talking  he saw a clerk peering at him from the office and suddenly it occurred to him that the place might get back at him tremendously over the bill  they would probably take it out of him by charging pounds and pounds  suppose they charged more than he had  the clerk had a particularly nasty face just the face to take advantage of a vacillating kipps  he became aware of a man in a cap touching it and produced his shilling automatically but the strain was beginning to tell it was a deuce and all of an expensethis tipping  if the hotel chose to stick it on to the bill something tremendous what was kipps to do refuse to pay make a row  if he did he couldnt fight all these men in bottle green  he went out about seven and walked for a long time and dined at last upon a chop in the euston road then he walked along to the edgeware road and sat and rested in the metropolitan music hall for a time until a trapeze performance unnerved him and finally he came back to bed he tipped the lift man sixpence and wished him goodnight in the silent watches of the night he reviewed the tale of the days tipping went over the horrors of the previous nights dinner and heard again the triumphant bray of the harmonicon devil released from its long imprisonment everyone would be told about him tomorrow he couldnt go on he admitted his defeat never in their whole lives had any of these people seen such a fool as he ugh  his method of announcing his withdrawal to the clerk was touched with bitterness  im going to get out of this said kipps blowing windily lets see what you got on my bill  one breakfast asked the clerk  do i look as if id ate two  at his departure kipps with a hot face convulsive gestures and an embittered heart tipped everyone who did not promptly and actively resist including an absentminded south african diamond merchant who was waiting in the hall for his wife and succumbed to old habit he paid his cabman a four shilling piece at charing cross having no smaller change and wished he could burn him alive then in a sudden reaction of economy he refused the proffered help of a porter and carried his bag quite violently to the train     chapter viii  kipps enters society   §1  submission to inexorable fate took kipps to the anagram tea  at any rate he would meet helen there in the presence of other people and be able to carry off the worst of the difficulty of explaining his little jaunt to london he had not seen her since his last portentous visit to new romney he was engaged to her he would have to marry her and the sooner he faced her again the better before wild plans of turning socialist defying the world and repudiating all calling for ever his heart on second thoughts sank he felt helen would never permit anything of the sort as for the anagrams he could do no more than his best and that he was resolved to do what had happened at the royal grand what had happened at new romney he must bury in his memory and begin again at the reconstruction of his social position ann buggins chitterlow all these seen in the matteroffact light of the folkestone train stood just as they stood before people of an inferior social position who had to be eliminated from his world it was a bother about ann a bother and a pity his mind rested so for a space on ann until the memory of these anagrams drew him away if he could see coote that evening he might he thought be able to arrange some sort of connivance about the anagrams and his mind was chiefly busy sketching proposals for such an arrangement it would not of course be ungentlemanly cheating but only a little mystification coote very probably might drop him a hint of the solution of one or two of the things not enough to win a prize but enough to cover his shame or failing that he might take a humorous quizzical line and pretend he was pretending to be very stupid there were plenty of ways out of it if one kept a sharp lookout  the costume kipps wore to the anagram tea was designed as a compromise between the strict letter of high fashion and seaside laxity a sort of easy semistate for afternoon helens first reproof had always lingered in his mind he wore a frock coat but mitigated it by a panama hat of romantic shape with a black band grey gloves but for relaxation brown button boots the only other man besides the clergy present a new doctor with an attractive wife was in full afternoon dress coote was not there  kipps was a little pale but quite selfpossessed as he approached mrs bindon bottings door he took a turn while some people went in and then faced it manfully the door opened and revealedann  in the background through a draped doorway behind a big fern in a great art pot the elder miss botting was visible talking to two guests the auditory background was a froth of feminine voices  our two young people were much too amazed to give one another any formula of greeting though they had parted warmly enough each was already in a state of extreme tension to meet the demands of this great and unprecedented occasion of an anagram tea lor said ann her sole remark and then the sense of miss bottings eye ruled her straight again she became very pale but she took his hat mechanically and he was already removing his gloves ann he said in a low tone and then fency the eldest miss botting knew kipps was the sort of guest who requires nursing and she came forward vocalising charm she said it was awfully jolly of him to come awfully jolly it was awfully difficult to get any good men  she handed kipps forward mumbling in a dazed condition to the drawingroom and there he encountered helen looking unfamiliar in an unfamiliar hat it was as if he had not met her for years  she astonished him she didnt seem to mind in the least his going to london she held out a shapely hand and smiled encouragingly youve faced the anagrams she said  the second miss botting accosted them a number of oblong pieces of paper in her hand mysteriously inscribed take an anagram she said take an anagram and boldly pinned one of these brief documents to kipps lapel the letters were cypshi and kipps from the very beginning suspected this was an anagram for cuyps she also left a thing like a long dance programme from which dangled a little pencil in his hand he found himself being introduced to people and then he was in a corner with the short lady in a big bonnet who was pelting him with gritty little bits of small talk that were gone before you could take hold of them and reply  very hot said this lady very hot indeedhot all the summerremarkable yearall the years remarkable nowdont know what were coming todont you think so mr kipps  oo rather said kipps and wondered if ann was still in the hall ann  he ought not to have stared at her like a stuck fish and pretended not to know her that couldnt be right but what was right  the lady in the big bonnet proceeded to a second discharge hope youre fond of anagrams mr kippsdifficult exercisestill one must do something to bring people togetherbetter than ludo anyhow dont you think so mr kipps  ann fluttered past the open door her eyes met his in amazed enquiry something had got dislocated in the world for both of them  he ought to have told her he was engaged he ought to have explained things to her perhaps even now he might be able to drop her a hint  dont you think so mr kipps  oo rather said kipps for the third time  a lady with a tired smile who was labelled conspicuously wogdelenk drifted towards kipps interlocutor and the two fell into conversation kipps found himself socially aground he looked about him helen was talking to a curate and laughing kipps was overcome by a vague desire to speak to ann he was for sidling doorward  what are you please said an extraordinarily bold tall girl and arrested him while she took down cypshi  im sure i dont know what it means she explained im sir bubh dont you think anagrams are something chronic  kipps made stockish noises and the young lady suddenly became the nucleus of a party of excited friends who were forming a syndicate to guess and barred his escape she took no further notice of him he found himself jammed against an occasional table and listening to the conversation of mrs wogdelenk and his lady with the big bonnet  she packed her two beauties off together said the lady in the big bonnet time enough too dont think much of this girl shes got as housemaid now pretty of course but theres no occasion for a housemaid to be prettynone whatever and she doesnt look particularly up to her work either kind of mazed expression  you never can tell said the lady labelled wogdelenk you never can tell my wretches are big enough heaven knows and do they work not a bit of it  kipps felt dreadfully out of it with regard to all these people and dreadfully in it with ann  he scanned the back of the big bonnet and concluded it was an extremely ugly bonnet indeed it got jerking forward as each short dry sentence was snapped off at the end and a plume of osprey on it jerked excessively she hasnt guessed even one followed by a shriek of girlish merriment came from the group about the tall bold girl theyd shriek at him presently perhaps beyond thinking his own anagram might be cuyps he hadnt a notion what a chatter they were all making it was just like a summer sale just the sort of people whod give a lot of trouble and swap you and suddenly the smouldering fires of rebellion leapt to flame again these were a rotten lot of people and the anagrams were rotten nonsense and he kipps had been a rotten fool to come there was helen away there still laughing with her curate pity she couldnt marry a curate and leave him kipps alone then hed know what to do he disliked the whole gathering collectively and in detail why were they all trying to make him one of themselves he perceived unexpected ugliness everywhere about him there were two great pins jabbed through the tall girls hat and the swirls of her hair below the brim with the minutest piece of tape tieup showing did not repay close examination mrs wogdelenk wore a sort of mumps bandage of lace and there was another lady perfectly dazzling with beads and jewels and bits of trimming they were all flaps and angles and flouncesthese women not one of them looked as neat and decent a shape as anns clean trim little figure echoes of masterman woke up in him again ladies indeed here were all these chattering people with money with leisure with every chance in the world and all they could do was to crowd like this into a couple of rooms and jabber nonsense about anagrams  could cypshi really mean cuyps floated like a dissolving wreath of mist across his mind  abruptly resolution stood armed in his heart he was going to get out of this  scuse me he said and began to wade neck deep through the bubbling tea party  he was going to get out of it all  he found himself close by helen im orf he said but she gave him the briefest glance she did not appear to hear him still mr spratlingdown you must admit theres a limit even to conformity she was saying  he was in a curtained archway and ann was before him carrying a tray supporting several small sugar bowls  he was moved to speech what a lot he said and then mysteriously im engaged to her he indicated helens new hat and became aware of a skirt he had stepped upon  ann stared at him helplessly borne past in the grip of incomprehensible imperatives  why shouldnt they talk together  he was in a small room and then at the foot of the staircase in the hall he heard the rustle of a dress and what was conceivable his hostess was upon him  but youre not going mr kipps she said  i must he said i got to  but mr kipps  i must he said im not well  but before the guessing without any tea  ann appeared and hovered behind him  i got to go said kipps  if he parleyed with her helen might awake to his desperate attempt  of course if you must go  its something ive forgotten said kipps beginning to feel regrets reely i must  mrs botting turned with a certain offended dignity and ann in a state of flushed calm that evidently concealed much came forward to open the door  im very sorry he said im very sorry half to his hostess and half to her and was swept past her by superior social forceslike a drowning man in a millraceand into the upper sandgate road he half turned upon the step and then slam went the door  he retreated along the leas a thing of shame and perplexitymrs bottings aggrieved astonishment uppermost in his mind  somethingreinforced by the glances of the people he was passingpressed its way to his attention through the tumultuous disorder of his mind  he became aware that he was still wearing his little placard with the letters cypshi  desh it he said clutching off this abomination in another moment its several letters their task accomplished were scattering gleefully before the breeze down the front of the leas   §2  kipps was dressed for mrs waces dinner half an hour before it was time to start and he sat waiting until coote should come to take him around manners and rules of good society lay before him neglected he had read the polished prose of the member of the aristocracy on page 96 as far as        the acceptance of an invitation is in the eyes of diners out a      binding obligation which only illhealth family bereavement or      some allimportant reason justifies its being set on one side or      otherwise  evaded   and then he had lapsed into gloomy thoughts  that afternoon he had had a serious talk with helen  he had tried to express something of the change of heart that had happened to him but to broach the real state of the matter had been altogether too terrible for him he had sought a minor issue i dont like all this seciety he had said  but you must see people said helen  yes but its the sort of people you see he nerved himself i didnt think much of that lot at the enegram tea  you have to see all sorts of people if you want to see the world said helen  kipps was silent for a space and a little short of breath  my dear arthur she began almost kindly i shouldnt ask you to go to these affairs if i didnt think it good for you should i  kipps acquiesced in silence  you will find the benefit of it all when we get to london you learn to swim in a tank before you go out into the sea these people here are good enough to learn upon theyre stiff and rather silly and dreadfully narrow and not an idea in a dozen of them but it really doesnt matter at all youll soon get savoir faire  he made to speak again and found his powers of verbal expression lacking instead he blew a sigh  youll get used to it all very soon said helen helpfully  as he sat meditating over that interview and over the vistas of london that opened before him on the little flat and teas and occasions and the constant presence of brudderkins and all the bright prospect of his new and better life and how he would never see ann any more the housemaid entered with a little package a small square envelope to arthur kipps esquire  a young woman left this sir said the housemaid a little severely  eh said kipps what young woman and then suddenly began to understand  she looked an ordinary young woman said the housemaid coldly  ah said kipps thats orlright  he waited till the door had closed behind the girl staring at the envelope in his hand and then with a curious feeling of increasing tension tore it open as he did so some quicker sense than sight or touch told him its contents it was anns half sixpence and besides not a word  then she must have heard him  she had kept the half sixpence all these years  he was standing with the envelope in his hand trying to get on from that last inference when coote became audible without  coote appeared in evening dress a clean and radiant coote with large greenish white gloves and a particularly large white tie edged with black for a third cousin he presently explained nace isnt it he could see kipps was pale and disturbed and put this down to the approaching social trial you keep your nerve up kipps my dear chap and youll be all right said coote with a big brotherly glove on kipps sleeve   §3  the dinner came to a crisis so far as kipps emotions were concerned with mrs bindon bottings talk about servants but before that there had been several things of greater or smaller magnitude to perturb and disarrange his social front one little matter that was mildly insurgent throughout the entire meal was if i may be permitted to mention so intimate a matter the behaviour of his left brace the webbingwhich was of a cheerful scarlet silkhad slipped away from its buckle fastened no doubt in agitation and had developed a strong tendency to place itself obliquely in the manner rather of an official decoration athwart his spotless front it first asserted itself before they went in to dinner he replaced this ornament by a dexterous thrust when no one was looking and thereafter the suppression of his novel innovation upon the stereotyped sombreness of evening dress became a standing preoccupation on the whole he was inclined to think his first horror excessive at any rate no one remarked upon it however you imagine him constantly throughout the evening with one eye and one hand whatever the rest of him might be doing predominantly concerned with the weak corner  but this i say was a little matter what exercised him much more was to discover helen quite terribly in evening dress  the young lady had let her imagination rove londonward and this costume was perhaps an anticipation of that clever little flat not too far west which was to become the centre of so delightful a literary and artistic set it was of all the feminine costumes present most distinctly an evening dress one was advised miss walshingham had arms and shoulders of a type by no means despicable one was advised miss walshingham was capable not only of dignity but charm even a certain glow of charm it was you know her first evening dress a tribute paid by walshingham finance to her brightening future had she wanted keeping in countenance she would have had to have fallen back upon her hostess who was resplendent in black and steel the other ladies had to a certain extent compromised mrs walshingham had dressed with just a refined little v and mrs bindon botting except for her dear mottled arms confided scarcely more of her plump charm to the world the elder miss botting stopped short of shoulders and so did miss wace but helen didnt she washad kipps had eyes to see ita quite beautiful human figure she knew it and she met him with a radiant smile that had forgotten all the little difference of the afternoon but to kipps her appearance was the last release with that she had become as remote as foreign as incredible as a wife and mate as though the cnidian venus herself in all her simple elegance was before witnesses declared to be his if indeed she had ever been credible as a wife and mate  she ascribed his confusion to modest reverence and having blazed smiling upon him for a moment turned a shapely shoulder towards him and exchanged a remark with mrs bindon botting anns poor little half sixpence came against kipps fingers in his pocket and he clutched at it suddenly as though it was a talisman then he abandoned it to suppress his order of the brace he was affected by a cough miss wace tells me mr revel is coming mrs botting was saying  isnt it delightful said helen we saw him last night hes stopped on his way to paris hes going to meet his wife there  kipps eyes rested for a moment on helens dazzling deltoid and then went enquiringly accusingly almost to cootes face where in the presence of this terrible emergency was the gospel of suppression nowthat furtive treatment of religion and politics and birth and death and bathing and babies and all those things which constitutes your true gentleman he had been too modest even to discuss this question with his mentor but surely surely this quintessence of all that is good and nice could regard these unsolicited confidences only in one way with something between relief and the confirmation of his worst fears he perceived by a sort of twitching of the exceptionally abundant muscles about cootes lower jaw in a certain deliberate avoidance of one particular direction by these pale but resolute grey eyes by the almost convulsive grip of the ample greenish white gloves behind him a grip broken at times for controlling pats at the blackbordered tie and the back of that spacious head and by a slight but increasing disposition to cough that coote did not approve  to kipps helen had once supplied a delicately beautiful dream a thing of romance and unsubstantial mystery but this was her final materialisation and the last thin wreath of glamour about her was dispelled in some way he had forgotten how and it was perfectly incomprehensible he was bound to this dark solid and determined young person whose shadow and suggestion he had once loved he had to go through with the thing as a gentleman should still  and when he was sacrificing ann  he wouldnt stand this sort of thing whatever else he stood should he say something about her dress to hertomorrow  he could put his foot down firmly he could say look ere i dont care i aint going to stand it see  shed say something unexpected of course she always did say something unexpected  suppose for once he overrode what she said simply repeated his point  he found these thoughts battling with certain conversational aggressions from mrs wace and then revel arrived and took the centre of the stage  the author of that brilliant romance red hearts abeating was a less imposing man than kipps had anticipated but he speedily effaced that disappointment by his predominating manners although he lived habitually in the vivid world of london his collar and tie were in no way remarkable and he was neither brilliantly handsome nor curly nor longhaired his personal appearance suggested arm chairs rather than the equestrian exercises and amorous toyings and passionate intensities of his masterpiece he was inclined to be fat with whitish flesh muddy coloured straight hair he had a rather shapeless and truncated nose and his chin was asymmetrical one eye was more inclined to stare than the other he might have been esteemed a little undistinguished looking were it not for his beeswaxed moustache which came amidst his features with a pleasing note of incongruity and the whimsical wrinkles above and about his greater eye his regard sought and found helens as he entered the room and they shook hands presently with an air of intimacy kipps for no clear reason found objectionable he saw them clasp their hands heard cootes characteristic cougha sound rather more like a very very old sheep a quarter of a mile away being blown to pieces by a small charge of gunpowder than anything else in the worlddid some confused beginnings of a thought and then they were all going in to dinner and helens shining bare arm lay along his sleeve kipps was in no state for conversation she glanced at him and though he did not know it very slightly pressed his elbow he struggled with strange respiratory dislocations before them went coote discoursing in amiable reverberations to mrs walshingham and at the head of the procession was mrs bindon botting talking fast and brightly beside the erect military figure of little mr wace he was not a soldier really but he had caught a martinet bearing by living so close to shorncliffe revel came last in charge of mrs waces queenly black and steel politely admiring in a flutelike cultivated voice the mellow wall paper of the staircase kipps marvelled at everybodys selfpossession  from the earliest spoonful of soup it became evident that revel considered himself responsible for the table talk and before the soup was over it was almost as manifest that mrs bindon botting inclined to consider his sense of responsibility excessive in her circle mrs bindon botting was esteemed an agreeable rattle her manner and appearance were conspicuously vivacious for one so plump and she had an almost irish facility for humorous description she would keep people amused all through an afternoon call with the story of how her jobbing gardener had got himself married and what his home was like or how her favourite butt mr stigson warder had all his unfortunate children taught almost every conceivable instrument because they had the phrenological bump of music abnormally large they got to trombones my dear she would say with her voice coming to a climax usually her friends conspired to draw her out but on this occasion they neglected to do so a thing that militated against her keen desire to shine in revels eyes after a time she perceived that the only thing for her to do was to cut in on the talk on her own account and this she began to do she made several ineffectual snatches at the general attention and then revel drifted towards a topic she regarded as particularly her own the ordering of households  they came to the thing through talk about localities we are leaving our house in the boltons said revel and taking a little place at wimbledon and i think of having rooms in danes inn it will be more convenient in many ways my wife is furiously addicted to golf and exercise of all sorts and i like to sit about in clubsi havent the strength necessary for these hygienic proceedingsand the old arrangement suited neither of us and besides no one could imagine the demoralisation the domestics of west london have undergone during the last three years  its the same everywhere said mrs bindon botting  very possibly it is a friend of mine calls it the servile tradition in decay and regards it all as a most hopeful phenomenon  he ought to have had my last two criminals said mrs bindon botting  she turned to mrs wace while revel came again a little too late with a possibly  and i havent told you my dear she said speaking with voluble rapidity im in trouble again  the last girl  the last girl before i can get a cook my hard won housemaidshe pausedchucks it  panic asked young walshingham  mysterious grief everything merry as a marriage bell until my anagram tea then in the evening a portentous rigour of bearing a word or so from my aunt and immediatelyfloods of tears and notice for a moment her eye rested thoughtfully on kipps as she said is there anything heartrending about anagrams  i find them so said revel i  but mrs bindon botting got away again for a time it made me quite uneasy  kipps jabbed his lip with his fork rather painfully and was recalled from a fascinated glare at mrs botting to the immediate facts of dinner  whether anagrams might not have offended the good domestics moral codeyou never can tell we made enquiries no no no she must go and thats all  one perceives said revel in these disorders dimly and distantly the last dying glow of the age of romance let us suppose mrs botting let us at least try to supposeit is love  kipps clattered with his knife and fork  its love said mrs botting what else can it be beneath the orderly humdrum of our lives these romances are going on until at last they bust up and give notice and upset our humdrum altogether some fatal wonderful soldier  the passions of the common or house domestic said revel and recovered possession of the table  upon the troubled disorder of kipps table manners there had supervented a quietness an unusual calm for once in his life he had distinctly made up his mind on his own account he listened no more to revel he put down his knife and fork and refused anything that followed coote regarded him with tactful concern and helen flushed a little   §4  about halfpast nine that night came a violent pull at the bell of mrs bindon botting and a young man in a dress suit a gibus and other marks of exalted social position stood without athwart his white expanse of breast lay a ruddy bar of patterned silk that gave him a singular distinction and minimised the glow of a few small stains of burgundy his gibus was thrust back and exposed a disorder of hair that suggested a reckless desperation he had in fact burnt his boats and refused to join the ladies coote in the subsequent conversation had protested quietly youre going on all right you know to which kipps had answered he didnt care a eng about that and so after a brief tussle with walshinghams detaining arm had got away i got something to do he said ome and here he waspanting an extraordinary resolve the door opened revealing the pleasantly furnished hall of mrs bindon botting lit by rosetinted lights and in the centre of the picture neat and pretty in black and white stood ann at the sight of kipps her colour vanished  ann said kipps i want to speak to you i got something to say to you right away see im  this aint the door to speak to me at said ann  but ann its something special  you spoke enough said ann  ann  besides thats my door down there basement if i was caught talking at this door  but ann im  basement after nine thems my hours im a servant and likely to keep one if youre calling here what name please but you got your friends and i got mine and you mustnt go talking to me  but ann i want to ask you  someone appeared in the hall behind ann not here said ann dont know anyone of that name and incontinently slammed the door in his face  what was that ann said mrs bindon bottings invalid aunt  gem a little intoxicated maamasking for the wrong name maam  what name did he want asked the lady doubtfully  no name that we know maam said ann hustling along the hall towards the kitchen stairs  i hope you werent too short with him ann  no shorter than he deserved considering ow he beaved said ann with her bosom heaving  and mrs bindon bottings invalid aunt perceiving suddenly that this call had some relation to anns private and sentimental trouble turned after one moment of hesitating scrutiny away  she was an extremely sympathetic lady was mrs bindon bottings invalid aunt she took an interest in the servants imposed piety extorted confessions and followed human nature blushing and lying defensively to its reluctantly revealed recesses but anns sense of privacy was strong and her manner under drawing out and encouragement sometimes even alarming  so the poor old lady went upstairs again   §5  the basement door opened and kipps came into the kitchen he was flushed and panting  he struggled for speech  ere he said and held out two half sixpences  ann stood behind the kitchen tableface pale and eyes round and nowand it simplified kipps very muchhe could see she had indeed been crying  well she said  dont you see  ann moved her head slightly  i kep it all these years  you kep it too long  his mouth closed and his flush died away he looked at her the amulet it seemed had failed to work  ann he said  well  ann  the conversation still hung fire  ann he said made a movement with his hands that suggested appeal and advanced a step  ann shook her head more defiantly and became defensive  look here ann said kipps i been a fool  they stared into each others miserable eyes  ann he said i want to marry you  ann clutched the table edge you cant she said faintly  he made as if to approach her around the table and she took a step that restored their distance  i must he said  you cant  i must you got to marry me ann  you cant go marrying everybody you got to marry er  i shant  ann shook her head youre engaged to that girl lady rather you cant be engaged to me  i dont want to be engaged to you i been engaged i want to be married to you see rightaway  ann turned a shade paler but what dyou mean she asked  come right off to london and marry me now  what dyou mean  kipps became extremely lucid and earnest  i mean come right off and marry me now before anyone else can see  in london  in london  they stared at one another again they took things for granted in the most amazing way  i couldnt said ann for one thing my months not up for morn free weeks yet  they hung before that for a moment as though it was insurmountable  look ere ann arst to go arst to go  she wouldnt said ann  then come without arsting said kipps  shes keep my box  she wont  she will  she wont  you dont know er  well desherleter leter who cares ill buy you a undred boxes if youll come  it wouldnt be right towards her  it isnt her you got to think about ann its me  and you avent treated me properly she said you avent treated me properly artie you didnt ought to ave  i didnt say i ad he interrupted did i ann he appealed i didnt come to arguefy im all wrong i never said i wasnt its yes or no me or not i been a fool there see i been a fool aint that enough i got myself all tied up with everyone and made a fool of myself all around  he pleaded it isnt as if we didnt care for one another ann  she seemed impassive and he resumed his discourse  i thought i wasnt likely ever to see you again ann i reely did it isnt as though i was seein you all the time i didnt know what i wanted and i went and beaved like a fooljest as anyone might i know what i want and i know what i dont want now  ann  well  will you come will you come  silence  if you dont answer me annim despritif you dont answer me now if you dont say youll come ill go right out now  he turned doorward passionately as he spoke with his threat incomplete  ill go he said i avent a friend in the world i been and throwed everything away i dont know why i done things and why i avent all i know is i cant stand nothing in the world any more he choked the pier he said  he fumbled with the door latch grumbling some inarticulate selfpity as if he sought a handle and then he had it open  clearly he was going  artie said ann sharply  he turned about and the two hung white and tense  ill do it said ann  his face began to work he shut the door and came a step back to her staring his face became pitiful and then suddenly they moved together artie she cried dont go and held out her arms weeping  they clung close to one another  oh i been so misbel cried kipps clinging to this lifebuoy and suddenly his emotion having no further serious work in hand burst its way to a loud boohoo his fashionable and expensive gibus flopped off and fell and rolled and lay neglected on the floor  i been so misbel said kipps giving himself vent oh i been so misbel ann  be quiet said ann holding his poor blubbering head tightly to her heaving shoulder and herself all aquiver be quiet shes there listenin shell ear you artie on the stairs   §6  anns last words when an hour later they parted mrs and miss bindon botting having returned very audibly upstairs deserve a section to themselves  i wouldnt do this for everyone mind you whispered ann     chapter ix  the labyrinthodon   §1  you imagine them fleeing through our complex and difficult social system as it were for life first on foot and severally to the folkestone central station then in a firstclass carriage with kipps bag as sole chaperone to charing cross and then in a fourwheeler a long rumbling palpitating slow flight through the multitudinous swarming london streets to sid kipps kept peeping out of the window its the next corner after this i believe he would say for he had a sort of feeling that at sids he would be immune from the hottest pursuits he paid the cabman in a manner adequate to the occasion and turned to his prospective brotherinlaw me and ann he said were going to marry  but i thought began sid  kipps motioned him towards explanations in the shop  its no good my arguing with you said sid smiling delightedly as the case unfolded you done it now and masterman being apprised of the nature of the affair descended slowly in a state of flushed congratulation  i thought you might find the higher life a bit difficult said masterman projecting a bony hand but i never thought youd have the originality to clear out wont the young lady of the superior classes swear never mindit doesnt matter anyhow  you were starting a climb he said at dinner that doesnt lead anywhere you would have clambered from one refinement of vulgarity to another and never got to any satisfactory top there isnt a top its a squirrels cage things are out of joint and the only top there is is a lot of blazing card playing women and betting menyou should read modern societyseasoned with archbishops and officials and all that sort of glossy pandering bosh youd have hung on a disconsolate dismal little figure somewhere up the ladder far below even the motorcar class while your wife larked aboutor fretted because she wasnt a bit higher than she was i found it all out long ago ive seen women of that sort and i dont climb any more  i often thought about what you said last time i saw you said kipps  i wonder what i said said masterman in parenthesis anyhow youre doing the right and sane thing and thats a rare spectacle youre going to marry your equal and youre going to take your own line quite independently of what people up there or people down there think you ought or ought not to do thats about the only course one can take nowadays with everything getting more muddled and upside down every day make your own little world and your own house first of all keep that right side up whatever you do and marry your mate that i suppose is what i should doif i had a mate but people of my sort luckily for the world dont get made in pairs no  besides however and abruptly taking advantage of an interruption by master walt he lapsed into thought  presently he came out of his musings  after all he said theres hope  what about said sid  everything said masterman  where theres life theres hope said mrs sid but none of you arent eating anything like you ought to  masterman lifted his glass  heres to hope he said the light of the world  sid beamed at kipps as who should say you dont meet a character like this every dinner time  heres to hope repeated masterman the best thing one can have hope of lifeyes  he imposed his movement of magnificent selfpity on them all even young walt was impressed  they spent the days before their marriage in a number of agreeable excursions together one day they went to kew by steamboat and admired the house full of paintings of flowers extremely and one day they went early to have a good long day at the crystal palace and enjoyed themselves very much indeed they got there so early that nothing was open inside all the stalls were wrappered up and all the minor exhibitions locked and barred they seemed the minutest creatures even to themselves in that enormous empty aisle and their echoing footsteps indecently loud they contemplated realistic groups of plaster savages and ann thought theyd be queer people to have about she was glad there were none in this country they meditated upon replicas of classical statuary without excessive comment kipps said at large it must have been a queer world then but ann very properly doubted if they really went about like that but the place at that early hour was really lonely one began to fancy things so they went out into the october sunshine of the mighty terraces and wandered amidst miles of stucco tanks and about those quiet gargantuan grounds a great grey emptiness it was and it seemed marvellous to them but not nearly so marvellous as it might have seemed i never see a finer place never said kipps turning to survey the entirety of the enormous glass front with paxtons vast image in the centre  what it must ave cost to build said ann and left her sentence eloquently incomplete  presently they came to a region of caves and waterways and amidst these waterways strange reminders of the possibilities of the creator they passed under an arch made of a whales jaws and discovered amidst herbage as if they were browsing or standing unoccupied and staring as if amazed at themselves huge effigies of iguanodons and deinotheria and mastodons and suchlike cattle gloriously done in green and gold  they got everything said kipps earls court isnt a patch on it  his mind was very greatly exercised by these monsters and he hovered about them and returned to them youd wonder ow they ever got enough to eat he said several times   §2  it was later in the day and upon a seat in the presence of the green and gold labyrinthodon that looms so splendidly above the lake that the kippses fell into talk about their future they had made a sufficient lunch in the palace they had seen pictures and no end of remarkable things and that and the amber sunlight made a mood for them quiet and philosophical a heaven mood kipps broke a contemplative silence with an abrupt illusion to one principal preoccupation i shall offer an pology and i shall offer er brother damages if she likes to bring an action for breach after that welli done all i can they cant get much out of reading my letters in court because i didnt write none i dessay a thousan or twoll settle all that anyhow i aint much worried about that that dont worry me very much annno  and then its a lark our marrying its curious ow things come about if i adnt run against you where should i ave been now eh even after we met i didnt seem to see it likenot marrying you i meanuntil that night i came i didntreely  i didnt neither said ann with thoughtful eyes on the water  for a time kipps mind was occupied by the prettiness of her thinking face a faint tremulous network of lights reflected from the ripples of a passing duck played subtly over her cheek and faded away  ann reflected i spose things ad to be she said  kipps mused its curious ow ever i got on to be engaged to er  she wasnt suited to you said ann  suited no fear thats jest it ow did it come about  i expect she led you on said ann  kipps was halfminded to assent then he had a twinge of conscience it wasnt that ann he said its curious i dont know what it was but it wasnt that i dont recollect no lifes jolly rum thats one thing anyow and i suppose im a rum sort of feller i get excited sometimes and then i dont seem to care what i do thats about what it was reely still  they meditated kipps with his arms folded and pulling at his scanty moustache presently a faint smile came over his face  well get a nice little ouse out ithe way  its omelier than folkestone said ann  jest a nice little ouse said kipps theres hughenden of course but thats let besides being miles too big and i

into hythe just the sort we want not too big and not too small well ave a kitching and a diningroom and a little room to sit in of a night  it mustnt be a ouse with a basement said ann  whats a

able to earn a living  its is ealth said ann  i expect it is said kipps and ceased to talk for a little while  then he spoke with deliberation sea air might be the saving of im ann  he glanced doubtfully at ann and she was looking at him even fondly  you think of other people a lot said ann i been looking at you sittin there and thinking  i suppose i do i suppose when ones appy one does  you do said ann  we shall be appy in that little ouse ann dont y think  she met his eyes and nodded  i seem to see it said kipps sort of cosy like bout tea time and muffins kettle on the ob cat on the earthrug we must get a cat ann and you there eh  they regarded each other with appreciative eyes and kipps became irrelevant  i dont believe ann he said i avent kissed you not for arf an hour leastways not since we was in those caves  for kissing had already ceased to be a matter of thrilling adventure for them  ann shook her head you be sensible and go on talking about mr masterman she said  but kipps had wandered to something else i like the way your air turns back just there he said with an indicative finger it was like that i remember when you was a girl sort of wavy ive often thought of it member when we raced that timeout beind the church  then for a time they sat idly each following out agreeable meditations  its rum said kipps  whats rum  ow everythings appened said kipps whod ave thought of our being ere like this six weeks ago whod ave thought of my ever aving any money  his eyes went to the big labyrinthodon he looked first carelessly and then suddenly with a growing interest in its vast face  im deshed he murmured ann became interested he laid a hand on her arm and pointed ann scrutinised the labyrinthodon and then came around to kipps face in mute interrogation  dont you see it said kipps  see what  es jest like old coote  its extinct said ann not clearly apprehending  i dessay e is but es jest like old coote all the same for that  kipps meditated on the monstrous shapes in sight i wonder ow all these old antediluvium animals got extinct he asked no one couldnt possibly ave killed em  why i know that said ann they was overtook by the flood  kipps meditated for a while but i thought they had to take two of everything there was  within reason they ad said ann  the kippses left it at that  the great green and gold labyrinthodon took no notice of their conversation it gazed with its wonderful eyes over their heads into the infiniteinflexibly calm it might indeed have been coote himself there coote the unassuming cutting them dead   §3  and in due course these two simple souls married and venus urania the goddess of wedded love the goddess of tolerant kindliness or meeting half way to whom all young couples should pray and offer sacrifices of self who is indeed a very great and noble and kindly goddess was in some manner propitiated and bent down and blessed them in their union   end of book ii     book iii  kippses     chapter i  the housing problem   §1  honeymoons and all things come to an end and you see at last mr and mrs arthur kipps descending upon the hythe platformcoming to hythe to find that nice little houseto realise that bright dream of a home they had first talked about in the grounds of the crystal palace they are a valiant couple you perceive but small and the world is a large incongruous system of complex and difficult things kipps wears a grey suit with a wingpoke collar and a neat smart tie mrs kipps is the same bright and healthy little girl woman you saw in the marsh not an inch has been added to her stature in all my voluminous narrative only now she wears a hat  it is a hat very unlike the hats she used to wear on her sundays out a flourishing hat with feathers and buckle and bows and things the price of that hat would take many peoples breath awayit cost two guineas kipps chose it kipps paid for it they left the shop with flushed cheeks and smarting eyes glad to be out of range of the condescending saleswoman  artie said ann you didnt ought to ave  that was all and you know the hat didnt suit ann a bit her clothes did not suit her at all the simple cheap clean brightness of her former style had given place not only to this hat but to several other things in the same key and out from among these things looked her pretty face the face of a wise little childan artless wonder struggling through a preposterous dignity  they had bought that hat one day when they had gone to see the shops in bond street kipps had looked at the passersby and it had suddenly occurred to him that ann was dowdy he had noted the hat of a very proudlooking lady passing in an electric brougham and had resolved to get ann the nearest thing to that  the railway porters perceived some subtle incongruity in ann the knot of cabmen in the station doorway the two golfers and the lady with daughters who had also got out of the train and kipps a little pale blowing a little not in complete possession of himself knew that they noticed her and him and ann it is hard to say just what ann observed of these things  ere said kipps to a cabman and regretted too late a vanished h  i got a trunk up there he said to a ticket inspector marked a k  ask a porter said the inspector turning his back  demn said kipps not altogether inaudibly   §2  it is all very well to sit in the sunshine and talk of the house you will have and another altogether to achieve it we englishall the world indeed todaylive in a strange atmosphere of neglected great issues of insistent triumphant petty things we are given up to the fine littlenesses of intercourse table manners and small correctitudes are the substance of our lives you do not escape these things for long even by so catastrophic a proceeding as flying to london with a young lady of no wealth and inferior social position the mists of noble emotion swirl and pass and there you are divorced from all your deities and grazing in the meadows under the argus eyes of the social system the innumerable mean judgments you feel raining upon you upon your clothes and bearing upon your pretensions and movements  our world today is a meanly conceived oneit is only an added meanness to conceal that fact for one consequence it has very few nice little houses such things do not come for the asking they are not to be bought with money during ignoble times its houses are built on the ground of monstrously rich shabbily extortionate landowners by poor parsimonious greedy people in a mood of elbowing competition what can you expect from such ridiculous conditions to go househunting is to spy out the nakedness of this pretentious world to see what our civilization amounts to when you take away curtains and flounces and carpets and all the fluster and distraction of people and fittings it is to see mean plans meanly executed for mean ends the conventions torn aside the secrets stripped the substance underlying all such chester cootery soiled and worn and left  so you see our poor dear kippses going to and fro in hythe in sandgate in ashford and canterbury and deal and doverat last even in folkestone with orders to view pink and green and white and yellow orders to view and labelled keys in kipps hand and frowns and perplexity upon their faces they did not clearly know what they wanted but whatever it was they saw they knew they did not want that always they found a confusing multitude of houses they could not take and none they could their dreams began to turn mainly on empty abandonedlooking rooms with unfaded patches of paper to mark the place of vanished pictures and doors that had lost their keys they saw rooms floored with boards that yawned apart and were splintered skirtings eloquent of the industrious mouse kitchens with a dead blackbeetle in the empty cupboard and a hideous variety of coal holes and dark cupboards under the stairs they stuck their little heads through roof trapdoors and gazed at disorganised ball taps at the bleak filthiness of unstoppered roofs there were occasions when it seemed to them that they must be the victims of an elaborate conspiracy of house agents so bleak and cheerless is a secondhand empty house in comparison with the humblest of inhabited dwellings  commonly the houses were too big they had huge windows that demanded vast curtains in mitigation countless bedrooms acreage of stone steps to be cleaned kitchens that made ann protest she had come so far towards a proper conception of kipps social position as to admit the prospect of one servantbut lor she would say youd want a manservant in this ouse when the houses were not too big then they were almost invariably the product of speculative building of that multitudinous hasty building for the extravagant multitude of new births that was the essential disaster of the nineteenth century the new houses ann refused as damp and even the youngest of these that had been in use showed remarkable signs of a sickly constitution the plaster flaked away the floors gaped the paper mouldered and peeled the doors dropped the bricks scaled and the railings rusted nature in the form of spiders earwigs cockroaches mice rats fungi and remarkable smells was already fighting her way back  and the plan was invariably inconvenient invariably all the houses they saw had a common quality for which she could find no word but for which the proper word is incivility they build these ouses she said as though girls wasnt uman beings sids social democracy had got into her blood perhaps and anyhow they went about discovering the most remarkable inconsiderateness in the contemporary house theres kitching stairs to go up artie ann would say some poor girls got to go up and down up and down and be tired out jest because they havent the sense to leave enough space to give their steps a proper riseand no water upstairs anywhereevery drop got to be carried its ouses like this wear girls out  its aving ouses built by men i believe makes all the work and trouble said ann  the kippses you see thought they were looking for a reasonably simple little contemporary house but indeed they were looking either for dreamland or 1975 ad or thereabouts and it hadnt come   §3  but it was a foolish thing of kipps to begin building a house  he did that out of an extraordinary animosity for house agents he had conceived  everybody hates house agents just as everybody loves sailors it is no doubt a very wicked and unjust hatred but the business of a novelist is not ethical principle but facts everybody hates house agents because they have everybody at a disadvantage all other callings have a certain amount of give and take the house agent simply takes all other callings want you your solicitor is afraid you may change him your doctor cannot go too far your novelistif only you knew itis mutely abject towards your unspoken wishesand as for your tradespeople milkmen will fight outside your front door for you and greengrocers call in tears if you discard them suddenly but who ever heard of a house agent struggling to serve anyone you want to get a house you go to him you dishevelled and angry from travel anxious enquiring he calm clean inactive reticent quietly doing nothing you beg him to reduce rents whitewash ceilings produce other houses combine the summer house of no 6 with the conservatory of no 4much he cares you want to dispose of a house then he is just the same serene indifferenton one occasion i remember he was picking his teeth all the time he answered me competition is a mockery among house agents they are all alike you cannot wound them by going to the opposite office you cannot dismiss them you can at most dismiss yourself they are invulnerably placed behind mahogany and brass too far usually even for a sudden swift lunge with an umbrella and to throw away the keys they lend you instead of returning them is larceny and punishable as such  it was a house agent in dover who finally decided kipps to build kipps with a certain faltering in his voice had delivered his ultimatum no basement not more than eight rooms hot and cold water upstairs coal cellar in the house but with intervening doors to keep dust from the scullery and so forth he stood blowing youll have to build a house said the house agent sighing wearily if you want all that it was rather for the sake of effective answer than with any intention at the time that kipps mumbled thats about what i shall dothis goes on  whereupon the house agent smiled he smiled  when kipps came to turn the thing over in his mind he was surprised to find quite a considerable intention had germinated and was growing up in him after all lots of people have built houses how could there be so many if they hadnt suppose he reely did then he would go to the house agent and say ere while you been getting me a sootable ouse blowed if i avent built one go round to all of them all the house agents in folkestone in dover ashford canterbury margate ramsgate saying that perhaps then they might be sorry it was in the small hours that he awoke to a realisation that he had made up his mind in the matter  ann he said ann and also used the sharp of his elbow  ann was at last awakened to the pitch of an indistinct enquiry what was the matter  im going to build a house ann  eh said ann suddenly as if awake  build a house  ann said something incoherent about hed better wait until the morning before he did anything of the sort and immediately with a fine trustfulness went fast asleep again  but kipps lay awake for a long while building his house and in the morning at breakfast he made his meaning clear he had smarted under the indignities of house agents long enough and this seemed to promise revengea fine revenge and you know we might reely make rather a nice little ouse out of itlike we want  so resolved it became possible for them to take a house for a year with a basement no service lift blackleading to do everywhere no water upstairs no bathroom vast sash windows to be cleaned from the sill stone steps with a twist and open to the rain into the coal cellar insufficient cupboards unpaved path to the dustbin no fireplace to the servants bedroom no end of splintery wood to scrubin fact a very typical english middleclass house and having added to this house some furniture and a languid young person with unauthentic golden hair named gwendolen who was engaged to a sergeantmajor and had formerly been in an hotel having moved in and spent some sleepless nights varied by nocturnal explorations in search of burglars because of the strangeness of being in a house for which they were personally responsible kipps settled down for a time and turned himself with considerable resolution to the project of building a home   §4  at first kipps had gathered advice finding an initial difficulty in how to begin he went into a builders shop at seabrook one day and told the lady in charge that he wanted a house built he was breathless but quite determined and he was prepared to give his order there and then but she temporised with him and said her husband was out and he left without giving his name also he went and talked to a man in a cart who was pointed out to him by a workman as the builder of a new house near saltwood but he found him first sceptical and then overpoweringly sarcastic i suppose you build a ouse every oliday he said and turned from kipps with every symptom of contempt  afterwards carshot told alarming stories about builders and shook kipps expressed resolution a good deal and then pierce raised the question whether one ought to go in the first instance to a builder at all and not rather to an architect pierce knew a man at ashford whose brother was an architect and as it is always better in these matters to get someone you know the kippses decided before pierce had gone and carshots warning had resumed their sway to apply to him they did sorather dubiously  the architect who was brother of pierces friend appeared as a small alert individual with a black bag and a cylindrical silk hat and he sat at the diningroom table with his hat and his bag exactly equidistant right and left of him and maintained a demeanour of impressive woodenness while kipps on the hearthrug with a quaking sense of gigantic enterprise vacillated answers to his enquiries ann held a watching brief for herself in a position she had chosen as suitable to the occasion beside the corner of the carved oak sideboard they felt in a sense at bay  the architect began by asking for the site and seemed a little discomposed to discover this had still to be found i thought of building just anywhere said kipps i avent made up my mind about that yet the architect remarked that he would have preferred to see the site in order to know where to put what he called his ugly side but it was quite possible of course to plan a house in the air on the level simply with back and front assumedif they would like to do that kipps flushed slightly and secretly hoping it would make no great difference in the fees said a little doubtfully that he thought that would be all right  the architect then marked off as it were the first section of his subject with a single dry cough opened his bag took out a spring tape measure some hard biscuits a metal flask a new pair of dogskin gloves a clockwork motorcar partially wrapped in paper a bunch of violets a paper of small brass screws and finally a large distended notebook he replaced the other objects carefully opened his notebook put a pencil to his lips and said and what accommodation will you require to which ann who had followed his every movement with the closest attention and a deepening dread replied with the violent suddenness of one who has long lain in wait cubbuds  anyhow she added catching her husbands eye  the architect wrote it down  and how many rooms he said coming to secondary matters  the young people regarded one another it was dreadfully like giving an order  how many bedrooms for example asked the architect  one suggested kipps inclined now to minimise at any cost  theres gwendolen said ann  visitors perhaps said the architect and temperately you never know  two praps said kipps we dont want no more than a little ouse you know  but the merest shootingbox said the architect  they got to six he beat them steadily from bedroom to bedroom the word nursery played across their imaginative skieshe mentioned it as the remotest possibilityand then six being reluctantly conceded ann came forward to the table sat down and delivered herself of one of her prepared conditions ot and cold water she said laid on to each roomanyow  it was an idea long since acquired from sid  yes said kipps on the hearthrug ot and cold water laid on to each bedroomweve settled on that  it was the first intimation to the architect that he had to deal with a couple of exceptional originality and as he had spent the previous afternoon in finding three large houses in the builder which he intended to combine into an original and copyright design of his own he naturally struggled against these novel requirements he enlarged on the extreme expensiveness of plumbing on the extreme expensiveness of everything not already arranged for in his scheme and only when ann declared shed as soon not have the house as not have her requirements and kipps blenching the while had said he didnt mind what a thing cost him so long as he got what he wanted did he allow a kindred originality of his own to appear beneath the acquired professionalism of his methods he dismissed their previous talk with his paragraphic cough of course he said if you dont mind being unconventional  he explained that he had been thinking of a queen anne style of architecture ann directly she heard her name shook her head at kipps in an aside so far as the exterior went for his own part he said he liked to have the exterior of a house in a style not priggishly in a style but mixed with one style uppermost and the gables and dormers and casements of the queen anne style with a little rough cast and sham timbering here and there and perhaps a bit of an overhang diversified a house and made it interesting the advantages of what he called a queen anne style was that it had such a variety of features still if they were prepared to be unconventional it could be done a number of houses were now built in the unconventional style and were often very pretty in the unconventional style one frequently had what perhaps he might call internal features for example an old english oak staircase and gallery white roughcast and green paint were a good deal favoured in houses of this type  he indicated that this excursus on style was finished by a momentary use of his cough and reopened his notebook which he had closed to wave about in a moment of descriptive enthusiasm while expatiating on the unbridled wealth of external features associated with queen anne six bedrooms he said moistening his pencil one with barred windows suitable for a nursery if required  kipps endorsed this huskily and reluctantly  there followed a most interesting discussion upon house building in which kipps played a minor part they passed from bedrooms to the kitchen and scullery and there ann displayed an intelligent exactingness that won the expressed admiration of the architect they were particularly novel upon the position of the coal cellar which ann held to be altogether too low in the ordinary house necessitating much heavy carrying they dismissed as impracticable the idea of having coal cellar and kitchen at the top of the house because that would involve carrying all the coal through the house and therewith much subsequent cleaning and for a time they dealt with a conception of a coal cellar on the ground floor with a light staircase running up outside to an exterior shoot it might be made a feature said the architect a little doubtfully jotting down a note of it it would be apt to get black you know  thence they passed to the alternative of service lifts and then by an inspiration of the architect to the possibilities of gas heating kipps did a complicated verbal fugue on the theme gas heating heats the air with variable aspirates he became very red and was lost to the discussion altogether for a time though his lips kept silently on  subsequently the architect wrote to say that he found in his notebook very full and explicit directions for bow windows to all rooms for bedrooms for water supply lift height of stairs and absence of twists therein for a wellventilated kitchen twenty feet square with two dressers and a large boxwindow seat for scullery and outhouses and offices but nothing whatever about drawingroom diningroom library or study or approximate cost and he awaited further instructions he presumed there would be a breakfastroom diningroom drawingroom and study for mr kipps at least that was his conception and the young couple discussed this matter long and ardently  ann was distinctly restrictive in this direction i dont see what you want a drawinroom and a dinin and a kitchen for if we was going to let in summerwell and good but were not going to let consequently we dont want so many rooms then theres a all what use is a all it only makes work and a study  kipps had been humming and stroking his moustache since he had read the architects letter i think id like a little bit of a studynot a big one of course but one with a desk and bookshelves like there was in hughenden id like that  it was only after they had talked to the architect again and seen how scandalised he was at the idea of not having a drawingroom that they consented to that internal feature they consented to please him but we shant never use it said ann  kipps had his way about a study when i get that study said kipps i shall do a bit of reading ive long wanted to do i shall make a habit of going in there and reading something an hour every day theres shakespeare and a lot of things a man like me ought to read besides we got to ave somewhere to put the encyclopædia ive always thought a study was about what ive wanted all along you cant elp reading if you got a study if you avent theres nothing for it so fars i can see but treshy novels  he looked down at ann and was surprised to see a joyless thoughtfulness upon her face  fency ann he said not too buoyantly aving a little ouse of our own  it wont be a little ouse said ann not with all them rooms   §5  any lingering doubt in that matter was dispelled when it came to plans  the architect drew three sets of plans on a transparent bluish sort of paper that smelt abominably he painted them very nicely brick red and ginger and arsenic green and a leaden sort of blue and brought them over to show our young people the first set were very simple with practically no external featuresa plain style he said it wasbut it looked a big sort of house nevertheless the second had such extras as a conservatory bow windows of various sorts one roughcast gable and one halftimbered ditto in plaster and a sort of overhung verandah and was much more imposing and the third was quite fungoid with external features and honeycombed with internal ones it was he said practically a mansion and altogether a very noble fruit of the creative mind of man it was he admitted perhaps almost too good for hythe his art had run away with him and produced a modern mansion in the best folkestone style it had a central hall with a staircase a moorish gallery and tudor stained glass window crenelated battlements to the leading over the portico an octagonal bulge with octagonal bay windows surmounted by an oriental dome of metal lines of yellow bricks to break up the red and many other richnesses and attractions it was the sort of house ornate and in its dignified way voluptuous that a city magnate might build but it seemed excessive to the kippses the first plan had seven bedrooms the second eight the third eleven that had the architect explained worked in as if they were pebbles in a mountaineers boat  theyre big ouses said ann directly the elevations were unrolled  kipps listened to the architect with round eyes and an exuberant caution in his manner anxious not to commit himself further than he had done to the enterprise and the architect pointed out the features and other objects of interest with the scalpel belonging to a pocket manicure set that he carried ann watched kipps face and communicated with him furtively over the architects head not so big said anns lips  its a bit big for what i meant said kipps with a reassuring eye on ann  you wont think it big when you see it up said the architect you take my word for that  we dont want no more than six bedrooms said kipps  make this one a boxroom then said the architect  a feeling of impotence silenced kipps for a time  now which said the architect spreading them out is it to be  he flattened down the plans of the most ornate mansion to show it to better effect  kipps wanted to know how much each would cost at the outside which led to much alarmed signalling from ann but the architect could estimate only in the most general way  they were not really committed to anything when the architect went away kipps had promised to think it over that was all  we cant ave that ouse said ann  theyre miles too bigall of them agreed kipps  youd want four servants wouldnt be ardly enough said ann  kipps went to the hearthrug and spread himself his tone was almost offhand nex time e comes said kipps ill splain to him it isnt at all the sort of thing we want itsits a misunderstanding you got no occasion to be anxious bout it ann  i dont see much good reely in building an ouse at all said ann  oo we got to build a ouse now we begun said kipps but now supposin we ad  he spread out the most modest of the three plans and scratched his cheek   §6  it was unfortunate that old kipps came over the next day  old kipps always produced peculiar states of mind in his nephew a rash assertiveness a disposition towards display unlike his usual self there had been great difficulty in reconciling both these old people to the pornick mesalliance and at times the controversy echoed in old kipps expressed thoughts this perhaps it was and no ignoble vanity that set the note of florid successfulness going in kipps conversation whenever his uncle appeared mrs kipps was as a matter of fact not reconciled at all she had declined all invitations to come over on the bus and was a taciturn hostess on the one occasion when the young people called at the toy shop en route for mrs pornick she displayed a tendency to sniff that was clearly due to pride rather than catarrh and except for telling ann she hoped she would not feel too stuck up about her marriage confined her conversation to her nephew or the infinite the call was a brief one and made up chiefly of pauses no refreshment was offered or asked for and ann departed with a singularly high colour for some reason she would not call at the toy shop when they found themselves again in new romney  but old kipps having adventured over and tried the table of the new menage and found it to his taste showed many signs of softening towards ann he came again and then again he would come over by the bus and except when his mouth was absolutely full he would give his nephew one solid and continuous mass of advice of the most subtle and disturbing description until it was time to toddle back to the high street for the afternoon bus he would walk with him to the sea front and commence pourparlers with boatmen for the purchase of one of their boats you ought to keep a boat of your own he said though kipps was a singularly poor sailoror he would pursue a plan that was forming in his mind in which he should own and manage what he called weekly property in the less conspicuous streets of hythe the cream of that was to be a weekly collection of rents in person the nearest approach to feudal splendour left in this democratised country he gave no hint of the source of the capital he designed for this investment and at times it would appear he intended it as an occupation for his nephew rather than himself  but there remained something in his manner towards ann in the glances of scrutiny he gave her unawares that kept kipps alertly expansive whenever he was about and in all sorts of ways it was on account of old kipps for example that our kipps plunged one day a golden plunge and brought home a box of cummerbundy ninepenny cigars and substituted blue label old methusaleh four stars for the common and generally satisfactory white brand  some of this is whiskey my boy said old kipps when he tasted it smacking critical lips  saw a lot of young officer fellers coming along said old kipps you ought to join the volunteers my boy and get to know a few  i dessay i shall said kipps later  theyd make you an officer you know n no time they want officers said old kipps it isnt everyone can afford it theyd be regular glad to ave you aint bort a dog yet  not yet uncle ave a segar  not a moty car  not yet uncle  theres no urry bout that and dont get one of these ere trashy cheap ones when you do get it my boy get one asll last a lifetime im surprised you dont ire a bit more  ann dont seem to fency a moty car said kipps  ah said old kipps i expect not and glanced a comment at the door she aint used to going out he said more at ome indoors  fact is said kipps hastily were thinking of building a ouse  i wouldnt do that my boy began old kipps but his nephew was routing in the cheffonier drawer amidst the plans he got them in time to check some further comment on ann um said the old gentleman a little impressed by the extraordinary odour and the unusual transparency of the tracing paper kipps put into his hands thinking of building a ouse are you  kipps began with the most modest of the three projects  old kipps read slowly through his silverrimmed spectacles plan of a ouse for arthur kipps esquireum  he didnt warm to the project all at once and ann drifted into the room to find him still scrutinising the architects proposals a little doubtfully  we couldnt find a decent ouse anywhere said kipps leaning against the table and assuming an offhand note i didnt see why we shouldnt run up one for ourselves old kipps could not help liking the tone of that  we thought we might see said ann  its a spekerlation of course said old kipps and held the plan at a distance of two feet or more from his glasses and frowned this isnt exactly the ouse i should expect you to ave thought of though he said practically its a villa its the sort of ouse a bank clerk might ave tisnt what i should call a gentlemans ouse artie  its plain of course said kipps standing beside his uncle and looking down at this plan which certainly did seem a little less magnificent now than it had at the first encounter  you mustnt ave it too plain said old kipps  if its comfortable ann hazarded  old kipps glanced at her over his spectacles you aint comfortable my gal in this world not if you dont live up to your position so putting compactly into contemporary english that fine old phrase noblesse oblige a ouse of this sort is what a retired tradesman might ave or some little whippersnapper of a sliciter but you  course that isnt the ony plan said kipps and tried the middle one  but it was the third one which won over old kipps now thats a ouse my boy he said at the sight of it  ann came and stood just behind her husbands shoulder while old kipps expanded upon the desirability of the larger scheme you ought to ave a billiardroom he said i dont see that but all the rests all right a lot of these ere officers ere ud be glad of a game of billiards  whats all these dots said old kipps  srubbery said kipps flowing srubs  theres eleven bedrooms in that ouse said ann its a bit of a lot aint it uncle  youll want em my girl as you get on youll be aving visitors friends of your usband praps from the school of musketry what you want im to get on with you cant never tell  if we ave a great srubbery ann ventured we shall ave to keep a gardener  if you dont ave a srubbery said old kipps with a note of patient reasoning ow are you to prevent every jackanapes that goes by starin into your drorinroom winderpraps when you get someone a bit special to entertain  we aint used to a srubbery said ann mulishly we get on very well ere  it isnt what youre used to said old kipps its what you ought to ave now and with that ann dropped out of the discussion  study and libry old kipps read thats right i see a tantalus the other day over brookland the very thing for a gentlemans study ill try and get over and bid for it  by bus time old kipps was quite enthusiastic about the house building and it seemed to be definitely settled that the largest plan was the one decided upon but ann had said nothing further in the matter   §7  when kipps returned from seeing his uncle into the busthere always seemed a certain doubt whether that portly figure would go into the little red tiptop boxhe found ann still standing by the table looking with an expression of comprehensive disapproval at the three plans  there dont seem much the matter with uncle said kipps assuming the hearthrug spite of is eartburn e opped up them steps like a bird  ann remained staring at the plans  you dont like them plans hazarded kipps  no i dont artie  we got to build somethin now  butits a gentlemans ouse artie  itsits a decent size o course  kipps took a flirting look at the drawing and went to the window  look at the cleanin free servantsll be lost in that ouse artie  we must ave servants said kipps  ann looked despondently at her future residence  we got to keep up our position anyow said kipps turning towards her it stands to reason ann we got a position very well i cant ave you scrubbin floors you got to ave a servant and you got to manage a ouse you wouldnt ave me ashamed  ann opened her lips and did not speak  what asked kipps  nothing said ann only i did want it to be a little ouse artie i wanted it to be a andy little ouse jest for us  kipps face was suddenly flushed and mulish he took up the curiously smelling tracings again im not agoing to be looked down upon he said its not only uncle im thinking of  ann stared at him  kipps went on i wont ave that young walshingham fr instance sneering and sniffling at me making out as if we was all wrong i see im yesterday nor coote neether im as goodwere as good whatevers appened  silence and the rustle of plans  he looked up and saw anns eyes bright with tears for a moment the two stared at one another  well ave the big ouse said ann with a gulp i didnt think of that artie  her aspect was fierce and resolute and she struggled with emotion well ave the big ouse she repeated they shant say i dragged you down wiv menone of them shant say that ive thoughtive always been afraid of that  kipps looked again at the plan and suddenly the grand house had become very grand indeed he blew  no artie none of them shant say that and with something blind in her motions ann tried to turn the plan round to her  after all kipps thought there might be something to say for the milder project but he had gone so far that now he did not know how to say it  and so the plans went out to the builders and in a little while kipps was committed to two thousand five hundred pounds worth of building but then you know he had an income of twelve hundred a year   §8  it is extraordinary what minor difficulties cluster about house building  i say ann remarked kipps one day we shall ave to call this little ouse by a name i was thinking of ome cottage but i dunno whether ome cottage is quite the thing like all these little fishermens places are called cottages  i like cottage said ann  its got eleven bedrooms dsee said kipps i dont see ow you can call it a cottage with more bedrooms than four proply speaking its a large villa proply its almost a big ouse leastways a ouse  well said ann if you must call it villahome villa i wish it wasnt  kipps meditated  ow about eureka villa he said raising his voice  whats eureka  its a name he said there used to be eureka dress fasteners theres lots of names come to think of it to be got out of a shop theres pyjama villa i remember that in the hosiery no come to think that wouldnt do but maraposasort of oatmeal cloth that was no eurekas better  ann meditated it seems silly like to ave a name that dont mean much  perhaps it does said kipps though its what people ave to do  he became meditative i got it he cried  not oreeka said ann  no there used to be a ouse at hastings opposite our schoolquite a big ouse it wasst anns now that  no said mrs kipps with decision thanking you kindly but i dont have no butcher boys making game of me  they consulted carshot who suggested after some days of reflection waddycombe as a graceful reminder of kipps grandfather old kipps who was for upton manor house where he had once been second footman buggins who favoured either a stern simple number number oneif there were no other houses there or something patriotic as empire villa and pierce who inclined to sandringham but in spite of all this help they were still undecided when amidst violent perturbations of the soul and after the most complex and difficult hagglings wranglings fears muddles and goings to and fro kipps became the joyless owner of a freehold plot of threeeighths of an acre and saw the turf being wheeled away from the site that should one day be his home     chapter ii  the callers   §1  the kippses sat at their midday dinnertable and amidst the vestiges of rhubarb pie and discussed two postcards the one oclock post had brought it was a rare bright moment of sunshine in a wet and windy day in the march that followed their marriage kipps was attired in a suit of brown with a tie of fashionable green while ann wore one of those picturesque loose robes that are usually associated with sandals and advanced ideas but there werent any sandals on ann or any advanced ideas and the robe had come quite recently through the counsels of mrs sid pornick its artlike said kipps giving way its more comfortable said ann the room looked out by french windows upon a little patch of green and the hythe parade the parade was all shiny wet with rain and the greengrey sea tumbled and tumbled between parade and sky  the kipps furniture except for certain chromo lithographs of kipps incidental choice that struck a quiet note amidst the wall paper had been tactfully forced by an expert salesman and it was in a style of mediocre elegance there was a sideboard of carved oak that had only one fault it reminded kipps at times of woodcarving and its panel of bevelled glass now reflected the back of his head on its shelf were two books from parsons library each with a place marked by a slip of paper neither of the kippses could have told you the title of either book they read much less the authors name there was an ebonised overmantel set with phials and pots of brilliant colour each duplicated by lookingglass and bearing also a pair of chinese jars made in birmingham a wedding present from mr and mrs sidney pornick and several sumptuous japanese fans and there was a turkey carpet of great richness in addition to these modern exploits of messrs bunt and bubble there were two inactive tall clocks whose extreme dilapidation appealed to the connoisseur a terrestrial and a celestial globe the latter deeply indented a number of good old iron moulded and dusty books and a stuffed owl wanting one easily replaceable glass eye obtained by the exertions of uncle kipps the table equipage was as much as possible like mrs bindon bottings only more costly and in addition there were green and crimson wine glassesthough the kippses never drank wine  kipps turned to the more legible of his two postcards again  unavoidably prevented from seein me today e says i like is cheek after i give im is start and everything  he blew  e certainly treats you a bit orfand said ann  kipps gave vent to his dislike of young walshingham hes getting too big for is britches he said im beginning to wish she ad brought an action for breach ever since e said she wouldnt es seemed to think ive got no right to spend my own money  es never liked your building the ouse said ann  kipps displayed wrath what the goodness as it got to do wiv im  overman indeed he added overmantel e trys that on with me ill tell im something e wont like  he took up the second card dashed if i can read a word of it i can jest make out chitlow at the end and thats all  he scrutinised it its like someone in a fit writing this here might be w h a twhat p r i c ei got it what price harry now it was a sort of saying of is i expect es either done something or not done something towards starting that play ann  i expect thats about it said ann  kipps grunted with effort i cant read the rest he said at last nohow  a thoroughly annoying post he pitched the card on the table stood up and went to the window where ann after a momentary reconnaisance at chitterlows hieroglyphics came to join him  wonder what i shall do this afternoon said kipps with his hands deep in his pockets  he produced and lit a cigarette  go for a walk i spose said ann  i been for a walk this morning  spose i must go for another he added after an interval  they regarded the windy waste of sea for a space  wonder why it is e wont see me said kipps returning to the problem of young walshingham its all lies about is being too busy  ann offered no solution  rain again said kipps as the lash of the little drops stung the window  oo bother said kipps you got to do something look ere ann ill go orf for a reglar tramp through the rain up by saltwood round by newington over the camp and so round and back and see ow theyre getting on about the ouse see and look ere you get gwendolen to go out a bit before i come back if its still rainy she can easy go round and see er sister then well ave a bit of tea with tea cakeall buttery see toce it ourselves praps eh  i dessay i can find something to do in the ouse said ann considering youll take your mackintosh and leggins i spose youll get wet without your mackintosh over those roads  righo said kipps and went to ask gwendolen for his brown leggings and his other pair of boots   §2  things conspired to demoralise kipps that afternoon  when he got outside the house everything looked so wet under the drive of the southwester that he abandoned the prospect of the clay lanes towards newington altogether and turned east to folkestone along the seabrook digue his mackintosh flapped about him the rain stung his cheek for a time he felt a hardy man and then as abruptly the rain ceased and the wind fell and before he was through sandgate high street it was a bright spring day and there was kipps in his mackintosh and squeaky leggings looking like a fool  inertia carried him another mile to the leas and there the whole world was pretending there had never been such a thing as rainever there wasnt a cloud in the sky except for an occasional puddle the asphalt paths looked as dry as a bone a smartly dressed man in one of those overcoats that look like ordinary cloth and are really most deceitfully and unfairly waterproof passed him and glanced at the stiff folds of his mackintosh demn said kipps his mackintosh swished against his leggings his leggings piped and whistled over his boottops  why do i never get anything right kipps asked of a bright implacable universe  nice old ladies passed him refined people with tidy umbrellas bright beautiful superciliouslooking children of course the right thing for such a day as this was a light overcoat and an umbrella a child might have known that he had them at home but how could one explain that he decided to turn down by the harvey monument and escape through clifton gardens towards the hills and thereby he came upon coote  he already felt the most abject and propitiatory of social outcasts when he came upon coote and coote finished him he passed within a yard of coote coote was coming along towards the leas and when kipps saw him his legs hesitated about their office and he seemed to himself to stagger about all over the footpath at the sight of him coote started visibly then a sort of rigor vitae passed through his frame his jaw protruded and errant bubbles of air seemed to escape and run about beneath his loose skin seemed i sayi am perfectly well aware that there is really connective tissue in coote as in all of us to prevent anything of the sort his eyes fixed themselves on the horizon and glazed as he went by kipps could hear his even resolute breathing he went by and kipps staggered on into a universe of dead cats and dust heaps rind and ashescut cut  it was part of the inexorable decrees of providence that almost immediately afterwards the residuum of kipps had to pass a very very long and observantlooking girls school  kipps recovered consciousness again on the road between shorncliffe station and cheriton though he cannot remember indeed to this day he has never attempted to remember how he got there and he was back at certain thoughts suggested by his last nights novel reading that linked up directly with the pariahlike emotions of these last encounters the novel lay at home upon the cheffonier it was one of society and politicsthere is no need whatever to give the title or name the authorwritten with a heavyhanded thoroughness that overrode any possibility of resistance on the part of the kipps mind it had crushed all his poor little edifice of ideals his dreams of a sensible unassuming existence of snugness of not caring what people said and all the rest of it to dust it had reinstated squarely and strongly again the only proper conception of english social life there was a character in the book who trifled with art who was addicted to reading french novels who dressed in a loose careless way who was a sorrow to his dignified silveryhaired politicoreligious mother and met the admonitions of bishops with a front of brass he treated a nice girl to whom they had got him engaged badly he married beneath himsome low thing or other and sank  kipps could not escape the application of the case he was enabled to see how this sort of thing looked to decent people he was enabled to gauge the measure of the penalties due his mind went from that to the frozen marble of cootes visage  he deserved it  that day of remorse later it found him coming upon the site of his building operations and surveying it in a mood near to despair his mackintosh over his arm  hardly anyone was at work that dayno doubt the builders were having him in some obscure mannerand the whole place seemed a dismal and depressing litter the builders shed blacklettered wilkins builder hythe looked like a stranded thing amidst a castup disorder of wheelbarrows and wheeling planks and earth and sand and bricks the foundations of the walls were trenches full of damp concrete drying in patches the roomsit was incredible they could ever be roomswere shaped out as squares and oblongs of coarse wet grass and sorrel they looked absurdly smalldishonestly small what could you expect of course the builders were having him building too small building all wrong using bad materials old kipps had told him a wrinkle or two the builders were having him young walshingham was having him everybody was having him they were having him and laughing at him because they didnt respect him they didnt respect him because he couldnt do things right who could respect him  he was an outcast he had no place in the world he had had his chance in the world and turned his back on it he had behaved badlythat was the phrase  here a great house was presently to arise a house to be paid for a house neither he nor ann could managewith eleven bedrooms and four disrespectful servants having them all the time  how had it all happened exactly  this was the end of his great fortune what a chance he had had if he had really carried out his first intentions and stuck to things how much better everything might have been if he had got a tutorthat had been in his mind originallya special sort of tutor to show him everything right a tutor for gentlemen of neglected education if he had read more and attended better to what coote had said  coote who had just cut him  eleven bedrooms what had possessed him no one would ever come to see them no one would ever have anything to do with them even his aunt cut him his uncle treated him with a halfcontemptuous sufferance he had not a friend worth counting in the world buggins carshot pierce shop assistants the pornicksa low socialist lot he stood among his foundations like a lonely figure among ruins he stood among the ruins of his future and owned himself a foolish and mistaken man he saw himself and ann living out their shameful lives in this great crazy placeas it would bewith everybody laughing secretly at them and their eleven rooms and nobody approaching themnobody nice and right that is for ever and ann  what was the matter with ann shed given up going for walks lately got touchy and tearful been fitful with her food just when she didnt ought to it was all a part of the judgment upon wrongdoing it was all part of the social penalties that juggernaut of a novel had brought home to his mind   §3  he let himself in with his latchkey he went moodily into the diningroom and got out the plans to look at them he had a vague hope that there would prove to be only ten bedrooms but he found there were still eleven he became aware of ann standing over him look ere artie said ann  he looked up and found her holding a number of white oblongs his eyebrows rose  its callers said ann  he put his plans aside slowly and took and read the cards in silence with a sort of solemnity callers after all then perhaps he wasnt to be left out of the world after all mrs g porrett smith miss porrett smith miss mabel porrett smith and two smaller cards of the rev g porrett smith lor he said clergy  there was a lady said ann and two growedup galsall dressed up  and im  there wasnt no im  not he held out the little card  no

beind the others and didnt come in  i didnt see no gentleman with them at all said ann  rum said kipps a halfforgotten experience came back to him i know he said waving the reverend gentlemans card e give em the slip thats what hed done gone off while they was rapping before you let em in its a fair call anyow he felt a momentary base satisfaction at his absence what did they talk about ann  there was a pause i didnt let em in said ann  he looked up suddenly and perceived that something unusual was the matter with ann her face was flushed her eyes were red and hard  didnt let em in  no they didnt come in at all  he was too astonished for words  i answered the door said ann id been upstairs namelling the floor ow was i to think about callers artie we aint never ad callers all the time we been ere id sent gwendolen out for a bref of fresh air and there i was upstairs namelling that floor she done so bad sos to get it done before she came back i thought id namel that floor and then get tea and ave it quiet with you toce and all before she came back ow was i to think about callers  she paused well said kipps what them  they came and rapped ow was i to know i thought it was a tradesman or something never took my apron off never wiped the namel off my andsnothing there they was  she paused again she was getting to the disagreeable part  wad they say said kipps  she says is mrs kipps at home see to me  yes  and me all painty and no cap on and nothing neither missis nor servant like there artie i could a sunk through the floor with shame i really could i could ardly get my voice i couldnt think of nothing to say but just not at ome and out of abit like i eld the tray and they give me the cards and went and ow i shall ever look that lady in the face again i dont know and thats all about it artie they looked me up and down they did and then i shut the door on em  goo said kipps  ann went and poked the fire needlessly with a passion quivering hand  i wouldnt ave ad that appen for five pounds said kipps a clergyman and all  ann dropped the poker into the fender with some éclat and stood up and looked at her hot face in the glass kipps disappointment grew you did ought to ave known better than that ann you reely did  he sat forward cards in hand with a deepening sense of social disaster the things were laid upon the table toast sheltered under a cover at mid fender the teapot warmed beside it and the kettle just lifted from the hob sang amidst the coals ann glanced at him for a moment then stooped with the kettleholder to wet the tea  tcha said kipps with his mental state developing  i dont see its any use getting in a state about it now said ann  dont you i do see eres these people good people want to sociate with us and ere you go and slap em in the face  i didnt slap em in the face  you dopractically you slams the door in their face and thats all we see of em ever i wouldnt ave ad this appen not for a tenpound note  he rounded his regrets with a grunt for a while there was silence save for the little stir of anns movements preparing the tea  tea artie said ann handing him a cup  kipps took it  i put sugar once said ann  oo dash it oo cares said kipps taking an extraordinarily large additional lump with fury quivering fingers and putting his cup with a slight excess of force on the recess cupboard oo cares  i wouldnt ave ad that appen he said bidding steadily against accomplished things for twenty pounds  he gloomed in silence through a long minute or so then ann said the fatal thing that exploded him artie she said  what  theres buttud toce down there by your foot there was a pause husband and wife regarded one another  buttud toce he said you go and mess up them callers and then you try and stuff me up with buttud toce buttud toce indeed eres our first chance of knowing anyone thats at all fit to sociate with look ere ann tell you what it isyou got to return that call  return that call  yes you got to return that call thats what you got to do i know he waved his arm vaguely towards the miscellany of books in the recess its in manners and rools of good sity you got to find jest ow many cards to leave and you got to go and leave em see  anns face expressed terror but artie ow can i  ow can you ow could you you got to do it anyow they wont know younot in your bond street at if they do they wont say nothing  his voice assumed a note of entreaty you mus ann  i cant  you mus  i cant and i wont anything in reason ill do but face those people again i cantafter what as appened  you wont  no  so there they goorf and we never see them again and so it goes on so it goes on we dont know nobody and we shant know anybody and you wont put yourself out not a little bit or take the trouble to find out anything ow it ought to be done  terrible pause  i never ought to ave merried you artie thats the troof  oh dont go into that  i never ought to ave merried you artie im not equal to the position if you adnt said youd drown yourself she choked  i don see why you shouldnt try ann ive improved why dont you stead of which you go sending out the servant and namelling floors and then when visitors come  ow was i to know about yr old visitors cried ann in a wail and suddenly got up and fled from amidst their ruined tea the tea of which toce all buttery was to be the crown and glory  kipps watched her with a momentary consternation then he hardened his heart ought to ave known better he said goin on like that he remained for a space rubbing his knees and muttering he emitted scornfully i carnt an i wont he saw her as the source of all his shames  presently quite mechanically he stooped down and lifted the flowery china cover ter dash er buttud toce he shouted at the sight of it and clapped the cover down again hard  when gwendolen came back she perceived things were in a slightly unusual poise kipps sat by the fire in a rigid attitude reading a casually selected volume of the encyclopaedia britannica and ann was upstairs and inaccessibleto reappear at a later stage with reddened eyes before the fire and still in a perfectly assimilable condition was what was evidently an untouched supply of richly buttered toast under a cracked cover  theyve ad a bit of a tiff said gwendolen attending to her duties in the kitchen with her outdoor hat still on and her mouth full theyre rummunsif ever my eye  and she took another piece of anns generously buttered toast   §4  the kippses spoke no more that day to one another  the squabble about cards and buttered toast was as serious to them as the most rational of differences it was all rational to them their sense of wrong burnt within them their sense of what was owing to themselves the duty of implacability the obstinacy of pride in the small hours kipps lay awake at the nadir of unhappiness and came near groaning he saw life as an extraordinarily desolating muddle his futile house his social discredit his bad behaviour to helen his low marriage to ann  he became aware of something irregular in anns breathing  he listened she was awake and quietly and privately sobbing  he hardened his heart resolutely he hardened his heart  the stupid little tragedies of these clipped and limited lives  what is the good of keeping up the idyllic sham and pretending that illeducated misdirected people get along very well and that all this is harmlessly funny and nothing more you think im going to write fat silly grinning novels about halfeducated undertrained people and keep it up all the time that the whole things nothing but funny  as i think of them lying unhappily there in the darkness my vision pierces the night see what i can see above them brooding over them i tell you there is a monster a lumpish monster like some great clumsy griffin thing like the crystal palace labyrinthodon like coote like the leaden goddess dulness pope abhorred like some fat proud flunkey like pride like indolence like all that is darkening and heavy and obstructive in life it is matter and darkness it is the antisoul stupidity my kippses live in its shadow shalford and his apprenticeship system the hastings academy the ideas of coote the ideas of the old kippses all the ideas that have made kipps what he is all these are its shadow but for that monster they might not be groping among false ideas and hurt one another so sorely and so stupidly but for that the glowing promise of childhood and youth might have had a happier fruition thought might have awakened in them to meet the thought of the world the quickening sunshine of literature pierced to the substance of their souls their lives might not have been divorced as now they are divorced for ever from the apprehension of beauty that we favoured ones are giventhe vision of the grail that makes life fine for ever i have laughed and i laugh at these two people i have sought to make you laugh  but i see through the darkness the souls of my kippses as they are as little pink strips of living stuff like the bodies of little illnourished ailing ignorant children children who feel pain who are naughty and muddled and suffer and do not understand why and the claw of this beast rests upon them     chapter iii  terminations   §1  next morning came a remarkable telegram from folkestone please come at once urgent walshingham said the telegram and kipps after an agitated but still ample breakfast departed  when he returned his face was very white and his countenance disordered he let himself in with his latchkey and came into the diningroom where ann sat affecting to work at a little thing she called a bib she heard his hat fall in the hall before he entered as though he had missed the peg i got something to tell you ann he said disregarding their overnight quarrel and went to the hearthrug and took hold of the mantel and stared at ann as though the sight of her was novel  well said ann not looking up and working a little faster  es gone  ann looked up sharply and her hands stopped whos gone for the first time she perceived kipps pallor  young walshinghami saw er and she tole me  gone what dyou mean  cleared out gone off for good  what for  for is ealth said kipps with sudden bitterness es been speckylating hes speckylated our money and es speckylated their money and now es took is ook thats all about it ann  you mean  i mean es orf and our twentyfour thousands orf too and ere we are smashed up thats all about it ann he panted  ann had no vocabulary for such an occasion oh lor she said and sat still  kipps came about and stuck his hands deeply in his trouser pockets speckylated every pennylorst it alland gorn  even his lips were white  you mean we aint got nothin left artie  not a penny not a bloomin penny ann no  a gust of passion whirled across the soul of kipps he flung out a knuckly fist if i ad im ere he said ididid wring is neck for im idid his voice rose to a shout he thought of gwendolen in the kitchen and fell to ugh  but artie said ann trying to grasp it dyou mean to say hes took our money  speckylated it said kipps with an illustrative flourish of the arm that failed to illustrate bort things dear and sold em cheap and played the ankeypankey jackass with everything we got thats what i mean es done ann he repeated this last sentence with the addition of violent adverbs  dyou mean to say our moneys gone artie  terdash it yes ann swore kipps exploding in a shout aint i tellin you  he was immediately sorry i didnt mean to oller at you ann he said but im all shook up i dont ardly know what im sayin evry penny  but artie  kipps grunted he went to the window and stared for a moment at a sunlit sea gord he swore  i mean he said coming back to ann and with an air of exasperation that hes bezzled and ooked it thats what i mean ann  ann put down the bib but wot are we going to do artie  kipps indicated ignorance wrath and despair with one comprehensive gesture of his hands he caught an ornament from the mantel and replaced it im going to bang about he said if i aint precious careful  you saw er you say  yes  what did she say xactly said ann  told me to see a slicitortole me to get someone to elp me at once she was there in blacklike she used to beand speaking cool and carefullike elen shes precious ard is elen she looked at me straight its my fault she said i ought to ave warned you only under the circumstances it was a little difficult straight as anything i didnt ardly say anything to er i didnt seem to begin to take it in until she was showing me out i adnt anything to say jest as well perhaps she talked like a call amost she saidwhat was it she said about her mother my mothers overcome with grief she said so naturally everything comes on me  and she told you to get someone to elp you  yes i been to old bean  o bean  yes what i took my business away from  what did he say  he was a bit offand at first but then e come round he couldnt tell me anything till e knew the facts what i know of young walshingham there wont be much elp in the facts no  he reflected for a space its a smashup ann more likely than not ann es left us overead in debt we got to get out of it just ow we can  we got to begin again he went on ow i dont know all the way ome my eads been going we got to get a living someow or other aving time to ourselves and a bit of money to spend and no hurry and worry its all over for ever ann we was fools ann we didnt know our benefits we been caught gord gord  he was on the verge of banging about again  they heard a jingle in the passage the large soft impact of a servants indoor boots as if she were a part a mitigatory part of fate came gwendolen to lay the midday meal kipps displayed selfcontrol forthwith ann picked up the bib again and bent over it and the kippses bore themselves gloomily perhaps but not despairfully while their dependant was in the room she spread the cloth and put out the cutlery with a slow inaccuracy and kipps after a whisper to himself went again to the window ann got up and put away her work methodically in the cheffonier  when i think said kipps as soon as the door closed again behind gwendolen when i think of the ole people and aving to tell em of it alli want to smesh my ead against the nearest wall smesh my silly brains out and bugginsbuggins what id arf promised to start in a lill outfitting shop in rendezvous street  gwendolen returned and restored dignity  the midday meal spread itself slowly before them gwendolen after her custom left the door open and kipps closed it carefully before sitting down  he stood for a moment regarding the meal doubtfully  i dont feel as if i could swaller a moufful he said  you got to eat said ann  for a time they said little and once swallowing was achieved ate on with a sort of melancholy appetite each was now busy thinking  after all said kipps presently whatever appens they cant turn us out or sell us up before nex quarterday im pretty sure about that  sell us up said ann  i dessey were bankrup said kipps trying to say it easily and helping himself with a trembling hand to unnecessary potatoes  then a long silence ann ceased to eat and there were silent tears  more potatoes artie choked ann  i couldnt said kipps no  he pushed back his plate which was indeed replete with potatoes got up and walked about the room even the dinnertable looked distraught and unusual  what to do i dont know he said  oh lord he ejaculated and picked up and slapped down a book  then his eye fell upon another postcard that had come from chitterlow by the mornings post and which now lay by him on the mantelshelf he took it up glanced at its imperfectly legible message and put it down  delayed he said scornfully not prodooced in the smalls or is it smells e says ow can one understand that anyow es umbugging again somefing about the strand no well es ad all the money ell ever get out of me im done  he seemed to find a momentary relief in the dramatic effect of his announcement he came near to a swagger of despair upon the hearthrug and then suddenly came and sat down next to ann and rested his chin on the knuckles of his two clenched hands  i been a fool ann he said in a gloomy monotone i been a brasted fool but its ard on us all the same its ard  ow was you to know said ann  i ought to ave known i did in a sort of way know and ere we are i wouldnt care so much if it was myself but its you ann ere we are regular smashed up and you he checked at an unspeakable aggravation of their disaster i knew e wasnt to be depended upon and there i left it and you got to pay whats to appen to us all i dont know  he thrust out his chin and glared at fate  ow do you know es speckylated everything said ann after a silent survey of him  e as said kipps irritably holding firm to disaster  she say so  she dont know of course but you depend upon it thats it she told me she knew something was on and when she found im gone and a note lef for her she knew it was up with im e went by the night boat she wrote that telegram off to me straight away  ann surveyed his features with tender perplexed eyes she had never seen him so white and drawn before and her hand rested an inch or so away from his arm the actual loss was still as it were afar from her the immediate thing was his enormous distress  ow do you know she said and stopped it would irritate him too much  kipps imagination was going headlong  sold up he emitted presently and ann flinched  going back to work day after dayi cant stand it ann i cant and you  it dont do to think of it said ann  presently he came upon a resolve i keep on thinking of it and thinking of it and whats to be done and whats to be done i shant be any good ome sarfernoon it keeps on going round and round in my ead and round and round i better go for a walk or something id be no comfort to you ann i should want to owl and ammer things if i ung about ome my fingers is all atwitch i shall keep on thinking ow i might ave stopped it and callin myself a fool  he looked at her between pleading and shame it seemed like deserting her  ann regarded him with teardimmed eyes  youd better do whats good for you artie she said ill be best cleaning its no use sending off gwendolen before her month and the top room wants turning out she added with a sort of grim humour may as well turn it out now while i got it  i better go for a walk said kipps  and presently our poor exploded kipps was marching out to bear his sudden misery habit turned him up the road towards his growing house and then suddenly he perceived his directionoh lorand turned aside and went up the steep way to the hill crest and the sandling road and over the line by that treeembowered junction and athwart the wide fields towards postlinga little black marching figureand so up the downs and over the hills whither he had never gone before   §2  he came back long after dark and ann met him in the passage  where you been artie she asked with a strained note in her voice  i been walking and walkingtrying to tire myself out all the time i been thinking what shall i do trying to fix something up all out of nothing  i didnt know you meant to be out all this time  kipps was gripped by compunction  i cant think what we ought to do he said presently  you cant do anything much artie not till you hear from mr bean  no i cant do anything much thats jest it and all this time i keep feelin if i dont do something the top of my eadll bust been trying to make up advertisements arf the time i been outbout finding a place good salesman and stockkeeper and good manchester dresses windowdressinglor fancy that all beginning again if you went to stay with sid a bitif i sent every penny i got to youi dunno i dunno  when they had gone to bed there was an elaborate attempt to get to sleep in one of their great waking pauses kipps remarked in a muffled tone i didnt mean to frighten you ann being out so late i kep on walking and walking and someow it seemed to do me good i went out to the illtop ever so far beyond stanford and sat there ever so long and it seemed to make me better just looking over the marsh like and seeing the sun set  very likely said ann after a long interval it isnt so bad as you think it is artie  its bad said kipps  very likely after all it isnt quite so bad if theres only a little  there came another long silence  ann said kipps in the quiet darkness  yes said ann  ann said kipps and stopped as though he had hastily shut a door upon speech  i kep thinking he said trying again i kep thinkingafter alli been cross to you and a fool about thingsabout them cards ann buthis voice shook to pieceswe ave been appy ann  someow  togever  and with that he and then she fell into a passion of weeping they clung very tightly togethercloser than they had been since ever the first brightness of their married days turned to the grey of common life again  all the disaster in the world could not prevent their going to sleep at last with their poor little troubled heads close together on one pillow there was nothing more to be done there was nothing more to be thought time might go on with his mischiefs but for a little while at least they still had one another   §3  kipps returned from his second interview with mr bean in a state of strange excitement he let himself in with his latchkey and slammed the door ann he shouted in an unusual note ann  ann replied distantly  something to tell you said kipps something noo  ann appeared apprehensive from the kitchen  ann he said going before her into the little diningroom for his news was too dignified for the passage very likely ann o bean says we shall ave he decided to prolong the suspense guess  i cant artie  think of a lot of money  a undred pounds praps  he spoke with immense deliberation o v e r a f o u s a n d p o u n d s  ann stared and said nothing only went a shade whiter  over he said amost certainly over  he shut the diningroom door and came forward hastily for ann it was clear meant to take this mitigation of their disaster with a complete abandonment of her selfcontrol she came near flopping she fell into his arms  artie she got to at last and began to weep clinging tightly to him  pretty near certain said kipps holding her a fousand pounds  i said artie she wailed on his shoulder with the note of accumulated wrongs very likely it wasnt so bad  theres things he said when presently he came to particulars e couldnt touch the noo place its freehold and paid for and with the bit of building on it theres five or six undred pound prapssay worf free undred for safety we cant be sold up to finish it like we thought o bean says we can very likely sell it and get money e says you often get a chance to sell a ouse lessen arf done specially freeold very likely e say then theres hughenden hughenden asnt been mortgaged not for more than arf its value theres a undred or so to be got on that and the furniture and the rent for the summer still coming in e says theres very likely other things a fousand pounds thats what e said e said it might even be more  they were sitting now at the table  it alters everything said ann  i been thinking that ann all the way ome i came in the motor car first ride ive ad since the smash we neednt send off gwendolen leastways not till after you know we neednt turn out of erenot for a long time what we been doing for the o people we can go on doing amost as much and your mother i wanted to oller coming along i pretty near run coming down the road by the hotel  oh i am glad we can stop ere and be comfortable a bit said ann i am glad for that  i pretty near told the driver on the motoronly e was the sort wont talk you see ann well be able to start a shop well be able to get into something like all about our aving to go back to places and that all that doesnt matter any more  for a while they abandoned themselves to ejaculating transports then they fell talking to shape an idea to themselves of the new prospect that opened before them  we must start a sort of shop said kipps whose imagination had been working itll ave to be a shop  drapery said ann  you want such a lot of capital for the drapery morn a thousand pounds you want by a long wayto start it anything like proper  well outfitting like buggins was going to do  kipps glanced at that for a moment because the idea had not occurred to him then he came back to his prepossession  well i thought of something else ann he said you see ive always thought a little bookshop it isnt like the draperyaving to be learnt i thoughteven before this smashupow id like to ave something to do instead of always aving olidays always like we ave been aving  he reflected  you dont know much about books do you artie  you dont want to he illustrated i noticed when we used to go to that libry at folkestone ladies werent anything like what they was in a drapersif you avent got just what they want its oh no and out they go but in a book shop its different one books very like anotherafter all what is it something to read and done with its not a thing that matters like print dresses or servietteswhere you either like em or dont and people judge you by they take what you give em in books and libries and glad to be told what to see ow we wasup at that libry  he paused you see ann  well i read n dvertisement the other day i been asking mr bean it saidfive undred pounds  what did  branches said kipps  ann failed to understand its a sort of thing that gets up book shops all over the country said kipps i didnt tell you but i arst about it a bit ony i dropped it again before this smash i mean id thought id like to keep a shop for a lark ony then i thought it silly besides it ud ave been beneath me  he blushed vividly it was a sort of projek of mine ann  ony it wouldnt ave done he added  it was a tortuous journey when the kippses set out to explain anything to each other but through a maze of fragmentary elucidations and questions their minds did presently begin to approximate to a picture of a compact bright little shop as a framework for themselves  i thought of it one day when i was in folkestone i thought of it one day when i was looking in at a window i see a chap dressin a window and he was whistlin reglar lightarted i thought then id like to keep a bookshop anyow jest for something to do and when people werent about then you could sit and read the books see it wouldnt be arf bad  they mused each with elbows on table and knuckles to lips looking with speculative eyes at each other  very likely well be appier than we should ave been with more money said kipps presently  we wasnt ardly suited reflected ann and left her sentence incomplete  fish out of water like said kipps  you wont ave to return that call now said kipps opening a new branch of the question thats one good thing  lor said ann visibly brightening no more i shant  i dont spose theyd want you to even if you didwith things as they are  a certain added brightness came into anns face nobody wont be able to come leaving cards on us artie now any more we are out of that  there isnt no necessity for us to be stuck up said kipps any more for ever ere we are ann common people with jest no position at all as you might say to keep up no sevnts not if you dont like no dressin better than other people if it wasnt we been robbeddashed if id care a rap about losing that money i blievehis face shone with the rare pleasure of paradoxi reely blieve ann itll prove a savin in the end   §4  the remarkable advertisement which had fired kipps imagination with this dream of a bookshop opened out in the most alluring way it was one little facet in a comprehensive scheme of transatlantic origin which was to make our oldworld methods of bookselling sit up and it displayed an imaginative briskness a lucidity and promise that aroused the profoundest scepticism in the mind of mr bean to kipps renewed investigations it presented itself in an expository illustrated pamphlet far too well printed mr bean thought for a reputable undertaking of the most convincing sort mr bean would not let him sink his capital in shares in its projected company that was to make all things new in the world of books but he could not prevent kipps becoming one of their associated booksellers and so when presently it became apparent that an epoch was not to be made and the associated booksellers trading union limited receded and dissolved and liquidated a few drops and vanished and went away to talk about something else kipps remained floating undamaged in this interestingly uncertain universe as an independent bookseller  except that it failed the associated booksellers trading union had all the stigmata of success its fault perhaps was that it had them all instead of only one or two it was to buy wholesale for all its members and associates and exchange stock having a common booksinstock list and a common lending library and it was to provide a uniform registered shop front to signify all these things to the intelligent passerby except that it was controlled by buoyant young overmen with a touch of genius in their arithmetic it was i say a most plausible and hopeful project kipps went several times to london and an agent came to hythe mr bean made some timely interventions and then behind a veil of planks and an announcement in the high street the uniform registered shop front came rapidly into being associated booksellers trading union said this shop front in a refined artistic lettering that bookbuyers were going to value as wise men over forty value the proper label for berncasteler doctor and then arthur kipps  next to starting a haberdashers shop i doubt if kipps could have been more truly happy than during those weeks of preparation  there is of course nothing on earth and i doubt at times if there is a joy in heaven like starting a small haberdashers shop imagine for example having a drawerful of tapes one whole piece most exquisitely blocked of every possible width of tape or again an army of neat large packages each displaying one sample of hooks and eyes think of your cottons your drawer of coloured silks the little less least of the compartments and thin packets of your needle drawer poor princes and wretched gentlefolk mysteriously above retail trade may taste only the faint unsatisfactory shadow of these delights with trays of stamps or butterflies i write of course for those to whom these things appeal there are clods alive who see nothing or next to nothing in spools of mercerised cotton and endless bands of paperset pins i write for the wise and as i write i wonder that kipps resisted haberdashery he did yet even starting a bookshop is at least twenty times as interesting as building your own house to your own design in unlimited space and time or any possible thing people with indisputable social position and sound securities can possibly find to do upon that i rest  you figure kipps going to have a look to see how the little shop is getting on the shop that is not to be a loss and a spending of money but a gain he does not walk too fast towards it as he comes into view of it his paces slacken and his head goes to one side he crosses to the pavement opposite in order to inspect the fascia better already his name is adumbrated in faint white lines stops in the middle of the road and scrutinises imaginary details for the benefit of his future next door neighbour the curiosityshop man and so at last in a smell of paint and of the shavings of imperfectly seasoned pinewood the shop is already glazed and a carpenter is busy over the fittings for adjustable shelves in the side windows a painter is busy on the fixtures round about shelving above and drawers below which are to accommodate most of the stock and the counterthe counter and desk are done kipps goes inside the desk the desk which is to be the strategic centre of the shop brushes away some sawdust and draws out the marvellous till here gold is to be here silver here coppernotes locked up in a cashbox in the well below then he leans his elbows on the desk rests his chin on his fist and fills the shelves with imaginary stock books beyond reading every day a man who cares to wash his hands and read uncut pages artfully may have his cake and eat it among that stock under the counter to the right paper and string are to lurk ready to leap up and embrace goods sold on the table to the left art publications whatever they may prove to be he maps it out serves an imaginary customer receives a dream seven and six pence packs bows out he wonders how it was he ever came to fancy a shop a disagreeable place  its different he says at last after musing on that difficulty being your own  it is different  or again you figure kipps with something of the air of a young sacristan handling his brightly virginal accountbooks and looking and looking again and then still looking at an unparalleled specimen of copperplate engraving ruled money below and above bearing the words in account with arthur kipps loud flourishes the booksellers trading union temperate decoration you figure ann sitting and stitching at one point of the circumference of the light of the lamp stitching queer little garments for some unknown stranger and over against her sits kipps before him is one of those engraved memorandum forms a moist pad wet with some thick and greasy greenish purple ink that is also spreading quietly but steadily over his fingers a crossnibbed pen for firstaid surgical assistance to the patient in his hand a dating rubber stamp at intervals he brings down this latter with great care and emphasis upon the paper and when he lifts it there appears a beautiful oval design of which paid arthur kipps the associated booksellers trading union and a date are the essential ingredients stamped in purple ink  anon he turns his attention to a box of small round yellow labels declaring this book was bought from the associated booksellers trading union he licks one with deliberate care sticks it on the paper before him and defaces it with great solemnity i can do it ann he says looking up brightly for the associated booksellers trading union among other brilliant notions and inspirations devised an ingenious system of taking back its books again in part payment for new ones within a specified period when it failed all sorts of people were left with these unredeemed pledges in hand   §5  amidst all this bustle and interest all this going to and fro before they moved in to the high street came the great crisis that hung over the kippses and one morning in the small hours anns child was born  kipps was coming to manhood swiftly now the once rabbitlike soul that had been so amazed by the discovery of chubes in the human interior and so shocked by the sight of a womans shoulderblades that had found shame and anguish in a mislaid gibus and terror in an anagram tea was at last facing the greater realities he came suddenly upon the master thing in life birth he passed through hours of listening hours of impotent fear in the night and in the dawn and then there was put into his arms something most wonderful a weak and wailing creature incredibly heartstirringly soft and pitiful with minute appealing hands that it wrung his heart to see he held this miracle in his arms and touched its tender cheek as if he feared his lips might injure it and this marvel was his son  and there was ann with a greater strangeness and a greater familiarity in her quality than he had ever found before there were little beads of perspiration on her temples and her lips and her face was flushed not pale as he had feared to see it she had the look of one who emerges from some strenuous and invigorating act he bent down and kissed her and he had no words to say she wasnt to speak much yet but she stroked his arm with her hand and had to tell him one thing  hes over nine pounds artie she whispered bessiesbessies wasnt no more than eight  to have given kipps a pound of triumph over sid seemed to her almost to justify nunc dimittis she watched his face for a moment then closed her eyes in a kind of blissful exhaustion as the nurse with something motherly in her manner pushed kipps out of the room   §6  kipps was far too much preoccupied with his own life to worry about the further exploits of chitterlow the man had got his two thousand on the whole kipps was glad he had had it rather than young walshingham and there was an end to the matter as for the complicated transactions he achieved and proclaimed by mainly illegible and always incomprehensible postcards they were like passing voices heard in the street as one goes about ones urgent concerns kipps put them aside and they got in between the pages of the stock and were lost forever and sold in with the goods to customers who puzzled over them mightily  then one morning as he was dusting round before breakfast chitterlow returned appeared suddenly in the shop doorway  kipps was overcome with amazement  it was the most unexpected thing in the world the man was in evening dress evening dress in that singularly crumpled state it assumes after the hour of dawn and above his dishevelled red hair a smallish gibus hat tilted remarkably forward he opened the door and stood tall and spread with one vast white glove flung out as if to display how burst a glove might be his eyes bright such wrinkling of brow and mouth as only an experienced actor can produce and a singular radiance of emotion upon his whole being an altogether astonishing spectacle  it was amazing beyond the powers of kipps the bell jangled for a bit and then gave it up and was silent for a long great second everything was quietly attentive kipps was amazed to his uttermost had he had ten times the capacity he would still have been fully amazed its chitlow he said at last standing duster in hand  but he doubted whether it was not a dream  tzit gasped that most excitable and extraordinary person still in an incredibly expanded attitude and then with a slight forward jerk of the starry split glove bif  he could say no more the tremendous speech he had had ready vanished from his mind kipps stared at his extraordinary facial changes vaguely conscious of the truth of the teachings of nisbet and lombroso concerning men of genius  then suddenly chitterlows features were convulsed the histrionic fell from him like a garment and he was weeping he said something indistinct about old kipps good old kipps oh old kipps and somehow he managed to mix a chuckle and a sob in the most remarkable way he emerged from somewhere near the middle of his original attitude a merely lifesize creature my play boohoo he sobbed clutching at his friends arm my play kipps sob you know  well cried kipps with his heart sinking in sympathy it aint  no howled chitterlow no its a success my dear chap my dear boy oh its abuboohooa big success he turned away and wiped streaming tears with the back of his hand he walked a pace or so and turned he sat down on one of the specially designed artistic chairs of the associated booksellers trading union and produced an exiguous ladys handkerchief extraordinarily belaced he choked my play and covered his face here and there  he made an unsuccessful effort to control himself and shrank for a space to the dimensions of a small and pathetic creature his great nose suddenly came through a careless place in the handkerchief  im knocked he said in a muffled voice and so remained for a spacewonderfulveiled  he made a gallant effort to wipe his tears away i had to tell you he said gulping  be all right in a minute he added calm and sat still  kipps stared in commiseration of such success then he heard footsteps and went quickly to the house doorway jest a minute he said dont go in the shop ann for a minute its chitterlow hes a bit essited but hell be better in a minute its knocked him over a bit you seehis voice sank to a hushed note as one who announces deathes made a success with his play  he pushed her back lest she should see the scandal of another males tears  soon chitterlow felt better but for a little while his manner was even alarmingly subdued i had to come and tell you he said i had to astonish someone murielshell be firstrate of course but shes over at dymchurch he blew his nose with enormous noise and emerged instantly a merely garrulous optimist  i expect shell be precious glad  she doesnt know yet my dear boy shes at dymchurchwith a friend shes seen some of my first nights before better out of it im going to her now ive been up all nighttalking to the boys and all that im a bit off it just for a bit butit knocked em it knocked everybody  he stared at the floor and went on in a monotone they laughed a bit at the beginningbut nothing like a settled laughnot until the second actyou knowthe chap with the beetle down his neck little chisholme did that bit to rights then they beganto rights his voice warmed and increased laughing it made me laugh we jumped em into the third act before they had time to cool everybody was on it i never saw a first night go so fast laugh laugh laugh laugh laugh laugh he howled the last word with stupendous violence everything they laughed at they laughed at things that we hadnt meant to be funnynot for one moment bif bizz curtain a fair knockout i went onbut i didnt say a word chisholme did the patter shouting it was like walking under niagaragoing across that stage it was like never having seen an audience before  then afterwardsthe boys  his emotion held him for a space dear old boys he murmured  his words multiplied his importance increased in a little while he was restored to something of his old self he was enormously excited he seemed unable to sit down anywhere he came into the breakfastroom so soon as kipps was sure of him shook hands with mrs kipps parenthetically sat down and immediately got up again he went to the bassinette in the corner and looked absentmindedly at kipps junior and said he was glad if only for the youngsters sake he immediately resumed the thread of his discourse he drank a cup of coffee noisily and walked up and down the room talking while they attempted breakfast amidst the gale of his excitement the infant slept marvellously through it all  you wont mind my sitting down mrs kipps i couldnt sit down for anyone or id do it for you its you im thinking of more than anyone you and muriel and all old pals and good friends it means wealth it means moneyhundreds and thousands if youd heard em youd know  he was silent through a portentous moment while topics battled for him and finally he burst and talked of them all together it was like the rush of water when a dam bursts and washes out a fairsized provincial town all sorts of things floated along on the swirl for example he was discussing his future behaviour im glad its come now not before ive had my lesson i shall be very discreet now trust me weve learnt the value of money he discussed the possibility of a country house of taking a martello tower as a swimmingbox as one might say a shootingbox of living in venice because of its artistic associations and scenic possibilities of a flat in westminster or a house in the west end he also raised the question of giving up smoking and drinking and what classes of drink were especially noxious to a man of his constitution but discourses on all this did not prevent a parenthetical computation of the probable profits on the supposition of a thousand nights here and in america nor did it ignore the share kipps was to have nor the gladness with which chitterlow would pay that share nor the surprise and regret with which he had learnt through an indirect source which awakened many associations of the turpitude of young walshingham nor the distaste chitterlow had always felt for young walshingham and men of his type an excursus upon napoleon had got into the torrent somehow and kept bobbing up and down the whole thing was thrown into the form of a single complex sentence with parenthetical and subordinate clauses fitting one into the other like chinese boxes and from first to last it never even had an air of approaching anything in the remotest degree partaking of the nature of a full stop  into this deluge came the daily news like the gleam of light in watts picture the waters were assuaged while its sheet was opened and it had a column a whole column of praise chitterlow held the paper and kipps read over his left hand and ann under his right it made the affair more real to kipps it seemed even to confirm chitterlow against lurking doubts he had been concealing but it took him away he departed in a whirl to secure a copy of every morning paper every blessed rag there is and take them all to dymchurch and muriel forthwith it had been the sendoff the boys had given him that had prevented his doing as much at charing crosslet alone that he only caught it by the skin of his teeth besides which the bookstall wasnt open his white face lit by a vast excitement bid them a tremendous farewell and he departed through the sunlight with his buoyant walk buoyant almost to the tottering pitch his hair as one got it sunlit in the street seemed to have grown in the night  they saw him stop a newsboy  every blessed rag floated to them on the notes of that gorgeous voice  the newsboy too had happened on luck something like a faint cheer from the newsboy came down the air to terminate that transaction  chitterlow went on his way swinging a great budget of papers a figure of merited success the newsboy recovered from his emotion with a jerk examined something in his hand again transferred it to his pocket watched chitterlow for a space and then in a sort of hushed silence resumed his daily routine  ann and kipps watched that receding happiness in silence until he vanished round the bend of the road  i am glad said ann at last speaking with a little sigh  som i said kipps with emphasis for if ever a feller as worked and waitedits im  they went back through the shop rather thoughtfully and after a peep at the sleeping baby resumed their interrupted breakfast if ever a feller as worked and waited its im said kipps cutting bread  very likely its true said ann a little wistfully  whats true  about all that money coming  kipps meditated i dont see why it shouldnt be he decided and handed ann a piece of bread on the tip of his knife  but well keep on the shop he said after an interval for further reflection all the same i avent much trust in money after the things weve seen   §7  that was two years ago and as the whole world knows the pestered butterfly is running still it was true it has made the fortune of a once declining little theatre in the strand night after night the great beetle scene draws happy tears from a house packed to repletion and kippsfor all that chitterlow is not what one might call a business manis almost as rich as he was in the beginning people in australia people in lancashire scotland ireland in new orleans in jamaica in new york and montreal have crowded through doorways to kipps enrichment lured by the hitherto unsuspected humours of the entomological drama wealth rises like an exhalation all over our little planet and condenses or at least some of it does in the pockets of kipps  its rum said kipps  he sat in the little kitchen out behind the bookshop and philosophised and smiled while ann gave arthur waddy kipps his evening tub before the fire kipps was always present at this ceremony unless customers prevented there was something in the mixture of the odours of tobacco soap and domesticity that charmed him unspeakably  chuckerdee o man he said affably wagging his pipe at his son and thought incidentally after the manner of all parents that very few children could have so straight and clean a body  daddas got a cheque said arthur waddy kipps emerging for a moment from the towel  e gets old of everything said ann you cant say a word  dadda got a cheque this marvellous child repeated  yes o man i got a cheque and its got to go into a bank for you against when you got to go to school see sos youll grow up knowing your way about a bit  daddas got a cheque said the wonder son and then gave his mind to making mighty splashes with his foot every time he splashed laughter overcame him and he had to be held up for fear he should tumble out of the tub in his merriment finally he was towelled to his toetips wrapped up in warm flannel and kissed and carried off to bed by anns cousin and lady help emma and then after ann had carried away the bath into the scullery she returned to find her husband with his pipe extinct and the cheque still in his hand  two fousand pounds he said its dashed rum wot ave i done to get two fousand pounds ann  what avent younot to said ann  he reflected upon this view of the case  i shant never give up this shop he said at last  were very appy ere said ann  not if i ad fifty fousand pounds  no fear said ann  you got a shop said kipps and you come along in a years time and there it is but moneylook ow it come and goes theres no sense in money you may kill yourself trying to get it and then it comes when you arent looking theres my riginal money where is it now gone and its took young walshingham with it and es gone too its like playing skittles long comes the ball right and left you fly and there it is rolling away and not changed a bit no sense in it es gone and shes gonegone off with that chap revel that sat with me at dinner merried man and chitlow rich lorwhat a fine place that gerrik club is to be sure where i ad lunch wiv im bettern any otel footmen in powder they gotnot waiters annfootmen es rich and me richin a sort of way dont seem much sense in it ann owever you look at it he shook his head  i know one thing said kipps  what  im going to put it in jest as many different banks as i can see fifty ere fifty there posit im not going to nvest itno fear  its only frowing money away said ann  im arf a mind to bury some of it under the shop only i expect one ud always be coming down at nights to make sure it was there i dont seem to trust anyonenot with money he put the cheque on the table corner and smiled and tapped his pipe on the grate with his eyes on that wonderful document spose old bean started orf he reflected one thing e is a bit lame  e wouldnt said ann not im  i was only joking like he stood up put his pipe among the candlesticks on the mantel took up the cheque and began folding it carefully to put it back in his pocketbook  a little bell jangled  shop said kipps thats right keep a shop and the shopll keep you thats ow i look at it ann  he drove his pocketbook securely into his breast pocket before he opened the livingroom door  but whether indeed it is the bookshop that keeps kipps or whether it is kipps who keeps the bookshop is just one of those commercial mysteries people of my unarithmetical temperament are never able to solve they do very well the dears anyhow thank heaven  the bookshop of kipps is on the lefthand side of the hythe high street coming from folkestone between the yard of the livery stable and the shopwindow full of old silver and such like thingsit is quite easy to findand there you may see him for yourself and speak to him and buy this book of him if you like he has it in stock i know very delicately ive seen to that his name is not kipps of course you must understand that but everything else is exactly as i have told you you can talk to him about books about politics about going to boulogne about life and the ups and downs of life perhaps he will quote you bugginsfrom whom by the bye one can now buy everything a gentlemans wardrobe should contain at the little shop in rendezvous street folkestone if you are fortunate to find kipps in a good mood he may even let you know how he inherited a fortune once run froo it hell say with a not unhappy smile got another afterwardsspeckylating in plays neednt keep this shop if i didnt like but its something to do  or he may be even more intimate i seen some things he said to me once raver life why once ii loped i didreely  of course you will not tell kipps that he is kipps or that i have put him in this book he does not know and you know one never knows how people are going to take that sort of thing i am an old and trusted customer now and for many amiable reasons i should prefer that things remained exactly on their present footing   §8  one earlyclosing evening in july they left the baby to the servant cousin and kipps took ann for a row on the hythe canal it was a glorious evening and the sun set in a mighty blaze and left a world warm and very still the twilight came and there was the water shining bright and the sky a deepening blue and the great trees that dipped their boughs towards the water exactly as it had been when he paddled home with helen when her eyes had seemed to him like dusky stars he had ceased from rowing and rested on his oars and suddenly he was touched by the wonder of life the strangeness that is a presence stood again by his side  out of the darknesses beneath the shallow weedy stream of his being rose a question a question that looked up dimly and never reached the surface it was the question of the wonder of the beauty the purposeless inconsecutive beauty that falls so strangely among the happenings and memories of life it never reached the surface of his mind it never took to itself substance or form it looked up merely as the phantom of a face might look out of deep waters and sank again to nothingness  artie said ann  he woke up and pulled a stroke what he said  penny for your thoughts artie  he considered  i reely dont think i was thinking of anything he said at last with a smile no  he still rested on his oars  i expect he said i was thinking jest what a rum go everything is i expect it was something like that  queer old artie  aint i i dont suppose there ever was a chap quite like me before  he reflected for just another minute oo i dunno he said and roused himself to
