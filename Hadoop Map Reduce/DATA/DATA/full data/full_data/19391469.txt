book i     a society scandal  tall and burly with features and skin hardened by exposure to the sun and winds of many climates he looked like a man ready to face all hardships equal to any emergency already one seemed to see the clothes and habits of civilization falling away from him the former to be replaced by the stern unlovely outfit of the war correspondent who plays the game they crowded round him in the club smoking room for these were his last few minutes they had dined him toasted him and the club loving cup had been drained to his success and his safe return for lovell was a popular member of this very bohemian gathering and he was going to the far east at a few hours notice to represent one of the greatest of english dailies  a pale slight young man who stood at this right hand was speaking his name was walter aynesworth and he was a writer of short storiesa novelist in embryo  what i envy you most lovell he declared is your escape from the deadly routine of our day by day life here in london it seems to me that we live the life of automatons we lunch we dine we amuse or we bore ourselves and we sleepand all the rest of the world does the same passion we have outgrown emotion we have destroyed by analysis the storms which shake humanity break over other countries what is there left to us of life civilization ministers too easily to our needs existence has become a habit no wonder that we are a tired race  life is the same the world over another man remarked with every forward step in civilization life must become more mechanical london is no worse than paris or paris than tokyo  aynesworth shook his head i dont agree with you he replied it is the same more or less with all european countries but the saxon temperament with its mixture of philosophy and philistinism more than any other gravitates towards the life mechanical existence here has become fossilized we wear a mask upon our faces we carry a gauge for our emotions lovell is going where the one great force of primitive life remains he is going to see war he is going to breathe an atmosphere hot with naked passion he is going to rub shoulders with men who walk hand in hand with death thats the sort of tonic we all want to remind us that we are human beings with blood in our veins and not sawduststuffed dolls  then lovell broke silence he took his pipe from his mouth and he addressed aynesworth  walter he said you are talking rot there is nothing very complex or stimulating about the passion of war when men kill one another unseen where you feel the sting in your heart which comes from god knows where and you crumple up with never a chance to have a go at the chap who has potted you from the trenches or behind a rock a thousand yards off mine is going to be except from a spectacular point of view a very barren sort of year compared with what yours might be if the fire once touched your eyes i go where life is cruder and fiercer perhaps but you remain in the very city of tragedies  aynesworth laughed as he lit a fresh cigarette  city of tragedies he exclaimed it sounds all right but its bunkum all the same show me where they lie lovell old chap tell me where to stir the waters  several of those who were watching him noticed a sudden change in lovells face the good humor and bonhomie called up by this last evening amongst his old friends had disappeared his face had fallen into graver lines his eyes seemed fixed with a curious introspective steadiness on a huge calendar which hung from the wall when at last he turned towards aynesworth his tone was almost solemn  some of them dont lie so very far from the surface walter he said there is onehe took out his watchthere is one which if you like i will tell you about i have just ten minutes  good  go ahead lovell old chap  have a drink first  he held out his hand they were all silent he stood up amongst them by far the tallest man there with his back to the chimney piece and his eyes still lingering about that calendar  thirteen years ago he said two young mencall them by their christian names wingrave and lumleyshared a somewhat extensive hunting box in leicestershire they were both of good family well off and fairly popular lumley the more so perhaps he represented the ordinary type of young englishman with a stronger dash than usual of selfishness wingrave stood for other things he was reticent and impenetrable people called him mysterious  lovell paused for a moment to refill his pipe the sudden light upon his face as he struck a match seemed to bring into vivid prominence something there indescribable in words yet which affected his hearers equally with the low gravity of his speech the man himself was feeling the tragedy of the story he told  they seemed he continued always to get on well together until they fell in love with the same woman her name we will say was ruth she was the wife of the master of hounds with whom they hunted if i had the storywriting gifts of aynesworth here i would try to describe her as i havent i will simply give you a crude idea of what she seemed like to me  she was neither dark nor fair short nor tall amongst a crowd of other women she seemed undistinguishable by any special gifts yet when you had realized her there was no other woman in the room she had the eyes of an angel only they were generally veiled she had the figure of a miniature venus soft and with delicate curves which seemed somehow to be always subtly asserting themselves although she affected in her dress an almost puritanical simplicity her presence in a room was always felt at once there are some women beautiful or plain whose sex one scarcely recognizes she was not one of these she seemed to carry with her the concentrated essence of femininity her quiet movements the almost noiseless rustling of her clothes the quaint undistinguishable perfumes which she used her soft even voice were all things which seemed individual to her she was like a study in undernotes and yetlovell paused a momentand yet no spanish dancing woman whose dark eyes and voluptuous figure have won her the crown of the demimonde ever possessed that innate and mystic gift of kindling passion like that woman i told you i couldnt describe her i cant i can only speak of effects if my story interests you you must build up your own idea of her  becky sharpe aynesworth murmured  lovell nodded  perhaps he admitted only ruth was a lady to go on with my story a hunting coterie as you fellows know means lots of liberty and a general freeandeasiness amongst the sexes which naturally leads to flirtations more or less serious ruths little affairs were either too cleverly arranged or too harmless for gossip amongst the other women of the hunt she seemed outwardly almost demure but one daythere was a row  lovell paused and took a drink from a glass by his side  i hope you fellows wont think that im spinning this out he said it is after all in itself only a commonplace story but ive carried it locked up in my memory for years and now that ive let it loose it unwinds itself slowly this is how the row came about lumley one afternoon missed wingrave and ruth from the hunting field someone most unfortunately happened to tell him that they had left the run together and had been seen riding together towards white lodge which was the name of the house where these two young men lived lumley followed them he rode into the stable yard and found there ruths mare and wingraves covert hack from which he had not changed when they had left the field both animals had evidently been ridden hard and there was something ominous in the smile with which the head groom told him that lady ruth and wingrave were in the house  the two men had separate dens wingraves was much the better furnished as he was a young man of considerable taste and he had also fitted it with sporting trophies collected from many countries this room was at the back of the house and lumley deliberately crossed the lawn and looked in at the window  lovell paused for a moment or two to relight his pipe  remember he continued that i have to put this story together partly from facts which came to my knowledge afterwards and partly from reasonable deductions i may say at once that i do not know what lumley saw when he played the spy the housekeeper had just taken tea in and it is possible that wingrave may have been holding his guests hand or that something in their faces or attitude convinced him that his jealousy was well founded anyhow it is certain that lumley was half beside himself with rage when he strode away from that window then in the avenue he must have heard the soft patter of hounds coming along the lane or perhaps seen the pink coats of the huntsmen through the hedge this much is certain he hurried down the drive and returned with ruths husband  lovell took another drink no one spoke no one even made a remark the little circle of listeners had caught something of his own gravity the story was an ordinary one enough but something in lovells manner of telling it seemed somehow to bring into their consciousness the apprehension of the tangled web of passions which burned underneath its sordid details  ruths husbandsir william i will call himstood side by side with lumley before the window what they saw i cannot tell you they entered the room the true story of what happened there i doubt if anyone will ever know the evidence of servants spoke of raised voices and the sound of a heavy fall when they were summoned sir william lay on the floor unconscious lady ruth had fainted lumley and wingrave were both bending over the former on the floor were fragments of paper which were afterwards put together and found to be the remains of a check for a large amount payable to lady ruth and signed by wingrave  the sequel is very soon told sir william died in a few days and wingrave on the evidence of lumley and ruth was committed for manslaughter and sent to prison for fifteen years  lovell paused a murmur went round the little group of listeners the story after all except for lovells manner of telling it was an ordinary one everyone felt that there was something else behind  so they asked no questions whilst lovell drank his whisky and soda and refilled his pipe again his eyes seemed to wander to the calendar  according to lady ruths evidence he said thoughtfully her husband entered the room at the exact moment when she was rejecting wingraves advances and indignantly refusing a check which he was endeavoring to persuade her to accept a struggle followed between the two men with fatal results for sir william that he added slowly is the story which the whole world read and which most of it believes here however are a few corrections of my own and a suggestion or two for you aynesworth and those of you who like to consider yourselves truth seekers first then lady ruth was a selfinvited guest at white lodge she had asked wingrave to return with her and as they sat together in his room she confessed that she was worried and asked for his advice she was in some money trouble ingeniously explained no doubt wingrave with the utmost delicacy offered his assistance which was of course accepted it was exactly what she was there for she was in the act of taking the check when she saw her husband and lumley her reputation was at stake her subsequent course of action and evidence becomes obvious the check unexplained was ruin she explained it  of the struggle and of the exact means by which sir william received his injuries i know nothing there is the evidence it may or may not be true the most serious part of the case so far as lady ruth was concerned lay in the facts as to her husbands removal from the white lodge in an unconscious state he was driven almost twelve miles at a walking pace no stimulants were administered and though they passed two doctors houses no stop was made a doctor was not sent for until half an hour after they reached home and even then they seemed to have chosen the one who lived furthest away the conclusion is obvious enough to anyone who knows the facts of the case sir william was not meant to live  wingraves trial was a famous one he had no friends and few sympathizers and he insisted upon defending himself his cross examination of the man who had been his friend created something like a sensation amongst other things he elicited the fact that lumley after first seeing the two together had gone and fetched sir william it was a terrible half hour for lumley and when he left the box amongst the averted faces of his friends the sweat was pouring down his face i can seem him now as though it were yesterday then lady ruth followed she was quietly dressed the effect she produced was excellent she told her story she hinted at the insult she spoke of the check she had imagined no harm in accepting wingraves invitation to tea men and women of the hunt who were on friendly terms treated one another as comrades she spoke of the blow she had seen it delivered and so on and all the time i sat within a few feet of wingrave and i knew that in the black box before him were burning love letters from this woman to the man whose code of honor would ever have protected her husband from disgrace and i knew that i was listening to the thing which you aynesworth and many of your fellow story writers have so wisely and so ignorantly dilated uponthe vengeance of a woman denied only i heard the words themselves cold earnest words fall one by one from her lips like a sentence of doomand there was life in the thing life and death when she had finished the whole court was in a state of tension everyone was leaning forward it would be the most piquant the most wonderful cross examination every heardthe woman lying to save her honor and to achieve her vengeance the man on trial for his life wingrave stood up lady ruth raised her veil and looked at him from the witness box there was the most intense silence i ever realized who could tell the things which flashed from one to the other across the dark well of the court who could measure the fierce silent scorn which seemed to blaze from his eyes as he held her therehis slave until he chose to give the signal for release at last he looked away towards the judge and the woman fell forward in the box gasping a crumpled up nerveless heap of humanity  my lord he said i have no questions to ask this witness  everyone staggered wingraves few friends were horrified after that there was of course no hope for him he got fifteen years penal servitude  like an echo from that pentup murmur of feeling which had rippled through the crowded court many years ago his little group of auditors almost gasped as lovell left his place and strolled down the room aynesworth laid his hand upon his shoulder  all the time he said you were looking at that calendar why  lovell once more faced them he was standing with his back to a round table strewn with papers and magazines  it was the date he said and the fact that i must leave england within a few hours which forced this story from me tomorrow wingrave will be free listen aynesworth he continued turning towards him and the rest of you who fancy that it is i who am leaving a humdrum city for the world of tragedies i leave you the legacy of a greater one than all asia will yield to me lady ruth is married to lumley and they hold today in london a very distinguished social position tomorrow wingrave takes a hand in the game he was once my friend i was in court when he was tried i was intimately acquainted with the lawyers clerk who had the arrangement of his papers i know what no one else breathing knows he is a man who never forgives a man who was brutally deceived and who for years has had no other occupation than to brood upon his wrongs he is very wealthy indeed still young he has marvelous tenacity of purpose and he has brains tomorrow he will be free  aynesworth drew a little breath  i wonder he murmured if anything will happen  lovell shrugged his shoulders  where i go he said the cruder passions may rage and life and death be reckoned things of little account but you who remainwho can tellyou may look into the face of mightier things     outside the pale  three men were together in a large and handsomely furnished sitting room of the clarence hotel in piccadilly one pale quiet and unobtrusive dressed in sober black the typical lawyers clerk was busy gathering up a collection of papers and documents from the table over which they had been strewn his employer who had more the appearance of a country gentleman than the junior partner in the wellknown firm of rocke and son solicitors had risen to his feet and was drawing on his gloves at the head of the table was the client  i trust sir wingrave that you are satisfied with this account of our stewardship the solicitor said as his clerk left the room we have felt it a great responsibility at times but everything seems to have turned out very well the investments of course are all above suspicion  perfectly satisfied i thank you was the quiet reply you seem to have studied my interests in a very satisfactory manner  mr rocke had other things to say but his clients manner seemed designed to create a barrier of formality between them he hesitated unwilling to leave yet finding it exceedingly difficult to say the things which were in his mind he temporized by referring back to matters already discussed solely for the purpose of prolonging the interview  you have quite made up your mind then to put the tredowen property on the market he remarked you will excuse my reminding you of the fact that you have large accumulated funds in hand and nearly a hundred thousand pounds worth of easily realizable securities tredowen has been in your mothers family for a good many years and i should doubt whether it will be easily disposed of  the man at the head of the table raised his head he looked steadily at the lawyer who began to wish that he had left the room with his clerk decidedly sir wingrave seton was not an easy man to get on with  my mind is quite made up thank you on this and all other matters concerning which i have given you instructions was the calm reply i have had plenty of time for consideration he added drily  the lawyer had his opening at last and he plunged  sir wingrave he said we were at college together and our connection is an old one you must forgive me if i say how glad i am to see you here and to know that your bad time is over i can assure you that you have had my deepest sympathy nothing ever upset me so much as that unfortunate affair i sincerely trust that you will do your best now to make up for lost time you are still young and you are rich let us leave business alone now for the moment what can i do for you as a friend if you will allow me to call you so  wingrave turned slightly in his chair in his altered position a ray of sunshine fell for the first time upon his gaunt but striking face lined and hardened as though by exposure and want of personal care there was also a lack of sensibility an almost animal callousness on the coldly lit eyes and unflinching mouth which readily suggested some terrible and recent experiencesomething potent enough to have dried up the human nature out of the man and left him soulless his clothes had the impress of the readymade although he wore them with a distinction which was obviously inherent and notwithstanding the fact that he seemed to have been writing he wore gloves  i am much obliged to you rocke he said let me repeat your question what is there that you can do for me  mr rocke was apparently a little nonplussed the absolute imperturbability of the man who had once been his friend was disconcerting  well he said the governor sent me instead of coming himself because he thought that i might be more useful to you london changes so quicklyyou would hardly know your way about now i should like you to come and dine with me tonight and ill take you round anywhere you care to go and then if you dont want to go back to your old tradespeople i could take you to my tailor and bookmaker  is that all wingrave asked calmly  rocke was again taken aback  certainly not he answered there must be many ways in which i could be useful to you but i cant think of them all at once i am here to serve you professionally or as a friend to the best of my ability can you suggest anything yourself what do you want  that is the question wingrave said which i have been asking myself unfortunately up to now i have not been able to answer it regarding myself however from the point of view of a third party i should say that the thing i was most in need of was the society of my fellow creatures  exactly rocke declared that is what i thought you would say it wont take us long to arrange something of the sort for you  can you put me up wingrave asked at your club and introduce me to your friends there  rocke flinched before the steady gaze of those cold enquiring eyes in which he fancied too that a gleam of malice shone the color mounted to his cheeks it was a most embarrassing situation  i can introduce you to some decent fellows of course and to some very charming ladies he said hesitatingly but as to the clubiwell dont you think yourself that it would scarcely be wise to  exactly wingrave interrupted and these ladies that you spoke of  oh theres no difficulty about that rocke declared with an air of relief i can make up a little dinner party for tonight if you like theres an awfully smart american woman over here with the fanciful fan companyim sure youd like her and shed come like a shot then id get daisy vaneshes all right they dont know anything and wouldnt care if they did besides you could call yourself what you liked  thank you wingrave said i am afraid i did not make myself quite clear i was not thinking of play fellows i was thinking of the men and women of my own order shall i put the matter quite clearly can i take my place in society under my own name renew my old friendships and build up new ones can i do this even at the risk of a few difficulties at first i am not a sensitive man i am prepared for the usual number of disagreeable incidents but can i win my way through  with his back against the wall rocke displayed more courage besides what was the use of mincing matters with a man who had all the appearance of a human automaton who never flinched or changed color and whose passions seemed dried up and withered things  i am afraid not sir wingrave he said i should not recommend you to try at any rate for the present  give me your reasons was the cool response  i will do so with pleasure rocke answered about the time of the trial and immediately afterwards there was a certain amount of sympathy for you people felt that you must have received a good deal of provocation and there were several unexplained incidents which told in your favor today i should think that the feeling amongst those who remember the affair at all is rather the other way you heard i believe that lady ruth married lumley barrington  yes  barrington has been very successful at the bar and they say that he is certain of a judgeship before long his wife has backed him up well they have entertained lavishly and today i should think that she is one of the most popular hostesses in london in her earlier days i used to hear that she was one of the very fast hunting setthat was the time when you knew her i can assure you that if ever that was true she is a completely altered woman today she is patroness of half a dozen great charitable schemes she writes very clever articles in the reviews on the betterment of the poor question and royalty itself visits at her house  i see wingrave said drily i was not aware of these changes  if ever mr rocke continued people were inclined to look a little askance at her that has all gone by today she is one of the last women in the world of whom people would be likely to believe ill  wingrave nodded slowly  i am very much obliged to you he said for this information you seem to have come here today mr rocke with good intentions towards me let me ask you to put yourself in my place i am barely forty years old and i am rich i want to make the most of my lifeunder the somewhat peculiar circumstances how and where should you live  it depends a little upon your tastes of course rocke answered you are a sportsman are you not  i am fond of sport wingrave answered at least i was at present i am not conscious of having any positive tastes  i think rocke continued that i should first of all change my name then without making any effort to come into touch with your old friends i should seek acquaintance amongst the bohemian world of london and paris there i might myself perhaps be able to help you for sport you might fish in norway or iceland or shoot in hungary you could run to a yacht if you cared about it and if you fancy big game why theres all africa before you  wingrave listened without changing a muscle of his face  your programme he remarked presupposes that i have no ambitions beyond the pursuit of pleasure  rocke shrugged his shoulders he was becoming more at his ease he felt that his advice was sound that he was showing a most comprehensive grasp of the situation  i am afraid he said that none of what we call the careers are open to you you could not enter parliament and you are too old for the professions the services of course are impossible you might write if your tastes ran that way nowadays it seems to be the fashion to record ones experiences in print ifif they should happen to be in any way exceptional i can think of nothing else  i am very much obliged to you wingrave said your suggestions are eminently practical i will think them over dont let me keep you any longer  about this evening rocke remarked shall i fix up that little dinner party you have only to say the word  i am very much obliged to you but i think not answered wingrave i will dine with you alone some evening with pleasure not just as present  rocke looked as he felt puzzled he honestly wished to be of service to this man but he was at a loss to know what further suggestion he could make there was something impenetrable about his client something which he could not arrive at behind the hard grim face and measured words he could not even guess as to what the mans hopes or intentions were eventually although with some reluctance he took up his hat  well sir wingrave he said if there is really nothing i can do for you i will go if you should change your mind you have only to telephone you can command me at any time i am only anxious to be of service to you  you have already been of service to me wingrave answered quietly you have spoken the truth you have helped me to realize my position more exactly will you give your father my compliments and thanks and say that i am entirely satisfied with the firms conduct of affairs during myabsence  rocke nodded  certainly he said that will please the governor i must be off now i hope youll soon be feeling quite yourself again sir wingrave it must seem a bit odd at first i suppose but it will wear off all right what you want after all is society much better let me arrange that little dinner for tonight  wingrave shook his head  later on perhaps he answered good morning     a student of character  left alone wingrave walked for several minutes up and down the room his hands behind him his head bent he walked not restlessly but with measured footsteps his mind was fixed steadfastly upon the one immediate problem of his own future his interview with rocke had unsettledto a certain extent unnervedhim was this freedom for which he had longed so passionately this return into civilized life to mean simply the exchange of an ironbarred cell for a palace whose outer gates were as hopelessly locked even though the key was of gold freedom was it after all an illusion was his to be the hogs paradise of empty delights were the other worlds indeed forbidden he moved abruptly to the window and threw it open below was piccadilly brilliant with may sunshine surging with life motors and carriages omnibuses and hansoms were all jostled together in a block the pavements were thronged with a motley and everhurrying crowd it seemed to him accustomed to the callous and hopeless appearance of a less happy tribe that the faces of these people were all aflame with the joy of the springtime the perfume from the great clusters of yellow daffodils and violets floated up from the flower sellers baskets below the fresh warm air seemed to bring him poignant memories of crocusstarred lawns of trim beds of hyacinths of the song of birds of the perfume of drooping lilac grim and motionless as a figure of fate wingrave looked down from his window with cold yet discerning eyes he was still an alien a denizen in another world from that which flowed so smoothly and pleasantly below it was something to which he did not belong which he doubted indeed if ever again he could enter he had no part in it no share in that vigorous life whose throbbings he could dimly feel though his own heart was beating to a slower and a very different tune they were his fellows in name only between him and them stood the judgment ofrocke  the evil chances of the world are many it was whilst his thoughts traveled in this fashion that the electric landaulette of lady ruth barrington glided round the corner from st james street and joined in the throng of vehicles slowly making their way down piccadilly his attention was attracted first by the white and spotless liveries of the servantsthe form of locomotion itself was almost new to him then he saw the woman who leaned back amongst the cushions she was elegantly dressed she wore no veil she did not look a day more than thirty she was attractive from the tips of her patent shoes to the white bow which floated on the top of her lace parasol a perfectly dressed perfectly turned out woman she had too the lazy confident air of a woman sure of herself and her friends she knew nothing of the look which flashed down upon her from the window overhead  wingrave turned away with a little gasp a halfstifled exclamation had crept out from between his teeth his cheeks seemed paler than ever and his eyes unnaturally bright nevertheless he was completely master of himself on the table was a large deed box of papers which rocke had left for his inspection from its recesses he drew out a smaller box unlocked it with a key from his chain and emptied its sole contentsa small packet of lettersupon the table he counted them one by one they were all thereand on top a photograph a breath of halfforgotten perfume stole out into the room he opened one of the letters and its few passionate words came back to his memory linked with a hundred other recollections the desire of her eyes of her lips raised for his the caressing touch of her fingers he found himself wondering in an impersonal sort of way that these things should so little affect him his blood ran no less coldly nor did his pulses beat the faster for this backward glance into things finished  there was a knock at the door he raised his head  come in  a slim fair young man obeyed the summons and advanced into the room wingrave eyed him with immovable face nevertheless his manner somehow suggested a displeased surprise  sir wingrave seton i believe the intruder said cheerfully  that is my name wingrave admitted but my orders below have evidently been disobeyed i am not disposed to receive visitors today  the intruder was not in the least abashed he laid his hat upon the table and felt in his pocket  i am very sorry he said they did try to keep me out but i told them that my business was urgent i have been a journalist you see and am used to these little maneuvers  wingrave looked at him steadily with closedrawn eyebrows  am i to understand he said that you are in here in your journalistic capacity  the newcomer shook his head  pray do not think he said that i should be guilty of such an impertinence my name is aynesworth walter aynesworth i have a letter for you from lovell you remember him i daresay here it is  he produced it from his breast coat pocket and handed it over  where is lovell wingrave asked  he left for the east early this morning aynesworth answered he had to go almost at an hours notice  wingrave broke the seal and read the letter through afterwards he tore it into small pieces and threw them into the grate  what do you want with me mr aynesworth he asked  i want to be your secretary aynesworth answered  my secretary wingrave repeated i am much obliged to you but i am not requiring anyone in that capacity  pardon me aynesworth answered but i think you are you may not have realized it yet but if you will consider the matter carefully i think you will agree with me that a secretary or companion of some sort is exactly what you do need  out of curiosity wingrave remarked i should be glad to know why you think so  certainly aynesworth answered in the first place i know the story of your life and the unfortunate incident which has kept you out of society for the last ten years  from lovell i presume wingrave interrupted  precisely aynesworth admitted ten years absence from english life today means that you return to it an absolute and complete stranger you would be like a cooks tourist abroad without a guide or a baedeker if you attempted to rely upon yourself now i am rather a bohemian sort of person but i have just the sort of allround knowledge which would be most useful to you i have gone a little way into society and i know something about politics i can bring you uptodate on both these matters i know where to dine well in town and where to be amused i can tell you where to get your clothes and the best place for all the etceteras if you want to travel i can speak french and german and i consider myself a bit of a sportsman  i am sure wingrave answered i congratulate you upon your versatility i am quite convinced i shall advertise at once for a secretary  why advertise aynesworth asked i am here  wingrave shook his head  you would not suit me at all he answered  why not aynesworth asked i forget whether i mentioned all my accomplishments i am an oxford man with a degree and i can write tolerable english ive a fair head for figures and i dont require too large a salary  exactly wingrave answered drily you are altogether too desirable i should not require an admirable crichton for my purpose  aynesworth remained unruffled  all right he said you know best of course suppose you tell me what sort of a man would satisfy you  why should i wingrave asked coldly  it would amuse me aynesworth answered and ive come a mile or so out of my way and given up a whole morning to come and see you go on it wont take long  wingrave shrugged his shoulders  i will not remind you he said that you came on your own initiative i owe you the idea however so i will tell you the sort of person i shall look out for in the first place i do not require him to be a gentleman  i can be a shocking bounder at times aynesworth murmured  he must be more a sort of an upper servant wingrave continued i should require him to obey me implicitly whatever i told him to do you have a conscience i presume  very little aynesworth answered i have been a journalist  you have the remnants of one at all events wingrave said quite sufficient no doubt to interfere with your possible usefulness to me i must have someone who is poortoo poor to question my will or to dispute my orders whatever they might be  i have never aynesworth declared possessed a superfluous halfcrown in my life  you probably possess what is called a sense of honor wingrave continued you would certainly disapprove of some of my proceedings and you would probably disobey my orders  sense of honor aynesworth repeated you have too flattering an opinion of me i dont know what it is i always cheat at cards if i get the chance  wingrave turned away  you are a fool he said and you wont suit me  when can i come aynesworth asked  you can stay now wingrave answered your salary will be four hundred a year you will live at my expense the day you disobey an order of mine you go no notice mind  agreed aynesworth answered what should i do first send you a tailor i should think  wingrave nodded  i will give the afternoon to that sort of people he said here is a list of the tradesmen i used to deal with kindly avoid them  aynesworth glanced at the slip of paper and nodded  all outofdate now he remarked ill be back to lunch     a delicate mission  aynesworth was back in less than an hour he carried under his arm a brown paper parcel the strings of which he commenced at once to untie wingrave who had been engrossed in the contents of his deed box watched him with immovable face  the tailor will be here at twothirty he announced and the other fellows will follow on at half an hours interval the manicurist and the barber are coming at six oclock  wingrave nodded  what have you there he asked pointing to the parcel  cigars and cigarettes and jolly good ones too aynesworth answered opening a flat tin box and smelling the contents appreciatively try one of these the finest turkish tobacco grown  i dont smoke wingrave answered  oh youve got out of it but you must pick it up again aynesworth declared best thing out for the nervessort of humanizes one you know  humanizes one does it wingrave remarked softly well ill try  he took a cigarette from the box curtly inviting aynesworth to do the same  what about lunch the latter asked would you care to come round with me to the cannibal club rather a bohemian set but there are always some good fellows there  i am much obliged wingrave answered if you will ask me again in a few days time i shall be very pleased i do not wish to leave the hotel just at present  do you want me aynesworth asked  not until five oclock wingrave answered i should be glad if you would leave me now and return at that hour in the meantime i have a commission for you  good aynesworth declared what is it  you will go wingrave directed to no 13 cadogan street and you will enquire for lady ruth barrington if she should be out ascertain the time of her return and wait for her  if she is out of town  she is in london wingrave answered i have seen her from the window this morning you will give her a message say that you come from me and that i desire to see her tomorrow the time and place she can fix but i should prefer not to go to her house  aynesworth stooped down to relight his cigarette he felt that wingrave was watching him and he wished to keep his face hidden  i am unknown to lady ruth he remarked supposing she should refuse to see me  wingrave looked at him coldly  i have told you what i wish done he said the task does not seem to be a difficult one please see to it that i have an answer by five oclock  aynesworth lunched with a few of his particular friends at the club they heard of his new adventure with somewhat doubtful approbation  youll never stand the routine old chap  and what about your own work  what will the daily scribbler people say  aynesworth shrugged his shoulders  i dont imagine it will last very long he answered and i shall get a fair amount of time to myself the work i do on the daily scribbler doesnt amount to anything it was a chance i simply couldnt refuse  the editor of a wellknown london paper leaned back in his chair and pinched a cigar carefully  youll probably find the whole thing a sell he remarked the story as lovell told it sounded dramatic enough and if the man were to come back to life again fresh and vigorous things might happen provided of course that lovell was right in his suppositions but ten or twelve years solitary confinement although it maynt sound much on paper is enough to crush all the life and energy out of a man  aynesworth shook his head  you havent seen him he said i have  whats he like walter another man asked  i cant describe him aynesworth answered i shouldnt like to try ill bring him here some day you fellows shall see him for yourselves i find him interesting enough  the whole thing the editor declared will fizzle out you see if it doesnt a man whos just spent ten or twelve years in prison isnt likely to run any risk of going there again there will be no tragedy more likely reconciliation  perhaps aynesworth said imperturbably but it wasnt only the possibility of anything of that sort happening you know which attracted me it was the tragedy of the man himself with his numbed helpless life set down here in the midst of us with a great blank chasm between him and his past what is there left to drive the wheels the events of one day are simple and monotonous enough to us because they lean up against the events of yesterday and the yesterdays before how do they seem i wonder to a man whose yesterday was more than a decade of years ago  the editor nodded  it must be a grim sensation he admitted but i am afraid with you my dear walter it is an affair of shop you wish to cull from your interesting employer the material for that everybecoming novel of yours lets go upstairs ive time for one pool  i havent aynesworth answered ive a commission to do  he left the club and walked westwards humming softly to himself but thinking all the time intently his errand disturbed him he was to be the means of bringing together again these two people who had played the principal parts in lovells dramahis new employer and the woman who had ruined his life what was the object of it what manner of vengeance did he mean to deal out to her lovells words of premonition returned to him just then with curious insistencehe was so certain that wingraves reappearance would lead to tragical happenings aynesworth himself never doubted it his brief interview with the man into whose service he had almost forced himself had impressed him wonderfully yet what weapon was there save the crude one of physical force with which wingrave could strike  he rang the bell at no 13 cadogan street and sent in his card by the footman the man accepted it doubtfully  her ladyship has only just got up from luncheon sir and she is not receiving this afternoon he announced  aynesworth took back his card and scribbled upon it the name of the newspaper for which he still occasionally worked  her ladyship will perhaps see me he said handing the card back to the man it is a matter of business i will not detain her for more than a few minutes  the man returned presently and ushered him into a small sitting room  her ladyship will be quite half an hour before she can see you sir he said  i will wait aynesworth answered taking up a paper  the time passed slowly at last the door was opened a woman in a plain but exquisitely fitting black gown entered from lovells description aynesworth recognized her at once and yet for a moment he hesitated to believe that this was the woman whom he had come to see the years had indeed left her untouched her figure was slight almost girlish her complexion as smooth and her coloring faint though it was as delicate and natural as a childs her eyes were unusually large and the lashes which shielded them heavy it was when she looked at him that aynesworth began to understand  she carried his card in her hand and glanced at it as he bowed  you are the daily scribbler she said you want me to tell you about my bazaar i suppose  i am attached to the daily scribbler lady ruth barrington aynesworth answered but my business this afternoon has nothing to do with the paper i have called with a message froman old friend of yours  she raised her eyebrows ever so slightly the graciousness of her manner was perceptibly abated  indeed i scarcely understand you mraynesworth  my message aynesworth said is from sir wingrave seton  the look of enquiry half impatient half interrogative faded slowly from her face she stood quite still her impassive features seemed like a plaster cast from which all life and feeling were drawn out her eyes began slowly to dilate and she shivered as though with cold then the man who was watching her and wondering knew that this was fearfear undiluted and naked  he stepped forward and placed a chair for her she felt for the back of it with trembling fingers and sat down  issir wingrave setonout of prison she asked in a strange dry tone one would have thought that she had been choking  since yesterday aynesworth answered  but his timeis not up yet  there is always a reduction aynesworth reminded her for what is called good conduct  she was silent for several moments then she raised her head she was a brave woman and she was rapidly recovering her selfpossession  well she asked what does he want  to see you aynesworth answered tomorrow afternoon either here or at his apartments in the clarence hotel he would prefer not to come here  are you his friend she asked  i am his secretary aynesworth answered  you are in his confidence  i only entered his service this morning he said  how much do you know she persisted of the unfortunate affair which ledto his imprisonment  i have been told the whole story aynesworth answered  her eyes rested thoughtfully upon his it seemed as though she were trying to read in his face exactly what he meant by the whole story  then she said do you think that anything but pain and unpleasantness can come of a meeting between us  lady ruth aynesworth answered it is not for me to form an opinion i am sir wingrave setons secretary  what is he going to do she asked  i have no idea he answered  is he going abroad  i know nothing of his plans aynesworth declared what answer shall i take back to him  she looked at him earnestly gradually her face was softening the frozen look was passing away the expression was coming back to her eyes she leaned a little towards him her voice although it was raised above a whisper was full of feeling  mr aynesworth she murmured i am afraid of sir wingrave seton  aynesworth said nothing  i was always a little afraid of him she continued even in the days when we were friendly he was so hard and unforgiving i know he thinks that he has a grievance against me he will have been brooding about it all these years i dare not see him ii am terrified  if that is your answer aynesworth said i will convey it to him  her beautiful eyes were full of reproach  mr aynesworth she said in a low tone for a young man you are very unsympathetic  my position aynesworth answered does not allow me the luxury of considering my personal feelings  she looked hurt  i forgot she said looking for a moment upon the floor you have probably been prejudiced against me you have heard only one story listenshe raised her eyes suddenly and leaned a little forward in her chairsome day if you will come and see me when i am alone and we have time to spare i will tell you the whole truth i will tell you exactly what happened you shall judge for yourself  aynesworth bowed  in the meantime  her eyes filled slowly with tears aynesworth looked away he was miserably uncomfortable  you cannot be quite so hardhearted as you try to seem mr aynesworth she said quietly i want to ask you a question you must answer it you dont know how much it means to me you are sir wingrave setons secretary you have access to all his papers have you seen any letters of mine do you know if he still has any in his possession  my answer to both questions is no aynesworth said a little stiffly i only entered the service of sir wingrave seton this morning and i know nothing at all as yet of his private affairs and lady ruth you must forgive my reminding you that in any case i could not discuss such matters with you he added  she looked at him with a faint strange smile afterwards when he tried to do so aynesworth found it impossible to describe the expression which flitted across her face he only knew that it left him with the impression of having received a challenge  incorruptible she murmured sir wingrave seton is indeed a fortunate man  there was a lingering sweetness in her tone which still had a note of mockery in it her silence left aynesworth conscious of a vague sense of uneasiness he felt that her eyes were raised to his and for some reason which he could not translate even into a definite thought he wished to avoid them the silence was prolonged for long afterwards he remembered those few minutes there was a sort of volcanic intensity in the atmosphere he was acutely conscious of small extraneous things of the perfume of a great bowl of hyacinths the ticking of a tiny french clock the restless drumming of her finger tips upon the arm of her chair all the time he seemed actually to feel her eyes commanding impelling beseeching him to turn round he did so at last and looked her full in the face  lady ruth he said will you favor me with an answer to my message  certainly she answered smiling quite naturally i will come and see sir wingrave seton at four oclock tomorrow afternoon you can tell him that i think it rather an extraordinary request but under the circumstances i will do as he suggests he is staying at the clarence i presume under his own name i shall have no difficulty in finding him  he is staying there under his own name aynesworth answered and i will see that you have no difficulty  so kind of you she murmured holding out her hand and again there was something mysterious in her eyes as she raised them to him as though there existed between them already some understanding which mocked the conventionality of her words aynesworth left the house and lit a cigarette upon the pavement outside with a little sigh of relief he felt somehow humiliated did she fancy he wondered that he was a callow boy to dance to any tune of her pipingthat he had never before seen a beautiful woman who wanted her own way     the gospel of hate  and what wingrave asked his secretary as they sat at dinner that night did you think of lady ruth  in plain words i should not like to tell you aynesworth answered i only hope that you will not send me to see her again  why not  lady ruth aynesworth answered deliberately is a very beautiful woman with all the most dangerous gifts of eve when she wanted her own way she did me the scanty honor of appraising me as an easy victim and she asked questions  for instance  she wanted me to tell her if you still had in your possession certain letters of hers aynesworth said  good what did you say  i told her of course aynesworth continued that having been in your service for a few hours only i was scarcely in a position to know i ventured further to remind her that such questions addressed from her to me were to say the least of it improper  wingraves lips parted in what should have been a smile but the spirit of mirth was lacking  and then  there was nothing else aynesworth answered she simply dismissed me  i can see wingrave remarked your grievance you are annoyed because she regarded you as too easy a victim  perhaps aynesworth admitted  there was some excuse for her after all wingrave continued coolly she possesses powers which you yourself have already admitted and you i should say are a fairly impressionable person so far as her sex is concerned confess now that she did not leave you altogether indifferent  perhaps not aynesworth admitted reluctantly he did not care to say more  in case you should feel any curiosity on the subject wingrave remarked i may tell you that i have those letters which she was so anxious to know about and i shall keep them safeeven from you you can amuse yourself with her if you like you will never be able to tell her more than i care for her to know  aynesworth continued his dinner in silence after all he was beginning to fear that he had made a mistake lovell had somehow contrived to impart a subtly tragic note to his story but the outcome of it all seemed to assume a more sordid aspect these two would meet there would be recriminations a tragic appeal for forgiveness possibly some melodramatic attempt at vengeance the glamour of the affair seemed to him to be fading away now that he had come into actual contact with it it was not until he began to study his companion during a somewhat prolonged silence that he felt the reaction it was then that he began to see new things that he felt the enthusiasm kindled by lovells strangely told story begin to revive it was not the watching for events more or less commonplace which would repay him for the step he had taken it was the study of this man placed in so strange a positiona man come back to life after years of absolute isolation he had broken away from the chain which links together men of similar tastes and occupations and which goes to the creation of type he was in a unique position he was in the world but not of it he was groping about amongst familiar scenes over which time had thrown the pall of unfamiliarity what manner of place would he findwhat manner of place did he desire to find it was here that the real interest of the situation culminated at least so aynesworth thought then  they were dining at a restaurant in the strand which aynesworth had selected as representing one the more wealthy type of bohemian life the dinner and wine had been of his choosing wingrave had stipulated only for the best wingrave himself had eaten very little the bottle of wine stood half empty between them the atmosphere of the place the effect of the wine the delicate food and the music were visible to a greater or less degree according to temperament amongst all the other little groups of men and women by whom they were surrounded wingrave alone remained unaffected he was carefully and correctly dressed in clothes borrowed from his new tailor and he showed not the slightest signs of strangeness or gaucherie amongst his unfamiliar surroundings he looked about him always with the cold easy nonchalance of the man of the world of being recognized he had not the slightest fear his frame and bearing and the brightness of his deep strong eyes still belonged to early middle age but his face itself worn and hardened was the face of an elderly man the more aynesworth watched him the more puzzled he felt  i am afraid he remarked that you are disappointed in this place  not at all wingrave answered it is typical of a class i suppose it is the sort of place i wished to visit  in a corner of the room aynesworth had recognized a friend and fellow clubman who was acting at a neighboring theater he was dining with some young ladies of his company and beckoned to aynesworth to come over and join them he pointed them out to wingrave  would you care to be introduced he asked holiwell is a very good fellow and the girls might interest you two of them are americans and they are very popular  wingrave shook his head  thank you no he said i should be glad to meet your friend some time when he is alone  it was the first intimation which aynesworth had received of his companions sentiments as regards the other sex years afterwards when his attitude towards them was often quoted as being one of the extraordinary features of an extraordinary personality he remembered his perseverance on this occasion  you have not spoken to a woman for so many years he persisted why not renew the experience nothing so humanizing you knownot even cigarettes  wingraves face fell if possible into sterner lines his tone was cold and hard  my scheme of life he said may be reconstructed more than once before i am satisfied but i can assure you of this there will be no serious place in it for women  aynesworth shrugged his shoulders he never doubted but that in a month of two his visavis would talk differently  your scheme of life he repeated thoughtfully that sounds interesting have you any objection i wonder to telling me what manner of life you propose to lead  it was several moments before wingrave answered him he was smoking a cigar in a mechanical sort of way but he obviously derived no pleasure from it yet aynesworth noticed that some instinct had led him to choose the finest brand  perhaps he said letting his eyes rest coldly upon his questioner if i told you all that was in my mind you would waive your months salary and get back to your journalism  aynesworth shrugged his shoulders  why should you suppose that he asked i am not a moralist myself nor am i the keeper of your conscience i dont think that you could frighten me off just yet  nevertheless wingrave admitted there are times when i fear that we shall not get on together i begin to suspect that you have a conscience  you are the first aynesworth assured him who has ever flattered me to that extent  it may be elastic of course wingrave continued but i suspect its existence i warn you that association with me will try it hard  i accept the challenge aynesworth answered lightly  you are rasher than you imagine wingrave declared for instance i have admitted to you have i not that i am interested in my fellow creatures that i want to mix with them and watch them at their daily lives let me assure you that that interest is not a benevolent one  i never fancied that you were a budding philanthropist aynesworth remarked lighting a fresh cigarette  i find myself wingrave continued thoughtfully in a somewhat unique position i am one of the ordinary human beings with whom the world is peopled but i am not conscious of any of the usual weaknesses of sentiment or morality for instance if that gentleman with the red face who has obviously eaten and drunk too much were to have an apoplectic fit at the moment and die in his chair it would not shock or distress me in the least on the contrary i should be disposed to welcome his removal from a world which he obviously does nothing to adorn  aynesworth glanced at the person in question he was a theatrical agent and financier of stock companies whom he knew very well by sight  i suppose wingrave continued that i was born with the usual moral sentiments and the usual feelings of kinship towards my fellow creatures circumstances however have wholly destroyed them to me men have become the puppets and women the dancing dolls of life my interest in them if it exists at all is malevolent i should like to see them all suffer exactly as i have suffered it would interest me exceedingly  still aynesworth remained silent he was anxious to hear all that was in the others mind and he feared lest any interruption might divert him  there are men in the world wingrave continued called philanthropists amiable obese creatures as a rule whose professed aim in life it is to do as much good as possible i take my stand upon the other pole it is my desire to encourage and to work as much evil as possible i wish to bring all the suffering i can upon those who come within the sphere of my influence  you are likely aynesworth remarked to achieve popularity  wingrave regarded him steadfastly  your speech he said is flippant but you yourself do not realize how near it comes to the truth human beings are like dogsthey are always ready to lick the hand that flogs them i mean to use the scourge whenever i can seize the opportunity but you will find the jackals at my heels nevertheless whenever i choose to whistle  aynesworth helped himself to a liqueur he felt that he needed it  one weakness alone distresses me wingrave continued in all ordinary matters of sentiment i am simply a negation there is one antipathy however which i find it hard to overcome the very sight of a woman or the sound of her voice distresses me this is the more unfortunate he continued because it is upon the shoulders of her sex that the greater portion of my debt to my fellow creatures rests however time may help me  aynesworth leaned back in his chair and contemplated his companion for the next few moments in thoughtful silence it was hard he felt to take a man who talked like this seriously his manner was convincing his speech deliberate and assured there was not the slightest doubt but that he meant what he said yet it seemed to aynesworth equally certain that the time would come and come quickly when the unnatural hardness of the man would yield to the genial influence of friendship of pleasure of the subtle joys of freedom those past days of hideous monotony of profitless debasing toil the long sleepless nights the very nightmare of life to a man of wingraves culture and habits might well have poisoned his soul have filled him with ideas such as these but everything was different now the history of the world could show no epoch when pleasures so many and various were there for the man who carries the golden key today he was a lookeron and the ice of his years of bitterness had not melted tomorrow at any moment he might catch a whiff of the fragrance of life and the blood in his veins would move to a different tune this was how it seemed to aynesworth as he studied his companion through the faint blue mist of tobacco smoke  this expression of your sentiments he remarked at last is interesting so far as it goes i am however a practical person and my connection with you is of a practical order you dont propose i presume to promenade the streets with a catoninetails  your curiosity wingrave remarked is reasonable tomorrow i may gratify some portion of it after my interview with lady ruth in the meantime i might remark that to the observant person who has wits and money the opportunities for doing evil present themselves i think with reasonable frequency i do not propose however to leave things altogether to chance  a definite scheme of illdoing aynesworth ventured to suggest would be more satisfactory  exactly he admitted  he called for the bill and his eyes wandered once more around the room as the waiter counted out the change the band were playing the valse amoureuse the air was grown heavy with the odor of tobacco and the mingled perfumes of flowers and scents a refrain of soft laughter followed the music an afterdinner air pervaded the place wingraves lip curled  my lack of kinship with my fellows he remarked is exceedingly well defined just now i agree with the one philosopher who declared that eating and drinking are functions which are better performed in private  the two men went on to a theater the play was a society triflea thing of the moment wingrave listened gravely without a smile or any particular sign of interest at the end of the second act he turned towards his companion  the lady in the box opposite he remarked desires to attract your attention  aynesworth looked up and recognized lady ruth she was fanning herself languidly but her eyes were fixed upon the two men she leaned a little forward and her gesture was unmistakable  aynesworth rose to his feet a little doubtfully  you had better go wingrave said present my compliments and excuses i feel that a meeting now would amount to an anticlimax  aynesworth made his way upstairs lady ruth was alone and he noticed that she had withdrawn to a chair where she was invisible to the house even aynesworth himself could not see her face clearly at first for she had chosen the darkest corner of the box he gathered an impression of a gleaming white neck and bosom rising and falling rather more quickly than was natural eyes which shone softly through the gloom and the perfume of white roses a great cluster of which lay upon the box ledge her voice was scarcely raised above a whisper  that issir wingrave with you  yes aynesworth answered it was he who saw you first  she seemed to catch her breath her voice was still tremulous  he is changed she said i should not have recognized him  they were the best ten years of his life aynesworth answered think of how and in what surroundings he has been compelled to live no wonder that he has had the humanity hammered out of him  she shivered a little  is he always like this she asked i have watched him he never smiles he looks as hard as fate itself  i have known him only a few hours aynesworth reminded her  i dare not come tomorrow she whispered i am afraid of him  do you wish me to tell him so he asked  i dont know she answered you are very unfeeling mr aynesworth  i hope not he answered and looked away towards the orchestra he did not wish to meet her eyes  you are she murmured i have no one to whom i dare speakof this i dare not mention his name to my husband it was my evidence which convicted him and i can see i know that he is vindictive and he has those letters oh if i could only get them back  her voice trembled with an appeal whispered but passionate it was wonderful how musical and yet how softly spoken her words were they were like live things and the few feet of darkened space through which they had passed seemed charged with magnetic influence  mr aynesworth  he turned and faced her  cant you help me  i cannot lady ruth  the electric bell rang softly from outside and the orchestra commenced to play lady ruth rose and looked at herself in the mirror then she turned and smiled at her visitor the pallor of her face was no longer unnatural she was a wonderful woman  i shall come tomorrow she said shall i see you  that he answered depends upon sir wingrave  she made a little grimace as she dismissed him wingrave did not speak to his companion for some time after he had resumed his seat then he inclined his head towards him  have you come to terms with her ladyship he asked drily  not yet aynesworth answered  you can name your own price he continued she will pay dont be afraid of making her bid up she has a good deal at stake  aynesworth made no reply he was thinking how easy it would be to hate this man     hast thou found me o mine enemy  aynesworth was waiting in the hall on the following afternoon when lady ruth arrived he had half expected that she would drive up to the side door in a hansom would wear a thick veil and adopt the other appurtenances of a clandestine meeting but lady ruth was much too clever a woman for anything of the sort she descended at the great front entrance from her own electric coupe and swept into the hotel followed by her maid she stopped to speak to the manager of the hotel who knew her from her visits to the worldfamous restaurant and she asked at once for sir wingrave seton then she saw aynesworth and crossed the hall with outstretched hand  how nice of you to be here she murmured can you take me to sir wingrave at once i have such a busy afternoon that i was afraid at the last moment that i should be unable to come  aynesworth led her towards the lift  sir wingrave is in his sitting room he remarked it is only on the first floor  she directed her maid where to wait and followed him on the way down the corridor he stole a glance at her she was a little pale and he could see that she had nerved herself to this interview with a great effort as he knocked at the door her great eyes were raised for a moment to his and they were like the eyes of a frightened child  i am afraid she murmured  there was no time for more they were in the room and wingrave had risen to meet them lady ruth did not hesitate for a moment she crossed the room towards him with outstretched hands aynesworth who was standing a little on one side watched their meeting with intense though covert interest she had pushed back her veil her head was a little upraised in a mute gesture of appeal  she was pale to the lips but her eyes were soft with hidden tears wingrave stood stonily silent like a figure of fate his hands remained by his sides her welcome found no response from him she came to a standstill and swaying a little stretched out her hand and steadied herself by grasping the back of a chair  wingrave she murmured and her voice was full of musical reproach  aynesworth turned to leave the room but wingrave looking over her head addressed him  you will remain here aynesworth he said there are some papers at that desk which require sorting  aynesworth hesitated he had caught the look on lady ruths face  if you could excuse me for half an hour sir wingrave he began  i cannot spare you at present wingrave interrupted kindly remain  aynesworth had no alternative but to obey wingrave handed a chair to lady ruth he was looking at her steadfastly there were no signs of any sort of emotion in his face whatever their relations in the past might have been it was hard to believe from his present demeanor that he felt any  wingrave she said softly are you going to be unkind to meyou whom i have always thought of in my dreams as the most generous of men i have looked forward so much to seeing you againto knowing that you were free dont disappoint me  wingrave laughed shortly and aynesworth bent closer over his work with a gathering frown upon his forehead a mirthless laugh is never a pleasant sound  disappoint you he repeated calmly no i must try and avoid that you have been looking forward with so much joy to this meeting then i am flattered  she shivered a little  i have looked forward to it she answered and her voice was dull and lifeless with pain but you are not glad to see me she continued there is no welcome in your face you are changedaltogether why did you send for me  listen  there was a moments silence wingrave was standing upon the hearthrug cold passionless sphinxlike lady ruth was seated a few feet away but her face was hidden  you owe me something he said  oweyou something she repeated vaguely  do you deny it he said  oh no no she declared with emotion not for a moment  i want he said to give you an opportunity of repaying some portion of that debt  she raised her eyes to his her whispered words came so softly that they were almost inaudible  i am waiting she said tell me what i can do  he commenced to speak at some length very impassively very deliberately  you will doubtless appreciate the fact he said that my position today is a somewhat peculiar one i have had enough of solitude i am rich i desire to mix once more on equal terms amongst my fellows and against that i have the misfortune to be a convicted felon who has spent the last ten or a dozen years amongst the scum of the earth engaged in degrading tasks and with no identity save a number the position as you will doubtless observe is a difficult one  her eyes fell from his once more she shivered as though with physical pain something that was like a smile only that it was cold and lifeless flitted across his lips  i have no desire he continued to live in foreign countries on the contrary i have plans which necessitate my living in england the difficulties by this time are without doubt fully apparent to you  she said nothing her eyes were once more watching his face  my looking glass he continued shows me that i am changed beyond any reasonable chance of recognition i do not believe that the wingrave seton of today would readily be recognized as the wingrave seton of twelve years ago but i propose to make assurance doubly sure i am leaving this country for several years at once i shall go to america and i shall return as mr wingrave millionaireand i propose by the way to make money there i desire under that identity to take my place once more amongst my fellows i shall bring letters of introductionto you  there was a long and somewhat ominous silence lady ruths eyes were fixed upon the floor she was thinking and thinking rapidly but there were no signs of it in her pale drawn face at last she looked up  there is my husband she said he would recognize you if no one else did  you are a clever woman he answered i leave it to you to deal with your husband as seems best to you  other people she faltered would recognize you  do me the favor he begged her to look at me carefully for several moments you doubtless have some imperfect recollection of what i was compare it with my present appearance i venture to think that you will agree with me recognition is barely possible  again there was silence lady ruth seemed to have no words but there was the look of a frightened child upon her face  i am sorry he continued that the idea does not appeal to you i can understand that my presence may serve to recall a period which you and your husband would doubtless prefer to forget  stop  a little staccato cry of pain a cry which seemed to spring into life from a tortured heart broke from her lips aynesworth heard it and at that moment he hated his employer wingrave paused for a moment politely and then continued  but after all he said i can assure you that you will find very little in the mr wingrave of new york to remind you of the past i shall do my utmost to win for myself a place in your esteem which will help you to forget the other relationship which if my memory serves me used once to exist between us  she raised her head either she realized that for the present the man was immune against all sentiment or his calm brutality had had a correspondingly hardening effect upon her  if i agree she said will you give me back my letters  no he answered  what are you going to do with them  it depends he said upon you i enter into no engagement i make no promises i simply remind you that it would be equally possible for me to take my place in the world as a rehabilitated wingrave seton ten years ago i yielded to sentiment today i have outlived it  ten years ago she murmured you were a hero god knows what you are now  exactly he answered smoothly i am free to admit that i am a puzzle to myself i find myself in fact a most interesting study  i consent she said with a little shudder i am going now  you are a sensible woman he answered aynesworth show lady ruth to her carriage  she rose to her feet hung from her neck by a chain of fine gold was a large chinchilla muff she stood before him and her hands had sought its shelter timidly she withdrew one  will you shake hands with me wingrave she asked timidly  he shook his head  forgive me he said i may better my manners in america but a present i cannot  she passed out of the room aynesworth followed closing the door behind them in the corridor she stumbled and caught at his arm for support  dont speak to me she gasped take me where i can sit down  he found her a quiet corner in the drawing room she sat perfectly still for nearly five minutes with her eyes closed then she opened them and looked at her companion  mr aynesworth she said are you so poor that you must serve a man like that  he shook his head  it is not poverty he answered i knew his history and i am interested in him  you write novels dont you she asked  i try he answered his story fascinated me he stands today in a unique position to life i want to see how he will come out of it  you knew his storythe truth  everything he answered i heard it from a journalist who was in court his only friend the only man who knew  where is he now  on his way to japan  she drew a little breath between her teeth  there were rumors she said it was hard for me at first but i lived them down i was very young then i ought not to have accepted his sacrifice i wish to heaven i had not i wish that i had faced the scandal then it is worse to be in the power of a man like this today mr aynesworth  lady ruth  do you think that he has the right to keep those letters  i cannot answer that question  will you be my friend  so far as i canin accordance with my obligations to my employer  she tried him no further then but rose and walked slowly out of the room he found her maid and saw them to their carriage then he returned to the sitting room wingrave was smoking a cigarette  i am trying the humanizing influence he remarked got rid of her ladyship  lady ruth has just gone aynesworth answered  have you promised to steal the letters yet he inquired  not yet  her dainty ladyship has not bid high enough i suppose he continued dont be afraid to open your mouth theres another woman there besides the lady ruth barrington who opens bazaars and patronizes charity and entertains royalty ask what you want and shell pay  what a brute you are aynesworth exclaimed involuntarily  of course i am he admitted i know that but whose fault is it it isnt mine ive lived the life of a brute creature for ten years you dont abuse a onelegged man poor devil ive had other things amputated i was like you once it seemed all right to me to go under to save a womans honor you never have therefore i say youve no right to call me a brute personally i dont object it is simply a matter of equity  i admit it aynesworth declared you are acting like a brute  precisely i didnt make myself what i am prison did it go and try ten years yourself and youll find you will have to grope about for your fine emotions are you coming to america with me  i suppose so aynesworth answered when do we start  saturday week  sport west or civilization east  both wingrave answered here is a list of the kit which we shall require add yourself the things which i have forgotten i pay for both  very good of you aynesworth answered  not at all i dont suppose youd come without can you shoot  a bit he admitted  be particular about the rifles i can take you to a little corner in canada where the bears dont stand on ceremony put everything in hand and be ready to come down to cornwall with me on monday  cornwall aynesworth exclaimed what on earth are we going to do in cornwall  i have an estate there the home of my ancestors which i am going to sell i am the last of the setons fortunately and i am going to smash the family tree sell the heirlooms and burn the family records  i shouldnt if i were you aynesworth said quietly you are a young man yet you may come back to your own  meaning  you may smoke enough cigarettes to become actually humanized one can never tell i have known men proclaim themselves cynics for life who have been making idiots of themselves with their own children in five years  wingrave nodded gravely  true enough he answered but the one thing which no man can mistake is death listen and i will quote some poetry to you i thinkit is something like this  the rivers of ice may melt and the mountains crumble into dust but the heart of a dead man is like the seed plot unsown green grass shall not sprout there nor flowers blossom nor shall all the ages of eternity show there any sign of life  he spoke as though he had been reading from a childs primer when he had finished he replaced his cigarette between his teeth  i am a dead man he said calmly dead as the wildest seed plot in gods most forgotten acre     lord of the manor  she came slowly towards the two men through the overgrown rose garden a thin pale wildeyed child dressed in most uncompromising black it was a matter of doubt whether she was the more surprised to see them or they to find anyone else in this wilderness of desolation they stood face to face with her upon the narrow path  have you lost your way she inquired politely  we were told aynesworth answered that there was a gate in the wall there through which we could get on to the cliffs  who told you so she asked  the housekeeper aynesworth answered i will not attempt to pronounce her name  mrs tresfarwin the child said it is not really difficult but she had no right to send you through here it is all private you know  and you aynesworth asked with a smile you have permission i suppose  yes she answered i have lived here all my life i go where i please have you seen the pictures  we have just been looking at them aynesworth answered  arent they beautiful she exclaimed ioh  she sat suddenly down on a rough wooden seat and commenced to cry for the first time wingrave looked at her with some apparent interest  why what is the matter with you child aynesworth exclaimed  i have loved them so all my life she sobbed the pictures and the house and the gardens and now i have to go away i dont know where nobody seems to know  aynesworth looked down at her black frock  you have lost someone perhaps he said  my father she answered quietly he was organist here and he died last week  and you have no other relatives he asked  none at all no oneseemsquite to knowwhat is going to become of me she sobbed  where are you staying now he inquired  with an old woman who used to look after our cottage she answered but she is very poor and she cannot keep me any longer mrs colson says that i must go and work and i am afraid i dont know anyone except at tredowen and i dont know how to work and i dont want to go away from the pictures and the garden and the sea it is all so beautiful isnt it dont you love tredowen  well i havent been here very long you see aynesworth explained  wingrave spoke for the first time his eyes were fixed upon the child and aynesworth could see that she shrank from his cold unsympathetic scrutiny  what is your name he asked  juliet lundy she answered  how long was your father organist at the church  i dont know she answered ever since i was born and before  and how old are you  fourteen next birthday  and all that time he asked has there been no one living at tredowen  no one except mrs tresfarwin she answered it belongs to a very rich man who is in prison  wingraves face was immovable he stood on one side however and turned towards his companion  we are keeping this young lady he remarked from what seems to be her daily pilgrimage i wonder whether it is really the pictures or mrs tresfarwins cakes  she turned her shoulder upon him in silent scorn and looked at aynesworth a little wistfully  goodbye she said  he waved his hand as he strolled after wingrave  there you are mr lord of the manor he said you cant refuse to do something for the child her father was organist at your own church and a hard struggle he must have had of it with an absentee landlord and a congregation of seagulls i should think  are you joking wingrave asked coldly  i was never more in earnest in my life aynesworth answered the girl is come from gentlefolks did you see what a delicate face she had and how nicely she spoke you wouldnt have her sent out as a servant would you  wingrave looked at his companion ominously  you have a strange idea of the duties of a landlord he remarked do you seriously suppose that i am responsible for the future of every brat who grows up on this estate  of course not aynesworth answered you must own for yourself that this case is exceptional let us go down to the vicarage and inquire about it  i shall do nothing of the sort wingrave answered nor will you do you see the spray coming over the cliffs there the sea must be worth watching  aynesworth walked by his side in silence he dared not trust himself to speak wingrave climbed with long rapid strides to the summit of the headland and stood there with his face turned seawards the long breakers were sweeping in from the atlantic with a low insistent roar as far as the eye could reach the waves were crusted with white foam every now and then the spray fell around the two men in a little dazzling shower the very atmosphere was salt about their heads the seagulls whirled and shrieked from the pebbled beach to the horizon there was nothing to break the monotony of that empty waste of waters  wingrave stood perfectly motionless with his eyes fixed upon the horizon minute after minute passed and he showed no signs of moving aynesworth found himself presently engaged in watching him thoughts must be passing through his brain he wondered what they were it was here that he had spent his boyhood barely an hour ago the two men had stood before the picture of his father it was here if anywhere that he might regain some part of his older and more natural self was it a struggle he wondered that was going on within the man there were no signs of it in his face simply he stood and looked and looked as though by infinite perseverance the very horizon itself might recede and the thing for which he sought become revealed  aynesworth turned away at last and there not many yards behind apparently watching them stood the child he waved his hand and advanced towards her her eyes were fixed upon wingrave half fearfully  i am afraid of the other gentleman she whispered as he reached her side will you come a little way with me i will show you a seagulls nest  they left wingrave where he was and went hand in hand along the cliff side she was a curious mixture or shyness and courage she talked very little but she gripped her companions fingers tightly  i can show you she said where the seagulls build and i can tell you the very spot in the sea where the sun goes down night after night  there are some baby seagulls in one of the nests but i darent go very near for the mother bird is so strong father used to say that when they have their baby birds to look after they are as fierce as eagles  your father used to walk with you here juliet aynesworth asked  always till the last few months when he got weaker and weaker she answered since then i come every day alone  dont you find it lonely he asked  she shook her head  at first she answered not now it makes me unhappy would you like to go down on the beach and look for shells i can find you some very pretty ones  they clambered down and wandered hand in hand by the seashore she told him quaint little stories of the smugglers of wrecks and the legends of the fisher people coming back along the sands she clung to his arm and grew more silent her eyes sought his every now and then wistfully presently she pointed out a tiny whitewashed cottage standing by itself on a piece of waste ground  that is where i live now at least for a day or two she said they cannot keep me any longer when are you going away  very soon i am afraid little girl he answered i will come and see you though before i go  you promise she said solemnly  i promise aynesworth repeated  then she held up her face a little timidly and he kissed her afterwards he watched her turn with slow reluctant footsteps to the unpromising abode which she had pointed out aynesworth made his way to the inn cursing his impecuniosity and wingraves brutal indifference  he found the latter busy writing letters  doing your work aynesworth he remarked coldly be so good as to write to christies for me and ask them to send down a valuer to go through the pictures  you are really going to sell aynesworth exclaimed  most certainly wingrave answered heirlooms and family pictures are only so much rubbish to me i am the last of my line and i doubt whether even my lawyer could discover a next of kin for my personal property sell of course im going to sell what use is all this hoarded rubbish to me i am going to turn it into gold  and what use is gold aynesworth asked curiously you have plenty  not enough for my purpose wingrave declared we are going to america to make more  its vandalism aynesworth said rank vandalism the place as it is is a picture the furniture and the house have grown old together why you might marry  wingrave scowled at the younger man across the room  you are a fool aynesworth he said shortly take down these letters  after dinner wingrave went out alone aynesworth followed him about an hour later when his work was done and made his way towards the vicarage it was barely nine oclock but the little house seemed already to be in darkness he rang twice before anybody answered him then he heard slow shuffling footsteps within and a tall gaunt man in clerical attire and carrying a small lamp opened the door  aynesworth made the usual apologies and was ushered into a bare gloomylooking apartment which from the fact of its containing a writing table and a few books he imagined must be the study his host never asked him to sit down he was a long unkemptlooking man with a cold forbidding face and his manner was the reverse of cordial  i have called to see you aynesworth explained with reference to one of your parishionersthe daughter of your late organist  indeed the clergyman remarked solemnly  i saw her today for the first time and have only just heard her story aynesworth continued it seems to be a very sad one  his listener inclined his head  i am unfortunately a poor man aynesworth continued but i have some friends who are well off and i could lay my hands upon a little ready money i should like to discuss the matter with you and see if we cannot arrange something to give her a start in life  the clergyman cleared his throat  it is quite unnecessary he answered a connection of her fathers has come forward at the last moment who is able to do all that is required for her her future is provided for  aynesworth was a little taken aback  i am very glad to hear it he declared i understood that she had neither friends nor relations  you were misinformed the other answered she has both  may i ask who it is who has turned up so unexpectedly aynesworth inquired i have taken a great fancy to the child  the clergyman edged a little towards the door and the coldness of his manner was unmistakable  i do not wish to seem discourteous he said but i cannot recognize that you have any right to ask me these questions you may accept my word that the child is to be fittingly provided for  aynesworth felt the color rising in his cheeks  i trust he said that you do not find my interest in her unwarrantable my visit to you is simply a matter of charity if my aid is unneeded so much the better all the same i should like to know where she is going and who her friends are  i do not find myself at liberty to afford you any information was the curt reply  thereupon there was nothing left for aynesworth to do but to put on his hat and walk out which he did  wingrave met him in the hall on his return  where have you been he asked a little sharply  on a private errand aynesworth answered irritated by his words and look  you are my secretary wingrave said coldly i do not pay you to go about executing private errands  aynesworth looked at him in surprise did he really wish to quarrel  i imagine sir he said that my time is my own when i have no work of yours on hand if you think otherwise  he paused and looked at his employer significantly wingrave turned on his heel  be so kind he said as to settle the bill here tonight we leave by the seven oclock train in the morning  tomorrow aynesworth exclaimed  precisely  do you mind he asked if i follow by a later train  i do wingrave answered i need you in london directly we arrive  i am afraid aynesworth said after a moments reflection that it is impossible for me to leave  why  you will think it a small thing he said but i have given my promise i must see that child again before i go  you are referring he asked to the blackfrocked little creature we saw about the place yesterday  yes  wingrave regarded his secretary as one might look at a person who has suddenly taken leave of his senses  i am sorry he said to interfere with your engagements but it is necessary that we should both leave by the seven oclock train tomorrow morning  aynesworth reflected for a moment  if i can see the child first he said i will come if not i will follow you at midday  in the latter case wingrave remarked pray do not trouble to follow me unless your own affairs take you to london our connection will have ended  you mean this aynesworth asked  it is my custom wingrave answered to mean what i say  aynesworth set his alarm that night for halfpast five it seemed to him that his future would largely depend upon how soundly the child slept     the heart of a child  the cottage as aynesworth neared it showed no sign of life the curtainless windows were blank and empty no smoke ascended from the chimney its plastered front was innocent of any form of creeper but in the few feet of garden in front a great overgrown wild rose bush starred with deep red blossoms perfumed the air as he drew near the door suddenly opened and with a little cry of welcome the child rushed out to him  how lovely of you she cried i saw you coming from my window  you are up early he said smiling down at her  the sun woke me she answered it always does i was going down to the sands shall we go together or would you like to go into the gardens at tredowen the flowers are beautiful there while the dew is on them  i am afraid aynesworth answered that i cannot do either i have come to say goodbye  the light died out of her face all of a sudden the delicate beauty of her gleaming eyes and quivering mouth had vanished she was once more the pale wan little child he had seen coming slowly up the garden path at tredowen  you are goingso soon she murmured  he took her hand and led her away over the short green turf of the common  we only came for a few hours he told her but i have good news for you juliet unless you know already mr saunders has found out some of your friends they are going to look after you properly and you will not be alone any more  what time are you going she asked  silly child he answered giving her hand a shake listen to what i am telling you you are going to have friends to look after you always arent you glad  no i am not glad she answered passionately i dont want to go away i amlonely  her arms suddenly sought his neck and her face was buried on his shoulder he soothed her as well as he could  i must go little girl he said for i am off to america almost at once as soon as i can after i come back i will come and see you  you have only been here one day she sobbed  i would stay if i could dear aynesworth answered come dry those eyes and be a brave girl think how nice it will be to go and live with people who will take care of you properly and be fond of you why you may have a pony and all sorts of nice things  i dont want a pony she answered hanging on his arm i dont want to go away i want to stay hereand wait till you come back  he laughed  why when i come back little woman he answered you will be almost grown up come dry your eyes now and i tell you what we will do you shall come back with me to breakfast and then drive up to the station and see us off  i should like to come she whispered but i am afraid of the other gentleman  very likely we shant see him aynesworth answered if we do he wont hurt you  i dont like his face she persisted  well we wont look at it aynesworth answered but breakfast we must have  they were half way through the meal and juliet had quite recovered her spirits when wingrave entered he looked at the two with impassive face and took his place at the table he wished the child good morning carelessly but made no remark as to her presence there  i have just been telling juliet some good news aynesworth remarked i went to see mr saunders the vicar here last night and he has found out some of her fathers friends they are going to look after her  wingrave showed no interest in the information but a moment later he addressed juliet for the first time  are you glad that you are going away from tredowen he asked  i am very very sorry she answered the tears gathering once more in her eyes  but you want to go to school dont you and see other girls he asked  she shook her head decidedly  it will break my heart she said quietly to leave tredowen i think that if i have to go away from the pictures and the garden and the sea i shall never be happy any more  you are a child he remarked contemptuously you do not understand if you go away you can learn to paint pictures yourself like those at tredowen you will find that the world is full of other beautiful places  the sympathetic aspect of his words was altogether destroyed by the thin note of careless irony which even the child understood she felt that he was mocking her  i could never be happy she said simply away from tredowen you understand dont you she added turning confidentially to aynesworth  you think so now dear he said but remember that you are very young there are many things for you to learn before you grow up  i am not a dunce she replied i can talk french and german and do arithmetic and play the organ father used to teach me these things i can learn at tredowen very well i hope that my friends will let me stay here  wingrave took no more notice of her she and aynesworth walked together to the station as they passed the little whitewashed cottage she suddenly let go his hand and darted inside  wait one moment she cried breathlessly  she reappeared almost at once holding something tightly clenched in her right hand she showed it to him shyly  it is for you please she said  it was a silver locket and inside was a little picture of herself aynesworth stooped down and kissed her he had had as many presents in his life as most men but never an offering which came to him quite like that they stood still for a moment and he held out her hands already the morning was astir the seagulls were wheeling whitewinged and noiseless above their heads the air was fragrant with the scent of cottage flowers like a low sweet undernote the sea came rolling in upon the firm sandsout to the west it stretched like a sheet of softly swaying inland water for those few moments there seemed no note of discordand then the harsh whistle of an approaching train they took hold of hands and ran  it was perhaps as well that their farewells were cut short there was scarcely time for more than a few hurried words before the train moved out from the queer little station and with his head out of the window aynesworth waved his hand to the blackfrocked child with her pale eager face already stained with tearsa lone strange little figure full of a sort of plaintive grace as she stood there against a background of milk cans waving a crumpled handkerchief  wingrave who had been buried in a morning paper looked up presently  if our journeyings he remarked drily are to contain everywhere incidents such as these they will become a sort of sentimental pilgrimage  aynesworth shrugged his shoulders  i am sorry he said that my interest in the child has annoyed you at any rate it is over now the parson was mysterious but he assured me that she was provided for  wingrave looked across the carriage with cold reflective curiosity  your point of view he remarked is a mystery to me i cannot see how the future of an unfledged brat like that can possibly concern you  perhaps not aynesworth answered but you must remember that you are a little out of touch with your fellows just now i daresay when you were my age you would have felt as i feel i daresay that as the years go on you will feel like it again  wingrave was thoughtful for a moment  so you think he remarked that i may yet have in me the making of a sentimentalist  aynesworth returned his gaze as steadfastly  one can never tell he answered you may change of course i hope that you will  you are candid at any rate  i do not think aynesworth answered that there is any happiness in life for the man who lives entirely apart from his fellow creatures not to feel is not to live i think that the first real act of kindness which you feel prompted to perform will mark the opening of a different life for you  wingrave spread out the newspaper  i think he said with a faint sneer that it is quite time you took this sea voyage     the sword of damocles  mr lumley barrington kc and mp was in the act of stepping into his carriage to drive down to the house when he was intercepted by a message it was his wifes maid who came hurrying out after him  i beg your pardon sir she said but her ladyship particularly wished to see you as soon as you came in  is your mistress in barrington asked in some surprise  yes sir the maid answered her ladyship is resting before she goes to the ball at caleram house she is in her room now  i will come up at once barrington said  he kept the carriage waiting while he ascended to his wifes room there was no answer to his knock he opened the door softly she was asleep on a couch drawn up before the fire  he crossed the room noiselessly and stood looking down upon her her lithe soft figure had fallen into a posture of graceful almost voluptuous ease the ribbons and laces of her muslin dressing gown quivered gently with her deep regular breathing she had thrown off her slippers and one long slender foot was exposed the other was doubled up underneath her body her face was almost like the face of a child smooth and unwrinkled save for one line by the eyes where she laughed he looked at her steadfastly could the closing of the eyes indeed make all the difference life and the knowledge of life seemed things far from her consciousness could one look like thateven in sleepand underneath barrington broke away from his train of thought and woke her quickly  she sat up and yawned  parsons managed to catch you then she remarked  yes he answered i was just off i got away from wills dinner party early and called here for some notes i must be at the househe glanced at the clockin threequarters of an hour  she nodded i wont keep you as long as that  her eyes met his a little furtively full of inquiry i have done what you wished he said quietly i called at the clarence hotel  you saw him  no he sent back my card he declined to see me  she showed no sign of disappointment she sat up and looked into the fire smoothing her hair mechanically with her hands  personally barrington continued i could see no object whatever in my visit i have nothing to say to him nor i should think he to me i am sorry for him of course but hed never believe me if i told him so what happened to him was partly my fault and unless hes changed hes not likely to forget it  she swayed a little towards him  it was partlyalsomine she murmured  i dont see that at all he objected you at any rate were blameless  she looked up at him and he was astonished to find how pale she was  i was not she said calmly  there was a short silence barrington had the air of a man who has received a shock  ruth he exclaimed glancing towards the door and speaking almost in a whisper do you meanthat there are things which i have never known  yes she answered i mean that he might if he chose do us nowboth of usan immense amount of harm  barrington sat down at the end of the sofa he knew his wife well enough to understand that this was serious  let us understand one another ruth he said quietly i always thought that you were a little severe on wingrave at the trial he may bear you a grudge for that it is very possible that he does but what can he do now he had his chance to cross examine you and he let it go by  he has some letters of mine lady ruth said slowly  letters written before the trial  yes  why did he not make use of them there  if he had lady ruth said with her eyes fixed upon the carpet the sympathy would have been the other way he would have got off with a much lighter sentence and youwould not have married me  good god barrington muttered  you see lady ruth continued resting her hand upon her husbands coat sleeve the thing happened all in a second i had the check in my hand when you and sir william came crashing through that window and sir williams eyes were upon me the only way to save myself was to repudiate it and let wingrave get out of the affair as well as he could of course i never guessed what was going to happen  then it was wingrave barrington muttered who played the game  yes lady ruth answered quietly but i am not so sure about him now you and i lumley know one another a little better today than we did twelve years ago we have had a few of the corners knocked off i suppose i can tell you things now i didnt care to then wingrave had lent me money before he has letters from me today thanking him for it  barrington was a large florid man well built and well set up in court he presented rather a formidable appearance with his truculent chin his straight firm mouth and his commanding presence yet there was nothing about him now which would have inspired fear in the most nervous of witnesses he looked like a man all broken up by some unexpected shock  if he had produced those lettersat the trial  lady ruth shrugged her shoulders  i risked it anyhow she said i had to my story was the only one which gave me a dogs chance and i didnt mean to go underthen wingrave never gave me away but i fancy hes feeling differently about it now  how do you know ruth  i have seen him he sent for me she answered lumley dont look at me like that were not in the nursery you and i i went because i had to hes going to america for a time and then hes coming back here i think that when he comes backhe means mischief  he is not the sort of man to forget barrington said half to himself  she shuddered ever so slightly then she stretched out a long white arm and drawing his head suddenly down to her kissed him on the lips  if only she murmured he would give up the letters without them he might sayanything no one would believe  barrington raised his eyes to hers there was something almost pathetic in the worshiping light which shone there he was as he had always been her abject slave  can you think of any way he asked shall i go to him again  useless she answered you have nothing to offer in exchange he would not give them to me he surely would not give them to you shall i tell you what is in his mind listen then he is rich now he means to make more money there then he will return calling himself mr wingravean americanwith imaginary letters of introduction to us he has ambitionsi dont know what they are but they seem to entail his holding some sort of a place in society we are to be his sponsors  is it practicable he asked  quite she answered he is absolutely unrecognizable now he has changed cruelly cant you imagine the horror of it he will be always in evidence always with those letters in the background he means to make life a sort of torture chamber for us  better defy him at once and get over barrington said after all dont you think that the harm he could do is a little imaginary  she brushed the suggestion aside with a little shiver  shall i tell you what he would do lumley she said leaning towards him he would have my letters and a copy of my evidence printed in an elegant little volume and distributed amongst my friends it would come one day like a bomb and nothing that you or i could do would alter it in the least your career and my social position would be ruined success brings enemies you know lumley and i have rather more than my share  then we are helpless he said  unless we can get the lettersor unless he should never return from america she answered  barrington moved uneasily in his seat he knew very well that some scheme was already forming in his wifes brain  if there is anything that i can do he said in a low tone dont be afraid to tell me  there is one chance she answered a sort of forlorn hope but you might try it he has a secretary a young man named aynesworth if he were on our side  dont you think barrington interrupted that you would have more chance with him than i  she laughed softly  you foolish man she said touching his fingers lightly i believe you think that i am irresistible  i have seen a good many lions tamed he reminded her  nonsense anyhow there is one here who seems quite insensible i have talked already with mr aynesworth he would not listen to me  ah  nevertheless she continued softy of one thing i am very sure every man is like every woman he is vulnerable if you can discover the right spot and the right weapons mr aynesworth is not a womans man but i fancy that he is ambitious i thought that you might go and see him he has rooms somewhere in dorset street  he rose to his feet a glance at the clock reminded him of the hour  i will go he said i will do what i can i think dear he added bending over her to say farewell that you should have been the man  she laughed softly  am i such a failure as a woman then she asked with a swift upward glance dont be foolish lumley my woman will be here to dress me directly you must really go away  he strode down the stairs with tingling pulses and drove to the house where his speech a little florid in its rhetoric and verbose as became the man was nevertheless a great success  quite a clever fellow barrington one of his acquaintances remarked when you get him away from his wife     a forlorn hope  aynesworth ceased tugging at the strap of his portmanteau and rose slowly to his feet a visitor had entered his roomsapparently unannounced  i must apologize the newcomer said for my intrusion your housekeeper i presume it was whom i saw below told me to come up  aynesworth pushed forward a chair  wont you sit down he said i believe that i am addressing mr lumley barrington  not altogether without embarrassment barrington seated himself something of his ordinary confidence of bearing and demeanor had certainly deserted him his manner too was nervous he had the air of being altogether ill at ease  i must apologize further mr aynesworth he continued for an apparently illtimed visit you are i see on the eve of a journey  i am leaving for america tomorrow aynesworth answered  with sir wingrave seton i presume barrington remarked  precisely aynesworth answered  barrington hesitated for a moment aynesworth was civil but inquiring he felt himself very awkwardly placed  mr aynesworth he said i must throw myself upon your consideration you can possibly surmise the reason of my visit  aynesworth shook his head  i am afraid he said that i must plead guilty to densenessin this particular instance at any rate i am altogether at a loss to account for it  you have had some conversation with my wife i believe  yes but  before you proceed mr aynesworth barrington interrupted one word you are aware that sir wingrave seton is in possession of certain documents in which my wife is interested which he refuses to give up  i have understood that such is the case aynesworth admitted will you pardon me if i add that it is a matter which i can scarcely discuss  barrington shrugged his shoulders  let it go for the moment he said there is something else which i want to say to you  aynesworth nodded a little curtly he was not very favorably impressed with his visitor  well  barrington leaned forward in his chair  mr aynesworth he said you have made for yourself some reputation as a writer your name has been familiar to me for some time i was at college i believe with your uncle stanley aynesworth  he paused aynesworth said nothing  i want to know barrington continued impressively what has induced you to accept a position with such a man as seton  that aynesworth declared is easily answered i was not looking for a secretaryship at all or anything of the sort but i chanced to hear his history one night and i was curious to analyze so far as possible his attitude towards life and his fellows on his reappearance in it that is the whole secret  barrington leaned back in his chair and glanced thoughtfully at his companion  you know the story of his misadventures then he remarked  i know all about his imprisonment and the cause of it aynesworth said quietly  barrington was silent for several moments he felt that he was receiving but scanty encouragement  is it worth while mr aynesworth he asked at length there is better work for you in the world than this  again aynesworth preferred to reply by a gesture only barrington was watching him steadily  a political secretaryship mr aynesworth he said might lead you anywhere if you are ambitious it is the surest of all stepping stones into the house after that your career is in your own hands i offer you such a post  i am exceedingly obliged to you aynesworth replied but i scarcely understand  i have influence barrington said which i have never cared to use on my own account i am willing to use it on yours you have only to say the word and the matter is arranged  i can only repeat aynesworth said that i am exceedingly obliged to you mr barrington but i cannot understand why you should interest yourself so much on my behalf  if you wish me to speak in plain words barrington said i will do so i ask you to aid me as a man of honor in the restoration of those letters to my wife  i cannot do it aynesworth said firmly i am sorry that you should have come to me with such an offer it is quite out of the question  barrington held out his hand  do not decide too hastily he said remember this sir wingrave seton had once an opportunity of putting those letters to any use he may have thought fit he ignored it at that time their tenor and contents might easily have been explained after all these years that task would be far more difficult i say that no man has a right to keep a womans letters back from her years after any friendship there may have been between them is over it is not the action of an honorable man sir wingrave seton has placed himself outside the pale of honorable men  your judgment aynesworth answered quietly seems to me severe sir wingrave seton has been the victim of peculiar circumstances  barrington looked at his companion thoughtfully he was wondering exactly how much he knew  you defend him he remarked that is because you have not yet found out what manner of man he is  in any case aynesworth answered i am not his judge mr barrington he added you must forgive me if i remind you that this is a somewhat unprofitable discussion  a short silence followed with barrington it did not appear to be a silence of irresolution he was leaning a little forward in his chair and his head was resting upon his hand of his companion he seemed for the moment to have become oblivious aynesworth watched him curiously was he looking back through the years he wondered to that one brief but lurid chapter of history or was it his own future of which he was thinkinga future which to the world must seem so full of brilliant possibilities and yet which he himself must feel to be so fatally and miserably insecure  mr aynesworth he said at last i suppose from a crude point of view i am here to bribe you  aynesworth shrugged his shoulders  is it worth while he asked a little wearily i have tried to be civilbut i have also tried to make you understand your task is absolutely hopeless  it should not be barrington persisted this is one of those rare cases in which anything is justifiable seton had his chance at the trial he chose to keep silence i do not praise him or blame him for that it was the only course open to a man of honor i maintain that his silence then binds him to silence for ever he has no right to ruin my life and the happiness of my wife by subtle threats to hold those foolish letters over our heads like a thunderbolt held ever in suspense you are ambitious i believe mr aynesworth get me those letters and i will make you my secretary find you a seat in parliament and anything else in reason that you will  aynesworth rose to his feet he wished to intimate that so far as he was concerned the interview was at an end  your proposition mr barrington he said is absolutely impossible in the first place i have no idea where the letters in question are and sir wingrave is never likely to suffer them to pass into my charge  you have opportunities of finding out barrington suggested  and secondly aynesworth continued ignoring the interruption whatever the right or the wrong of this matter may be i am in receipt of a salary from sir wingrave seton and i cannot betray his confidence  barrington also rose to his feet he was beginning to recognize the hopelessness of his task  this is final mr aynesworth he asked  absolutely was the firm reply  barrington bowed stiffly and moved towards the door on the threshold he paused  i trust mr aynesworth he said hesitatingly that you will not regard this as an ordinary attempt at bribery and corruption i have simply asked you to aid me in setting right a great injustice  it is a subtle distinction mr barrington aynesworth answered but i will endeavor to keep in mind your point of view  barrington drove straight home and made his way directly to his study now that he was free from his wifes influence and looked back upon his recent interview he realized for the first time the folly and indignity of the whole proceedings he was angry that a man of common sense keen witted and farseeing in the ordinary affairs of life should have placed himself so completely in a false not to say a humiliating position and then just as suddenly he forgot all about himself and remembered only her with a breath of violets and the delicate rustling of halflifted skirts she had come softly into the room and stood looking at him inquiringly her manner seemed to indicate more a goodnatured curiosity than real anxiety she made a little grimace as he shook his head  i have failed he said shortly that young man is a prig  i was afraid she said that he would be obstinate men with eyes of that color always are  what are we to do ruth  what can we she answered calmly nothing but wait he is going to america it is a terrible country for accidents something may happen to him there do go and change your things theres a dear and look in at the westinghams for me for an hour well just get some supper and come away  i will be ready in ten minutes barrington answered he understood that he was to ask no questions nor did he but all the time his man was hurrying him into his clothes his brain was busy weaving fancies     professor sinclairs dancing academy  mr sinclair or as he preferred to be called professor sinclair waved a white kid glove in the direction of the dancing hall  this way ladies and gentlemen he announced a beautiful valse just about to commence tickets if you please ah glad to see you miss cullingham youll finda friend of yours inside  there was a good deal of giggling as the girls came out from the little dressing room and joined their waiting escorts who stood in a line against the wall mostly struggling with refractory gloves mr sinclair proprietor of the west islington dancing academy and host of these little gatheringsfor a consideration of eighteenpencedid his best by a running fire of conversation to set everyone at their ease he wore a somewhat rusty frock coat black trousers a white dress waistcoat and a red tie evening dress was not de rigueur the money at the door and that everyone should behave as ladies and gentlemen were the only things insisted upon  mr sinclairs best smile and most correct bow was suddenly in evidence  mademoiselle violet he exclaimed to a lady who came in alone we are enchanted we feared that you had deserted us there is a young gentleman inside who is going to be made very happy one shilling change thank you wont you step into the cloak room  the lady shook her head  if you dont mind mr sinclair she said i would rather keep my hat and veil on i can only stay for a few minutes is mr richardson here do you know ah i can see him  she stepped past the professor into the little dancing hall a young lady was pounding upon a piano a boy at her side was playing the violin a few couples were dancing but most of the company was looking on the evening was young and mr sinclair who later on officiated as mc had not yet made his attack upon the general shyness the lady known as mademoiselle violet paused and looked around her suddenly she caught sight of a pale anemiclooking youth who was standing apart from the others lounging against the wall she moved rapidly towards him  how do you do mr richardson she said holding out her hand  he started and a sudden rush of color streamed into his cheeks he took her hand awkwardly and he was almost speechless with nervousness  i dont believe youre at all glad to see me she remarked  oh miss violet he exclaimed he would have said more but the words stuck in his throat  can we sit down somewhere she said i want to talk to you  there were one or two chairs placed behind a red drugget curtain where adventurous spirits led their partners later in the evening they found a place there and the young man recovered his power of speech  not glad to see you he exclaimed almost vehemently why what else do you suppose i come here for every thursday evening i never dance they all make game of me because they know i come here on the chance of seeing you again im a fool i know that you just amuse yourself here with me and then you go away back to your friendsand forget and i hang about round here like the silly ass that i am  my deargeorge  the young man blushed at the sound of his christian name he was mollified despite himself  i suppose its got to be the same thing all over again he declared resignedly youll talk to me and let me be near youand make a fool of me all round and then youll go away and heaven knows when ill see you again you wont let me take you home and wont tell me where you live or who your friends are you do treat me precious badly miss violet  this time she said quietly it will not be the same i have something quite serious to say to you  something seriousyou go on he exclaimed in excitement  have you found another place yet  no i havent really tried i have a little money saved and i could get one tomorrow if  she stopped him with a smiling gesture  i dont mean thatyet she said i wanted to know whether it would be possible for you to go away for a little time if someone paid all your expenses  to go away he repeated blankly what for  mademoiselle violet leaned a little nearer to him  my mistress asked me yesterday she said if i knew anyone who could be trusted who would go away at a moments notice on an errand for her  your mistress he repeated you really are a ladys maid then are you  of course she answered impatiently havent i told you so before now what do you say will you go  i dunno he answered thoughtfully if it had been for you i dont know that id have minded i aint fond of traveling  it is for me she interrupted hastily if i can find her anyone who will do what she wants she will make my fortune she has promised and then  well and then  mademoiselle violet looked at him thoughtfully  i should not make any promises she said demurely but things would certainly be different  the young mans blood was stirred mademoiselle violet stood to him for the whole wonderful world of romance into which he had peered dimly from behind the counter of an islington emporium her low voiceso strange to his ears after the shrill chatter of the young ladies of his acquaintancethe mystery of her coming and going all went to give color to the single dream of his unimaginative life apart from her he was a somewhat vulgar entirely commonplace young man of saving habits and with some aptitude for business in a small way he had been well on his way to becoming a small but successful shopkeeper thereby realizing the only ideals which had yet presented themselves to him when madame violet had unconsciously intervened of what might become of him now he had no clear conception of himself  ill go he declared  mademoiselle violets eyes flashed behind her veil her fingers touched his for a moment  it is a long way she said  i dont care he answered valiantly  toamerica  america he gasped butis this a joke miss violet  she shook her head  of course not america is not a great journey  but it will cost  she laughed softly  my mistress is very rich she said the cost does not matter at all you will have all the money you can spendand more  he felt himself short of breath and bereft of words  gee whiz he murmured  they sat there in silence for a few moments a promenading couple put their heads behind the screen and withdrew with the sound of feminine giggling outside the piano was being thumped to the tune of a popular polka  but what have i go to do he asked  to watch a man who will go out by the same steamer as you she answered write to london tell me what he does how he spends his time whether he is ill or well you must stay at the same hotel in new york and try and find out what his business is there remember we want to know my mistress and i everything that he does  who is he he asked a friend of your mistress  no she answered shortly an enemy a cruel enemythe cruelest enemy a woman could have  the subdued passion of her tone thrilled him he felt himself bewilderedin touch with strange things she leaned a little closer towards him and that mysterious perfume which was one of her many fascinations dazed him with its sweetness  if you could send home word she whispered that he was ill that anything had happened to him that he was not likely to returnour fortunes would be madeyours and mine  stop he muttered youphew its hot here  he wiped the perspiration recklessly from his forehead with a red silk handkerchief  what made you come to me he asked i dont even know the name of your mistress  and you must not ask it she declared quietly it is better for you not to know i came to you because you were a man and i knew that i could trust you  her flattery sank into his soul no one else had ever called him a man he felt himself capable of great things to think that but for the coming of this wonderful mademoiselle violet he might even now have been furnishing a small shop on the outskirts of islington with collars and ties and gloves designed to attract the youth of that populous neighborhood  when do i start he asked with a coolness which surprised himself  she drew a heavy packet from the recesses of the muff she carried  all the particulars are here she said the name of the steamer the name of the man and money you will be told where to get more in new york if you need it  he took it from her mechanically she rose to her feet  you will remember she said looking into his eyes  i aint likely to forget anything youve said tonight he answered honestly but look here let me take you homejust this once give me something to think about  she shook her head  i will give you something to hope for she whispered you must not come a yard with me when you come back it will perhapsbe different  he remained behind the partition gripping the packet tightly mademoiselle violet took a hasty adieu of mr sinclair and descended to the street she walked for a few yards and then turned sharply to the left a hansom into which she stepped at once was waiting there she wrapped herself hastily in a long fur coat which lay upon the seat and thrust her hand through the trap door  st martins schoolroom she told the cabman  apparently mademoiselle violet combined a taste for philanthropy with her penchant for islington dancing halls she entered the little schoolroom and made her way to the platform dispensing many smiles and nods amongst the audience of the concert which was momentarily interrupted for her benefit she was escorted on to the platform by a young and earnestlooking clergyman and given a chair in the center of the little group who were gathered there and after the conclusion of the song the clergyman expressed his gratification to the audience that a lady with so many calls upon her time such high social duties should yet find time to show her deep interest in their welfare by this most kind visit after which he ventured to call upon lady barrington to say a few words     mephistopheles on a steamer  in some respects the voyage across the atlantic was a surprise to aynesworth his companion seemed to have abandoned for the time at any rate his habit of taciturnity he conversed readily if a little stiffly with his fellow passengers he divided his time between the smoke room and the deck and very seldom sought the seclusion of his state room aynesworth remarked upon this change one night as the two men paced the deck after dinner  you are beginning to find more pleasure he said in talking to people  wingrave shook his head  by no means he answered coldly it is extremely distasteful to me  then why do you do it aynesworth asked bluntly  wingrave never objected to being asked questions by his secretary he seemed to recognize the fact that aynesworths retention of his post was due to a desire to make a deliberate study of himself and while his own attitude remained purely negative he at no time exhibited any resentment or impatience  i do it for several reasons he answered first because misanthropy is a luxury in which i cannot afford to indulge secondly because i am really curious to know whether the time will ever return when i shall feel the slightest shadow of interest in any human being i can only discover this by affecting a toleration for these peoples society which i can assure you if you are curious about the matter is wholly assumed  aynesworth shrugged his shoulders  surely he said you find mrs travers entertaining  wingrave reflected for a moment  you mean the lady with a stock of epigrams and a green veil he remarked no i do not find her entertaining  your neighbor at table then miss packe  if my affections have perished wingrave answered grimly my taste i hope is unimpaired the young person who travels to improve her mind and fills up the gaps by reading baedeker on the places she hasnt been to fails altogether to interest me  arent you a little severe aynesworth remarked  i suppose wingrave answered that it depends upon the point of view to use a hackneyed phrase you study people with a discerning eye for good qualities natureand circumstances have ordered it otherwise with me i see them through darkened glasses  it is not the way to happiness aynesworth said  there is no highroad to what you term happiness wingrave answered one holds the string and follows into the maze but one does not choose ones way you are perhaps more fortunate than i that you can appreciate mrs travers wit and find my neighbor who has done europe attractive that is a matter of disposition  i should like aynesworth remarked to have known you fifteen years ago  wingrave shrugged his shoulders  i fancy he said that i was a fairly average personi mean that i was possessed of an average share of the humanities i have only my memory to go by i am one of those fortunate persons you see who have realized an actual reincarnation i have the advantage of having looked out upon life from two different sets of windowsby the bye aynesworth have you noticed that unwholesomelooking youth in a serge suit there  aynesworth nodded  what about him  i fancy that he must knowmy history he sits all day long smoking bad cigarettes and watching me he makes clumsy attempts to enter into conversation with me he is interested in us for some reason or other  aynesworth nodded  shocking young bounder he remarked ive noticed him myself  talk to him some time and find out what he means by it wingrave said i dont want to find my biography in the american newspapers it might interfere with my operations there heres this woman coming to worry us you take her off aynesworth i shall go into the smoking room  but mrs travers was not so easily to be disposed of for some reason or other she had shown a disposition to attach herself to wingrave  please put me in my chair she said to him holding out her rug and cushion no not you mr aynesworth mr wingrave understands so much better how to wrap me up thanks wont you sit down yourself its much better for you out here than in the smoking roomand we might go on with our argument  i thought wingrave remarked accepting her invitation after a moments hesitation that we were to abandon it  that was before dinner she answered glancing sideways at him i feel braver now  you are prepared he remarked for unconditional surrender  she looked at him again she had rather nice eyes quite dark and very soft and she was a great believer in their efficacy  of my argument  he did not answer her for a moment he had turned his head slightly towards her and though his face was as usual expressionless and his eyes cold and hard she found nevertheless something of meaning in his steady regard there was a flush in her cheek when she looked away  i am afraid she remarked that you are rather a terrible person  you flatter me he murmured i am really quite harmless  not from conviction then i am sure she remarked  perhaps not he admitted let us call it from lack of enterprise the virtues are all very admirable things but it is the men and women with vices who have ruled the world the good die young because there is no useful work for them to do no really satisfactory person from a moral point of view ever achieved greatness  she half closed her eyes  my head is going round she murmured what an upheaval fancy mephistopheles on a steamer  he was at any rate the most interesting of that little trio wingrave remarked but even he was a trifle heavy  do you go about the world preaching your new doctrines she asked  not i he answered nothing would every make a missionary of me for good or for evil for the simple reason that no one elses welfare except my own has the slightest concern for me  what hideous selfishness she said softly but i dont thinkyou quite mean it  i can assure you i do he answered drily my world consists of myself for the central figure and the half a dozen or so of people who are useful or amusing to me except that the rest are needed to keep moving the machinery of the world they might all perish so far as i was concerned  i dont think mrs travers said softly that i should like to be in your world  i can very easily believe you he answered  unless she remarked tentatively i came to convert  he nodded  there is something in that he admitted it would be a great work a little difficult you know  all the more interesting  you see he continued i am not only bad but i admire badness my wish is to remain badin fact i should like to be worse if i knew how you would find it hard to make a start i couldnt even admit that a state of goodness was desirable  she looked at him curiously the night air was perhaps getting colder for she shivered and drew the rug a little closer around her  you speak like a prophet she remarked  a prophet of evil then  she looked at him steadfastly the lightness had gone out of her tone  do you know she said i am almost sorry that i ever knew you  he shook his head  you cant mean it he declared  why not  i have done you the greatest service one human being can render another i have saved you from being bored  she nodded  that may be true she admitted but can you conceive no worse state in the world than being bored  there is no worse state he answered drily i was bored once he added for ten years or so i ought to know  were you married she asked  he shook his head  not quite so bad as that he answered i was in prison  she turned a startled face towards him  nonsense  it is perfectly true he said coolly are you horrified  what did you do she asked in a low tone  i killed a man  purposely  he shrugged his shoulders  he attacked me i had to defend myself  she said nothing for several moments  shall i go he asked  no sit still she answered i am frightened of you but i dont want you to go away i want to think yes i can understand you better now your life was spoilt  by no means he answered i am still young i am going to make up for those ten years  she shook her head  you cannot she answered the years can carry no more than their ordinary burden of sensations if you try to fill them too full you lose everything  i shall try what i can do he remarked calmly  she rose abruptly  i am afraid of you tonight she said i am going downstairs will you give my rug and cushion to the deck steward andgood night  she gave him her hand but she did not look at him and she hurried away a little abruptly  wingrave yawned and lighting a cigar strolled up and down the deck a figure loomed out of the darkness and almost ran into him it was the young man in the serge suit he muttered a clumsy apology and hurried on     a cockney conspirator  the bar closes in ten minutes sir the smoking room steward announced  the young man who had been the subject of wingraves remarks hastily ordered another drink although he had an only halfemptied tumbler in front of him presently he stumbled out on to the deck it was a dark night and a strong head wind was blowing he groped his way to the railing and leaned over with his head half buried in his hands below the black tossing sea was churned into phosphorescent spray as the steamer drove onwards into the night  was it he indeedgeorge richardson he doubted it the world of tape measures and calico counters seemed so far away the interior of his quondam lodgings in a bystreet of islington so unfamiliar and impossible he felt himself swallowed up in this new and bewildering existence of which he was so insignificant an atom the existence where tragedy reared her gloomy head and the shadows of great things loomed around him down there in the cold restless waste of black waterswhat was it that he saw the sweat broke out upon his forehead the blood seemed turned to ice in his veins he knew very well that his fancy mocked him that it was not indeed a mans white face gleaming on the crest of the waves but none the less he was terrified  mr richardson was certainly nervous not all the brandy he had drunkand he had never drunk half as much before in his lifeafforded him the least protection from these ghastly fancies the step of a sailor on the deck made him shiver the thought of his empty state room was a horror he tried to think of the woman at whose bidding he had left behind him islington and the things that belonged to islington he tried to recall her soft suggestive whispers the glances which promised more even than her spoken words all the perfume and mystery of her wonderful presence her very name was an allurement mademoiselle violet how softly it fell from the lips god in heaven what was that he started round trembling in every limb it was nothing more than the closing of the smoking room door behind him sailors with buckets and mops were already beginning their nightly tasks he must go to his state room somehow or other he must get through the night  he did it but he was not a very prepossessing looking object when he staggered out on deck twelve hours later into the noon sunshine the chair towards which he looked so eagerly was occupied he scarcely knew himself whether that little gulp of acute feeling which shot through his veins was of relief or disappointment while he hesitated wingrave raised his head  wingrave did not as a rule speak to his fellow passengers of richardson he had not hitherto taken the slightest notice yet this morning of all others he addressed him  i believe he said holding it out towards him that this envelope is yours i found it under your chair  richardson muttered something inarticulate and almost snatched it away it was the envelope of the fatal letter which mademoiselle violet had written him to queenstown  sit down mr richardson if you are not in a hurry wingrave continued calmly i was hoping that i might see you this morning can you spare me a few minutes  richardson subsided into his chair his heart was thumping against his ribs wingraves voice sounded to him like a faroff thing  the handwriting upon that envelope which i have just restored to you mr richardson is well known to me wingrave continued gazing steadfastly at the young man whom he was addressing  the envelope the handwriting richardson faltered iit was from  an instants pause wingrave raised his eyebrows  ah he said we need not mention the ladys name that she should be a correspondent of yours however helps me to understand better several matters which have somewhat puzzled me lately no dont go my dear sir we must really have this affair straightened out  what affair richardson demanded with a very weak attempt at bluster i dont understand youdont understand you at all  wingrave leaned a little forward in his chair his eyebrows were drawn close together his gaze was entirely merciless  you are not well this morning he remarked a little headache perhaps wont you try one of these phenacetine lozengesexcellent things for a headache i believe warranted in fact to cure all bodily ailments for ever what you dont like the look of them  the young man cowered back in his chair he was gripping the sides tightly with both hands and the pallor of a ghastly fear had spread over his face  idont know what you mean he faltered i havent a headache  wingrave looked thoughtfully at the box between his fingers  if you took one of these mr richardson he said you would never have another at any rate now tell me sir how you came by them  i know nothing about the young man began  dont lie to me sir wingrave said sharply i have been wondering what the  you meant by hanging around after me giving the deck steward five shillings to put your chair next mine and pretending to read while all the time you were trying to overhear any scraps of conversation between my secretary and myself i thought you were simply guilty of impertinent curiosity this however rather alters the look of affairs  what does richardson asked faintly that box aint mine  perhaps not wingrave answered but you found it in my state room and filled it up with its present contents my servant saw you coming out and immediately went in to see what you had stolen and report you he found nothing missing but he found this box full of lozenges which he knows quite well was half full before you went in now what was your object mr richardson in tampering with that box upon my shelf  i havei have never seen it before richardson declared i have never been in your state room  the deck steward was passing wingrave summoned him  i wish you would ask my servant to step this way he said you will find him in my state room  the man disappeared through the companion way richardson rose to his feet  im not going to stay here to be bullied and cross examined he declared im off  one moment wingrave said if you leave me now i shall ask the captain to place you under arrest  richardson looked half fearfully around  what for  attempted murder very clumsily attempted but attempted murder none the less  the young man collapsed wingraves servant came down the deck  you sent for me sir he inquired respectfully  wingrave pointed towards his companion  was that the person whom you saw coming out of my state room he asked  yes sir the man replied at once  you could swear to him if necessary  certainly sir  that will do morrison  the man withdrew wingrave turned to his victim a few weeks ago he remarked i had a visit from the lady whose handwriting is upon that envelope i had on the table before me a box of phenacetine lozenges she naturally concluded that i was in the habit of using them that lady has unfortunately cause to consider me if not an enemy something very much like it you are in correspondence with her only last night you placed in my box of these lozenges some others closely resembling them but fortunately a little different in shape mine were harmlessas a matter of fact a single one of yours would kill a man in ten minutes now mr richardson what have you to say about all this why should i not send for the captain and have you locked up till we arrive at new york  richardson drew his handkerchief across his damp forehead  you cant prove nothing he muttered  i am afraid that i must differ from you wingrave answered we will see what the captain has to say  he leaned forward in his chair to attract the attention of a seaman  richardson interposed  all right he said thickly suppose i own up what then  a few questionsnothing terrifying i am not very frightened of you  go on  how did you become acquainted with the writer of that letter  richardson hesitated  she came to a dancing class at islington he said  wingraves face was expressionless but his tone betrayed his incredulity  a dancing class at islington nonsense  mind the young man asserted it was her mistress who put her up to this it was nothing to do with her it was for her mistresss sake  do you know the mistress wingrave asked  no i dont know her name even never heard it  your letter then was from the maid  of course it was richardson answered if you recognize the writing you must know that yourself  wingrave looked reflectively seaward the matter was not entirely clear to him yet he was sure that this young man was telling the truth so far as he could divine it  well he said you have made your attempt and failed if fortune had favored you you might at this moment have been a murderer i might have warned you by the bye that i am an exceedingly hard man to kill  richardson looked uneasily around  i aint admitting anything you know he said  precisely well what are you going to do now are you satisfied with your first reverse or are you going to renew the experiment  ive had enough was the dogged answer ive been made a fool of i can see that i shall return home by the next steamer i never ought to have got mixed up in this  i am inclined to agree with you wingrave remarked calmly do i understand that if i choose to forget this little episode you will return to england by the next steamer  i swear it richardson declared  and in the meantime that you make no further attempt of a similar nature  not i he answered with emphasis ive had enough  then wingrave said we need not prolong this conversation forgive my suggesting mr richardson that whilst i am on deck the other side of the ship should prove more convenient for you  the young man rose and without a word staggered off wingrave watched him through halfclosed eyes until he disappeared  it was worth trying he said softly to himself a very clever woman that she looks forward through the years and she sees the clouds gathering it was a little risky and the means were very crude but it was worth trying     the moth and the candle  tomorrow morning aynesworth remarked we shall land  wingrave nodded  i shall not be sorry he said shortly  aynesworth fidgeted about he had something to say and he found it difficult wingrave gave him no encouragement he was leaning back in his steamer chair with his eyes fixed upon the sky line notwithstanding the incessant companionship of the last six days aynesworth felt that he had not progressed a single step towards establishing any more intimate relations between his employer and himself  mrs travers is not on deck this afternoon he remarked a trifle awkwardly  indeed wingrave answered i hadnt noticed  aynesworth sat down there was nothing to be gained by fencing  i wanted to talk about her sir if i might he said  wingrave withdrew his eyes from the sea and looked at his companion in cold surprise  to me he asked  yes i thought the first few days that mrs travers was simply a vain little woman of the world perfectly capable of taking care of herself and heartless enough to flirt all day long if she chose without any risk so far as she was concerned i believe i made a mistake  this is most interesting wingrave said calmly but why talk to me about the lady i fancy that i know as much about her as you do  very likely but you may not have realized the same things mrs travers is a married woman with a husband in boston and two little children of whom i believe she is really very fond she is a foolish goodnatured little woman who thinks herself clever because her husband has permitted her to travel a good deal and has evidently been rather fascinated by the latitudinarianism of continental society she is a little afraid of being terribly bored when she gets back to boston and she is very sentimental  i had no idea wingrave remarked that you had been submitting the lady and her affairs to the ordeal of your marvelous gift of analysis i rather fancied that you took no interest in her at all  i did not aynesworth answered until last night  and last night he repeated questioningly  i found her on deckcrying she had been tearing up some photographs and she talked a little wildly i talked to her then for a little time  cant you be more explicit wingrave asked  aynesworth looked him in the face  she gave me the impression he said that she did not intend to return to her husband  wingrave nodded  and what have you to say to me about this he asked  i have no right to say anything of course aynesworth answered you might very properly tell me that it is no concern of mine mrs travers has already compromised herself to some extent with the people on board who know her and her family she never leaves your side for a moment if she can help it and for the last two or three days she has almost followed you about you may possibly derive some amusement from her society for a short time butafterwards  explain yourself exactly wingrave said  is it necessary aynesworth declared brusquely talk sensibly to her dont encourage her if she should really be contemplating anything foolish  why not  oh hang it all aynesworth declared im not a moralist but shes a decent little woman dont ruin her life for the sake of a little diversion  wingrave who had been holding a cigar case in his hand for the last few minutes opened it and calmly selected a cigar  arent you a little melodramatic aynesworth he said  sounds like it no doubt his companion answered but after all hang it shes not a bad little sort and you wouldnt care to meet her in piccadilly in a couple of years time  wingrave turned a little in his chair there was a slight hardening of the mouth a cold gleam in his eyes  that he remarked is precisely where you are wrong i am afraid you have forgotten our previous conversations on this or a similar subject disconnect me in your mind at once from all philanthropic notions i desire to make no one happy to assist at no ones happiness my own life has been ruined by a woman her sex shall pay me where it can if i can obtain from the lady in question a single seconds amusement her future is a matter of entire indifference to me she can play the repentant wife or resort to the primeval profession of her sex i should not even have the curiosity to inquire which  in that case aynesworth said slowly i presume that i need say no more  unless it amuses you wingrave answered it really is not worth while  perhaps aynesworth remarked it is as well that i should tell you this i shall put the situation before mrs travers exactly as i see it i shall do my best to dissuade her from any further or more intimate intercourse with you  at the risk of course wingrave said of my offering youthis  he drew a paper from his pocket book and held it out it was the return half of a steamer ticket  even at that risk aynesworth answered without hesitation  wingrave carefully folded the document and returned it to his pocket  i am glad he said to find that you are so consistent there is mrs travers scolding the deck steward go and talk to her you will scarcely find a better opportunity  aynesworth rose at once wingrave in a few moments also left his seat but proceeded in the opposite direction he made his way into the pursers room and carefully closed the door behind him  mrs travers greeted aynesworth without enthusiasm her eyes were resting upon the empty place which wingrave had just vacated  can i get your chair for you mrs travers aynesworth asked or shall we walk for a few minutes  mrs travers hesitated she looked around but there was obviously no escape for her  i should like to sit down she said i am very tired this morning my chair is next mr wingraves there  aynesworth found her rug and wrapped it around her she leaned back and closed her eyes  i shall try to sleep she said i had such a shocking night  he understood at once that she was on her guard and he changed his tactics  first he said may i ask you a question  she opened her eyes wide and looked at him she was afraid  not now she said hurriedly this afternoon  this afternoon i may not have the opportunity he answered is your husband going to meet you at new york mrs travers  no  are you going direct to boston  she looked at him steadily there was a slight flush of color in her cheeks  i find your questions impertinent mr aynesworth she answered  there was a short silence aynesworth hated his task and hated himself but most of all he pitied the woman who sat by his side  no he said they are not impertinent i am the lookeron you know and i have seena good deal if wingrave were an ordinary sort of man i should never have dared to interfere if you had been an ordinary sort of woman i might not have cared to  she half rose in her chair  i shall not stay here she began struggling with her rug  do he begged i ami want to be your friend really  you are supposed to be his she reminded him  he shook his head  i am his secretary there is no question of friendship between us for the rest i told him that i should speak to you  you have no right to discuss me at all she declared vehemently  none whatever he admitted i have to rely entirely upon your mercy this is the truth people are thrown together a good deal on a voyage like this you and mr wingrave have seen a good deal of one another you are a very impressionable woman he is a singularly cold unimpressionable man you have found his personality attractive you fancyother things wingrave is not the man you think he is he is selfish and entirely without affectionate impulses the world has treated him badly and he has no hesitation in saying that he means to get some part of his own back again he does not care for you he does not care for anyone if you should be contemplating anything ridiculous from a mistaken judgment of his character it is better that you should know the truth  the anger had gone she was pale again and her lips were trembling  men seldom know one another she said softly you judge from the surface only  mine is the critical judgment of one who has studied him intimately aynesworth said yours is the sentimental hope of one fascinated by what she does not understand wingrave is utterly heartless  that she answered steadfastly i do not believe  you do not because you will not he declared i have spoken because i wish to save you from doing what you would repent of for the rest of your days you have the one vanity which is common to all women you believe that you can change what believe me is unchangeable to wingrave women are less than playthings he owes the unhappiness of his life to one and he would see the whole of her sex suffer without emotion he is impregnable to sentiment ask him and i believe that he would admit it  she smiled and regarded him with the mild pity of superior knowledge  you do not understand mr wingrave she remarked  aynesworth sighed he realized that every word he had spoken had been wasted upon this pale pretty woman who sat with her eyes now turned seawards and the smile still lingering upon her lips studying her for a moment he realized the danger more acutely than ever before the fretfulness seemed to have gone from her face the weary lines from her mouth she had the look of a woman who has come into the knowledge of better things and it was wingrave who had done this aynesworth for the first time frankly hated the man once as a boy he had seen a keeper take a rabbit from a trap and dash its brains out against a tree the incident flashed then into his mind only the face of the keeper was the face of wingrave     devil take the hindmost  wingrave and aynesworth were alone in a private room of the waldorf astoria hotel the table at which the former was seated was covered with letters and papers a new york directory and an atlas were at his elbow  i propose wingrave said leaning back in his chair to give you some idea of the nature of my business in this country you will be able then i trust to carry out my instructions more intelligibly  aynesworth nodded  i thought he said that you came here simply to remain in seclusion for a time  that is one of my reasons wingrave admitted but i had a special purpose in coming to america during myenforced seclusioni made the acquaintance of a man called hardwell he was an englishman but he had lived in america for some years and had got into trouble over some company business we had some conversation and it is upon his information that i am now going to act  he is trustworthy aynesworth asked  i take the risk wingrave answered coolly there is a small copper mine in utah called the royal hardwell copper mine the shares are hundred dollar ones and there are ten thousand of them they are scarcely quoted now as the mine has become utterly discredited hardwell managed this himself with a false report he meant to have the company go into liquidation and then buy it for a very small amount as a matter of fact the mine is good and could be worked at a large profit  you have hardwells word for that aynesworth remarked  exactly wingrave remarked i am proceeding on the assumption that he told me the truth i wish to buy if possible the whole of the shares and as many more as i can get brokers to sell the price of the shares today is two dollars  i presume you will send out an expert to the mine first aynesworth said  i shall do nothing of the sort wingrave answered the fact that i was buying upon information would send the shares up at once i mean to buy first and then go out to the mine if i have made a mistake i shall not be ruined if hardwells story is true there will be millions in it  aynesworth said nothing but his face expressed a good deal  here are the names of seven respectable brokers wingrave continued passing a sheet of paper towards him i want you to buy five hundred shares from each of them the price may vary a few points whatever it is pay it here are seven signed checks i shall buy myself as many as i can without spoiling the market you had better start out in about a quarter of an hour and see to this you have my private ledger  yes  open an account to hardwell in it a quarter of all the shares i buy are to be in his name and a quarter of all the profits i make in dealing in the shares is to be credited to him  a fairly generous arrangement for mr hardwell aynesworth remarked  there is nothing generous about it wingrave answered coldly it is the arrangement i made with him and to which i propose to adhere you understand what i want you to do  perfectly aynesworth answered i still think however that much the wiser course would be to send an expert to the mine first  indeed wingrave remarked politely that is all i think i shall expect to see you at luncheon time if you are asked questions as to why you are dealing in these shares to such an extent you can say that the friend for whom you are acting desires to boom copper and is going on the low price of the metal at the moment they will think you a fool and perhaps may not trouble to conceal their opinion after they have finished the business you must endeavor to support the character i have no doubt but that you will be successful  aynesworth moved towards the door  once more wingrave called him back he was leaning a little forward across the table his face was very set and cold  there is a question which i wish to ask you aynesworth he said it concerns another matter altogether do you know who sent the marconigram to dr travers which brought him to new york to meet his wife  i do not aynesworth answered  it was sent by someone on board the ship wingrave continued you have no suspicion as to whom it could have been  none aynesworth answered firmly at the same time i do not mind telling you this if i had thought of it i would have sent it myself  wingrave shrugged his shoulders  it is perhaps fortunate for the continuation of our mutual relations that you did not think of it he remarked quietly i accept your denial i shall expect you back at one oclock  at a few minutes after that hour the two men sat down to luncheon wingrave at that time was the possessor of six thousand shares in the royal hardwell copper mine which had cost him on an average two dollars twentyfive the news of the dealing however had got about and although derision was the chief sentiment amongst the brokers the price steadily mounted a dozen telegrams were sent out to the mine and on receipt of the replies the dealing became the joke of the day the mine was still deserted and no fresh inspection had been made the price dropped a little then wingrave bought a thousand more by telephone and it rose again to four a few minutes before closing time he threw every share of which he was possessed upon the market and the next morning royal hardwells stood at one dollar seventyfive  for a week wingrave pursued the same tactics and at the end of that time he had made twenty thousand dollars the brokers however now understood or thought they understood the situation no one bought for the rise they were all sellers wingrave at once changed his tactics he bought five thousand shares in one block and sold none even then the market was only mildly amused in a fortnight he was the nominal owner of sixteen thousand shares in a company of which only ten thousand actually existed then he sat still and the panic began the shares in a company which everyone believed to be worthless stood at thirty dollars and not a share was offered  a small pandemonium reigned in wingraves sitting room the telephone rang all the time the place was besieged with brokers then wingrave showed his hand he had bought these shares to hold he did not intend to sell one as to the six thousand owed to him beyond the number issued he was prepared to consider offers one broker left him a check for twenty thousand dollars another for nearly forty thousand wingrave had no pity he had gambled and won he would accept nothing less than par price the air in his sitting room grew thick with curses and tobacco smoke  aynesworth began by hating the whole business but insensibly the fascination of it crept over him he grew used to hearing the various forms of protest of argument and abuse which one and all left wingrave so unmoved sphinxlike he lounged in his chair and listened to all he never condescended to justify his position he never met argument by argument he had the air of being thoroughly bored by the whole proceedings but he exacted always his pound of flesh  on the third afternoon aynesworth met on the stairs a young broker whom he had come across once or twice during his earlier dealings in the shares they had had lunch together and aynesworth had taken a fancy to the boyhe was little morefresh from harvard and full of enthusiasm he scarcely recognized him for a moment the fresh color had gone from his cheeks his eyes were set in a fixed wild stare he seemed suddenly aged aynesworth stopped him  hullo nesbitt he exclaimed whats wrong  the young man would have passed on with a muttered greeting but aynesworth turned round with him and led the way into one of the smaller smoking rooms he called for drinks and repeated his question  your governor has me six hundred hardwells short nesbitt answered curtly  six hundred what does it mean aynesworth asked  sixty thousand dollars or thereabouts the young man answered despairingly his brokers wont listen to me and your governorwell ive just been to see him i wont call him names and we thought that some fool of an englishman was burning his fingers with those shares im not the only one caught but the others can stand it i cant worse luck  im beastly sorry aynesworth said truthfully i wish i could help you  nesbitt raised his head a sudden light flashed in his eyes he spoke quickly almost feverishly  say aynesworth he exclaimed do you think you could do anything with your governor for me you seeits ruin if i have to pay up i wouldnt mindfor myself but i was married four months ago and i cant bear the thought of going homeand telling her all the money we have between us is in my business and weve got no rich friends or anything of that sort i dont know what ill do if i have to be hammered ive been so careful too i didnt want to take this on but it seemed such a soft thing if i could get off with twenty thousand id keep my head up i hate to talk like this id go down like a man if i were alone butbutoh confound it all he exclaimed with an ominous break in his tone  aynesworth laid his hand upon the boys arm  look here he said ill try what i can do with mr wingrave wait here  aynesworth found his employer alone with his broker who was just hastening off to keep an appointment he plunged at once into his appeal  mr wingrave he said you have just had a young broker named nesbitt on  wingrave glanced at a paper by his side  yes he said six hundred short i wish they wouldnt come to me  ive been talking to him downstairs aynesworth said this will break him  then i ought not to have done business with him at all wingrave said coolly if he cannot find sixty thousand dollars he has no right to be in wall street i daresay hell pay though they all plead povertycurs  i think nesbitts case is a little different from the others aynesworth continued he is quite young little more than a boy and he has only just started in business to be hammered would be absolute ruin for him he seems such a decent young fellow and hes only just married hes in an awful state downstairs i wish youd have another talk with him i think youd feel inclined to let him down easy  wingrave smiled coldly  my dear aynesworth he said you astonish me i am not interested in this young mans future or in his matrimonial arrangements he has gambled with me and lost i presume that he would have taken my money if i had been the fool they all thought me as it is i mean to have hisdown to the last cent  he isnt like the others aynesworth protested doggedly hes only a boyand it seems such jolly hard luck doesnt it only four months married new york hasnt much pity for paupers he looks mad enough to blow his brains out have him up sir and see if you cant compromise  fetch him wingrave said curtly  aynesworth hurried downstairs the boy was walking restlessly up and down the room the look he turned upon aynesworth was almost pitiful  hell see you again aynesworth said hurriedly come along  the boy wrung his hand  youre a brick he declared     the hidden hand  wingrave glanced up as they entered he motioned nesbitt to a chair by his side but the young man remained standing  my secretary tells me wingrave said curtly that you cannot pay me what you owe  its more than i possess in the world sir nesbitt answered  it is not a large amount wingrave said i do not see how you can carry on business unless you can command such a sum as this  nesbitt moistened his dry lips with his tongue  i have only been doing a very small business sir he answered but quite enough to make a living i dont speculate as a rule hardwells seemed perfectly safe or i wouldnt have touched them i sold at four they are not worth one i could have bought thousands last week for two dollars  that is beside the question wingrave answered if you do not pay this you have cheated me out of my profits for i should have placed the commission with brokers who could why did you wish to see me again  i thought that you might give me time nesbitt answered raising his head and looking wingrave straight in the face it seems rather a low down thing to come begging id rather cut my right hand off than do it for myself but ivesomeone else to think about and if im hammered im done for give me a chance mr wingrave ill pay you in time  what do you ask for wingrave said  i thought that you might give me time nesbitt said and ill pay you the rest off with the whole of my profits every year  a most absurd proposal wingrave said coolly i will instruct my brokers to take twenty thousand dollars down and wait one week for the balance that is the best offer i can make you good day  the young man stood as though he were stunned  ii cant find it he faltered i cant indeed  your resources are not my affair wingrave said i shall instruct my broker to do as i have said if the money is not forthcoming you know the alternative  you mean to ruin me then nesbitt said slowly  i mean to exact the payment of what is due to me wingrave said curtly if you cannot pay it seems to me that i am the person to be pitiednot you show mr nesbitt out aynesworth  nesbitt turned towards the door he was very pale but he walked steadily he did not speak another word to wingrave  im beastly sorry aynesworth said to him on the stairs i wish i could help you  thank you nesbitt answered no one can help me im through  aynesworth returned to the sitting room wingrave had lit a cigarette and watched him as he arranged some papers  quite a comedy isnt it he remarked grimly  it doesnt present itself in that light to me aynesworth answered  wingrave blew the smoke away from in front of his face ah he said i forgot that you were a sentimentalist i look upon these things from my own point of view from yours i suppose i must seem a very disagreeable person i admit frankly that the sufferings of other people do not affect me in the slightest  i am sorry for you aynesworth said shortly if there is going to be much of this sort of thing though i must ask you to relieve me of my post i cant stand it  whenever you like my dear fellow wingrave answered i think that you would be very foolish to leave me though i must be a most interesting study  you arewhat the devil made you aynesworth muttered  wingrave laid down his cigarette  i am what my fellows have made me he said slowly i tasted hell for a good many years it has left me i suppose with a depraved taste ring up my brokers aynesworth i want to speak to malcolmson he had better come round here  the day dragged on aynesworth hated it all and was weary long before it was half over everyone who came was angry and a good many came whom wingrave refused to see just before five oclock young nesbitt entered the room unannounced aynesworth started towards him with a little exclamation the young mans evident excitement terrified him and he feared a tragedy malcolmson too half rose to his feet wingrave alone remained unmoved  nesbitt walked straight up to the table at which malcolmson and wingrave were sitting he halted in front of the latter  mr wingrave he said you will give me my receipt for those shares for fiftyseven thousand six hundred dollars  wingrave turned to a paper by his side and ran his forefinger down the list of names  mr nesbitt he said yes sixty thousand dollars  the young man laid a slip of paper upon the table  that is a certified check for the amount he said mr malcolmson please give me my receipt  ah mr wingrave remarked i thought that you would find the money  nesbitt bit his lip but he said nothing till he had the receipt and had fastened it up in his pocket then he turned suddenly round upon wingrave  look here he said youve got your money i dont owe you a cent now im going to tell you what i think of you  wingrave rose slowly to his feet he was as tall as the boy long lean and hard his face expressed neither anger nor excitement but there was a slight dangerous glitter in his deepset eyes  if you mean he said that you are going to be impertinent i would recommend you to change your mind  nesbitt for a moment hesitated there was something ominous in the cool courage of the older man and before he could collect himself wingrave continued  i presume he said that you chose your own profession you knew quite well there was no place in it for men with a sense of the higher morality it is a profession of gamblers and thieves if youd won youd have thought yourself a smart fellow and pocketed your winnings fast enough now that youve lostdont whine you sat down willingly enough to play the game with me dont call me names because you lost this is no place for children pocket your defeat and be more careful next time  nesbitt was silent for a moment wingrave cool and immovable dominated him he gave a little laugh and turned towards the door  guess youre right he declared well let it go at that  aynesworth followed him from the room  im awfully glad youre out of the scrape he said  nesbitt caught him by the arm  come right along he said i havent had a drink in the daytime for a year but were going to have a big one now i say do you know how i got that money  aynesworth shook his head  on easy terms i hope  they sat down in the american bar and a colored waiter in a white linen suit brought them whisky and apollinaris in tall tumblers  listen nesbitt said my brain is on the reel still i went back to my office and if it hadnt been for the little girl i should have brought a revolver by the way old johnny there waiting to see me no end of a swell phillson the uptown lawyer he went straight for me  been dealing in hardwells he asked  i nodded  short eh  six hundred shares i answered there was no harm in telling him for the street knew well enough  bad job he said how much does wingrave want  shares at par i answered it comes to close on fiftyseven thousand six hundred dollars  im going to find you the money he said  then i can tell you the things in my office began to swim id an idea somehow that he was there as a friend but nothing like this i couldnt answer him  its a delicate piece of business he went on in fact the fewer questions you ask the better all i can say is theres a chap in wall street got his eye on you your old dad once helped him over a much worse place than this anyhow ive a check here for sixty thousand dollars and no conditions only that you dont talk  but when am i to pay it back i gasped  if my client ever needs it and you can afford it he will ask for it phillson answered thats all  and before i could say another darned word he was gone and the check was there on my desk  aynesworth sipped his whisky and apollinaris and lit a cigarette  and they say he murmured that romance does not exist in wall street youre a lucky chap nesbitt  lucky do you think i dont realize it of course i know the old governor had lots of friends on the street but he was never in a big way and he got hit awfully hard himself before he died i cant understand it anyway  i wouldnt try aynesworth remarked laughing by the bye your friend whoever he was must have got to know pretty quickly  nesbitt nodded  i thought of that he said of course phillsons are lawyers for malcolmson wingraves broker so i daresay it came from him say aynesworth you dont mind if i ask you something  not at all aynesworth answered what is it  why the devil do you stop with a man like wingrave he doesnt seem your sort at all  aynesworth hesitated  wingrave interests me he answered he has had a curious life and he is a man with very strange ideas  nesbitt finished his drink and rose up  well he said hes not a man i should care to be associated with not but what i daresay he was right upstairs hes strong too and he must have a nerve but hes a brute for all that  nesbitt went his way and aynesworth returned upstairs wingrave was alone  have we finished this miserable business aynesworth asked  for the present wingrave answered mr malcolmson will supply you with a copy of the accounts see that hardwell is credited with a quarter share of the profits our dealings are over for the present be prepared to start on saturday for the west we are going to look for those bears  but the mine aynesworth exclaimed it belongs to you now arent you going out to examine it  wingrave shook his head  no he said i know nothing about mines my visit could not teach me anything one way or the other i have sent a commission of experts i am tired of cities and moneymaking i want a change  aynesworth looked at him suddenly the weariness was there indeedwas it his fancy or was it something more than weariness which shone out of the dark tired eyes     book ii     mr wingrave from america  four years ago tonight aynesworth said looking round the club smoking room thoughtfully we bade you farewell in this same room  lovell wan and holloweyed his arm in a sling his once burly frame gaunt and attenuated with disease nodded  and i told you the story he remarked ofthe man who had been my friend  dont let us talk of wingrave tonight aynesworth exclaimed with sudden emphasis  why not lovell knocked the ashes from his pipe and commenced leisurely to refill it why not indeed i mean to go and see him as soon as i can get about a little better  if your description of him aynesworth said was a faithful one you will find him changed  lovell laughed a little bitterly  the years leave their mark he said upon us allupon all of us that is who step out into the open where the winds of life are blowing look at me i weighed eighteen stone when i left england i had the muscles of a prize fighter and nerves of steel today i turn the scale at ten stone and am afraid to be alone in the dark  you will be yourself again in no time aynesworth declared cheerfully  i shall be better than i am now i hope lovell answered but i shall never be the man i was i have seengod grant that i may some day forget what i have seen no wonder that my nerves have gone i saw a russian correspondent a strong brutallooking man go off into hysterics i saw another run amuck through the camp shooting right and left and finally blow his own brains out many a night i sobbed myself to sleep the men who live through tragedies aynesworth age fast i expect that i shall find wingrave changed  i would give a good deal aynesworth declared to have known him when you did  lovell nodded  you should be able to judge of the past he said by the present four years ofintimate companionship with any man should be enough  perhaps aynesworth declared and yet i can assure you that i know no more of wingrave today than when i was first attracted to him by your story and became his secretary it is a humiliating confession but it is the truth  that is why you remain with him lovell remarked  i suppose so i have often meant to leave but somehow when the time comes i stay on his life seems to be made up of brutalities small and large he ruins a man with as little compunction as one could fancy him in his younger days pulling the legs from a fly i have never seen him do a kindly action and yet all the time i find myself watching for it a situation arises and i say to myself now i am going to see something different i never do and yet i always expect it am i boring you lovell  not in the least go on anything concerning wingrave interests me  it is four years ago you know since i went to him my first glimpse of his character was the cold brutality with which he treated lady ruth when she went to see him then we went down to his country place in cornwall there was a small child there whose father had been the organist of the village and who had died penniless there was no one to look after her no one to save her from the charity schools and domestic service afterwards the church was on wingraves estate it should have been his duty to augment the ridiculous salary the dead man had received would you believe it wingrave refused to do a single thing for that child he went down there like a vandal to sell the heirlooms and pictures which had belonged to his family for generations he had no time he told me coldly for sentiment  it sounds brutal enough lovell admitted what became of the child  one of her fathers relations turned up after all and took care of her aynesworth said wingrave knew nothing about that though then on the voyage across the atlantic there was a silly pretty little woman on board who was piqued by wingraves indifference and tried to flirt with him in a few days she was his slave she was going home to her husband and you would have thought that any decent fellow would have told her that she was a little fool and let her go but not wingrave she was landing with him at new york but someone amongst the passengers who guessed what was up sent a marconigram to her husband and he met us at the landing stage  nothing came of that then  no but it wasnt wingraves fault then he began dealing with some shares in a minethe mine you know they were supposed to be worthless and one boy who was a little young to the game sold him too many wingrave was bleeding these brokers for hundreds of thousands of dollars and the boy came and asked to be let off by paying his whole fortune to escape being hammered wingrave refused i believe if the boy hadnt just been married hed have blown his brains out  lovell laughed  i dont envy you your job he remarked is there nothing to set down on the credit side of the ledger  not much aynesworth answered he is a fine sportsman and he saved my life in the rockies which makes me feel a bit uncomfortable sometimes he has a sense of justice for he heard of this mine from a man in prison and he has kept accounts showing the fellows share down to the last halfpenny but i have never yet known him to speak a kindly word or do a kindly deed he seems intent upon carrying out to the letter his own principlesto make as many people as possible suffer for his own broken life now he is back here a millionaire with immense power for good or for evil i am almost afraid of him i wouldnt be lady ruth or her husband for something  lovell smoked thoughtfully for a time  wingrave was always a little odd he remarked but i never thought that he was a bad chap  go and see him now aynesworth said tell me if you think he wears a mask or whether he is indeed what he seems  the hall porter entered the room and addressed aynesworth  gentleman called for you sir he announced  it is wingrave aynesworth declared come and speak to him  they descended the stairs together outside wingrave was leaning back in the corner of an electric brougham reading the paper aynesworth put his head in at the window  you remember lovell mr wingrave he said we were just talking when your message came up ive brought him down to shake hands with you  wingrave folded his paper down at the precise place where he had been reading and extended a very limp hand his manner betrayed not the slightest interest or pleasure  how are you lovell he asked some time since we met  a good many years lovell answered  finished your campaigning wingrave inquired knocked you about a bit havent they  they very nearly finished me lovell admitted i shall pick up all right over here though  there was a moments silence lovells thoughts had flashed backwards through the years back to the time when he had sat within a few feet of this man in the crowded court of justice and listened through the painful stillness of that heavy atmosphere charged with tragedy to the slow unfolding of the drama of his life there had been passion enough then in his voice and blazing in his eyes emotion enough in his twitching features and restless gestures to speak of the fire below and now pale and cold the man who had gripped his fingers then and held on to them like a vise seemed to find nothing except a slight boredom in this unexpected meeting  i shall see you again i hope wingrave remarked at last by the bye if we do meet i should be glad if you would forget our past acquaintance sir wingrave seton does not exist any longer i prefer to be known only as mr wingrave from america  lovell nodded  as you wish of course he answered i do not think he added that you need fear recognition i myself should have passed you in the street  wingrave leaned back in the carriage  aynesworth he said if you are ready will you get in and tell the man to drive to cadogan square good night mr lovell  lovell reentered the club with a queer little smile at his lips the brougham glided up into the strand and turned westwards  we are going straight to the barringtons aynesworth asked  yes wingrave answered while i think of it aynesworth i wish you to remember this both lady ruth and her husband seem to think it part of the game to try and make a cats paw of you i am not suggesting that they are likely to succeed but i do think it possible that one of them may ask you questions concerning certain investments in which i am interested i rely upon you to give them no information  i know very little about your investmentsoutside the mine aynesworth answered they couldnt very well approach a more ignorant person are you going to help barrington to make a fortune  wingrave turned his head there was a slight contraction of the forehead an ominous glitter in his steel grey eyes  i think he said you know that i am not likely to do that  the two men did not meet again till late in the evening lady ruths rooms were crowded for it was the beginning of the political season and her parties were always popular nevertheless she found time to beckon wingrave to her before they had been in the room many minutes  i want to talk to you she said a little abruptly you might have come this afternoon as you promised  lady ruth was a wonderful woman a wellknown statesman had just asked a friend her age  i dont know was the answer but whatever it is she doesnt look it  tonight she was almost girlish her complexion was delicate and perfectly natural the graceful lines of her figure suggested more the immaturity of youth than any undue slimness she wore a wonderful collar of pearls around her long shapely neck but very little other jewelry the touch of her fingers upon wingraves coat sleeve was a carefully calculated thing if he had thought of it he could have felt the slight appealing pressure with which she led him towards one of the smaller rooms  there are two chairs there she said come and sit down i have something to say to you     the shadow of a fear  for several minutes lady ruth said nothing she was leaning back in the farthest corner of her chair her head resting slightly upon her fingers her eyes studying with a curious intentness the outline of wingraves pale hard face he himself either unconscious of or indifferent to her close scrutiny had simply the air of a man possessed of an inexhaustible fund of patience  wingrave she said quietly i think that the time has gone by when i was afraid of you  he turned slightly towards her but he did not speak  i am possessed she continued at present of a more womanly sentiment i am curious  ah he murmured you were always a little inclined that way  i am curious about you she continued you are comparatively speaking young welllooking enough and strong your hand is firmly planted upon the lever which moves the world what are you going to do  that he said depends upon many things  you may be ambitious she remarked if so you conceal it admirably you may be devoting your powers to the consummation of vengeance against those who have treated you ill there are no signs of that either at present  we have excellent authority he remarked for the statement that a considerable amount of satisfaction is derivable from the exercise of that sentiment  perhaps she answered but the pursuit of vengeance for wrongs of the past is the task of a fool now you are not a fool you carry your life locked up within you as a strong man should but there are always some who may look in through the windows i should like to be one  an empty cupboard he declared a cupboard swept bare by time and necessity  she shook her head  your life she said is molded towards a purpose what is it  i must ask myself the question he declared before i can tell you the answer  no she said the necessity does not exist your reckless pursuit of wealth your return here the use you are making of my husband and me are all means towards some end why not tell me  your imagination he declared is running away with you  are you our enemy she asked is this seeming friendship of yours a cloak to hide some scheme of yours to make us suffer or she drew a little closer to him and her eyes drooped  or what he repeated  is there a little left she whispered of the old folly  why not he answered quietly i was very much in love with you  it is dead she murmured i believe that you hate me now  her voice was almost a caress she was leaning a little towards him her eyes were seeking to draw his  hate you how impossible he said calmly you are still a beautiful woman you know ruth  he turned and studied her critically lady ruth raised her eyes once but dropped them at once she felt herself growing paler a spasm of the old fear was upon her  yes he continued age has not touched you you can still pour if you will the magic drug into the wine of fools by the bye i must not be selfish arent you rather neglecting your guests  never mind my guests she answered i have been wanting to talk to you alone for days why have you done this why are you here what is it that you are seeking for in life  a little amusement only he declared i cannot find it except amongst my own kind  you have not the appearance of a pleasure seeker she answered  mine is a passive search he said i have some years to liveand of solitude well i have tasted at once the joys and the depths  you are not in love with me any longer are you she asked  i am not bold enough to deny it he answered but do not be afraid that i shall embarrass you with a declaration to tell you the truth i have not much feeling left of any sort  you mean to keep your own counsel then she asked  it is so little to keep he murmured and i have parted with so much  she measured the emotion of his tone the curious yet perfectly natural indifference of his manner and she shivered a little always she feared what she could not understand  i had hoped she said sadly that we might at least have been friends  he shook his head  i have no fancy he declared for the cemeteries of affection you must remember that i am beginning life anew i do not know myself yet or you let us drift into the knowledge of one another and perhaps  well perhaps  there may be no question of friendship  lady ruth went back to her guests and with the effortless ease of long training she became once more the gracious and tactful hostess but in her heart the fear had grown a little stronger and a specter walked by her side once during the evening her husband looked at her questioningly and she breathed a few words to him he laughed reassuringly  oh wingraves all right i believe he said its only his manner that puts you off a bit hes just the same with everyone i dont think he means anything by it  lady ruth shivered but she said nothing just then aynesworth came up and with a motion of her fan she called him to her  please take me into the other room she said i want a glass of champagne and on the way you can tell me all about america  one is always making epigrams about america he protested smiling wont you spare me  tell me then how you progress with your great character study  ah he remarked quietly you come now to a more interesting subject  yes  frankly i do not progress at all  so far as you have gone  if he said i were to take pen and paper and write down at this moment my conclusions so far as i have been able to form any i fancy that they would make evil reading permit me  they stood for a few minutes before the long sideboard a footman had poured champagne into their glasses and lady ruth talked easily enough the jargon of the moment but when they turned away she moved slowly and her voice was almost a whisper  tell me this she said is he really as hard and cold as he seems you have lived with him now for four years you should know that at least  i believe that he is aynesworth answered i can tell you that much at least without breach of faith so far as one who watches him can tell he lives for his own gratificationand his indulgence in it does not as a rule make for the happiness of other people  then what does he want with us she asked almost sharply i ask myself that question untili am terrified  aynesworth hesitated  it is very possible he said that he is simply making use of you to reenter the world curiously enough he has never seemed to care for solitude he makes numberless acquaintances what pleasure he finds in it i do not know but he seldom avoids people he may be simply making use of you  what do you think yourself  i cannot tell aynesworth answered indeed i cannot tell  she left him a little impatiently and aynesworth joined the outside of the circle of men who had gathered round wingrave he was answering their questions readily enough if a little laconically he was quite aware that he occupied in society the one unique place to which princes might not even aspirethere was something of divinity about his millions something of awe in the tone of the men with whom he talked women pretended to be interested in him because of the romance of his suddenly acquired wealththe men did not trouble to deceive themselves or anyone else a break up of the group came when a certain great and muchtalkedabout lady sent across an imperative message by her cavalier for the moment she desired that mr wingrave should be presented to her  they passed down the room together a few moments later the marchioness wonderfully dressed in a gown of strange turquoise blue looking up at her companion and talking with somewhat unusual animation everyone made remarks of courseexchanged significant glances and unlovely smiles it was so like the marchioness to claim as a matter of course the best of everything that was going lady ruth watched them with a curious sense of irritation for which she could not altogether account it was impossible that she should be jealous and yet it was equally certain that she was annoyed if wingrave resisted his present fair captor he would enjoy a notability equal to that which his wealth already conferred upon him no man as yet had done it was it likely that wingrave would wear two crowns lady ruth beckoned aynesworth to her  tell me she said what is mr wingraves general attitude towards my sex  absolute indifference he declared promptly unless  he stopped short  you must go on she told him  unless he is possessed of the ability to make them suffer he answered after a moments hesitation  then emily will never attract him she declared almost triumphantly for she has no more heart that he has  he has yet to discover it aynesworth remarked when he does i think you will find that he will shrug his shouldersand say farewell  all the same lady ruth murmured to herself emily is a cat  lady ruth spoke to one more man that night of wingraveand that man was her husband their guests had departed and lady ruth in a marvelous white dressing gown was lying upon the sofa in her room  how do you get on with wingrave she asked what do you think of him  barrington shrugged his shoulders  what can one think of a man he answered who goes about like an animated mummy i have done my best i talked to him for nearly half an hour at a stretch today when i took him to the club for lunch he is the incarnation of indifference he wont listen to politics women or tales about them at any rate seem to bore him to extinction he drinks only as a matter of form and he wont talk finance by the bye ruth i wish you could get him to give you a tip i scarcely see how we are going to get through the season unless something turns up  is it as bad as that she asked  worse her husband answered gloomily weve been living on our capital for years every acre of queens norton is mortgaged and im shot if i can see how were going to pay the interest  she sighed a little wearily  do you think that it would be wise she asked let me tell you something lumley i have only known what fear was once in my life i am afraid now i am afraid of wingrave i have a fancy that he does not mean any good to us  barrington frowned and threw his cigarette into the fire with a little jerk  nonsense he exclaimed the mans not quite so bad as that weve been useful to him weve done exactly what he asked the other matters dead and buried we dont want his money but it is perfectly easy for him to help us make a little  she looked up at him quietly  i think lumley that it is dangerous she said  then youre not the clever woman i take you for he answered turning to leave the room just as you please only it will be that or the bankruptcy court before long  lady ruth lay quite still looking into the fire when her maid came she moved on tiptoe for it seemed to her that her mistress slept but lady ruth was wide awake though the thoughts which were flitting through her brain had perhaps some kinship to the land of dreams     juliet asks questions  any place the girl exclaimed as she entered more unlike a solicitors office i never saw flowers outside and flowers on your desk mr pengarth dont you have to apologize to your clients for your surroundings theres absolutely nothing except the brass plate outside to show that this isnt an oldfashioned farmhouse stuck down in the middle of a village fuchsias in the window sill too  he placed a chair for her and laid down the deed which he had been examining with a little sigh of relief it really was very hard work pretending to be busy  you see miss juliet he explained with twinkling eyes my clients are all country folk and it makes them feel more at home to find a lawyers office not very different from their own parlor  she nodded  what would the great man say she inquired pointing to the rows of black tin boxes which lined the walls  sir wingrave seton is never likely to come here again i am afraid he answered if he did i dont think hed mind to tell you the truth im rather proud of my office young lady  she looked around  they are nice she said decidedly but unbusinesslike  youre going to put up the pony and stay to lunch of course he said ill ring for the boy  she stopped him  please dont she exclaimed i have come to see youon business  mr pengarth after his first gasp of astonishment was a different man he fumbled about on the desk and produced a pair of gold spectacles which he adjusted with great nicety on the edge of his very short nose  on business my dear he repeated well well to be sure is it miss harrison who has sent you  mr pengarths visitor looked positively annoyed she leaned across the table towards him so that the roses in her large hat almost brushed his forehead her wonderful brown eyes were filled with reproach  mr pengarth she said do you know how old i am  how old my dear why let me see he exclaimed fourteen andwhy god bless my soul you must be eighteen  i am nineteen years old mr pengarth the young lady announced with dignity perhaps you will be kind enough to treat me nowerwith a little more respect  nineteen he repeated vaguely god bless mynineteen years old  i consider myself she repeated of age i have come to see you about my affairs  yes yes he said quite natural  for four years she continued i seem to have been supported by some relative of my father who has never vouchsafed to send me a single line or message except through you i have written letters which i have given to you to forward there has been no reply have you sent on those letters mr pengarth  why certainly my dear certainly  can you tell me how it is that i have had no answer  mr pengarth coughed he was not at all comfortable  your guardian miss juliet is somewhat eccentric he answered and he is a very busy man  can you tell me mr pengarth exactly what relation he is to me  there was a dead silence mr pengarth found the room suddenly warm and mopped his forehead with a large silk handkerchief  i have no authority he declared to answer any questions  then can you tell me of your own accord she said why there is all this mystery why may i not know who he is why may i not write to him am i anything to be ashamed of that he will not trust me even with his name i am tired of accepting so much and not being able to offer even my thanks in return it is too much like charity i have made up my mind that if this is to go on i will go away and earn my own living there mr pengarth  rubbish he exclaimed briskly what at  painting she declared triumphantly i have had this in my mind for some time and i have been trying to see what i can do best i have quite decided now to be an artist  pictures he declared sententiously dont sell  mine do she answered smiling i have had a check for three guineas from a shop in london for a little sea piece i did in two afternoons  he regarded her admiringly  you are a wonderful child he exclaimed  i am not a child at all she interrupted warmly and you can just sit down and write to your silly client and tell him so  i will certainly write to him he affirmed i will do so today you will not do anything rash until i have had time to get a reply  no she answered graciously i will wait for a week after thatwell i might do anything  you wouldnt leave tredowen miss juliet he protested  it would break my heart of course she declared but i would do it and trust to time to heal it up again tredowen seems like home to me but it isnt really you know some day sir wingrave seton may want to come back and live there himself are you quite certain mr pengarth that he wont be angry to hear that we have been living at the house all this time  certain mr pengarth declared firmly he left everything entirely in my hands he did not wish me to let it but he did not care about its being altogether uninhabited the arrangement i was able to make with your guardian was a most satisfactory one  but surely he will come back himself some time she asked  the lawyer shook his head sorrowfully  i am afraid he said that sir wingrave has no affection for the place whatever  no affection for tredowen she repeated wonderingly do you know what i think mr pengarth i think that it is the most beautiful house in the world  and yet you talk of leaving it  i dont want to go she answered but i dont want to be accepting things all my life from someone whose name even i do not know  well well he said you must wait until i have written my letter time enough to talk about that later on now if you wont stay to lunch you must come and see rachael and have some cake and a glass of wine  how sweet of you she exclaimed im frightfully hungry can i do anything to stop growing mr pengarth im getting taller and taller  she stood up she was head and shoulders taller than the little lawyer slim as a lath and yet wonderfully graceful she laughed down at him and made a little grimace  im a giraffe am i not she declared and im still growing do show me your garden mr pengarth i want to see your hollyhocks everyone is talking about them  they were joined in a few minutes by a prim dignified little lady ridiculously like mr pengarth whom he called sister and she miss rachael juliet walked down the garden between them  sister mr pengarth said juliet has come today to see me on business in effect she has come to remind me that she is grown up  grown up miss rachael protested vigorously rubbish  i am nineteen years old juliet declared  and what if you are miss rachael replied briskly in my young days we were in the nursery at nineteen  quite so mr pengarth assented with relief you took me by storm just now miss juliet after all you are only a child  i am old enough to feel and to mean all that i said to you mr pengarth she answered gravely and that reminds me toothere was something else i meant to ask you  sister mr pengarth said have you ordered the wine and the cake  bless me no miss rachael declared it shall be ready in five minutes  she entered the house mr pengarth stooped to pick some lavender  the only time i ever saw sir wingrave seton she said was on the day before i was told that a relation of my father had been found who was willing to take charge of me there was a younger man with him someone very very different from sir wingrave do you know who he was  a sort of secretary of sir wingrave i believe dear i never met him i was unfortunately away at the time they came  he was very nice and kind to me the girl continued just as nice as sir wingrave was horrid i suppose it was because they came on that day but i have always connected him somehow with this mysterious relation of mine mr aynesworth didnt help to find him did he  certainly not the lawyer answered the instructions i had came first from mr saunders the vicar of the parish it was he who appeared to have made the necessary inquiries  horrid old man she declared he used to make me feel that i wanted to cry every time that i saw him  miss rachael is calling us the lawyer declared with obvious relief  new cake juliet declared i can smell it delicious     lady ruths last card  there are two letters aynesworth announced which i have not opened one i think is from the marchioness of westhampton the other from some solicitors at truro they were both marked private  wingrave was at breakfast in his flat aynesworth had been in an adjoining room sorting his correspondence he accepted the two letters and glanced them through without remark but whereas he bestowed scarcely a seconds consideration upon the broad sheet of white paper with the small coronet and the faint perfume of violets the second letter apparently caused him some annoyance he read it through for a second time with a slight frown upon his forehead  you must cancel my engagements for two days aynesworth he said i have to go out of town  aynesworth nodded  theres nothing very special on he remarked do you want me to go with you  it is not necessary wingrave answered i am going he added after a moments pause to cornwall  aynesworth was immediately silent the one time when wingrave had spoken to him as an employer was in answer to some question of his as to what had eventually become of the treasures of tredowen he had always since scrupulously avoided the subject  be so good as to look out the trains for me wingrave continued i cannot go until the afternoon he added after a momentary pause i have an engagement for luncheon perhaps if you are not too busy you will see that morrison packs some things for me  he moved to the writing table and wrote a few lines to the marchioness regretting that his absence from town would prevent his dining with her on the following day then he studied the money column in several newspapers for half an hour and telephoned to his broker at eleven oclock he rode for an hour in the quietest part of the park avoiding so far as possible anyone he knew and galloping whenever he could it was the only form of exercise in which he was known to indulge although the knowledge of english games which he sometimes displayed was a little puzzling to some of his acquaintances on his return he made a simple but correct toilet and at halfpast one he met lady ruth at princes restaurant  lady ruths gown of dove color with faint touches of blue was effective and she knew it nevertheless she was a little pale and her manner lacked that note of quiet languor which generally characterized it she talked rather more than usual chattering idly about the acquaintances to whom she was continually nodding and bowing her face hardened a little as the marchioness on her way through the room with a party of friends stopped at their table  the two women exchanged the necessary number of inanities then the marchioness turned to wingrave  you wont forget that you are dining with me tomorrow  wingrave shook his head regretfully  i am sorry he said but i have to go out of town i have just written you  what a bore she remarked business of course  she nodded and passed on her farewell to lady ruth was distinctly curt wingrave resumed his seat and his luncheon without remark  hateful woman lady ruth murmured  i thought you were friends wingrave remarked  yes we are lady ruth assented the sort of friendship you men dont know much about you see a good deal of her dont you  wingrave raised his head and looked at lady ruth contemplatively  why do you ask me that he asked  curiosity  i do he remarked you should be grateful to her  why  it may save you a similar infliction  lady ruth was silent for several moments  perhaps she said at last i do not choose to be relieved  wingrave bowed his glass in his hand his lips were curled into the semblance of a smile but he did not say a word lady ruth leaned a little across the table so that the feathers of her hat nearly brushed his forehead  wingrave she asked do you know what fear is perhaps not you are a man you see no one has ever called me a coward you wouldnt would you  no he said deliberately you are not a coward  there is only one sort of fear which i know she continued and that is the fear of what i do not understand and that is why wingrave i am afraid of you  he set down his glass and his fingers trifled for a moment with its stem his expression was inscrutable  surely he said you are not serious  i am serious she declared and you know that i am  you are afraid of me he repeated softly i wonder why  she looked him straight in the eyes  because she said i did you once a very grievous wrong because i know that you have not forgiven me because i am very sure that all the good that was in you lies slain  by whose hand he asked quietly no you need not answer you know so do i yes i can understand your fear but i do not understand why you confess it to me  nor i she answered nor do i understand why i am hereat your bidding nor why i keep you always by my side whenever you choose to take your place there are you a vain man wingrave do you wish to pose as the friend of a woman whom the world has thought too ambitious to waste time upon such follies there is the marchioness she would do you more credit still  thank you he answered i like to choose the path myself when i pass into the maze of follies  you have not yet explained yourself she reminded him of all people in world you have chosen us for your presumptive friends why you hate us both you know that you do is it part of a scheme lumley is investing money on your advice i am allowing myself to be seen about with you more than is prudentconsidering all things do you want to rake out the ashes of our domestic hearthto play the part ofmelodramatic villain you are ingenious enough and powerful enough  you put strange ideas into my head he told her lightly why should i not play the part that you suggest it might be amusing and you certainly deserve all the evil which i could bring upon you  she leaned a little across the table towards him her eyes were soft and bright and they looked full into his the color in her cheeks was natural the air around him was faintly fragrant with the perfume of her clothes and hair  we couldnt leave off playing at the gameand act it could we she murmured we couldnt reallybe friends  lady ruth had played her trump card she had touched his fingers with hers her eyes shone with the promise of unutterable things but if wingrave was moved he did not show it  i wish he said that i could accept your offer in the spirit with which you tender it unfortunately i am a maimed person my sensibilities have gone friendship in the more intimate sense of the word i may never hope to feel again enmitywell that is more comprehensible even enmity he continued slowly which might prompt a woman to disguise herself as her own ladys maid to seek out a tool to get rid of the man she feared pardon me lady ruth you are eating nothing  she pulled down her veil  thank you i have finished she said in a low tone  he called for the bill  pray dont let my little remark distress you he said i had almost forgotten the circumstance until something you said brought it into my mind it is you yourself you must remember who set the example of candor  i deserve everything you can say she murmured everything you can do there is nothing left i suppose but suffering will you take me out to my carriage you can come back and have your coffee with the marchioness she keeps looking across at you and it will please her to think that you got rid of me  he glanced at his watch  i am afraid he said rising that i must deny myself the pleasure of seeking the marchioness again today i have a train to catch in half an hour you are ready  quite  they made their way through the maze of tables towards the door lady ruth exchanging greetings right and left with her friends although the tall gravelooking man who followed her was by far the greater object of interest  just like ruth to keep him in her pocket remarked her dearest friend looking after them they say that he has millions  she sighed a little enviously  the barrington menage needs a little backing up her companion remarked i should say that he had come just in time the marchioness has her eye upon him too there may be some fun presently  lady ruths dearest friend smiled  i will back ruth she said drily emily is beautiful but she is too obvious and too eager ruths little ways are more subtle besides look at the start she has she isnt the sort of woman men tire of  lady ruth held out her hand through the window of her electric coupe  thank you for my luncheon she said when shall we see you again  in a few days he answered standing bareheaded upon the pavement i shall call directly i return  lady ruth nodded and leaned back wingrave smiled faintly as he turned away he had seen the little shudder which she had done her best to hide  lady ruth found her husband at home writing letters in his study she sank wearily into a chair by his side  been lunching out he inquired  she nodded  at princes with wingrave  he made no remark but he seemed far from displeased  if id only had the pluck he remarked a little disconsolately i might have made thousands by following his advice this week it was you who put me off too  it turned out all right she asked  exactly as he said i made five hundred i might just as well have made five thousand  can you let me have a couple of hundred she asked the people are all bothering so  you know that i cant he answered irritably i had to send the lot to lewis and then it wasnt a quarter of what he is pressing for we shall never get through the season ruth unless  she raised her eyes  unless what  unless something turns up  there was a short uncomfortable silence lady ruth rose to her feet and stood facing the fireplace with her back to him  lumley she said lets face it  he gave a little start  face what he inquired  ruin the bankruptcy court and all the rest of it she declared a note of defiance creeping into her tone  her husbands face was white with astonishment he stared across at her blankly  are you mad ruth he exclaimed do you know what you are saying  quite well she answered im a little sick of the whole show the tradespeople are getting impertinent i dont even know where to get flowers for dinner tonight or where to go for my ascot gowns it must come sooner or later  youre talking like a fool he declared harshly do you know that i should have to give up my seat and my clubs  we could live quietly in the country  country behanged he exclaimed savagely what use is the country to you and me id sooner put a bullet through my brain ruth old lady he added more gently whats gone wrong youre generally such a well pluckedun have youhad a row with wingrave he asked looking at her anxiously  no  then what is it  nothing ive lost my nerve i suppose  you want a change it isnt so very long to cowes now and thank heavens thatll cost us nothing were going on wingraves yacht arent we  yes we did accept  barrington fidgeted for a moment with a paper knife  ruth he asked whats wrong between you and wingrave  nothing she answered im afraid of him thats all  afraid of him afraid of wingrave he repeated  yes i do not think that he has forgotten i think that he means to make us suffer  barrington was almost dignified  i never heard such nonsense in my life ruth he exclaimed i have watched wingrave closely and i have seen no trace of anything of the sort nonsense it is worse than nonsense you must be getting hysterical you must get all this rubbish out of your head to tell you the truth  well  i was thinking that you might ask wingrave to help us a bit i dont believe hed hesitate for a moment  ruth looked her husband in the face there was a curious expression in her eyes  do you think that it would be wise of me to ask him she demanded  why not he answered you can take care of yourself i can trust you  i told you that i was afraid of wingrave she reminded him i can take care of myself as a ruleand i doas you know i have elected to be one of the unfashionables in that respect but to ask wingrave for money is more than i dare do  then i shall ask him myself barrington declared  she picked up her gloves and turned to leave the room  i should prefer even that she said     guardian and ward  up to the present then wingrave remarked the child has no idea as to who has been responsible for the charge of her  no idea at all sir wingrave the lawyer declared your wishes have been strictly carried out most strictly she imagines that it is some unknown connection of her father but as i explained to you in my letter she has recently exhibited a good deal of curiosity in the matter she isera young lady of considerable force of character for her years and her present attitudeas i explained in my letteris a trifle difficult  wingrave was sitting in the lawyers own chair mr pengarth who was a trifle nervous preferred to stand  she shows i think a certain amount of ingratitude in forcing this journey and explanation upon me wingrave declared coldly it should have been sufficient for her that her benefactor preferred to remain anonymous  i regret sir wingrave that i must disagree with you mr pengarth answered boldly miss juliet miss lundy i should say is a young lady of characterandersome originality of disposition she is a great favorite with everyone around here  wingrave remained silent he had the air of one not troubling to reply to what he considered folly through the wide open window floated in the various sounds of the little country town the rumbling of heavy carts passing along the cobbled streets the shrill greetings of neighbors and acquaintances meeting upon the sidewalk and then the tinkling bell of a rubbertired cart pulling up outside and a clear girlish voice speaking to some one of the passersby  wingrave betrayed as much surprise as it was possible for him to show when at last she stood with outstretched hand before him he had only an imperfect recollection of an illclad untidylooking child with pale tearstained cheeks and dark unhappy eyes the march of the years had been a thing whose effects he had altogether underestimated the girl who stood now facing him was slight and there was something of the child left in her bright eager face but she carried herself with all the graceful assurance of an older woman her soft dark eyes were lit with pleasure and excitement her delicately traced eyebrows and delightful smile were somehow suggestive of her foreign descent her clothes were countrymade but perfect as regarded fit and trimness her beflowered hat was worn with a touch of coquettish grace a trifle unenglish but very delightful she had not an atom of shyness or embarrassment only there was a great surprise in her face as she held out her hands to wingrave  i know who you are she exclaimed you are sir wingrave seton to think that i never guessed  you remember seeing me then he remarked and his tone sounded all the colder after the full richness of her young voice  i just remember itonly just she answered you see you did not take much notice of me that time did you but i have lived amongst your ancestors too long to make any mistake why have you stayed away from tredowen so long  i have been abroad wingrave answered i am not fond of england  you had trouble here i know she said frankly but that is all past and over i think that you must forget how beautiful your home is or you would never bear to live away from it now please may i ask you a question  any that you think necessary wingrave answered spare me as much as possible i am not fond of them  shall i leave you two together for a little time mr pengarth suggested gathering up some papers  certainly not wingrave said shortly there is not the slightest necessity for it  mr pengarth resumed his seat  just as you please he answered but you must sit down juliet there you shall have my clients chair  the girl accepted it with a little laugh there was no shadow of embarrassment about her manner notwithstanding the cold stiffness of wingraves deportment he sat where the sunlight fell across his chair and the lines in his pale face seemed deeper than usual the grey hairs more plentiful the weariness in his eyes more apparent yet she was not in the least afraid of him  first of all then sir wingrave may i ask you why you have been so extraordinarily kind to me  there is nothing extraordinary about it at all he answered your father died and left you friendless in a parish of which i am lord of the manor he received a starvation pittance for his labors which it was my duty to augment a duty which with many others i neglected i simply gave orders that you should be looked after  she laughed softly  looked after why i have lived at tredowen i have had a governess a pony to drive heaven knows how many luxuries  that he interrupted hastily is nothing the house is better occupied what i have done for you is less in proportion than the sixpence you may sometimes have given to a beggar for i am a rich a ridiculously rich man with no possible chance of spending onequarter of my income you had a distinct and obvious claim upon me and at no cost or inconvenience to myself i have endeavored through others to recognize it  i will accept your view of the situation the girl said still smiling but with a faint note of disappointment in her tone i do not wish to force upon you expressions of gratitude which you would only find wearisome but i must thank you it is in my heart and i must speak of it there it is over you see i shall say no more  you are a sensible young lady wingrave said making a motion as though to rise i have only one request to make to you and that is that you keep to yourself the knowledge which mr pengarth informs me that you insisted upon acquiring you are nearly enough of age now and i will make you your own mistress that is all i think  the smile died away from her lips her tone became very earnest  sir wingrave she said for all that you have done for me i am as you know grateful i would try to tell you how grateful only i know that it would weary you so we will speak only of the future i cannot continue to accepteven such magnificent alms as yours  what do you mean child he asked frowning across at her  i mean she said that now i am old enough to work i cannot accept everything from one upon whom i have no claim if you will help me a little still i shall be more than grateful but it must be in my own way  you talk about work he said what can you do  i can paint she answered fairly well i should like to go to london and have a few lessons if i cannot make a living at that i shall try something else  you disappoint me wingrave said there is no place for you in london there are thousands starving there already because they can paint a little or sing a little or fancy they can do you find it dull down here  dull she exclaimed wonderingly i think that there can be no place on earth so beautiful as tredowen  you are happy here  perfectly  then for heavens sake forget all this folly wingrave said hardly london is no place for children miss harrison can take you up for a month when you choose you can go abroad if you want to but for the rest  she rose suddenly and sweeping across the office with one graceful movement she leaned over wingraves chair her hands rested upon his shoulders her eyes soft with gathering tears pleaded with his wingrave sat with all the outward immobility of a sphinx  dear sir wingrave she said you have been so generous so kind and i may not even speak of my gratitude dont please think me unreasonable or ungracious i cant tell you how i feel but i must i must i must go away i could not live here any longer now that i know fancy for a moment that i am your sister or your daughter dont you believe really that she would feel the same and i think you would wish her to dont be angry with me please  wingraves face never changed but his fingers gripped the arms of his chair so that a signet ring he wore cut deep into his flesh when he spoke his tone sounded almost harsh the girl turned away to dash the tears from her eyes  what do you think of thisfolly pengarth  the lawyer looked his best client squarely in the face i do not call it folly sir wingrave i think that miss lundy is right  there was a pause her eyes were still pleading with him  against the two of you wingrave remarked i am of course powerless after all it is no concern of mine i shall leave you pengarth to make such arrangements as miss lundy desires  he rose to his feet juliet now was pale she dashed the tears from her eyes and looked at him in amazement mingled with something which was almost like despair  you dont mean she exclaimed you are going away without coming to tredowen  why not he asked i never had any intention of going there  you are very angry with me she cried in despair ii  her lip quivered wingrave interposed  i shall be happy to go and have a look at the place he said carelessly if you will drive me back i fancy i have almost forgotten what it is like  she looked at him as at one who had spoken irreverently her eyes were full of wonder  i think that you must have indeed forgotten she said how very beautiful it is it is your home too there is no one else she added softly who can live there amongst all those wonderful things and call it reallyhome  i am afraid he said you will find that i have outlived all sentiment but i will certainly come to tredowen with you     ghosts of dead things  it was here she said as they passed through the walled garden seawards that i saw you firstyou and the other gentleman who was so kind to me  wingrave nodded  i believe that i remember it he said you were a mournfullooking object in a very soiled pinafore and most untidy hair  i had been out on the cliffs she reminded him where i am taking you now if you are going to make unkind remarks about my hair i think that i had better fetch a hat  pray dont leave me he answered i should certainly lose my way your hair in those days was i fancy a little moreunkempt  she laughed  it used to be cut short she said hideous there isnt that glorious  she had opened the postern gate in the wall and through the narrow opening was framed a wonderful picture of the cornish sea rolling into the rockstudded bay its soft thunder was in their ears salt and fragrant the west wind swept into their faces she closed the gate behind her and stepped blithely forward  come she cried we will climb the cliffs where we left you alone once before  side by side they stood looking over the ocean her head was thrown back her lips a little parted he watched her curiously  you must have sea blood in your veins he remarked you listen as though you heard music all the time  and what about you she asked him smiling you are the grandson of admiral sir wingrave seton who commanded a frigate at trafalgar and an ancestor of yours fought in the armada  i am afraid he said quietly that there is a hiatus in my life somewhere there are no voices which call to me any more and my family records are so much dead parchment  trouble passed into her glowing face and clouded her eyes  ah she said i do not like to hear you talk so do you know that when you do you make me afraid that something i have always hoped for will never come to pass  what is it he asked  i have always hoped she said that some day you would come once more to tredowen i suppose i am rather a fanciful person this is a country of superstitions and fancies you know but sometimes when i have been alone in the picture gallery with all that long line of dark faces looking down upon me from the walls i have felt like an interloper always they seem to be waiting tonight after dinner i will take you there i will try and show you what i mean  he shook his head  i shall never come back he said and there are no more of my name  she hesitated when at last she spoke the color was coming and going in her cheeks  sir wingrave she said i am only an ignorant girl and i have no right to talk to you like this please be angry with me if you want to i deserve it i know all aboutthat ten years couldnt you forget it and come back none of the country people round here your own people believe anything evil about you you were struck and you struck back again a man would do that you could be as lonely as you liked here or you could have friends if you wished for them but this is the place where you ought to live you would be happier here i believe than in exile the love of it all would come back you would never be lonely it is the same sea which sang to you when you were a child and to your fathers before you it would bring you forgetfulness when you wanted it or  wingrave interrupted her his tone was cold but not unkind  my dear young lady he said it is very good of you to be so sympathetic but i am afraid i am not at all the sort of person you imagine me to be what i was before those ten yearswell i have forgotten what i am now i unfortunately know i am a soured malevolent being whose only pleasure lies in the dealing out to others some portion of the unhappiness which was dealt out to me  i do not believe it she declared briskly  he shrugged his shoulders  nevertheless it is true he declared coolly listen more or less you interest me i will tell you something which i have never yet told to a single human being i need not go into particulars you will probably believe a broad statement my ten years imprisonment was more or less an injustice  sir wingrave  he checked her there was not a tremor in his tone the gesture with which he had repelled her was stiff and emotionless  i went into prison one man i came out another while i live i shall never be able to think kindly again of a single one of my fellow creatures it was not my fault so far as our affections are concerned we are machines all of us well my mainspring has broken  i dont believe it she declared  it is nevertheless true he affirmed calmly i am living in exile because i have no friends because friends have become an impossibility to me i shall not tell you any more of my life because you are young and you would not believe me if i did some day he added grimly you will probably hear for yourself  i shall never believe anything she declared which i do not choose to believe i shall never believe for instance that you are quite what you think yourself  we will talk of other things he said five years ago you showed aynesworth where the seagulls built  and now i will show you she exclaimed if you are sure that your head is steady enough come along  it was after dinner that she took him into the picture gallery miss harrison very much disturbed by the presence of the master of tredowen and still more so by the hint which she had already received as to coming changes followed them at a little distance  i am so sorry juliet said that we have no cigars or cigarettes  i seldom smoke wingrave answered  if only we had had the slightest idea of your coming miss harrison said for the tenth time we would have made more adequate preparations the wine cellar at least could have been opened i allowed mr and mrs tresfarwin to go for their holiday only yesterday and the cellars of course are never touched  your claret was excellent wingrave assured her  i am quite sure miss harrison said that claret from the local grocer is not what you are accustomed to  my dear madam wingrave protested i seldom touch wine show me which picture it is juliet that youah  she had led him to the end of the gallery and stopped before what seemed to be a plain oak cupboard surrounded by a massive frame she looked at him half fearfully  you want to see that picture he asked  if i might  he drew a bunch of keys from his pocket and calmly selected one it was a little rusty but the cupboard turned at once on its hinges a womans face smiled down upon them dark and splendid from the glowing touch of a great painter juliet studied it eagerly and then stole a sidelong glance at the man by her side he was surveying it critically and without any apparent emotion  herkomers i think he remarked quite one of his best  it is your mother she whispered  he nodded  im not great at genealogy he said but i can go as far back as that she was by way of being a great lady the daughter of the duke of warminster  you were an only son she said softly she must have been very fond of you  customary thing i suppose he remarked lucky for her under the circumstances that she died young  he closed the oaken door in front of the picture and locked it  i should like to see the armory he said but i really forgetlet me see it is at the end of the long gallery isnt it  she led him there without a word she was getting a little afraid of him they inspected the library and wandered back into the picture gallery it was she now who was silent she had shown him all her favorite treasures without being able to evoke a single spark of enthusiasm  once she remarked we all had a terrible fright we were told that everything was going to be sold  he nodded  i did think of it he admitted but there seemed to be no hurry all these things are growing into money year by year some day i shall send everything to christies  she looked at him in horror  you cannotoh you cannot mean it she cried  why not they are no use to me  no use she faltered  not a bit i dont suppose i shall see them again for many years and the moneywell one can use that  but i thoughtthat you were rich she faltered  so i am he answered and yet i go on making more and more and i shall go on money is the whip with which its possessor can scourge humanity it is with money that i deal out myforgive me i forgot that i was talking aloud and to a child he wound up suddenly  she looked at him dryeyed but with a strained look of sorrow strangely altering her girlish face  you must be very unhappy she said  not at all he assured her i am one of those fortunate persons who have outlived happiness and unhappiness i have nothing to do but liveand pay off a few little debts  he rose directly afterwards and she walked with him out to the gardens whence a short cut led to the village  i have not tried again to make you change your mind he said as they stood for a moment on the terrace if my wishes have any weight with you i trust that you will do nothing without consulting mr pengarth  and you she faltered are younever in london shant i see you again any time  if you care to by all means he answered tell mr pengarth to let me have your address goodbye thank you for taking care of my treasures so well  she held his cold hand in hers and suddenly raised it to her lips then she turned away and hurried indoors  wingrave stood still for a moment and gazed at his hand through the darkness as though the ghosts of dead things had flitted out from the dark laurel shrubs then he laughed quietly to himself     spreading the nets  by the bye the marchioness asked him have you a christian name  sorry wingrave answered if i ever had ive forgotten it  then i must call you wingrave she remarked i hate calling anyone i know decently well mr anything  charmed wingrave answered it isnt a bad name  it isnt she admitted by the bye she continued looking at him critically you are rather a surprising person arent you  glad youve found it out wingrave answered i always thought so  one associates all sorts of terrible things with millionairesespecially african and american ones she remarked now you could pass anywhere for the ordinary sort of decent person  wingrave nodded  i was told the other day he remarked reflectively that if i would only cultivate two things i might almost pass as a member of the english aristocracy  what were they she asked rashly  ignorance and impertinence he answered  the marchioness was silent for a moment there was a little more color than usual in her beautiful cheeks and a dangerous glitter in her eyes  you can go home mr wingrave she said  he rose to his feet imperturbably the marchioness stretched out a long white hand and gently forced him back again  you mustnt talk like that to me she said quietly i am sensitive  he bowed  a privilege i believe of your order he remarked  of course if you want to quarrel she began  i dont he assured her  then be sensible i want to talk to you  sensible alone with you he murmured i should establish a new record  you certainly arent in the least like a millionaire she declared smiling at him you are more like a  please go on he begged  i darent she answered shaking her head  then you arent in the least like a marchioness he declared at least not like our american ideas of one  she laughed outright  bring your chair quite close to mine she ordered i really want to talk to you  he obeyed and affected to be absorbed in the contemplation of the rings on the hand which a great artist had called the most beautiful in england she withdrew it a little peevishly after a moments pause  i want to talk about the barringtons she said do you know that they are practically ruined  i heard that barrington had been gambling on the stock exchange the last few days he answered  he has lost a great deal of money she answered and they were almost on their last legs before are you going to set them straight again  no idea he answered i havent been asked for one thing  ruth will ask you of course the marchioness said impatiently i expect that she is waiting at your flat by now i want to know whether you are going to do it  the hand was again very close to his again wingrave contemplated the rings  i forgot that you were her friend and are naturally anxious he remarked  i am not her friend the marchioness answered andi do not wish you to help them  wingrave was silent the hand was insistent and he held it for a moment lightly and then let it go  well i dont know he said doubtfully the barringtons have been very hospitable to me  rubbish the marchioness answered you have done quite enough for them already of course you are a manand you must choose i am sure that you understand me  he rose to his feet  i must think this out he said the barringtons have a sort of claim on me i will let you know which way i decide  she stood close to him and her hand fell upon his shoulder  you are not going she exclaimed i have told them that i am at home to no one and i thought that you would stay and entertain me sit down again wingrave  sorry he answered i have a lot to do this afternoon i came directly i had your note but i have had to keep some other people waiting  you are going to see lady ruth  not that i know of he declared i have heard nothing from her by the bye i lost some money to you at bridge the other evening how much was it do you remember  she looked at him for a second and turned away  do you really want to know she asked  if you please put the amount down on a piece of paper and then i shant forget it  she crossed the room to her desk and returned with a folded envelope he stuffed it into his waistcoat pocket  i shall be at the opera tonight she said will you come there and tell me whatwhich you decide  with pleasure he answered if i can get away from a stupid dinner in time  she let him go reluctantly afterwards she passed into her own room and stood looking at herself in the pier glass artists and the society papers called her the most beautiful woman in england fashion had placed her upon such a pinnacle that men counted it a distinction to be seen speaking to her she dealt out her smiles and favors like royalty itself she had never once known a rebuff this afternoon she felt that she had received one had she been too cold or too forward perhaps she had underestimated the man himself she rang for her maid  celeste she said i shall wear my new paquin gown tonight at the opera and my pearls  very good your ladyship  and i am going to lie down for an hour or two now dont let me be disturbed i want to look my best tonight you understand  perfectly your ladyship  the marchioness rested but she did not sleep she was thinking of wingrave  it was not lady ruth but her husband who was waiting to see wingrave on his return aynesworth was talking to him but at once withdrew wingrave nodded with slightly upraised eyebrows he never shook hands with barrington  you wanted to see me he inquired carelessly turning over a little pile of letters  barrington was ill at ease he hated himself and he hated his errand  yes for a moment or twoif youre not busy he said may i smoke im nervous this morning  help yourself wingrave said shortly cigarettes and cigars on the sideboard touch the bell if youll take anything to drink  thanksaynesworth gave me a brandy and soda capital fellow aynesworth  have another wingrave said shortly  he crossed the room to the sideboard wingrave glanced up from his letters and smiled coldly as he saw the shaking fingers  i dont often indulge like this barrington said turning away from the sideboard with a tumbler already empty in his hands the fact is ive had rather a rude knock and ruth thought id better come and see you  wingrave remained a study of impassivity his guests whole demeanor his uneasy words and nervous glances were an unspoken appeal to be helped out in what he had come to say and wingrave knew very well what it was nevertheless he remained silentpolitely questioning barrington sat down a little heavily he was not so carefully dressed as usual he looked older his appearance lacked altogether that air of buoyant prosperity which was wont to inspire his friends and creditors with confidence  ive been a fool wingrave he said you showed me how to make a little money a few weeks ago and it seemed so easy that i couldnt resist having a try by myself only on rather a larger scale i lost then i went in again to pull myself round and i lost again i lostmore than i can easily raise before settlement  i am sorry wingrave said politely it is very unwise to meddle in things you know so little about  for a moment the worm turned barrington rose to his feet and with a deep flush upon his cheeks moved towards the door but his spark of genuine feeling died out almost as soon as it had been kindled outside that door was ruin within as he very well knew lay his only chance of salvation he set down his hat and turned round  wingrave he said will you lend me some money  wingrave looked at him with upraised eyebrows  i he remarked lend you money why should i  heaven knows barrington answered it is you who have chosen to seek us out you have forced upon us something which has at least the semblance of friendship there is no one else whom i could ask it isnt only this damned stock exchange transaction everything has gone wrong with me for years if i could have kept going till next july i should have been all right i have made a little success in the house and i am promised a place in the next government i know it seems queer that i should be asking you but it is thator ruin now you know how things are with me  you are making wingrave said quietly a mistake i have not pretended or given the slightest evidence of any friendship for yourself  barrington looked at him with slowly mounting color  you mean  precisely wingrave interrupted i do not know what i might or might not do for lady ruth i have not considered the subject it has not in fact been presented to me  it is the same thing barrington declared hoarsely  pardon meit is not wingrave answered  what i ask you to do barrington said i ask on behalf of my wife  as an ambassador wingrave said coldly you are not acceptable to me it is a matter which i could only discuss with lady ruth herself if lady ruth has anything to say to me i will hear it  barrington stood quite still for several moments the veins on his forehead stood out like tightly drawn cords his breath came with difficulty the light in his eyes as he looked at wingrave was almost murderous  if lady ruth desires to see me wingrave remarked slowly i shall be here at nine oclock this evening tomorrow my movements are uncertain you will excuse me if i hurry you away now i have an engagement which is already overdue  barrington took up his hat and left the room without a word wingrave remained in his chair his eyes followed the departing figure of his visitor when he was absolutely sure that he was alone he covered his face with one hand his engagement seemed to have been with his thoughts for he did not stir for nearly an hour later then he rang the bell for aynesworth     in the toils  wingrave did not speak for several moments after aynesworth had entered the room he had an engagement book before him and seemed to be deep in its contents when at last he looked up his forehead was furrowed with thought and he had the weary air of a man who has been indulging in unprofitable memories  aynesworth he said be so good as to ring up walters and excuse me from dining with him tonight  aynesworth nodded  any particular form of excuse he asked  no say that i have an unavoidable engagement i will see him tomorrow morning  anything else aynesworth asked preparing to leave the room  no you might see that i have no visitors this evening lady ruth is coming here at nine oclock  lady ruth is coming here aynesworth repeated in a colorless tone alone  yes  aynesworth shrugged his shoulders but made no remark he turned towards the door but wingrave called him back  your expression aynesworth he said interests me am i or the lady in question responsible for it  i am sorry for lady ruth aynesworth said i think that i am sorry too for her husband  why she is coming of her own free will  there are different methods of compulsion aynesworth answered  wingrave regarded him thoughtfully  that he said is true but i still do not understand why you are sorry for her  because aynesworth said i know the history of a certain event and i know you it is i suppose for this end that you made use of them  wingrave nodded  quite right he declared i think that the time is not far off when that dear lady and i can cry quits this time too i see nothing to impair my satisfaction at the probable finale in various other cases as you might remember i have not been entirely successful  it depends aynesworth remarked drily upon what you term success  wingrave shrugged his shoulders  i think he said coldly that you are aware of what my feelings and desired course of action have been with regard to those of my fellow creatures with whom i have happened to come into contact it seems to me that i have been a trifle unfortunate in several instances  as for instance aynesworth asked  well to take a few cases only wingrave continued there was the child down at tredowen whom you were so anxious for me to befriend of course i declined to do anything of the sort and she ought by rights to have gone to some charitable institution founded and supported by fools and eventually become perhaps a domestic servant instead of which some relation of her father turns up and provides for her lavishly you must admit that that was unfortunate  it depends upon the point of view aynesworth remarked drily personally i considered it a most fortunate occurrence  naturally wingrave agreed but then you are a sentimentalist you like to see people happy and you would even help to make them so if you could without any personal inconvenience i am at the other pole if i could collect humanity into one sentient force i would set my heel upon it without hesitation i try to do what i can with the atoms but i have not the best of fortune there was mrs travers now there i should have been successful beyond a doubt if some busybody hadnt sent that cable to her husband i wonder if you were idiot enough to do that aynesworth  if i had thought of the marconigram aynesworth said i am sure i should have done it but as a matter of fact i did not  just as well so far as our relations are concerned wingrave said coldly i did manage to make poor men of a few brokers in new york but my best coup went wrong that boy would have blown his brains out i believe if some meddling idiot hadnt found him all that money at the last moment i have had a few smaller successes of course and there is this affair of lady ruth and her estimable husband you know that he came to borrow money of me i suppose  i guessed it aynesworth answered you should be modern in your revenge and lend it to him  wingrave smiled coldly  i fancy he said that lumley barrington will find my revenge modern enough i may lend the money they needbut it will be to lady ruth i told her husband so a few minutes ago i told him to send his wife to me he has gone to tell her now  i wonder aynesworth remarked that he did not thrash youor try to  again wingraves lips parted  moral deterioration has set in already he remarked when he pays his bills with my money he will lose the little he has left of his selfrespect  aynesworth turned abruptly away he was strongly tempted to say things which would have ended his connection with wingrave and as yet he was not ready to leave for the sake of a digression he took up a check book from the table  there are three checks he remarked which i cannot trace one for ten thousand pounds another for five and a third for a thousand pounds what account shall i put them to  private drawing account wingrave answered they represent a small speculation by the bye youd better go and ring up walters  do you wish the particulars entered in your sundry investment book aynesworth asked  wingrave smiled grimly  i think not he answered you can put them to drawing account if you want me again this evening i shall dine at the cafe royal at eight oclock and shall return here at five minutes to nine                   lady ruth was punctual at a few minutes past nine morrison announced that a lady had called to see mr wingrave by appointment  you can show her in wingrave said see that we are not disturbed  lady ruth was scarcely herself she was dressed in a highnecked muslin gown and she wore a hat and veil which somewhat obscured her features the latter she raised however as she accepted the chair which wingrave had placed for her he saw then that she was pale and her manner betrayed an altogether unfamiliar nervousness she avoided his eyes  did you expect me she asked  yes he answered i thought that you would come  her foot long and slender beat impatiently upon the ground she looked up at him once but immediately withdrew her eyes  why did you bring me here she asked in a low tone  my dear lady ruth he protested  if you want to play at being friends she said for heavens sake call me ruth you found it easy enough once  you are very kind he answered ruth by all means  now will you answer my question she said do you meanto help us  usno he answered youperhaps yes he added  then she looked at him and found herself puzzled by the perfect impassivity of his features surely he would drop the mask now he had insisted upon her coming  perhaps she repeated what thenare the conditions  he bent over towards her curiously enough there was mingled with many other sensations a certain sense of triumph in the thought it was almost a hope that at last he was going to betray himself that he was going to admit tacitly or by imputation that her power over him was not wholly dead it was a terrible situationin her heart she felt so but it had its compensations wingrave had been her constant attendant for months he had seen her surrounded by men all anxious to secure a smile from her he had seen her play the great lady in her own house and she played it very well she knew that she was a past mistress in the arts which fascinate his sex she understood the quiet speeches the moods every trick of the gamester in emotions from the fluttering of eyelids to the unchaining of the passions and he had loved her underneath it all he must love her now she was determined that he should tell her so it was genuine excitement which throbbed in her pulses a genuine color which burned in her cheeks  the conditions he repeated you believe then that i mean to make conditions  she raised her eyes to his eloquent eyes she knew and looked at him the mask was still therebut he had moved a little nearer to her  i do not know she said softly you must tell me  there was a moments silence she had scarcely given herself credit for such capacity for emotion he was on his feet surely the mask must go now and thenshe felt that it must be a nightmare it was incredible he had struck a match and was calmly lighting a cigarette  one he said coolly is that mademoiselle violet employs no more amateur assassins to make clumsy attempts upon my life  she sat in her place rigidhalf frozen with a cold numbing fear he had sent for her then only to mock her she had failed they were not even to have the money speech was quite impossible then he continued  i will take your assent for granted he said do you know how much you require to free yourself  about eight thousand pounds she answered mechanically  he sat down and wrote a check which he laid before her  you will have to endorse that he remarked in a matteroffact tone your name at the back will do instead of a receipt  she sprang to her feet  keep your money she cried i will not touch it please open the door for me i am going  by all meansif you wish it he answered undisturbed at the same time i am curious to know why you came here at all if you did not intend to accept it  she faced him hot and angry  i did intend to accept it she declared it is that or ruin but you are too cruel you make itimpossible  you surprise me he answered i suppose you know best  for heavens sake tell me she cried passionately what has come to you what manner of a man are you you loved me once now even after all these years you cannot deny it you have gone out of your way to be with me to be my companion wherever we are people are beginning to smile when they see us together i dont mind ifor gods sake tell me wingrave why do you do it why do you lend me this money what can i do for you what do you want me to be are you as cold as a stone have you no heartno heart even for friendship  i would not seek he answered to buyyour friendship with a check  but it is yours already she cried holding out her hands give me a little kindness wingrave you make me feel and seem a perfect idiot why id rather you asked me anything that treated me like this  i was under the impression wingrave remarked that i was behaving rather well i wonder what would really satisfy you  to have you behave as you are doing and want to behave differently she cried you are magnificentbut it is because you are indifferent will you kiss me wingrave  with pleasure he answered  she drew away from him quickly  is itanother woman she asked the marchioness  her eagerness was almost painful he did not answer her at once she caught hold of his wrist and drew him towards her her eyes searched his face  the marchioness he said is a very beautiful woman she does not however affect the situation as between you and me  if she dared lady ruth murmured wingrave wont you try and be friends with me  i will trycertainly he answered you would be surprised however if you could realize the effect of a long period of enforced seclusion upon a man of my  dont she shrieked stop  my temperament i was about to say he concluded there was a time when i am afraid i might have been tempted under such circumstances as these to forget that you were no longer free to forget everything that except we were alone and that youare as beautiful as ever you were  yes she murmured moving imperceptibly a little nearer towards him  he picked up the check and gave it to her  i am no actor he said looking at her steadily at present i make no conditions but  she leaned towards him he took her face between his hands and kissed her on the lips  i may make them later he said i reserve my right  she looked at him for a moment and dropped her veil  please take me down to my carriage she asked     the indiscretion of the marchioness  i am perfectly certain juliet declared that we ought not to be here  that aynesworth remarked fanning himself lightly with his pocket handkerchief may account for the extraordinary sense of pleasure which i am now experiencing at the same time i cant see why not  i only met you this afternoona few hours ago and here we are absolutely wedged together on these seatsand my chaperon is dozing half the time  pardon me aynesworth objected i knew you when you were a child  for one day  nevertheless aynesworth persisted the fact remains if you date our acquaintance from this afternoon i do not i have never forgotten the little girl in short frocks and long black hair who showed me where the seagulls built and told me cornish fairy stories  it was a very long time ago she remarked  four years he answered for you perhaps a long time because you have changed from a childinto a woman but for a man approaching middle ageas i amnothing  that is all very well she answered but i am not sure that we ought to be in the gallery at covent garden together with a chaperon who will sleep  she will wake up he declared with the music  and i she murmured will dream isnt it lovely  he smiled  i wonder how it really seems to you he remarked we are breathing an atmosphere hot with gas and fragrant with orange peel we are squashed in amongst a crowd of people of a class whom i fancy that neither you nor i know much about and i saw you last in a wilderness we saw only the yellow sands and the rocks and the atlantic we heard only the thunder of the sea and the screaming of seagulls this is very different  wonderfully wonderfully different she answered i miss it all of course i do and yet one is so much nearer to life here the real life of men and women oh one cannot compare it why should one try ah listen  the curtain went up the music of the orchestra subsided and the music of the human voice floated through the opera housethe human voice vibrant with joy and passion and the knowledge which lies behind the veil juliet found no time to talk then no time to think even of her companion her young cheeks were flushed her eyes were bright with excitement she leaned a little forward in her place she passed with all the effortless facility of her ingenuous youth into the dim world of golden fancies which the story of the opera was slowly unfolding beside her mrs tresfarwin dozed and blinked and dozed againand on her left aynesworth himself a little affected by the music still found time to glance continually at his companion so radiant with life and so fervently intent upon realizing to the full this the first of its unknown joys so with crashing of chords and thunder of melody the act went on and when it was over juliet thought no more of the cornish sea and the lullaby of the waves a new music was stirring in her young blood  they were in the front row of the gallery and presently she leaned over to gaze down at the panorama below the women in the boxes and stalls whose bare shoulders and skillfully coiffured hair flashed with jewels suddenly her hand fell upon aynesworths arm  look she cried in some excitement do you see who that is in the box therethe one almost next to the stage  aynesworth too uttered a little exclamation the lights from beneath were falling full upon the still cold face of the man who had just taken a vacant chair in one of the boxes  wingrave he exclaimed and glanced at once at his watch  sir wingrave seton she murmured isnt it strange that i should see him here tonight  he comes often aynesworth answered music is one of his few weaknesses  there was a movement in the box and a womans head and shoulders appeared from behind the curtain juliet gave a little gasp  mr aynesworth she exclaimed did you ever see such a beautiful woman do tell me who she is  a very great lady in london society aynesworth answered that is emily marchioness of westchester  juliets eyes never moved from her until the beautiful neck and shoulders were turned away she leaned over towards her companion and she did not again for some few minutes face the house  she is the loveliest woman i ever saw in my life juliet said with a little sigh is she a great friend of sir wingrave seton mr aynesworth  he has no friends aynesworth answered i believe that they are very well acquainted  poor sir wingrave juliet murmured softly  aynesworth looked at her in some surprise  it is odd that you should have recognized him from up here he remarked thoughtfully he has changed so much during the last few years  juliet smiled but she did not explain she felt that she was obeying wingraves wishes  i should have recognized him anywhere she answered simply i wonder what they are talking about she seems so interested and he looks so bored  aynesworth looked at his watch it was barely ten oclock  i am very glad to see him here this evening he remarked  i should like so much she said still gazing at them earnestly to know that they are talking about                   so you will not tell me the marchioness murmured ceasing for a moment the graceful movements of her fan and looking at him steadily you refuse me thisalmost the first thing i have ever asked you  it is scarcely wingrave objected a reasonable question  between you and me she murmured such punctiliousness is scarcely necessaryis it  he withstood the attack of those wonderful eyes lifted swiftly to his and answered her gravely  you are lady ruths friend he remarked probably therefore she will tell you all about it  the marchioness laughed softly yet with something less than mirth  friends she exclaimed lady ruth and i there was never a woman in this world who was less my friendespecially now  he asked for no explanation of her last words but in a moment or two she vouchsafed it she leaned a little forward her eyes flashed softly through the semidarkness  lady ruth is afraid she said quietly that i might take you away from her  my dear lady he protested the slight friendship between lady ruth and myself is not of the nature to engender such a fear  she shrugged her beautiful shoulders her hands were toying with the rope of pearls which hung from her neck she bent over them as though examining the color of the stones  how long have you known ruth she asked quietly  he looked at her steadfastly he could not be sure whether it was his fancy or whether indeed there was some hidden meaning in her question  since i came to live in england he answered  ah  there was a moments silence then with a little wave of her hands and a brilliant smile she figuratively dismissed the subject  we waste time she remarked lightly and we may have callers at any moment i will ask you no more questions save those which the conventions may permit you to answer truthfully we cant depart from our code can we even for the sake of an inquisitive woman  i can assure you he began  but i will have no assurances she interrupted smilingly i am going to talk of other things i am going to ask you a ridiculous question are you fond of musicseriously  i believe so he answered why  because she answered i sometimes wonder what there is in the world that interests you certainly none of the ordinary things seem to tonight almost for the first time i saw you look a little drawn out of yourself i was wondering whether it was the music or the people i suppose until one gets used to it she added looking a little wearily around the house an audience like this is worth looking at  it certainly is not the people he said do you make as close a study of all your acquaintances  naturally not she answered and i do not class you amongst my acquaintances at all you interest me my friendvery much indeed  i am flattered he murmured  you are noti wish that you were she answered simply i can understand why you have succeeded where so many others have failed you are strong you have nerves of steeland very little heart but nowwhat are you going to do with your life now that wealth must even have lost its meaning to you i should like to know that will you tell me  what is there to do he asked eat and drink and juggle a little with the ball of fate  you are not ambitious  not in the least  pleasure for itself does not attract you no i know that it does not what are you going to do then  i have no idea he answered wont you direct me  yes i will she answered if you will pay my price  he looked at her more intently he himself had been attaching no particular importance to this conversation but he was suddenly conscious that it was not so with the woman at his side her eyes were shining at him soft and full and sweet her beautiful bosom was rising and falling quickly there had come to her something which even he was forced to recognize that curious and voluptuous abandonment which a woman rarely permits herself and can never assume he was a little bewildered his speech lost for a moment its cold precision  your price he repeated ii am stupid im afraid i dont understand  marry me she whispered in his ear and i will take you a little further into life than you could ever go alone you dont care for me of coursebut you shall you dont understand this world wingrave or how to make the best of it i do let me be your guide  wingrave looked at her in grave astonishment  you are not by any chancein earnest he asked  you know very well that i am she answered swiftly and yet you hesitate what is it that you are afraid of dont you like to give up your liberty we need not marry unless you choose that is only a matter of form nowadays at any rate i have a hundred chaperons to choose from society expects strange things from me it is your companionship i want your money is fascinating of course i should like to see you spend it to spend it with both hands dont be afraid that we should be talked about i am not lady ruth i am emily marchioness of westchester and i live and choose my friends as i please will you be chief amongst them hush  for wingrave it was providential the loud chorus which had heralded the upraising of the curtain died away melbas first few notes were floating through the house silence was a necessity the low passion of the music rippled from the stage through the senses and into the hearts of many of the listeners but wingrave listened silent and unmoved he was even unconscious that the woman by his side was watching him half anxiously every now and then  the curtain descended amidst a thunder of applause wingrave turned slowly towards his companion and then there came a respitea knock at the door  the marchioness frowned but wingrave was already holding it open lady ruth followed by an immaculate young guardsman a relative of her husband was standing there  mr wingrave she exclaimed softly with upraised eyebrows why have you contrived to render yourself invisible we thought you were alone emily she continued and took pity on you and all the time you had a prize  the marchioness looked at lady ruth and lady ruth looked at the marchioness the young guardsman was a little sorry that he had come but lady ruth never turned a hair  you must really have your eyes seen to dear the marchioness remarked in a tone of tender concern when you cant see such an old friend as mr wingrave from a few yards away they must be very bad indeed how are you captain kendrick come and tell me about the polo this afternoon sorry i cant offer you all chairs this is an absurd boxit was only meant for two  come into ours lady ruth said we have chairs for six i think  the marchioness shook her head  i wish i had a millionaire in the family she murmured all the same i hate large parties i am oldfashioned enough to think that two is a delightful number  lady ruth laid her hand upon wingraves arm  a decided hint mr wingrave she declared come and let me introduce you to my sister our box is only a few yards off     i am misanthropos and hate mankind  wingrave had just come in from an early gallop his pale cheeks were slightly flushed and his eyes were bright he had been riding hard to escape from disconcerting thoughts he looked in at the study and found aynesworth with a mass of correspondence before him  anything important he asked  not yet aynesworth answered the letters marked private i have sent up to your room by the bye there was something i wanted to tell you  wingrave closed the door  well he said  i was up in the gallery of the opera house last night aynesworth said with aperson who saw you only once soon after i first came to youbefore america you were some distance away and yetmy friend recognized you  wingrave shrugged his shoulders  that of course is possible he answered it really does not matter so very much unless they knew meas wingrave seton  my friend aynesworth said recognized you as sir wingrave seton  wingrave frowned thoughtfully for a moment  who was it he asked  a most unlikely person aynesworth remarked smiling do you remember when we went down to tredowen just before we left for america a little longlegged blackfrocked child whom we met in the gardensthe organists daughter you know  what of her wingrave asked  it was she who was with me aynesworth remarked it was she who saw you in the box with the marchioness of westchester  aynesworth was puzzled by the intentness with which wingrave was regarding him impenetrable though the man was aynesworth who had not yet lost his early trick of studying him closely knew that for some reason or other his intelligence had proved disturbing  have you thenkept up your acquaintance with this child he demanded  aynesworth shook his head  she is not a child any longer but a very beautiful young woman he said i met her again quite by accident she is up in london studying art at the studio of an old friend of mine who has a class of girls i called to see him the other afternoon and recognized her  your acquaintance wingrave remarked has progressed rapidly if she accepts your escortto the gallery of the opera  it was scarcely like that aynesworth explained i met her and mrs tresfarwin on the way there and asked to be allowed to accompany them mrs tresfarwin was once your housekeeper i think at tredowen  and did you solve the mystery of this relation of her father who turned up so opportunely wingrave asked  aynesworth shook his head  she told me nothing about him he answered  wingrave passed on to his own room his breakfast was on the table awaiting him and a little pile of letters and newspapers stood by his plate his servant his head groom and his chauffeur were there to receive their orders for the morning about him were all the evidences of his wellordered life he sent both the men away and locked the door it was half an hour before he touched either his breakfast or his letters  he lunched at westchester house in obedience to a somewhat imperative summons there were other guests there whom however he outstayed as soon as they were alone his hostess touched him on the arm and led him to her own room  at last she exclaimed with an air of real relief there sit down opposite to me pleasei want to watch your face  she was a little paler than usual and he noticed that she had avoided talking much to him at luncheon time and yet he thought that he had never seen her more beautiful something in her face had altered he could not tell what it was for he was not a man of much experience as regarded her sex yet in a vague sort of way he understood the change a certain part of the almost insolent quietness the complete selfassurance of her manner had gone she was a little more like an ordinary woman  lady ruth proved herself an excellent tactician last night she remarked she has given me an exceedingly uncomfortable few hours for you well for you it was a respite wasnt it  i dont know that i should call it exactly that he answered thoughtfully  she looked at him steadfastly almost wistfully  well she said i am not going to make excuses for myself but the things which one says naturally enough when the emotions provoke them sound crude enough in cold blood and colder daylight we women are creatures of mood you know i was feeling a little lonely and a little tired last night and the music stole away my common sense  i understand he murmured all that you said shall be forgotten  then you do not understand she answered smiling at him what i said i do not wish to be forgotten onlyjust at that moment it sounded natural enoughand todayi think that i am a little ashamed  he rose from his seat her eyes leaped up to his expectantly and the color streamed into her cheeks but he only stood by her side he did nothing to meet the halfproffered embrace  dear lady emily he said all the kind things that you said were spoken to a stranger you did not know me i did not mean anyone to know me it is you who have commanded the truth you must have it i am not the person i seem to be i am not the person to whom words such as yours should have been spoken even my name is an assumed one i should prefer to leave it at thatif you are content  i am not content she answered quietly i must hear more  he bowed  i am a man he said who spent ten years in prison the ten best years of my life a woman sent me therea woman swore my liberty away to save her reputation i was never of a forgiving disposition i was never an amiably disposed person i want you to understand this any of the ordinary good qualities with which the average man may be endowed and which i may have possessed are as dead in me as hell fire could burn them you have spoken of me as of a man who failed to find a sufficient object in life you were wrong i have an object and i do my best to live up to it i hate the whole world of men and women who laughed their way through life whilst i sufferedtortures i hate the woman who sent me there i have no heart nor any sense of pity now perhaps you can understand my life and the manner of it  her hands were clasped to the side of her head something of horror had stolen into the steadfast gaze with which she was still regarding him yet there were other things there which puzzled him  thisis terrible she murmured then you are notmr wingrave at all  he hesitated after all it was scarcely worth while concealing anything now  i am sir wingrave seton he said you may remember my little affair  she caught hold of his hands  you poor poor dear she cried how you must have suffered  wingrave had a terrible moment what he felt he would never have admitted even to himself her eyes were shining with sympathy and it was so unexpected he had expected something in the nature of a cold withdrawal her silence was the only thing he had counted upon it was a fierce but short battle his sudden grasp of her hands was relaxed he stood away from her  you are very kind he said as you can doubtless imagine it is a little too late for sympathy the years have gone and the better part of me if ever there was a better part with them  i am not so sure of that she whispered  he looked at her coldly  why not  if you were absolutely heartless she said if you were perfectly consistent why did you not make me suffer you had a great chance a little feigned affection and then a few truths you could have dragged me down a little way into the pit of broken hearts why didnt you  he frowned  one is forced to neglect a few opportunities  she smiled at himdelightfully  you foolish man she murmured some day or other you will turn out to be a terrible impostor do you know i think i am going to ask you againwhat i asked you last night  i scarcely think that you will be so illadvised he declared coldly whether you believe it or not i can assure you that i am incapable of affection  she sighed  i am not so sure about that she said with protesting eyebrows but you are terribly hardhearted  he was entirely dissatisfied with the impression he had produced he considered the attitude of the marchioness unjustifiably frivolous he had an uneasy conviction that she was not in the least inclined to take him seriously  i dont think he said glancing at the clock that i need detain you any longer  you are really going away then she asked him softly  yes  to call on lady ruth perhaps  as it happens no he answered  suddenly her face changedshe had remembered something  it was lady ruth she exclaimed  exactly he interrupted  what a triumph of inconsistency she declared scornfully you are lending them money  i am lending money to lady ruth he answered slowly  their eyes met she understood at any rate what he intended to convey certainly his expression was hard and merciless enough now  poor ruth she murmured  some day he answered you will probably say that in earnest     juliet gains experience  of course juliet said after tredowen it seems very small almost poky but it isnt really and tredowen was not for me all my days it was quite time i got used to something else  wingrave looked around him with expressionless face it was a tiny room high up on the fifth floor of a block of flats prettily but inexpensively furnished juliet herself tall and slim with all the fire of youth and perfect health on her young face was obviously contented  and your work he asked  she made a little grimace  i have a good deal to unlearn she said but mr pleydell is very kind and encouraging  you will go down to cornwall for the hot weather i hope he said london is unbearable in august  the class are going for a sketching tour to normandy she said and mr pleydell thought that i might like to join them it is very inexpensive and i should be able to go on with my work all the time  he nodded thoughtfully  i hear he said that you have met mr aynesworth again  wasnt it delightful she exclaimed he is quite an old friend of mr pleydell i was so glad to see him  i suppose he remarked you are a little lonely sometimes  sometimes she admitted but i shant be when i get to know the girls in the class a little better  i have some friends he said thoughtfully women of course who would come and see you with pleasure and yet he added i am not sure that you would not be better off without knowing them  they are fashionable ladies perhaps she said simply  he nodded  they belong to the juggernaut here which is called society they would probably try to draw you a little way into its meshes i think yes i am sure he added looking at her that you are better off outside  and i am quite sure of it she answered laughing i havent the clothes or the time or the inclination for that sort of thing besides i am going to be much too happy ever to be lonely  i myself he said am not an impressionable person but they tell me that most people especially of your age find london a terribly lonely place  i can understand that she answered unless they really had something definite to do i have felt a little of that myself i think london frightens me a little it is so different from the country and there is a great deal that is difficult to understand  for instance  the great number of poor people who find it so hard to live she answered some of the small houses round here are awful and mr malcolmhe is the vicar of the church here and he called yesterdaytells me that they are nothing like so bad as in some other parts of london and then you take a bus it is such a short distanceand the shops are full of wonderful things at such fabulous prices and the carriages and houses are so lovely and people seem to be showering money right and left everywhere  it is the same in all large cities he answered more or less there must always be rich and poor when a great community are herded together as a rule the extreme poor are a worthless lot  there must be some of them though she answered who deserve to have a better time of course i have never been outside tredowen where everyone was contented and happy in their way and it seems terrible to me just at first i cant bear to think that everyone hasnt at least a chance of happiness  you are too young he said to bother your head about these things yet wait until you have gathered in a little philosophy with the years then you will understand how helpless you are to alter by ever so little the existing state of things and it will trouble you less  i she answered may of course be helpless but what about those people who have huge fortunes and still do nothing  why should they he answered coldly this is a world for individual effort no man is strong enough to carry even a single one of his fellows upon his shoulders charity is the most illogical and pernicious of all weaknesses  now you are laughing at me she declared i mean men like that mr wingrave the american who has come to england to spend all his millions i have just been reading about him she added pointing to an illustrated paper on the table they say that his income is too vast to be put into figures which would sound reasonable that he has estates and shooting properties and a yacht which he has never yet even seen and yet he will not give one penny away he gives nothing to the hospitals nothing to the poor he spends his money on himself and himself alone  wingrave smiled grimly  i am not prepared to defend my namesake he said but every man has a right to do what he likes with his own hasnt he and as for hospitals mr wingrave probably thinks like a good many more that they should be state endowed people could make use of them then without loss of self respect  she shook her head a little doubtfully  i cant argue about it yet she said because i havent thought about it long enough but i know if i had all the money this man has i couldnt be happy to spend thousands and thousands upon myself while there were people almost starving in the same city  you are a sentimentalist you see he remarked and you have not studied the laws on which society is based tell me how does mrs tresfarwin like london  juliet laughed merrily  isnt it amusing she declared she loves it she grumbles at the milk and we have the butter from tredowen everything else she finds perfection she doesnt even mind the five flights of stone steps  social problems wingrave remarked do not trouble her  not in the least juliet declared she spends all her pennies on beggars and omnibus rides and she is perfectly happy  wingrave rose to go in a few minutes juliet walked with him to the door  i am going to be really hospitable she declared i am going to walk with you to the street  all down those five flights he exclaimed  every one of them  they commenced the descent  there is something about a flat she declared which makes one horribly curious about ones neighborsespecially if one has never had any all these closed doors may hide no end of interesting people and i have never seen a soul go in or out how did you like all this climbing  im afraid i didnt appreciate it he admitted  perhaps you wont come to see me again then she asked i hope you will  i will come he said a little stiffly with pleasure  they were on the ground floor and juliet opened the door wingraves motor was outside and the man touched his hat she gave a little breathless cry  it isnt yours she exclaimed  certainly he answered do you want to come and look at it  rather she exclaimed i have never seen one close to in my life  he hesitated  ill take you a little way if you like he said  her cheeks were pink with excitement  if i like and ive never been in one before ill fly up for my hat i shant be a moment  she was already halfway up the first flight of stairs with a whirl of skirts and flying feet wingrave lit a cigarette and stood for a moment thoughtfully upon the pavement then he shrugged his shoulders his face had grown a little harder  she must take her chances he muttered no one knows her nobody is likely to find out who she is  she was down again in less time than seemed possible her cheeks were flushed and her eyes bright with excitement wingrave took the wheel himself and she sat up by his side they glided off almost noiselessly  we will go up to the park he said it is just the time to see the people  anywhere she exclaimed this is too lovely  they passed from battersea northwards into piccadilly and down into the park juliet was too excited to talk wingrave had enough to do to drive the car they passed plenty of people who bowed and many who glanced with wondering admiration at the beautiful girl who sat by wingraves side lady ruth who drive by quickly in a barouche almost rose from her seat the marchioness whose victoria they passed had time to wave her hand and flash a quick searching glance at juliet who returned it with her dark eyes filled with admiration the marchioness smiled to herself a little sadly as the car shot away ahead  if one asked she murmured to herself he would try to persuade one that it was another victim     nemesis at work  wingrave was present that evening at a reception given by the prime minister to some distinguished foreign guests he had scarcely exchanged the usual courtesies with his host and hostess before lady ruth leaning over from a little group whispered in his ear  please take me away i am bored i want to talk to you  he paused at once lady ruth nodded to her friends  mr wingrave is going to take me to hear melba sing she said see you all again i suppose at hereford house  they made slow progress through the crowded rooms once or twice wingrave fancied that his companion hung a little heavily upon his arm she showed no desire to talk she even answered a remark of his in a monosyllable only when they passed the marchioness on the arm of one of the foreign guests in whose honor the reception was given she seemed to shiver a little and her grasp upon his arm was tightened once in a block she was forced to speak to some acquaintances and during those few seconds wingrave studied her curiously she was absolutely colorless and her strange brilliant eyes seemed to have lost all their fire her gown was black and the decorations of her hair were black except for a single diamond there was something almost spectral about her appearance she walked stifflyfor the moment she had lost the sinuous grace of movement which had been one of her many fascinations her neck and shoulders alone remained as ever dazzlingly beautiful  they reached a quiet corner at last lady ruth sank with a little gesture of relief into an easy chair wingrave stood before her  you are tired tonight he remarked  i am always tired she answered wearily i begin to think that i always shall be  he said nothing lady ruth closed her eyes for a moment as though from sheer fatigue suddenly she opened them again and looked him full in the face  who was she she asked  i do not understand he replied  the child you were withthe ingenue you knowwith the pink cheeks and the wonderful eyes is she from one of the theaters or a genuine article  the young lady to whom you refer he answered is the daughter of an old friend of mine i am practically her guardian she is in london studying painting  you are her guardian lady ruth repeated i am sorry for her  you need not be he answered i trust that i shall be able to fulfill my duties in a perfectly satisfactory manner  oh i have no doubt of it she answered yet i am sorry for her  you are certainly he remarked not in an amiable mood  i am in rather a desperate one if that is anything she said looking at him with something of the old light in her tired eyes  you made a little error perhaps in those calculations he suggested it can be amended  dont be a brute she answered fiercely  he shrugged his shoulders  that sounds a little severe he remarked  dont take any notice of anything i say tonight she murmured softly i am a little mad i think that everything is going against me i know that you havent a grain of sympathy for methat you would rather see me suffer than not and yet you see i give myself away entirely why shouldnt i part of it is through you in a way  i rather fancied he remarked that up to now  yes of course she interrupted you saved me from ruin staved it off at any rate and you held over the reckoning ii almost wish  she paused again her eyes were searching his  i am a little tired of it all you see she continued i dont suppose lumley and i can ever be the same again since i brought himthat check he avoids being alone with mei do the same with him one would thinkto watch the people that the whole transaction was in the morning post they smile when they see us together they grin when they see you with anybody else its getting hateful wingrave  i am afraid he said quietly that you are in a nervous hypersensitive state no one else can possibly know of the little transaction between us and so far as i am concerned there has been nothing to interfere with your relations with your husband  you are right she answered i am losing my nerve i am only afraid that i am losing something else i havent an ounce of battle left in me i feel that i should like to close my eyes and wake up in a new world and start all over again  it is nothing but a mood he assured her those new worlds dont exist any longer they generally consist of foreign watering places where the sheep and the goats house together now and then i think i should play the game out lady ruth until  until what  perhaps to the end he answered who can tell not i by this time tomorrow it might be i who would be reminding you  yes  that there are other worlds and other lives to live  i should like she whispered very softly to hear of them but i fancy somehow that you will never be my instructor what of your ward  well what of her he answered calmly  she shivered a little  you were very frank with me once wingrave she said you are a man whose life fate has wrecked fate and i you have no heart left no feeling you can create suffering and find it amusing i am beginning to realize that  he nodded  there is some truth he declared in what you say  what of that child is she too to be a victim  i trust he answered that you are not going to be melodramatic  i dont call it that i really want to know i should like to warn her  i am not at war with children he answered her life and mine are as far apart as the poles  i had an odd fancy when i saw you with her lady ruth said slowly she is very goodlookingand not so absurdly young  the fancy was one he remarked coldly which i think you had better get rid of  in a way she continued thoughtfully i should like to get rid of it and yethow old are you wingrave well i know you are very little over forty you are barely in the prime of life you are strong you have the one thing which society today counts almost divinegreat immeasurable wealth cant you find someone to thaw the snows  i loved a woman once he answered it was a long time ago and it seems strange to me now  lady ruth lifted her eyes to his and their lambent fires were suddenly rekindled  love her again she murmured what is past is past but there are the days to come perhaps the woman too is a little lonely  i think not he answered calmly the woman is married she has lived with her husband more or less happily for a dozen years or so she is a little ambitious a little fond of pleasure but a leader of society and i am sure a very reputable member of it to love her again would be as embarrassing to heras it would be difficult for me you my dear lady ruth i am convinced would be the last to approve of it  you mock me she murmured bending her head is forgiveness also an impossibility  i think he said that any sentiment whatever between those two would be singularly misplaced you spoke of melba i think she is singing in the further room  lady ruth rose up still and pale there was fear in her eyes when she looked at him  is it to be always like this then she said  ah he answered i am no prophet who can tell what the days may bring in the meantime  the marchioness was very much in request that evening and she found time for only a few words with wingrave  what have you been doing to poor ruth she asked i never saw her look so ill  indeed he answered i had not noticed it  if i didnt know her better she remarked i might begin to suspect her of a conscience whose baby were you driving about this afternoon i didnt know that your taste ran to ingenues to such an extent shes sweetly pretty but i dont think its nice of you to flaunt her before us middleaged people its enough to drive us to the rouge box come to lunch tomorrow  i shall be delighted he answered and passed on  an hour or so later on his way out he came upon lady ruth sitting a little forlornly in the hall  i wonder whether i dare ask you to drop me in cadogan square she asked is it much out of your way i am leaving a little earlier than i expected  i shall be delighted he answered offering his arm  they passed out of the door and down the covered way into the street a few stragglers were loitering on the pavement and one a tall thin young man in a long ulster bent forwards as they came down the steps wingrave felt his companions grasp tighten upon his arm a flash of light upon the pale features and staring eyes of the young man a few feet off showed him to be in the act of intercepting them then at a sharp word from wingrave a policeman stretched out his arm the young man was pushed unceremoniously away wingraves tall footman and the policeman formed an impassable barrierin a moment the electric brougham was gliding down the street lady ruth was leaning back amongst the cushions and the hand which fell suddenly upon wingraves was cold as ice     richardson tries again  you sawwho that was  lady ruths voice seemed to come from a greater distance wingrave turned and looked at her with calm curiosity she was leaning back in the corner of the carriage and she seemed somehow to have shrunk into an unusual insignificance her eyes alone were clearly visible through the semidarknessand the light which shone from their depths was the light of fear  yes he answered slowly i believe that i recognized him it was the young man who persists in some strange hallucination as to a certain mademoiselle violet  it was no hallucination she answered you know that i was mademoiselle violet  he nodded  it amazes me he said thoughtfully that you should have stooped to such folly that my demise would have been a relief to you i can of course easily believe but the meansthey surely were not worthy of your ingenuity  dont she cried sharply i must have been utterly miserably mad  even the greatest of schemers have their wild moments he remarked consolingly this was one of yours you paid me a very poor compliment by the bye to imagine that an insignificant creature like that  will youleave off she moaned  i daresay he continued after a moments pause that you find him now quite an inconvenient person to deal with  she shuddered  oh i am paying for my folly if that is what you mean she declared he knowswho i amthat he was deceived he follows me abouteverywhere  wingrave glanced out of the carriage window  unless i am very much surprised he answered he is following us now  she came a little closer to him  you wont leave me promise  i will see you home he answered  you are coming on to hereford house  i think not he answered i have had enough of society for one evening  emily will be there later she said quietly  even lady emily he answered will not tempt me i will see you safely inside afterwards if your persistent follower is hanging about i will endeavor to talk him into a more reasonable frame of mind  she was silent for a moment then she turned to him abruptly  you are more kind to me sometimes than i deserve wingrave she remarked  it is not kindness he answered i dislike absurd situations here we are permit me  wingrave kept his word he saw lady ruth to her front door and then turned back towards his carriage standing by the side of the footman a little breathless haggard and disheveledlooking was the young man who had attempted to check their progress a few minutes ago  wingrave took hold of his arm firmly  get in there he ordered pointing to the carriage  the young man tried to escape but he was held as though in a vise before he well knew where he was he was in the carriage and wingrave was seated by his side  what do you want with me he asked hoarsely  i want to know what you mean by following that lady about wingrave asked  the young man leaned forward his hand was upon the door  let me get out he said sullenly  with pleasurepresently wingrave answered i can assure you that i am not anxious to detain you longer than necessary only you must first answer my question  i want to speak to her i shall follow her about until i can the young man declared  wingrave glanced at him with a faint derisive smile his clothes were worn and shabby he was badly in need of a shave and a wash he sat hunched up in a corner of the carriage the picture of mute discomfort and misery  do you know who she is wingrave asked  mademoiselle violet the young man answered  you are mistaken wingrave answered she is lady ruth barrington wife of lumley barrington and daughter of the earl of haselton  the young man was unmoved  she is mademoiselle violet he declared  the coupe drew up before the great block of buildings in which was wingraves flat the footman threw open the door  come in with me wingrave said i have something more to say to you  i would rather not the young man muttered and would have slouched off but wingrave caught him by the arm  come he said firmly and the youth obeyed  wingrave led the way into his sitting room and dismissed his servant who was setting out a tray upon the sideboard  sit down he ordered and his strange guest again obeyed wingrave looked at him critically  it seems to me he said deliberately that you are another of those poor fools who chuck away their life and happiness and go to the dogs because a woman had chosen to make a little use of them youre out of work i suppose  yes  hungry  i suppose so  wingrave brought a plate of sandwiches from the sideboard and mixed a whisky and soda he set them down in front of his guest and turned away with the evening paper in his hand  i am going into the next room for some cigarettes he remarked  he was gone scarcely two minutes when he returned the room was in darkness he moved suddenly towards the electric lights but was pushed back by an unseen hand a mans hot breath fell upon his cheek a hoarse rasping voice spoke to him out of the black shadows  dont touch the lights dont touch the lights i say  what folly is this wingrave asked angrily are you mad  not now came the quick answer i have been it has come to me here in the darkness i know why she is angry i know why she will not speak to me it isbecause i failed  wingrave laughed and moved towards the lights  we have had enough of this tomfoolery he said scornfully if you wont listen to reason  he never finished his sentence he had stumbled suddenly against a soft body he had a momentary impression of a white vicious face of eyes blazing with insane fury quick to act he struckbut before his hand descended he had felt the tearing of his shirt the sharp keen pain in his chest the swimming of his senses yet even then he struck again with passionate anger and his assailant went down amongst the chairs with a dull sickening crash  then there was silence in the room wingrave made an effort to drag himself a yard or two towards the bell but collapsed hopelessly richardson in a few moments staggered to his feet  he groped his way to the side of the wall and found the knobs of the electric lights he turned two on and looked around him wingrave was lying a few yards off with a small red stain upon his shirt front his face was ghastly pale and he was breathing thickly the young man looked at him for several moments and then made his way to the side table where the sandwiches were one by one he took them from the dish and ate deliberately when he had finished he made his way once more towards where wingrave lay but before he reached the spot he stopped short something on the wall had attracted his attention he put his hand to his head and thought for a moment it was an ideaa glorious idea                    lady ruths maid stepped back and surveyed her mistress ecstatically  milady she declared has never no never appeared more charming the gown it is divineand the coiffure milady will have no rivals  lady ruth looked at herself long and earnestly in the glass her face reflected none of the pleased interest with which her maid was still regarding her the latter grew a little anxious  milady thinks herself a trifle pale perhapsa little more color  lady ruth set down the glass  no thank you annette she answered i shall do very well i suppose certainly i wont have any rouge  milady knows very well what becomes her the woman answered discreetly the pallor it is the more distinguished milady cannot fail to have all the success she desires  lady ruth smiled a little wearily and at that moment there came a knock at the door a servant entered  someone wishes to speak to your ladyship on the telephone the girl announced  on the telephone at this time of night lady ruth exclaimed ridiculous they must send a message whoever they are  parkins told them so your ladyship the girl answered but they insisted that the matter was important they would give no name but said that they were speaking from mr wingraves rooms  lady ruth raised her eyebrows  it is very extraordinary she said coldly but i will come to the telephone     it was an accident  lady ruth took up the receiver some instinct seemed to have prompted her to close the door of the study  who is there she asked who is it that wants me  a thin unfamiliar voice answered her  is that lady ruth barrington  yes  is itmademoiselle violet  the receiver nearly dropped from her hand  i dont understand you she answered i am lady ruth barrington who are you  you are mademoiselle violet was the answer and you know who i am listen i am in mr wingraves rooms  she would have liked to have rung off and gone away but it seemed a sheer impossibility for her to move and all the time her knees were shaking and the fear of evil things was in her heart  what are you doing there she asked  he brought me in himself the thin voice answered can you hear me i dont want to speak any louder for fear anyone else should be listening  yes i can hear she answered but how dared you ring me up say what you desire to quickly i am going away  wait please the voice answered i know why you have been angry with me i know why you have kept away from me why you have been so cruel it was because i failed was it not dear mademoiselle violet  she had not the breath or the courage to answer him in a moment or two he continued and there was a note of suppressed exultation in his tone  listen this timei have not failed  she nearly screamed the receiver in her hand burned like a live thing her eyes were set in a fixed and awful stare as though she were trying to see for herself outside the walls of the little room where she stood into the larger chamber from which the voicethat awful voicecame her own words were hysterical and uncertain but she managed to falter them out at last  what do you mean where is mr wingrave tell me at once  the voice without being raised seemed to take to itself a note of triumph  he is dyingon the floorjust here listen hard perhaps you can hear him groan now will you believe that i am not a coward  her shriek drowned his words she flung the receiver from her with a crash and rushed from the room into the hall she brushed past her maid with a wild gesture  never mind my wraps open the door parkins is the carriage waiting  yes milady shall  but she was past him and down the steps  no 18 grosvenor mansions she cried to the man drive fast  the man obeyed the servants who had come to the door stood there a little frightened group she ignored them and everything else completely the carriage had scarcely stopped when she sprang out and crossed the pavement in a few hasty steps the tall commissionaire looked in amazement at her she wore an opera cloakshe was a bewildering vision of white satin and diamonds and her eyes were terrible with the fear which was in her heart  she clutched him by the arm  come up with me to mr wingraves rooms she exclaimed something terrible has happened i heard through the telephone  the man dashed up the stairs by her side wingraves suite was on the first floor and they did not wait for the lift the commissionaire put his finger on the bell of the outside door she leaned forward listening breathlessly inside all was silence except for the shrill clamor of the bell  go on ringing she said breathlessly dont leave off  the man looked at her curiously mr wingrave came in about an hour ago with a young man madam he said  yes yes she cried listen theres someone coming  they heard a hesitating step inside the door was cautiously opened it was richardson pale disheveled but triumphant who peered out  mademoisellemademoiselle violet he cried you have come to see for yourself this way  she raised her arm and struck him across the face so that with a little moan he staggered back against the wall then she hastened forward into the room towards which he had pointed and the door of which stood open the commissionaire followed her the servants were beginning to appear  the room was in darkness save for one electric light a groan however directed them she fell on her knees by wingraves prostrate figure and raised his head slightly his servant too was hurrying forward she looked up  get me some brandy she ordered send someone for a doctor dont let that young man escape the brandy quick  she forced some between his lips there was already a spot of blood upon the gown which a few minutes ago had seemed so immaculate one of the ornaments fell from her hair it lay unnoticed by her side suddenly wingrave opened his eyes she saw at once that he was conscious and that he recognized her  dont move please she begged it will be better for you not to speak the doctor will be here directly  he nodded  i dont think that i am much hurt he said slowly your young friend was a born bungler  she shuddered but said nothing  how on earth he asked did you get here  she whispered in his ear  the brutetelephoned please dont talk  the doctor arrived his examination was over in a few moments  nothing serious he declared the knife was pretty blunt fortunately how did it happen it seems like a case for the police  it was an accident wingrave declared coolly  the doctor shrugged his shoulders he was busy making bandages lady ruth rose to her feet she was white and giddy the commissionaire and morrison were talking together at the door the latter turned to lady ruth  do you think that we had better send for the police your ladyship he asked it was the young man who came in with mr wingrave who must have done this i thought he was a very wildlooking sort of person  you heard what mr wingrave said she answered i dont think that i should disobey him if i were you the doctor says that after all it is not very serious  he cant have got far the hall porter remarked he only slipped out as we came in  i should let him go for the present lady ruth said if mr wingrave wishes to prosecute afterwards it will be easy for him to do so  she stepped back to where wingrave lay he was in a recumbent position now and although a little pale he was obviously not seriously hurt  if there is nothing else that i can do she said i will go now  by all means wingrave answered i am exceedingly obliged to you for your kindness he added a little stiffly morrison show lady barrington to her carriage  she spoke a few conventional words of farewell and departed outside on the pavement she stood for a moment looking carefully around there was no sign of richardson anywhere she stepped into the carriage and leaned back in the corner     aynesworth plans a love story  wingrave disappeared suddenly from london aynesworth alone knew where he was gone and he was pledged to secrecy two people received letters from him lady ruth was one of them  this she remarked quietly handing it over to her husband may interest you  he adjusted his eye glasses and read it aloud  dear lady ruthi am leaving london today for several weeks with the usual inconsistency of the person to whom life is by no means a valuable asset i am obeying the orders of my physician i regret therefore that i cannot have the pleasure of entertaining your husband and yourself during cowes week the yacht however is entirely at your disposal and i have written captain masterton to that effect pray extend your cruise if you feel inclined toi remain yours sincerely w  mr barrington looked at his wife inquiringly  that seems to me entirely satisfactory ruth he said i think that he might have added a word or two of acknowledgment for what you did for him there is no doubt that but for your promptness things might have gone much worse  yes lady ruth said slowly i think that he might have added a few words  her husband regarded her critically  i am afraid dear he said that all this anxiety has knocked you up a little you are not looking well  i am tired she answered calmly it has been a long season i should like to do what wingrave has donego away somewhere and rest  barrington laid his hand upon hers affectionately it seemed to him that the rings hung a little loosely upon the thin white fingers she was pale too and her eyes were weary he did not notice that as soon as she could she drew her hand away  pon my word he said i wish we could go off somewhere by ourselves but with wingraves yacht to entertain on we must do something for a few of the people i dont suppose he minds whom we ask or how many  no she answered i do not suppose he cares  it is most opportune barrington declared i wanted particularly to do something for the hendersons he seems very well disposed and his influence means everything just now really ruth i believe we are going to pull through after all  she smiled a little wearily  do you think so lumley  i am sure of it ruth he answered i only wish i could see you a little more cheerful surely you cant stillbe afraid of wingrave he added glancing uneasily across the table  she looked him in the eyes  that is exactly what i am she answered i am afraid of him i have always been afraid nothing has happened to change him he came back to have his revenge he will have it  lumley barrington for once felt himself superior to his clever wife he smiled upon her reassuringly  my dear ruth he said if only you would reflect for a few moments i feel sure you would realize the absurdity of such fancies we did wingrave a service in introducing him to society here and i am sure that he appreciated it if he wished for our ruin why did he lend us eight thousand pounds on no security why does he lend us his yacht to entertain our friends why did he give me that information which enabled me to make the only money i ever did make on the stock exchange  she smiled contemptuously  you do not understand a man like wingrave she declared nothing that he has done is inconsistent with my point of view he gave you a safe tip knowing very well that when you had won a little you would try again on your own account and losewhich you did he lent us the money to become our creditor and he lends us the yacht to give another handle to the people who are saying already that he occupies the position in our family which is more fully recognized on the other side of the channel  you are talking rubbish he declared vehemently no one would dare to say such a thing of youof my wife  she laughed unmercifully  if you were not my husband she said cruelly you would have heard it before now i have been careful all my lifemore careful than most women but i can hear the whisperings already there are more ways to ruin than one lumley  we will refuse the yacht barrington said sullenly and i will go to the jews for that eight thousand pounds  we will do nothing of the sort lady ruth answered i am not going to be a laughing stock for emily and her friends if i can help it well play the game through now onlyit is best for you to know the risks  wingraves second letter was to juliet she found it on her table one afternoon when she came back from her painting class she tore it open eagerly enough but her face clouded over as she read  dear julieti am sorry that i am unable to carry out my promise to come and see you but i have been slightly indisposed for some days and am leaving london for the present almost at once i trust that you are still interested in your work and will enjoy your trip to normandy  i received your letter asking for my help towards reestablishing in life a poor family in whom you are interested i regret that i cannot accede to your request it is wholly against my principles to give money away to people of this class i look upon all charity as a mischievous attempt to tamper with natural laws and i am convinced that if everyone shared my views society would long ago have been reestablished on a sounder and more logical basis to be quite frank with you also i might add that the gift of sympathy has been denied to me i am quite indifferent whether the family you allude to starve or prosper  so far as you yourself are concerned however the matter is entirely different if it gives you pleasure to assist in pauperizing any number of your fellow creatures pray do so i enclose a check for l100 it is a present to you use it entirely as you pleaseonly if you use it for the purpose suggested in your letter to me remember that the responsibility is yours and yours alonei remain sincerely yours wingrave seton  juliet walked straight to her writing table her cheeks were flushed and her eyes were wet with tears she drew out a sheet of note paper and wrote rapidly  my dear guardiani return you the check i cannot accept such presents after all your goodness to me i am sorry that you feel as you do about giving money away you are so much older and wiser than i am that i dare not attempt to argue with you only it seems to me that life would be a cruelly selfish thing if we who are so much more fortunate than many of our fellow creatures did not sometimes try to help them a little through their misery perhaps i feel this a little more keenly because i wonder sometimes what might not have become of me but for your goodness  i am sorry that you are going away without coming to see me again you are not displeased with me i hope for asking you this or for any other reason i am foolish enough to feel a little lonely sometimes will you take me out again when you come backyour affectionate ward juliet  juliet went out and posted her letter on the way back she met aynesworth  come and sit in the park for a few minutes he begged  she turned and walked by his side willingly enough  have you been in to see me she asked  yes he answered i have some tickets for the haymarket for tonight do you think we could persuade mrs tresfarwin to come  im sure we could she answered laughing hannah never wants any persuading how nice of you to think of us  i am afraid he answered that i think of you a good deal  then i think that that also is very nice of you she declared  you like to be thought of  who doesnt what is the play tonight  ill tell you about it afterwards he said there is something else i want to say to you first  she nodded she scarcely showed so much interest as he would have liked  it is about berneval he said keeping his eyes fixed upon her face i saw mr pleydell today and he told me that you were all going there he suggested that i should come too  how delightful she exclaimed can you really get off  yes sir wingrave is going away and doesnt want me i must go somewhere and i thought that i might go over and take rooms near you all would you care to have me  of course i would she answered frankly oh she exclaimed suddenly her face clouding overi forgot  well  i am not sure she said that i am going  not going he repeated incredulously mr pleydell told me that it was all arranged  it wasuntil today she said i am a little uncertain now  he looked at her perplexed  may i know why he asked  she raised her eyebrows slightly  you are rather an inquisitive person she remarked the fact is i may need the money i have saved for berneval for somewhere else  of course he said slowly if you dont goi dont but you cant stay in london all through the hot weather  miss pengarth has asked me to go down there she said  he laid his hand suddenly upon hers  juliet he said  she shook her head  miss lundy please  well miss lundy then may i talk to you seriously  i prefer you frivolous she murmured i like to be amused  ill be frivolous enough later on this evening ive been wondering if youd think it impertinent if i asked you to tell me about your guardian  what do you want to know she asked  just who he is and why he is content to let you live with only an old woman to look after you it isnt the best thing in the world for you is it i should like to know him juliet  she shook her head  i am sorry she said i cannot tell you anything  there was a short silence aynesworth was disappointed and showed it  it isnt exactly ordinary curiosity he continued dont think that only i feel that you need someone who has the right to advise you and look after you i should like to be your guardian juliet  she laughed merrily  good she declared i like you so much better frivolous well you shall have your wish you shall be my guardian for the evening i have one cutlet for dinner and i am sure it will be spoilt will you come and share it  she rose to her feet and stood looking down upon him he was struck for the first time by something different in her appearance the smooth delicate girlishness of her young face was as yet untroubled her eyes laughed frankly into his and all the grace of natural childhood seemed still to linger about her and yetthere was a change understanding was there understanding with sorrow in its wake aynesworth was suddenly anxious had anything happened of which he was ignorant he rose up slowly he was sure of himself now was he sure of her     a deed of gift  wingrave threw the paper aside with an impatient exclamation a small notice in an obscure corner had attracted his attention the young man richardson had been fished out of the river half drowned and in view of his tearful and abject penitence had been allowed to go his way by a lenient magistrate he had been ill he pleaded and disappointed his former employer in an islington emporium gave him a good character and offered to take him back so that was an end of mr richardson and the romance of his days  a worm like that to have brought himthe strong man low wingrave thought with sullen anger as he leaned back in his chair with halfclosed eyes here was an undignified hiatus if not a finale to all his schemes to the even tenor of his selfrestrained purposeful life the west wind was rippling through the orchards which bordered the garden the muffled roar of the atlantic was in his ears a strange everlasting background to all the slighter summer sounds the murmuring of insects the calling of birds the melodious swish of the whirling knives in the distant hayfield wingrave was alone with his thoughts and he hated them  even mr pengarth was welcome mr pengarth very warm from his ride carrying his hat and a small black bag in his hand as he drew nearer he became hotter and was obliged to rest his bag upon the path and mop his forehead he was more afraid of his client than of anything else in the world  good afternoon sir wingrave he said i trust that you are feeling better today  wingrave eyed him coldly he did not reply to the inquiry as to his health  you have brought the deed he asked  certainly sir wingrave  the lawyer produced a roll of parchment from his bag in response to wingraves gesture he seated himself on the extreme edge of an adjacent seat  i do not propose to read all that stuff through wingrave remarked i take it for granted that the deed is made out according to my instructions  certainly sir wingrave  then we will go into the house and i will sign it  mr pengarth mopped his forehead once more it was a terrible thing to have a conscience  sir wingrave he said i apologize most humbly for what i am about to say but as the agent of your estates in this county and yourerlegal adviser with regard to them i am forced to ask you whether you are quite determined upon thismost unexampled piece of generosity tredowen has been in your mothers family for a great many years and although i must say that i have a great affection for this young lady i have also an old fashioned dislike to seeingerfamily property pass into the hands of strangers you might forgive memarry  wingrave smiled very faintly otherwise his face was inscrutable  i might he admitted calmly but i shall not do you consider me mr pengarth to be a person in possession of his usual faculties  oh most certainlymost certainly the lawyer declared emphatically  then please do not question my instructions any further so far as regards the pecuniary part of it i am a richer man than you have any idea of mr pengarth and for the restsentiment unfortunately does not appeal to me i choose to give the tredowen estates away to disappoint my next of kin that is how you may regard the transaction we will go into the house and complete this deed  wingrave rose slowly and walked with some difficulty up the gravel path he ignored however his companions timid offer of help and led the way to the library in a few minutes the document was signed and witnessed  i have ordered tea in the garden wingrave said as the two servants left the room that is unless you prefer any other sort of refreshment i dont know much about the cellars but there is some cabinet hock i believe  mr pengarth interposed  i am very much obliged he said but i will not intrude upon you further if you will allow me i will ring the bell for my trap  you will do nothing of the sort wingrave answered testily you will stay here and talk to me  i will stay with pleasure if you desire it the lawyer answered i had an idea that you preferred solitude  then you were wrong wingrave answered i hate being alone  they moved out together towards the garden tea was set out in a shady corner of the lawn  if you will forgive my remarking it mr pengarth said this seems rather an extraordinary place for you to come to if you really dislike solitude  i come to escape from an intolerable situation and because i was ill wingrave said  you might have brought friends the lawyer suggested  i have no friends wingrave answered  some of the people in the neighborhood would be very glad mr pengarth began  i do not wish to see them wingrave answered  mr pengarth took a peach and held his tongue wingrave broke the silence which followed a little abruptly  tell me mr pengarth he said do i look like a man likely to fail in anything he sets out to accomplish  the lawyer shook his head vigorously  you do not he declared  nor do i feel like one wingrave said and yet my record since i commenced shall i call it my second life is one of complete failure nothing that i planned have i been able to accomplish i look back through the months and through the years and i see not a single purpose carried out not a single scheme successful  not quite so bad as that i trust sir wingrave the lawyer protested  it is the precise truth wingrave affirmed drily i am losing confidence in myself  at least the lawyer declared you have been the salvation of our dear miss juliet if i may call her so but for you her life would have been ruined  precisely wingrave agreed but i forgot you dont understand i have saved her from heaven knows what i am going to give her the home she loves benevolence isnt it and yet if i had only the pluck i might succeed even nowso far as she is concerned  the lawyer took off his spectacles and rubbed them with his handkerchief he was thoroughly bewildered  i might succeed wingrave repeated leaning back in his chair if only  his face darkened it seemed to mr pengarth as he sipped his tea under the cool cedars drawing in all their wonderful perfume with every puff of breeze that he saw two men in the low invalids chair before him he saw the breath and desire of evil things struggling with some wonderful dream vainly seeking to realize itself  some of us the lawyer said timidly build our ideals too high up in the clouds so that to reach them is very difficult nevertheless the effort counts  wingrave laughed mockingly  it is not like that with me he declared my plans were made down in hell  god bless my soul the lawyer murmured but you are not serious sir wingrave  ay im serious enough wingrave answered do you suppose a man with the best pages of his life rooted out is likely to look out upon his fellows from the point of view of a philanthropist do you suppose that the man into whose soul the irons of bitterness have gnawed and eaten their way is likely to come out with a smirk and look around him for the opportunity of doing good rubbish my aim is to encourage suffering wherever i see it to create it where i can to make sinners and thieves of honest people  god bless my soul the lawyer gasped again i dont think you can beas bad as you think you are what about juliet lundy  fire flashed in wingraves eyes again at the mention of her name he seemed almost to lose control of himself it was several moments before he spoke he looked mr pengarth in the face and his tone was unusually deliberate  gifts he said are not always given in friendship life may easily become a more complicated affair for that child with the tredowen estates hanging round her neck and anyhow i disappoint my next of kin  morrison smoothfooted and silent appeared upon the lawn he addressed wingrave  a lady has arrived in a cab from truro sir he announced she wishes to see you as soon as convenient  a sudden light flashed across wingraves face dying out again almost immediately  who is she morrison he asked  the man glanced at mr pengarth  she did not give her name sir  mr pengarth and wingrave both rose the former at once made his adieux and took a short cut to the stables wingrave who leaned heavily upon his stick clutched morrison by the arm  who is it morrison he demanded  it is lady ruth barrington sir the man answered  alone  quite alone sir     for pitys sake  the library at tredowen was a room of irregular shape full of angles and recesses lined with bookcases it was in one of these standing motionless before a small marble statue of some forgotten greek poet that wingrave found his visitor she wore a plain serge traveling dress and the pallor of her face from which she had just lifted a voluminous veil matched almost in color the gleaming white marble upon which she was gazing but when she saw wingrave leaning upon his stick and regarding her with stern surprise strange lights seemed to flash in her eyes there was no longer any resemblance between the pallor of her cheeks and the pallor of the statue  lady ruth wingrave said quietly i do not understand what has procured for me the pleasure of this unexpected visit  she swayed a little towards him her head was thrown back all the silent passion of the inexpressible the hidden secondary forces of nature was blazing out of her eyes pleading with him in the broken music of her tone  you do not understand she repeated ah no but can i make you understand will you listen to me for once as a human being will you remember that you are a man and i a woman pleading for a little mercya little kindness  wingrave moved a step further back  permit me he said to offer you a chair  she sank into itspeechless for a moment wingrave stood over her leaning slightly against the corner of the bookcase  i trust he said that you will explain what all this means if it is my help which you require  her hands flashed out towards hima gesture almost of horror  dont she begged you know that it is not that you know very well that it is not why do you torture me  i can only ask you he said to explain  she commenced talking quickly her sentences came in little gasps  you wanted revengenot in the ordinary way you had brooded over it too long you understood too well once it was i who sought to revenge myself on you because you would not listen to me you hurt my pride everything that was evil in me rebelled  is this necessary he interrupted coldly i have never reproached you you chose the path of safety for yourself many another woman in your place would doubtless have done the same thing what i desire to know is why you are here in cornwall what has happened to make this journey seem necessary to you  listen she continued i want you to know how thoroughly you have succeeded before you came lumley and i were living together decently enough and as hundreds of others live with outside interests for our chief distraction you came a friend you were very subtle very skillful you never spoke a word of affection to me but you managed things so thatpeople talked you encouraged lumley to speculatenot in actual words perhaps but by suggestion then you lent me money lumley my husband let me borrow from you everyone knew that we were ruined everyone knew where the money came from that set us right so misery has been piled upon misery lumley has lost his self respect he is losing his ambition he is deteriorating every day ihow can i do anything else but despise him he let me his wife come to your rooms to borrow money from you do you think i can ever forget that do you think that he can dont you know that the memory of it is dragging us apart must keep us apart alwaysalways  wingrave leaned a little forward his hands were clasped upon the handle of his stick  all that you tell me he remarked coldly might equally well have been said in london i do not wish to seem inhospitable but i am still waiting to know why you have taken an eight hours journey to recite a few fairly obvious truths your relations with your husband frankly do not interest me the deductions which society may have drawn concerning our friendship need scarcely trouble you under the circumstances  then again the light was blazing in her eyes  under the circumstances she repeated i know what you mean it is true that you have asked for nothing it is true that all this time you have never spoken a single word which all the world might not hear you have never even touched my fingers except as a matter of formality once i was the woman you lovedand iwell you know is this part of your scheme of torture to play with me as though we were marionettes you and i with sawdust in our veins dull lifeless puppets well it is finishedyour vengeance you may reap the harvest when you will publish my letters prove yourself an injured man take a whip in your hand if you like and i will never flinch but for heavens sake remember that i am a woman i am willing to be your slave nurse you wait upon you follow you about what more can your vengeance need you have made me despise my husband you have made me hate my life with him you have forced me into a remembrance of what i have never really forgottenand oh wingrave she added opening her arms to him with a little sob if you send me away i think that i shall kill myself wingrave  there was a note of despair in her last cry her arms fell to her side wingrave was on his way to the further end of the room he rang the bell and turned towards her  listen he said calmly you will return to london tonight if ever i require you i shall send for youand you will come at present i do not you will return to your husband understand  yes she gasped but  he held out his hand morrison was at the door  morrison he said you will order the motor to be round in half an hour to take lady ruth to truro she has to catch the london express you will go with her yourself and see that she has a reserved carriage if by any chance you should miss the train order a special  very good sir  and tell the cook to send in tea and wine and some sandwiches in ten minutes  once more they were alone lady ruth rose slowly to her feet and trembling in every limb she walked down the room and fell on her knees before wingrave  wingrave she said i will go away i will do all that you tell me i will wear my chains bravely and hold my peace but before i go for heavens sake say a kind word look at me kindly kiss me hold my hands anything anything anything to prove to me that you are not a dead man i could bear unkindness reproaches abuse i can bear anything but this deadly coldness it is becoming a horror to me do wingravedo  she clasped his handhe drew it calmly away  lady ruth he said you have spoken the truth i am a dead man i have no affections i care neither for you nor for any living being all that goes to the glory and joy of life perished in that uncountable roll of days when the sun went out and inch by inch the wall rose which will divide me forever from you and all the world frankly it was not i who once loved you it was the man who died in prison his flesh and bones may have survivednothing else  she rose slowly to her feet her eyes seemed to be dilating  there is another woman she exclaimed softly her voice was like velvet but the agony in her face was unmistakable  there is no other woman he answered  she stood quite still  she is here with you now she cried who is it wingrave tell me the truth  the truth is already told he answered except my cook and her assistants there is not a woman in the house  again she listened she gave a little hoarse cry and wingrave started out in the hall a girls clear laugh rang like a note of music to their ears  you lie she cried fiercely you lie i will know who she is  suddenly the door was thrown open juliet stood there her hands full of roses her face flushed and brilliant with smiles  how delightful to find you here she exclaimed coming swiftly across to wingrave i do hope you wont mind my coming normandy is off and i have nowhere else to go  she saw lady ruth and stopped  oh i beg your pardon she exclaimed i did not know  this is lady ruth barrington wingrave said my ward miss juliet lundy  yourward lady ruth said gazing at her intently  juliet nodded  sir wingrave has been very kind to me since i was a child she said softly he has let me live here with mrs tresfarwin and i am afraid i sometimes forget that it is not really my home am i in the way she asked looking wistfully towards wingrave  by no means he exclaimed lady ruth is just going will you see that she has some tea or something  lady ruth laughed quietly  i think she said that it is i who am in the way i should love some tea if there is time but whatever happens i must not miss that train     a dream of paradise  it seemed to wingrave that the days which followed formed a sort of hiatus in his lifean interlude during which some other man in his place and in his image played the game of life to a longforgotten tune he moved through the hours as a man in a maze unrecognizable to himself half unconscious half heedless of the fact that the garments of his carefully cultivated antagonism to the world and to his fellows had slipped very easily from his unresisting shoulders the glory of a perfect english midsummer lay like a golden spell upon the land the moors were purple with heather touched here and there with the fire of the flaming gorse the wind blew always from the west the gardens were ablaze with slowly bursting rhododendrons every gleam of coloring every breath of perfume seemed to carry him unresistingly back to the days of his boyhood he fished once more in the trout streams he threw away his stick and tramped or rode with juliet across the moors at night time she sang or played with the windows open wingrave himself out of sight under the cedar trees whose perfume filled with aromatic sweetness the still night air piles of letters came every day which he left unopened upon his study table telegrams followed which he threw into the wastepaper basket juliet watched the accumulating heap with amazement  whatever do people write to you so much for she asked one morning watching the stream of letters flow out of the post bag  wingrave was silent for a moment her question brought a sudden and sharp sting of remembrance juliet knew him only as sir wingrave seton she knew nothing of mr wingrave millionaire  advertisements a good many of them he said i must send for aynesworth some day to go through them all  what fun she exclaimed do send for him he thinks that i am staying with miss pengarth and i havent written once since i got here  to wingrave it seemed that a chill had somehow stolen into the hot summer morning his feet were very nearly upon the earth again  i forgot he said that aynesworth wasa friend of yours he came and saw you often in london  she smiled reflectively  he has been very very kind she answered he was always that from the first time i saw you both do you remember it was down in the lower gardens  yes he answered i remember quite well  he was very kind to me then she continued and youwell i was frightened of you she stopped for a moment and laughed her eyes were full of amazed reminiscence you were so cold and severe i never could have dreamed that after all it was you who were going to be the dearest most generous friend i could ever have had do you know walteri mean mr aynesworthisnt very pleased with me just now  why not  he cannot understand why i will not tell him my guardians name i think it worries him  you would like to tell him wingrave asked  she nodded  i think so she answered  wingrave said no more but after breakfast he went to his study alone juliet found him there an hour later sitting idly in front of his table his great pile of correspondence was still untouched she came and sat on the edge of the table  what are we going to do this morning please she asked  wingrave glanced towards his letters  i am afraid he said that i must spend the day here  she looked at him blankly  not really she exclaimed i thought that we were going to walk to hanging tor  wingrave took up a handful of letters and let them fall through his fingers he had all the sensations of a man who is awakened from a dream of paradise to face the dull tortures of a dreary and eventless life his eyes were set in a fixed state an undernote of despair was in his tone  you know we arranged it yesterday she continued eagerly and if you are going to send for mr aynesworth you neednt bother about these letters yourself need you  he turned and regarded her deliberately her forehead was wrinkled a little with disappointment her brown eyes were filled with the soft light of confident appeal tall and elegantly slim there was yet something in the graceful lines of her figure which reminded him forcibly that the days of her womanhood had indeed arrived  she wore a plain white cambric dress and a simple but much beflowered hat the smaller details of her toilet all indicated the correct taste and instinctive coquetry of her french descent and she was beautiful wingrave regarded her critically and realized perhaps for the first time how beautiful her eyes were large and clear and her eyebrows delicately defined her mouth with its slightly humorous curl was a little large but wholly delightful the sun of the last few weeks had given to her skin a faint but most becoming duskiness under his close scrutiny a flush of color stole into her cheeks she laughed not altogether naturally  you look at me she said as though i were someone strange  i was looking he answered for the child the little blackfrocked child you know with the hair down her back and the tearful eyes i dont think i realized that she had vanished so completely  not more completely she declared gaily than the gloomy gentleman who frowned upon my existence and resented even my gratitude although she added leaning a little towards him i am very much afraid that i see some signs of a relapse today dont bother about those horrid letters let me tell mrs tresfarwin to pack us up some lunch and take me to hanging tor please  wingrave laughed a little unsteadily as he rose to his feet one day more then why not the end would be soon enough  sooner perhaps than even he imagined for that night aynesworth came pale and travelstained with all the volcanic evidences of a great passion blazing in his eyes quivering in his tone the day had passed to wingrave as a dream more beautiful even than any in the roll of its predecessors they sat together on low chairs upon the moonlit lawn in their ears the murmur of the sea upon their faces gathering strength with the darkness the night wind salt and fragrant with all the sweetness of dying flowers wingrave had never realized more completely what still seemed to him this wonderful gap in his life behind it all he had a subconsciousness that he was but taking a part in some mystical play yet with an abandon which when he stopped to think of it astonished him he gave himself up without effort or scruple to this most amazing interlude all day he had talked more than ever before the flush on his cheeks was like the flush of wine or the sun which had fired his blood as he had talked the more so had she grown the more silent she was sitting now with her hands clasped and her head thrown back looking up at the stars with unseeing eyes  you do not regret normandy then he asked  no she murmured i have been happy here i have been happier than i could ever have been in normandy  he turned and looked at her with curious intentness  my experience he said thoughtfully of young ladies of your age is somewhat limited but i should have thought that you would have found itlonely  perhaps i am different then she murmured i have never been lonely hereall my life  except he reminded her when i knew you first  ah but that was different she protested i had no home in those days and i was afraid of being sent away  it was in his mind then to tell her of the envelope with her name upon it in his study but a sudden rush of confusing thoughts kept him silent it was while he was laboring in the web of this tangled dream of wild but beautiful emotions that aynesworth came a pale tragic figure in his travelstained clothes and face furrowed with anxiety he stood over them almost before they were aware of his presence  walter she cried and sprang to her feet with extended hands wingraves face darkened and the shadow of evil crept into his suddenly altered expression it was an abrupt awakening this and he hated the man who had brought it about  aynesworth held the girls hands for a moment but his manner was sufficient evidence of the spirit in which he had come he drew a little breath and he looked from one to the other anxiously  is thisyour mysterious guardian juliet he asked hoarsely  she glanced at wingrave questioningly his expression was ominous and the light faded from her own face while she hesitated wingrave spoke  i imagine he said that the fact is fairly obvious what have you to say about it  a good deal aynesworth answered passionately juliet please go away i must speak to your guardianalone  again she looked at wingrave he pointed to the house  i think he said that you had better go  she hesitated something of the impending storm was already manifest aynesworth turned suddenly towards her  you shall not enter that house again juliet he declared stay in the gardens there and presently you shall know why     the awakening  wingrave had risen to his feet he was perfectly calm but there was a look on his face which juliet had never seen there before instinctively she drew a little away and aynesworth took his place between them  are you mad aynesworth wingrave asked coolly  not now aynesworth answered i have been mad to stay with you for four years to look on however passively at all the evil you have done ive had enough of it now and of you i came here to tell you so  a letter wingrave answered would have been equally efficacious however since you have told me  ill go when im ready aynesworth answered and ive more to say when i first entered your service and you told me what your outlook upon life was i never dreamed but that the years would make a man of you again i never believed that you could be such a brute as to carry out your threats i saw you do your best to corrupt a poor silly little woman who only escaped ruin by a miracle i saw you deal out what might have been irretrievable disaster to a young man just starting in life since your return to london you have done as little good and as much harm with your millions as any man could  wingrave was beginning to look bored  this is getting he remarked a little like melodrama i have no objection to being abused even in my own garden but there are limits to my patience come to the point if you have one  willingly aynesworth answered i want you to understand this i have never tried to interfere in any of your malicious schemes although i am ashamed to think i have watched them without protest but this one is different if you have harmed if you should ever dare to harm this child as sure as there is a god above us i will kill you  what is she to you wingrave asked calmly  shei love her aynesworth answered i mean her to be my wife  and she  she looks upon me as her greatest friend her natural protector and protect her i willeven against you  wingrave shrugged his shoulders  it seems to me he said that the young lady is very well off as she is she has lived in my house and been taken care of by my servants she has been relieved of all the material cares of life and she has been her own mistress i scarcely see how you my young friend could do better for her  aynesworth moved a step nearer to him the veins on his forehead were swollen his voice was hoarse with passion  why have you done this for her he demanded secretly too you a man to whom a good action is a matter for a sneer who have deliberately proclaimed yourself an evildoer by choice and destiny why have you constituted yourself her guardian not from kindness for you dont know what it is not from good nature for you havent any why then  wingrave shrugged his shoulders  i admit he remarked coolly that it does seem rather a problem we all do unaccountable things at times though  for your own sake aynesworth said fiercely i trust that this is one of the unaccountable things for the rest you shall have no other chance i shall take her to truro tonight  are you sure that she will go  i shall tell her the truth  and if she does not believe you  she will if you interfere i shall take her by force  i interfere wingrave remarked you need not be afraid of that the affair as it stands is far too interesting call her and make your appeal  i shall tell her the truth aynesworth declared  by all means i shall remain and listen to my indictment quite a novel sensation call the young lady by all means and dont spare me  aynesworth moved a few steps up the path he called to her softly and she came through the little iron gates from the rose gardens she was very pale and there was a gleam in her eyes which was like fear aynesworth took her by the hand and led her forward  you must be brave dear he whispered i am compelled to say some disagreeable things it is for your good it is because i care for you so much  she looked towards wingrave he was sitting upon the garden seat and his face was absolutely expressionless he spoke to her and his cold precise tone betrayed not the slightest sign of any emotion  aynesworth he remarked is going to tell you some interesting facts about myself please listen attentively as afterwards you will be called upon to make a somewhat important decision  she looked at him a little wistfully and sighed there was no trace any longer of her companion of the last few weeks it was the stern and gloomy stranger of her earlier recollections who sat there with folded arms  is it really necessary she asked  absolutely aynesworth answered hurriedly it wont take long but there are things which you must know  very well she answered i am listening  aynesworth inclined his head towards the place where wingrave sat  i will admit he said that the man there whom i have served for the last four years and more never deceived me as to his real character and intentions he had been badly treated by a woman and he told me plainly that he entered into life again at war with his fellows where he could see an opportunity of doing evil he meant to do it where he could bring misery and suffering upon anyone with whom he came into contact he meant to grasp the opportunity i listened to him but i never believed i told myself that it would be interesting to watch his life and to see the gradual inevitable humanizing of the man so i entered his service and have remained in it until today  he turned more directly towards juliet she was listening breathlessly to every word  juliet he said he has kept his word i have been by his side and i speak of the things i know he has sought no ones friendship who has not suffered for it there is not a man or woman living who owes him the acknowledgment of a single act of kindness i have seen him deliberately scheme to bring about the ruin of a harmless little woman i have seen him exact his pound of flesh even at the cost of ruin from a boy i tell you juliet of my own knowledge that he has neither heart nor conscience and that he glories in the evil that his hand finds to do even you must know something of his reputationhave heard something of his doings under the name he is best known by in londonmr wingrave millionaire  she started back as though in terror then she turned to wingrave who sat stonily silent  it isnt true she cried you are notthat man  he raised his eyes and looked at her it seemed to her that there was something almost satanic in the smile which alone disturbed the serenity of his face  certainly i am he answered when i returned from america it suited me to change my identity you must not doubt anything that mr aynesworth says i can assure you that he is a most truthful and conscientious young man i shall be able to give him a testimonial with a perfectly clear conscience  juliet shuddered as she turned away all the joy of life seemed to have gone from her face  you are mr wingravethe mr wingrave oh i cant believe it she broke off suddenly no one could have been so kind so generous as you have been to me  she looked from one to the other of the two men both were silent but whereas aynesworth had turned his head away wingraves position and attitude were unchanged she moved suddenly over towards him one hand fell almost caressingly upon his shoulder she looked eagerly into his face  tell methat it isnt all true she begged tell me that your kindness to me at least was realthat you did not mean it to be for my unhappiness afterwards please tell me that i think if you asked me if you cared to ask me that i could forgive everything else  every vice save one wingrave murmured nature has lavished upon me i am a poor liar it is perfectly true that my object in life has been exactly as aynesworth has stated it i may have been more or less successfulaynesworth can tell you that too as regards yourself  yes she exclaimed  i congratulate you upon your escape wingrave said aynesworth is right association of any sort with me is for your evil  she covered her face with her hands even his tone was different she felt that this man was a stranger and a stranger to be feared aynesworth came over to her side and drew her away  i have a cart outside he said i am going to take you to truro  wingrave heard the gate close after themhe heard the rumble of the cart in the road growing fainter and fainter he was alone now in the garden and the darkness was closing around him he staggered to his feet his face was back in its old set lines he was once more at war with the world     revenge isbitter  at no time during his career did wingrave appear before the public more prominently than during the next few months as london began to fill up again during the early part of october he gave many and magnificent entertainments his name figured in all the great social events he bought a mansion in park lane which had been built for royalty and the account of the treasures with which he filled it read like a chapter from some modern arabian nights in the city he was more hated and dreaded than ever his transactions huge and carefully thought out were for his own aggrandizement only and left always in their wake ruin and disaster for the less fortunate and weaker speculators he played for his own hand only the camaraderie of finance he ignored altogether in one other respect too he occupied a unique position amongst the financial magnates of the moment all appeals on behalf of charity he steadily ignored he gave nothing away his name never figured amongst the hospital lists suffering and disaster which drew their humble contributions from the struggling poor and middle classes left him unmoved and his check book unopened in an age when huge gifts on behalf of charity was the fashionable road to the peerage his attitude was all the more noticeable he would give a thousand pounds for a piece of sevres china which took his fancy he would not give a thousand farthings to ease the sufferings of his fellows yet there were few found to criticize him he was called original a crank there were even some who professed to see merit in his attitude to both criticism and praise he was alike indifferent with a cynicism with seemed only to become more bitter he pursued his undeviating and deliberate way  one morning he met lady ruth on the pavement in bond street she pointed to the vacant seat in her landau  get in please for a few minutes she said i want to talk to you i will take you where you like  they drove off in silence  you were not at the wavertons last night he remarked  no she answered quietly i was not asked  he glanced at her questioningly  i thought that you were so friendly he said  i was she answered lady waverton scarcely knows me now it is the beginning of the end i suppose  you are a little enigmatical this morning he declared  oh no you understand me very well she answered everybody knows that it is you who keep us going lumley has not got quite used to taking your money he has lost nearly all his ambition soon his day will have gone by people shrug their shoulders when they speak of us two years ago the wavertons were delighted to know me society seems big but it isnt there are no end of little sets one inside the other two years ago i was in the innermost today im getting towards the outside edge look at me do you see any change  he scrutinized her mercilessly in the cold morning light  you look older he said and you have begun to use rouge which is a pity  she laughed hardly  you think so well i dont want emily to see my hollow cheeksor you are you satisfied wingrave  i am afraid i dont understand he began  dont lie she interrupted curtly you do understand this is your vengeancevery subtle and very crafty everything has turned out exactly as you planned you have broken us wingrave i thought myself a clever woman but i might as well have tried to gamble with the angels why dont you finish it off nowmake me run away with you  it would bore us both he answered calmly besides you wouldnt come  i should and you know that i would she answered everyone expects it of us i think myself that it would be more decent  he looked at her thoughtfully  you are a strange woman he said i find it hard sometimes to understand you  then you are a fool she declared in a fierce little whisper you know what is underneath all my suffering all my broken pride you know that i was fool enough to keep the flame flickeringthat i have cared always and for no one else  he stopped the carriage  you are the most original woman i ever met he said quietly i neither wish to care nor be cared for by anyone go home to your husband and tell him to buy treadwells up to six  that same afternoon wingrave met aynesworth and cut him dead something in the younger mans appearance though perplexed him aynesworth certainly had not the air of a successful man he was pale carelessly dressed and apparently in ill health wingrave after an amount of hesitation which was rare with him turned his car towards battersea and found himself a few minutes later mounting the five flights of stone steps juliet herself opened the door to him she gave a little gasp when she saw who it was and did not immediately invite him to enter  i am sorry wingrave said coldly to inflict this visit upon you if you are alone and afraid to ask me in we can talk here  her cheeks became as flushed as a moment before they had been pale she looked at him reproachfully and standing on one side to let him pass closed the door behind him then she led the way into her sitting room  i am glad that you have come to see me she said wont you sit down  he ignored her invitation and stood looking around him there was a noticeable change in the little room there were no flowers some of the ornaments and the silver trifles from her table were missing the place seemed to have been swept bare of everything except the necessary furniture then he looked at her she was perceptibly thinner and there were black rings under her eyes  where is mrs tresfarwin he asked  in cornwall she answered  why  i could not afford to keep her here any longer  what are you doing for a livingpainting still  she shook her head a little piteously  they cant sell any more of my pictures she said i am trying to get a situation as governess or companion oranything  when did you have anything to eat last he asked  yesterday she answered and he was just in time to catch her she had fainted  he laid her upon the sofa poured some water over her face and fanned her with a newspaper his expression of cold indifference remained unmoved it was there in his face when she opened her eyes  are you well enough to walk he asked  quite thank you she answered i am so sorry  put on your hat he ordered  she disappeared for a few minutes and returned dressed for the street he drove her to a restaurant and ordered some dinner he made her drink some wine and while they waited he buried himself in a newspaper they ate their meal almost in silence afterwards wingrave asked her a question  where is aynesworth  looking for work i think she answered  why did you not stay down in cornwall  miss pengarth was awayand i preferred to return to london she told him quietly  when are you going to marry aynesworth he asked  she looked down into her glass and was silent he leaned a little towards her  perhaps he remarked quietly you are already married  still she was silent he saw the tears forced back from her eyes he heard the sob break in her throat yet he said nothing he only waited at last she spoke  nothing is settled yet she said still without looking at him  i see no reason he said calmly why until that time you should refuse to accept your allowance from mr pengarth  i cannot take any more of your money she answered it was a mistake from the first but i was foolish i did not understand  his lip curled with scorn  you are one of those he said who as a child were wise but as a young woman with a little knowledge becomea prig what harm is my money likely to do you i may be the devil himself but my gold is not tainted for the rest granted that i am at war with the world i do not number children amongst my enemies  she raised her eyes then and looked him in the face  i am not afraid of you she declared it is not that but i have been dependent long enough i will keep myselfor starve  he shrugged his shoulders and paid the bill  my man he said will take you wherever you like i have a call to make close here  they stood upon the pavement she held out her hand a little timidly her eyes were soft and wistful  goodbye guardian she said thank you very much for my lunch  ah he said gravely if you would let me always call myself that  she got into the car without a word wingrave walked straight back to his own house several people were waiting in the entrance hall and the visitors book was open upon the porters desk he walked through looking neither to the right nor the left crossed the great library with its curved roof its floor of cedar wood and its wonderful stainedglass windows and entered a smaller room beyondhis absolute and impenetrable sanctum he rang the bell for his servant  morrison he said if you allow me to be disturbed by any living person on any pretense whatever until i ring you lose your place do you understand  perfectly sir  wingrave locked the door the next hour belonged to himself alone  when at last he rang the bell he gave morrison a note  this is to be delivered at once he said  the man bowed and withdrew wingrave with his hands behind him strolled out into the library in a remote corner a small spectacled person was busy writing at a table wingrave crossed the room and stood before him  are you my librarian he asked  the man rose at once  certainly sir he answered my name is woodall you may have forgotten it i am at work now upon a new catalogue  wingrave nodded  i have a quarto shakespeare i think he said that i marked at sothebys also a manuscript thomas a kempis and a first edition of herrick i should like to see them  by all means the man answered hurrying to the shelves you have also a wonderful rare collection of manuscripts purchased from the abbey st jouvain and a unique horace if you will permit me  wingrave spent half an hour examining his treasures leaving his attendant astonished  a millionaire who understands he exclaimed softly as he resumed his seat miraculous  wingrave passed into the hall and summoned his major domo  show me the ballroom he ordered and the winter garden  the little man in quiet black clotheswingrave abhorred liveriesled him respectfully through rooms probably unequaled for magnificence in england he spoke of the exquisite work of french and italian artists with a gesture almost of reverence he pointed out the carving in the wonderful white ballroom  wingrave listened and watched with immovable face just as they had completed their tour morrison approached  mr lumley and lady ruth barrington are in the library sir he announced  wingrave nodded  i am coming at once he said     the way of peace  they awaited his coming in varying moods barrington was irritable and restless lady ruth gave no signs of any emotion whatever she had the air of a woman who had no longer fear or hope only her eyes were a little weary  barrington was walking up and down the room his hands in his pockets his eyes fixed upon his wife every now and then he glanced nervously towards her  of course he said if he wants a settlementwell theres an end of all things and i dont see why he shouldnt he hasnt lent money out of friendship he hates mealways has done and sometimes i wonder whether he doesnt hate you too  lady ruth shivered a little her husbands words came to her with peculiar brutality it was as though he were blaming her for not having proved more attractive to the man who held them in the hollow of his hand  doesnt it strike you she murmured that a discussion like this is scarcely in the best possible taste we cannot surmise what he wantswhat he is going to do let us wait  the door opened and wingrave entered to barrington who greeted him with nervous cordiality he presented the same cold impenetrable appearance lady ruth with quicker perceptions noticed at once the change she sat up in her chair eagerly it was what she had prayed for thisbut was it for good or evil her eyes sought his eagerly so much depended upon his first few words  wingrave closed the door behind him his greetings were laconic as usual he addressed lady ruth  i find myself obliged he said to take a journey which may possibly be a somewhat protracted one i wished before i left to see you and your husband i sent for you together but i wish to speak to you separatelyto your husband first you have often expressed a desire to see over my house lady ruth my major domo is outside will you forgive me if i send you away for a few minutes  lady ruth rose slowly to her feet  how long do you wish me to keep away she asked calmly  a few minutes only he answered you will find me here when parkinson has shown you round  he held the door open and she passed out with a single upward and wondering glance wingrave closed the door and seated himself close to where barrington was standing  barrington he said twenty years ago we were friends since then we have been enemies today so far as i am concerned we are neither  barrington started a little his lips twitched nervously he did not quite understand  i am sure wingrave he began  wingrave interrupted him ruthlessly  i give you credit he continued for understanding that my attitude towards you since ierreappeared has been inimical i intended you to speculate and you did speculate i meant you to lose and you have lost the money i lent to your wife was meant to remain a rope around your neck the fact that i lent it to her was intended to humiliate you the attentions which i purposely paid to her in public were intended to convey a false impression to societyand in this too i fancy that i have been successful  barrington drew a thick breaththe dull color was mounting to his cheeks  wingrave continued calmly  i had possibly in my mind at one time he said the idea of drawing things on to a climaxof witnessing the final disappearance of yourself and your wife from the worldsuch as we know it i have however ceased to derive amusement or satisfaction from pursuing what we may call my vengeance consequently it is finished  the light of hope leaped into barringtons dull eyes but he recognized wingraves desire for silence  a few feet to your left upon my writing table wingrave continued you will find an envelope addressed to yourself it contains a discharge in full for the money i have lent you i have also ventured to place to your credit at your own bank a sum sufficient to give you a fresh start when you return to cadogan square or at least this evening you will receive a communication from the prime minister inviting you to become one of the international board of arbitration on the alaskan question the position as you know is a distinguished one and if you should be successful your future career should be assured  barrington broke down he covered his face with his hands great sobs shook him wingrave waited for a few minutes and then rose to his feet  barrington he said there is one thing more what the world may say or think counts for very little society reverses its own judgments and eats its own words every day a little success will bring it to your feet like a whipped dog it is for yourself i say this for yourself alone there is no reason why you should hesitate to accept any service i may be able to render you you understand me  barringtons face was like the face of a young man all the cloud of suspicion and doubts and fears was suddenly lifted he looked through new eyes on to a new world  thank god he exclaimed not that i ever doubted it wingrave butthank god  barrington left the house radiantlady ruth and wingrave were alone she watched him close the door and turn towards her with a new timidity the color came and went in her pale cheeks her eyes were no longer tired when he turned towards her she leaned to him with a little seductive movement of her body her hands stole out towards him  wingrave she murmured  his first action seemed to crush all the desperate joy which was rising fast in her heart he took one hand and he led her to a chair  ruth he said i have been talking to your husband there are only a few words i want to say to you  there are only three i want to hear from you she murmured and her eyes were pleading with him passionately all the time it seems to me that i have been waiting to hear them all my life wingrave i am so tiredand i am losingi want to leave it all  exactly he answered cheerfully what you are going to do you are going to america with your husband  what do you mean she asked sharply  he shrugged his shoulders  i am rather tired of the game he said that is all i am like the child who likes to build up again the house of bricks which he has thrown down i have procured for your husband a seat on the alaskan board it is a very distinguished position and you will find that it will entail considerable social obligations in america when you return he will be able to claim a judgeship or a place in the government you will find things go smoothly enough then  but you she cried i want you  he looked at her gravely  dear lady ruth he said you may think so at this moment but you are very much mistaken what you really desire is a complete reconciliation with your husband and a place in the great world which no one shall be able to question these things are arranged for you alsothese  he handed her a little packet she dropped it idly into her lap she was looking steadfastly away from them  you are free from me now he continued you will find life run quite smoothly and i do not think that you will be troubled with me when you come back from america i have other plans  there was a slave she murmured who grew to love her gaoler and when they came to set her free and take her back to her own peopleshe prayed only to be left in her cell freedom for her meant a broken heart  but that was fiction he answered for you freedom will mean other things there is work for you to do honorable work you must fan the flame of your husbands ambition you must see that he does justice to his great opportunities you have your own battle to fight with society but you have the winning cards for before you go you and your husband will be received as guestswell by the one person whose decision is absolute  she looked at him in amazement  my word of honor he said quietly was enough for lord marendon you will find things go smoothly with you  you are wonderful she gasped butyouyou spoke of going away  i am going to travel he said quietly rather a long journey i have lived three lives i am going to try a fourth  alone she asked  quite alone he answered  tell me where you are going she begged  i cannot do that he answered it is my secret  she rose to her feet she was very pale she stood in front of him and she laid her hands upon his shoulders  wingrave she said i will obey i will live the life you have shown me and i will live it successfully but i will know this who is it that has succeeded where i have failed  i do not understand you he answered  you do she declared and i will know for years you have been a man with a shell upon your heart every good impulse every kind thought seemed withered up you were absolutely cold absolutely passionless i have worn myself out trying to call you back to your own to set the blood flowing once more in your veins to break for one moment the barriers which you had set up against nature herself some day i felt that it must comeand it has who has done it wingrave it is notemily  emily he exclaimed i have not seen her for months she has no interest for meshe never had  then tell me who it is  nature unaided he answered carelessly human intervention was not necessary it was the swing of the pendulum ruth the eternal law which mocks our craving for content i had no sooner succeeded in my new capacitythan the old man crept out  but nature has her weapons always she protested wingrave was it the child  he touched the electric bell taking her hands he bent down and kissed them  dear lady he said goodbyegood fortune conquer new worlds and rememberwhite is your color and paquin your one modiste morrison lady barringtons carriage     love shall make all things new  mr pengarth was loth to depart he felt that all pretext for lingering was gone that he had outstayed his welcome yet he found himself desperately striving for some excuse to prolong an interview which was to all effects and purposes concluded  i will do my best sir wingrave he said reverting to the subject of their interview to study miss lundys interests in every way i will also see that she has the letter you have left for her within eight days from now but if you could see you way to leave some sort of address so that i should have a chance of communicating with you if necessary i should assume my responsibilities with a lighter heart  wingrave gave vent to a little gesture of annoyance  my dear sir he said surely i have been explicit enough i have told you that within a week from now i shall be practically dead i shall never return to englandyou will never see me again i have given life here a fair trial and found it a failure i am going to make a new experimentand it is going to be in an unexplored country you could not reach me there through the post you i think would scarcely care to follow me let it go at that  mr pengarth took up his bag with a sigh  sir wingrave he said i am a simple man and life with me has always been a very simple affair i recognize the fact of course that i am not in a position to judge or to understand the mental attitude of one who like yourself has suffered and passed through great crises but i cannot help wishing that you could find it possible to try for a time the quiet life of a countryman in this beautiful home of yours  wingrave shrugged his shoulders  mr pengarth he said no two men are born alike into this world some are blessed with a contented mind some are wanderers by destiny you will forgive me if i do not discuss the matter with you more fully my journey wherever and whatever it is is inevitable  mr pengarth was braver than he had ever been in his life  sir wingrave he said there is one journey which we must all take in gods good time but the man who starts before he is called finds no welcome at the end the greatest in life are those who are content to wait  i am not in the least disposed to doubt it mr pengarth wingrave said calmly now i must really send you away  so mr pengarth went but wingrave was not long destined to remain in solitude there was a sound of voices in the hall morrisons protesting another insistent then the door opened and wingrave looked up with darkening face which did not lighten when he recognized the intruder  aynesworth he exclaimed what are you doing here what do you want with me  five minutes aynesworth answered and i mean to have it you may as well tell your man to take his hand off my shoulder  wingrave nodded to morrison  you can go he said come back when i ring  they were alone aynesworth threw down his hat and crossed the room until he was within a few feet of wingrave  well sir  aynesworth laughed a little unnaturally  i had to come he said it is humiliating but the discipline is good for me i was determined to come and see once more the man who has made an utter and complete fool of me  wingrave eyed him coldly  if you would be good enough to explain he began  oh yes ill explain aynesworth answered i engaged myself to you as secretary didnt i and i told you the reason at the time i wanted to make a study of you i wanted to trace the effect of your long period of isolation upon your subsequent actions i entered upon my dutieshow you must have smiled at me behind my back never was a man more completely and absolutely deceived i lived with you was always by your side i was there professedly to study your actions and the method of them and yet you found it a perfectly simple matter to hoodwink me whenever you chose  in what respect wingrave asked calmly  every respect aynesworth answered let me tell you two things which happened to me yesterday i met a young new york stockbroker named nesbitt in london and in common with all london i suppose by this time i learnt the secret of all those anonymous contributions to the hospitals and other charitable causes during the last year  go on wingrave said  i have come here on purpose to tell you what i think you are aynesworth said you are the greatest hypocrite unhanged you affect to hate your fellows and to love evildoers you deceived the whole world and you deceived me i know you now for what you are you conceived your evil plans but when the time came for carrying them out you funked it every time you had that silly little woman on the steamer in your power and you yourself behind your own back released her with that marconigram to her husband sent by yourself you brought the boy nesbitt face to face with ruin and to his face you offered him no mercy behind his back you employ a lawyer to advance him your own money to pay your own debt you decline to give a single penny away in charity and as stealthily as possible you give away in one year greater sums than any other man has ever parted with you decline to help the poor little orphan child of the village organist and secretly you have her brought up in your own home and stop the sale of your pictures for the sake of the child whom you had only once contemptuously addressed can you deny any one of these things  no wingrave answered quietly i cannot  and i thought you a strong man aynesworth continued aggrieved and contemptuous i nearly went mad with fear when i heard that it was you who were the selfappointed guardian of juliet lundy i looked upon this as one more the most diabolical of all your schemes  wingrave rose to his feet still and grave  aynesworth he said this interview does not interest me let us bring it to an end i admit that i have made a great failure of my life i admit that i have failed in realizing the ambitions i once confided to you i came out from prison with precisely those intentions and i was conscious of nothing in myself or my nature to prevent my carrying them out it seems that i was mistaken i admit all this but i do not admit your right to force yourself into my presence and taunt me with my failure you served me well enough but you were easily hoodwinked and our connection is at an end i have only one thing to say to you i am leaving this part of the world altogether i shall not return that child has some foolish scruples about taking any more of my money that arises through your confounded interference she is poor almost in want if you should fail her now  aynesworth interrupted with a hoarse little laugh  wingrave he said are you playing the simpleton if juliet will not take your money why should she take mine  wingrave came out from his place he was standing now between aynesworth and the door  aynesworth he said do i understand that you are not going to marry the child  i certainly not aynesworth answered  wingrave remained quite calm but there was a terrible light in his eyes  now for the first time aynesworth he said i am glad that you are here we are going to have a complete understanding before you leave this room juliet lundy as my ward was i believe contented and happy it suited you to disturb our relations and your excuse for doing so was that you loved her you took her away from me and now you say that you do not intend to marry her be so good as to tell me what the devil you do mean  aynesworth laughed a little bitterly  you must excuse me he said but a sense of humor was always my undoing and this reversal of our positions is a little odd isnt it i am not going to marry juliet lundy because she happens not to care for me in that way at all my appearance is scarcely that of a joyous lover is it  wingrave eyed him more closely aynesworth had certainly fallen away from the trim and carefully turned out young man of a few months back he was paler too and looked older  i do not understand this wingrave said  i do aynesworth answered bitterly there is someone else  someone whom i do not know about wingrave said frowning heavily who is he aynesworth  aynesworth shrugged his shoulders he said nothing wingrave came a step nearer to him  you may as well tell me he said quietly for i shall postpone my journey until i know the whole truth  it is not my secret aynesworth answered ask her yourself  very well wingrave declared i will i shall return to london tonight  it is not necessary aynesworth remarked  wingrave started  you mean that she is here he exclaimed  aynesworth drew him towards the window  come he said you shall ask her now  wingrave hesitated for a moment an odd nervousness seemed to have taken possession of him  i do not understand this aynesworth he said why is she here  go and ask her your question aynesworth said perhaps you will understand then  wingrave went down the path which led to the walled garden and the sea the tall hollyhocks brushed against his knees the air as mild as springtime was fragrant with the perfume of late roses wingrave took no note of these things once more he seemed to see coming up the path the little blackfrocked child with the pale face and the great sad eyes it was she indeed who rose so swiftly from the hidden seat then wingrave stopped short for he felt stirring within him all the long repressed madness of his unlived manhood it was the weakness against which he had fought so long and so wearily triumphant now so that his heart beat like a boys and the color flamed into his cheeks and all the time she was coming nearer and he saw that the child had become a woman and it seemed to him that all the joy of life was alight in her face and the one mysterious and wonderful secret of her sex was shining softly out of her eager eyes so that after all when they met wingrave asked her no questions she came into his arms with all the graceful and perfect naturalness of a child who has wandered a little away from home  i am too old for you dear he said presently as they wandered about the garden much too old  age she answered softly what is that what have we to do with the years that are past it is the years to come only which we need consider and to think of them makes me almost tremble with happiness you are much too rich and too wonderful a personage for a homeless orphan like me but she added tucking her arm through his with a contented little sigh i have you and i shall not let you go
