36351038	scenes and characters or eighteen months at beechcroft     preface    of those who are invited to pay a visit to beechcroft there are some who honestly acknowledging that amusement is their object will be content to feel with lilias conjecture with jane and get into scrapes with phyllis without troubling themselves to extract any moral from their proceedings and to these the mohun family would only apologise for having led a very humdrum life during the eighteen months spent in their company  there may however be more unreasonable visitors who professing only to come as parents and guardians expect entertainment for themselves as well as instruction for those who had rather it was out of sightlook for antiques in carved cherrystonesand require plot incident and catastrophe in a chronicle of small beer  to these the mohuns beg respectfully to observe that they hope their examples may not be altogether devoid of indirect instruction and lest it should be supposed that they lived without object aim or principle they would observe that the maxim which has influenced the delineation of the different scenes and characters is that feeling unguided and unrestrained soon becomes mere selfishness while the simple endeavour to fulfil each immediate claim of duty may lead to the highest acts of selfdevotion  new court beechcroft 18th january    preface 1886    perhaps this book is an instance to be adduced in support of the advice i have often given to young authorsnot to print before they themselves are old enough to do justice to their freshest ideas  not that i can lay claim to its being a production of tender and interesting youth  it was my second actual publication and i believe i was of age before it appearedbut i see now the failures that more experience might have enabled me to avoid and i would not again have given it to the world if the same characters recurring in another story had not excited a certain desire to see their first start  in fact they have been more or less my lifelong companions  an almost solitary child with periodical visits to the elysium of a large family it was natural to dream of other children and their ways and sports till they became almost realities  they took shape when my french master set me to write letters for him  the letters gradually became conversation and narrative and the adventures of the family sweetened the toils of french composition  in the exigencies of village school building in those days gone by before in every place   it there behoved him to set up the standard of her grace   the tale was actually printed for private sale as a link between translations of short stories  this process only stifled the family in my imagination for a time they awoke once more with new names but substantially the same and were my companions in many a solitary walk the results of which were scribbled down in leisure moments to be poured into my mothers ever patient and sympathetic ears  and then came the impulse to literature for young people given by the example of that memorable book the fairy bower and followed up by amy herbert  it was felt that elder children needed something of a deeper tone than the edgeworthian style yet less directly religious than the sherwood class of books and on that wave of opinion my little craft floated out into the great sea of the public  friends whose kindness astonished me and fills me with gratitude when i look back on it gave me seasonable criticism and pruning and finally launched me  my heroes and heroines had arranged themselves so as to work out a definite principle and this was enough for us all  childrens books had not been supposed to require a plot  miss edgeworths which i still continue to think gems in their own line are made chronicles or more truly illustrations of various truths worked out upon the same personages  moreover the skill of a jane austen or a mrs gaskell is required to produce a perfect plot without doing violence to the ordinary events of an everyday life it is all a matter of arrangement  mrs gaskell can make a perfect little plot out of a sick lad and a canary bird and another can do nothing with half a dozen murders and an explosion and of arranging my materials so as to build up a story i was quite incapable  it is still my great deficiency but in those days i did not even understand that the attempt was desirable  criticism was a more thorough thing in those times than it has since become through the multiplicity of books to be hurried over and it was often very useful as when it taught that such arrangement of incident was the means of developing the leading idea  yet with all its faults the children who had been real to me caught chiefly by the youthful sense of fun and enjoyment the attention of other children and the curious semibelief one has in the phantoms of ones brain made me dwell on their after life and share my discoveries with my friends not however writing them down till after the lapse of all these years the tenderness inspired by associations of early days led to taking up once more the old characters in the two sides of the shield and the kind welcome this has met with has led to the resuscitation of the crude and inexperienced tale which never pretended to be more than a mere family chronicle  c m yonge 6th october 1886    chapter ithe elder sister    return and in the daily round   of duty and of love thou best wilt find that patient faith   that lifts the soul above  eleanor mohun was the eldest child of a gentleman of old family and good property who had married the sister of his friend and neighbour the marquis of rotherwood  the first years of her life were marked by few events  she was a quiet steady useful girl finding her chief pleasure in nursing and teaching her brothers and sisters and her chief annoyance in her mammas attempts to make her a fine lady but before she had reached her nineteenth year she had learnt to know real anxiety and sorrow  her mother after suffering much from grief at the loss of her two brothers fell into so alarming a state of health that her husband was obliged immediately to hurry her away to italy leaving the younger children under the care of a governess and the elder boys at school while eleanor alone accompanied them  their absence lasted nearly three years and during the last winter an engagement commenced between eleanor and mr francis hawkesworth rather to the surprise of lady emily who wondered that he had been able to discover the real worth veiled beneath a formal and retiring manner and to admire features which though regular had a want of light and animation which diminished their beauty even more than the thinness and compression of the lips and the very pale gray of the eyes  the family were about to return to england where the marriage was to take place when lady emily was attacked with a sudden illness which her weakened frame was unable to resist and in a very few days she died leaving the little adeline about eight months old to accompany her father and sister on their melancholy journey homewards  this loss made a great change in the views of eleanor who as she considered the cares and annoyances which would fall on her father when left to bear the whole burthen of the management of the children and household felt it was her duty to give up her own prospects of happiness and to remain at home  how could she leave the tender little ones to the care of servantstrust her sisters to a governess and make her brothers home yet more dreary  she knew her father to be strong in sense and firm in judgment but indolent indulgent and inattentive to details and she could not bear to leave him to be harassed by the petty cares of a numerous family especially when broken in spirits and weighed down with sorrow  she thought her duty was plain and accordingly she wrote to mr hawkesworth to beg him to allow her to withdraw her promise  her brother henry was the only person who knew what she had done and he alone perceived something of tremulousness about her in the midst of the even cheerfulness with which she had from the first supported her fathers spirits  mr mohun however did not long remain in ignorance for frank hawkesworth himself arrived at beechcroft to plead his cause with eleanor  he knew her value too well to give her up and mr mohun would not hear of her making such a sacrifice for his sake  but eleanor was also firm and after weeks of unhappiness and uncertainty it was at length arranged that she should remain at home till emily was old enough to take her place and that frank should then return from india and claim his bride  well did she discharge the duties which she had undertaken she kept her fathers mind at ease followed out his views managed the boys with discretion and gentleness and made her sisters wellinformed and accomplished girls but for want of fully understanding the characters of her two next sisters emily and lilias she made some mistakes with regard to them  the clouds of sorrow to her so dark and heavy had been to them but morning mists and the four years which had changed her from a happy girl into a thoughtful anxious woman had brought them to an age which if it is full of the follies of childhood also partakes of the earnestness of youth an age when deep foundations of enduring confidence may be laid by one who can enter into and direct the deeper flow of mind and feeling which lurks hid beneath the freaks and fancies of the early years of girlhood but eleanor had little sympathy for freaks and fancies  she knew the realities of life too well to build airy castles with younger and gayer spirits her sisters romance seemed to her dangerous folly and their lively nonsense levity and frivolity  they were too childish to share in her confidence and she was too busy and too much preoccupied to have ear or mind for visionary trifles though to trifles of real life she paid no small degree of attention  it might have been otherwise had henry mohun lived but in the midst of the affection of all who knew him honour from those who could appreciate his noble character and triumphs gained by his uncommon talents he was cut off by a short illness when not quite nineteen a most grievous loss to his family and above all to eleanor unlike her as he was joyous highspirited full of fun and overflowing with imagination and poetry there was a very close bond of union between them in the strong sense of duty the firmness of purpose and energy of mind which both possessed and which made eleanor feel perfect reliance on him and look up to him with earnest admiration  with him alone she was unreserved he was the only person who could ever make her show a spark of liveliness and on his death it was only with the most painful efforts that she could maintain her composed demeanour and fulfil her daily duties  years passed on and still she felt the blank which harry had left almost as much as the first day that she heard of his death but she never spoke of him and to her sisters it seemed as if he was forgotten the reserve which had begun to thaw under his influence again returning placed her a still greater distance from the younger girls and unconsciously she became still more of a governess and less of a sister  little did she know of the blissful dreams in secret shared between emily lilias and their brother claude and little did she perceive the danger that lilias would be run away with by a lively imagination repressed and starved but entirely untrained  whatever influenced lilias had through her nearly the same effect upon emily a gentle girl easily led especially by lilias whom she regarded with the fondest affection and admiration  the perils of fancy and romance were not however to be dreaded for jane the fourth sister a strong resemblance of eleanor in her clear common sense love of neatness and active usefulness but there were other dangers for her in her tendency to faults which under wise training had not yet developed themselves  such were the three girls who were now left to assist each other in the management of the household and who looked forward to their new offices with the various sensations of pleasure anxiety self importance and selfmistrust suited to their differing characters and to the ages of eighteen sixteen and fourteen    chapter iithe new court    just at the age twixt boy and youth when thought is speech and speech is truth  the longdelayed wedding took place on the 13th of january 1845 and the bride and bridegroom immediately departed for a years visit among mr hawkesworths relations in northumberland whence they were to return to beechcroft merely for a farewell before sailing for india  it was halfpast nine in the evening and the wedding overmr and mrs hawkesworth gone and the guests departed the drawingroom had returned to its usual state  it was a very large room so spacious that it would have been waste and desolate had it not been well filled with handsome but heavy oldfashioned furniture covered with crimson damask and one side of the room fitted up with a bookcase so high that there was a spiral flight of library steps to give access to the upper shelves  opposite were four large windows now hidden by their ample curtains and near them was at one end of the room a piano at the other a drawingdesk  the walls were wainscoted with polished black oak the panels reflecting the red firelight like mirrors  over the chimneypiece hung a portrait by vandyke of a pale dark cavalier of noble mien and with arched eyebrows called by lilias in defiance of dates by the name of sir maurice de mohun the hero of the family and allowed by every one to be a striking likeness of claude the youth who at that moment lay extending a somewhat superfluous length of limb upon the sofa which was placed commodiously at right angles to the fire  the other side of the fire was mr mohuns special domain and there he sat at his writingtable abstracted by deafness and letter writing from the various sounds of mirth and nonsense which proceeded from the party round the long narrow sofa table which they had drawn across the front of the fire leaving the large round centre table in darkness and oblivion  this party had within the last half hour been somewhat thinned the three younger girls had gone to bed the rector of beechcroft mr robert devereux had been called home to attend some parish business and there remained emily and liliastall graceful girls with soft hazel eyes clear dark complexions and a quantity of long brown curls  the latter was busily completing a guard for the watch which mr hawkesworth had presented to reginald a fine handsome boy of eleven who with his elbows on the table sat contemplating her progress and sometimes teasing his brother maurice who was earnestly engaged in constructing a model with some cards which he had pilfered from the heap before emily  she was putting her sisters wedding cards into their shining envelopes and directing them in readiness for the post the next morning while they were sealed by a youth of the same age as claude a small slim figure with light complexion and hair and dark gray eyes full of brightness and vivacity  he was standing so as to be more on a level with the high candle and as emilys writing was not quite so rapid as his sealing he amused himself in the intervals with burning his own fingers by twisting the wax into odd shapes  why do you not seal up his eyes inquired reginald with an arch glance towards his brother on the sofa  do it yourself you rogue was the answer at the same time approaching with the hot sealingwax in his handa demonstration which occasioned claude to open his eyes very wide without giving himself any further trouble about the matter  eh said he now they try to look innocent as if no one could hear them plotting mischief  them it was notredgie thereyoung ladiesi appealwas not i as innocentwas the very rapid incoherent and indistinct answer  after so lucid and connected a justification no more can be said replied claude in a kind of leave me leave me to repose tone which occasioned lilias to say i am afraid you are very tired  tired what has he done to tire him  i am sure a wedding is a terrible wear of spirits said emily such excitement  wellwhen i give a spectacle to the family next year i mean to tire you to some purpose  eh said mr mohun looking up is rotherwoods wedding to be the next  you ought to understand uncle said lord rotherwood making two stops towards him and speaking a little more clearly i thought you longed to get rid of your nephew and his concerns  you idle boy returned mr mohun you do not mean to have the impertinence to come of age next year  as much as having been born on the 30th of july 1825 can make me  but what good will your coming of age do us said lilias you will be in london or brighton or some such stupid place  do not be senseless lily returned her cousin  devereux castle is to be in splendourhetherington in amazementthe countys hair shall stand on endilluminations bonfires feasts balls colours flying bands playing tenants dining fireworks  hurrah jolly jolly shouted reginald dancing on the ottoman and mind there are lots of squibs  and that master reginald mohun has a new cap and bells for the occasion said lord rotherwood  let me make some fireworks said maurice  you will begin like a noble baron of the hospitable olden time said lily  it will be like the old days when every birthday of yours was a happy day for the people at hetherington said emily  ah those were happy old days said lord rotherwood in a graver tone  these are happy days are not they said lily smiling  her cousin answered with a sigh yes but you do not remember the old ones lily then after a pause he added it was a grievous mistake to shut up the castle all these years  we have lost sight of everybody  i do not even know what has become of the aylmers  they went to live in london said emily aunt robert used to write to them there  i know i know but where are they now  in london i should think said emily  some one said miss aylmer was gone out as a governess  indeed  i wish i could hear more  poor mr aylmer  he was the first man who tried to teach me latin  i wonder what has become of that mad fellow edward and devereux my fathers godson  was not mrs aylmer badly off  i cannot bear that people should be forgotten  it is not so very long that we have lost sight of them said emily  eight years said lord rotherwood  he died six weeks after my father  well  i have made my mother promise to come home  really said lilias she has been coming so often  ayebut she is coming this time  she is to spend the winter at the castle and make acquaintance with all the neighbourhood  his lordship is romancing said claude to lily in a confidential tone  ill punish you for suspecting me of talking hyperborean language hyperbolical i mean cried lord rotherwood ill make you dance the polka with all the beauty and fashion  then i shall stay at oxford till it is over said claude  you do not know what a treasure you will be said the marquis ladies like nothing so well as dancing with a fellow twice the height he should be  beware of putting me forward said claude rising and as he leant against the chimneypiece looking down from his height of six feet three with a patronising air upon his cousin i shall be taken for the hero and you for my little brother  i wish i was said lord rotherwood it would be much better fun i should escape the speechifying the worst part of it  yes said claude for one whose speeches will be scraps of three words each strung together with the burthen of the apprentices song radara tadara tandore  radaratade said the marquis laughing  by the bye if eleanor and frank hawkesworth manage well they may be here in time  because they are so devoted to gaiety said claude  you will say next that william is coming from canada on purpose  that tall captain said lord rotherwood  he used to be a very awful person  ah he used to keep the spoilt marquis in order said claude  to say nothing of the spoilt claude returned lord rotherwood  claude never was spoilt said lily  it was not eleanors way said emily  at least she cannot be accused of spoiling me said lord rotherwood  i shall never dare to write at that round table again her figure will occupy the chair like banquos ghost and wave me off with a knitting needle  ah that stain of ink was a worse blot on your character than on the new table cover said claude  she was rigidly impartial said lord rotherwood  no said claude she made exceptions in favour of ada and me  she left the spoiling of the rest to emily  and well emily will perform it  a pretty state you will be in by the 30th of july 1846 said lord rotherwood  why should not emily make as good a duenna as eleanor said lily  why should she not  she will notthat is all said the marquis such slow people you all are  you would all go to sleep if i did not sometimes rouse you up a littlegrow stagnant  not an elegant comparison said lilias besides you must remember that your hasty brawling streams do not reflect like tranquil lakes  one of lilys poetical hits i declare said lord rotherwood but she need not have taken offencei did not refer to heronly claude and emily and perhapsno i will not say who else  then rotherwood i will tell you what i amthe lily that derives all its support from the calm lake  well done lily worthy of yourself cried lord rotherwood laughing but you know i am always off when you talk poetry  i suspect it is time for us all to be off said claude did i not hear it strike the quarter  and tomorrow i shall be off in earnest said lord rotherwood half way to london before claude has given one turn to his sides and his shoulders and his heavy head  shall we see you at easter said emily  no i do not think you will  i am engaged to stay with somebody somewhere i forget the name of place and man besides grosvenor square is more tolerable then than at any other time of the year and i shall spend a fortnight with my mother and florence  it is after easter that you come to oxford is it not claude  yes my year of idleness will be over  and there is the baron looking at his watch  the baron was the title by which the young people were wont to distinguish mr mohun who as lily believed had a right to the title of baron of beechcroft  it was certain that he was the representative of a family which had been settled at beechcroft ever since the norman conquest and lily was very proud of the name of sir william de moune in the battle roll and of sir john among the first knights of the garter  her favourite was sir maurice who had held out beechcroft court for six weeks against the roundheads and had seen the greater part of the walls battered down  witnesses of the strength of the old castle yet remained in the massive walls and broad green ramparts which enclosed what was now orchard and farm yard and was called the old court while the dwellinghouse built by sir maurice after the restoration was named the new court  sir maurice had lost many an acre in the cause of king charles and his new mansion was better suited to the honest squires who succeeded him than to the mighty barons his ancestors  it was substantial and well built with a square gravelled court in front and great solid folding gates opening into a lane bordered with very tall well clipped holly hedges forming a polished green prickly wall  there was a little door in one of these gates which was scarcely ever shut from whence a wellworn path led to the porch where generally reposed a huge newfoundland dog guardian of the hoops and walkingsticks that occupied the corners  the front door was of heavy substantial oak studded with nails and never closed in the daytime and the hall wainscoted and floored with slippery oak had a noble open fireplace with a wood fire burning on the hearth  on the other side of the house was a terrace sloping down to a lawn and bowlinggreen hedged in by a formal row of evergreens  a noble planetree was in the middle of the lawn and beyond it a pond renowned for waterlilies  to the left was the kitchen garden terminating in an orchard planted on the ramparts and moat of the old court then came the farm buildings and beyond them a field sloping upwards to an extensive wood called beechcroft park  in the wood was the cottage of walter greenwood gamekeeper and woodman by hereditary succession but able and willing to turn his hand to anything and in fact as adeline once elegantly termed him the family tee totum  to the right of the house there was a field called long acre bounded on the other side by the turnpike road to raynham which led up the hill to the village green surrounded by wellkept cottages and gardens  the principal part of the village was however at the foot of the hill where the court lane crossed the road led to the old church the school and parsonage in its little garden shut in by thick yew hedges  beyond was the blacksmiths shop more cottages and mrs appletons wondrous village warehouse and the lane after passing by the handsome old farmhouse of mr harrington mr mohuns principal tenant led to a bridge across a clear trout stream the boundary of the parish of beechcroft    chapter iiithe new principle    and wilt thou show no more quoth he   than doth thy duty bind i well perceive thy love is small  on the sunday evening which followed eleanors wedding lilias was sitting next to emily and talking in very earnest tones which after a time occasioned claude to look up and say what is all this about something remarkably absurd i suspect  only a new principle said emily  new cried lily only what must be the feeling of every person of any warmth of character  now for it then said claude  no no claude i really mean it and lily sincerely thought she did  i will not tell you if you are going to laugh  that depends upon what your principle may chance to be said claude  what is it emily  she will be much obliged to you for telling  she only says she cannot bear people to do their duty and not to act from a feeling of love said emily  that is not fair returned lily all i say is that it is better that people should act upon love for its own sake than upon duty for its own sake  what comes in rhyme with lily said claude  dont be tiresome claude i really want you to understand me  wait till you understand yourself said the provoking brother and let me finish what i am reading  for about a quarter of an hour he was left in peace while lily was busily employed with a pencil and paper under the shadow of a book and at length laid before him the following verses   what is the source of gentleness the spring of human blessedness bringing the wounded spirit healing the comforts high of heaven revealing the lightener of each daily care the wing of hope the life of prayer the zest of joy the balm of sorrow bliss of today hope of tomorrow the glory of the suns bright beam the softness of the pale moon stream the flowrets grace the rivers voice the tune to which the birds rejoice without it vain each learned page cold and unfelt each council sage heavy and dull each human feature lifeless and wretched every creature in which alone the glory lies which value gives to sacrifice tis that which formed the whole creation which rests on every generation of paradise the only token just left us mid our treasures broken which never can from us be riven sure earnest of the joys of heaven and which when earth shall pass away shall be our rest on the last day when tongues shall fail and knowledge cease and throbbing hearts be all at peace when faith is sight and hope is sure that which alone shall still endure of earthly joys in heaven above tis that best gift eternal love   what have you there said mr mohun who had come towards them while claude was reading the lines  taking the paper from claudes hand he read it to himself and then saying tolerable lily there are some things to alter but you may easily make it passable he went on to his own place leaving lilias triumphant  well claude you see i have the great baron on my side  i am of the barons opinion said claude the only wonder is that you doubted it  you seemed to say that love was good for nothing  i said nothing but that lily has a rhyme  and saying that i was silly was equivalent to saying that love was nothing said lily  o lily i hope not said claude with a comical air  well i know i often am foolish but not in this said lily i do say that mere duty is not lovable  say it if you will then said claude yawning only let me finish this sermon  lily set herself to reconsider some of her lines  but presently emily left the room claude looked up and lily exclaimed now claude let us make a trial of it  well said claude yawning again and looking resigned  think how eleanor went on telling us of duty duty dutynever making allowancesnever relaxing her stiff rules about trifles never unbending from her duennalike dignitynever showing one spark of enthusiasmmaking great sacrifices but only because she thought them her dutybecause it was rightgood for herselfonly a higher kind of selfishnessnot because her feeling prompted her  certainly feeling does not usually prompt people to give up their lovers for the sake of their brothers and sisters  she did it because it was her duty said lily quite as if she did not care  i wonder whether frank thought so said claude  at any rate you will confess that emily is a much more engaging person said lily  certainly i had rather talk nonsense to her said claude  you feel it though you will not allow it said lily  now think of emilys sympathy and gentleness and sweet smile and tell me if she is not a complete personification of love  and then eleanor unpoeticalnever thrown off her balance by grief or joy with no ups and downsno enthusiasmno appreciation of the beautifulher highest praise very right and tell me if there can be a better image of duty  claude might have had some chance of bringing lily to her senses if he had allowed that there was some truth in what she had said but he thought the accusation so unjust in general that he would not agree to any part of it and only answered you have very strange views of duty and of eleanor  well replied lily i only ask you to watch emily and i are determined to act on the principle of love and you will see if her government is not more successful than that of duty  such was the principle upon which lily intended her sister to govern the household and to which emily listened without knowing what she meant much better than she did herself  emilys own views as far as she possessed any were to get on as smoothly as she could and make everybody pleased and happy without much trouble to herself and also to make the establishment look a little more as if a lady emily had lately been its mistress than had been the case in eleanors time  mr mohuns property was good but he wished to avoid unnecessary display and expense and he expected his daughters to follow out these views keeping a wise check upon emily by looking over her accounts every saturday and turning a deaf ear when she talked of the age of the drawingroom carpet and the ugliness of the old chariot  emily had a good deal on her hands requiring sense and activity but lilias and jane were now quite old enough to assist her  lily however thought fit to despise all household affairs and bestowed the chief of her attention on her own departmentthe village school and poor people and she was also much engrossed by her music and drawing her german and italian and her verse writing  claude had more power over her than any one else  he was a gentle amiable boy of high talent but disposed to indolence by ill health in most matters he was however victorious over this propensity which was chiefly visible in his love of easy chairs and his dislike of active sports which made him the especial companion of his sisters  a dangerous illness had occasioned his removal from eton and he had since been at home reading with his cousin mr devereux and sharing his sisters amusements  jane was in her own estimation an important member of the administration and in fact was emilys chief assistant and deputy she was very small and trimly made everything fitted her precisely and she had tiny dexterous fingers and active little feet on which she darted about noiselessly and swiftly as an arrow an oval brown face bright colour straight features and smooth dark hair bright sparkling black eyes a little mouth wearing an arch subdued smile very white teeth and altogether the air of a woman in miniature brisk bold and blitheever busy and ever restless she was generally known by the names of brownie and changeling which were not inappropriate to her active and prying disposition  excepting claude and emily the young party were early risers and lily especially had generally despatched a good deal of business before the eight oclock breakfast  at nine they went to church mr devereux having restored the custom of daily service and after this mr mohun attended to his multitudinous affairs claude went to the parsonageemily to the storeroom lily to the village the younger girls to the schoolroom where they were presently joined by emily  lily remained in her own room till one oclock when she joined the others in the schoolroom and they read aloud some book of history till two the hour of dinner for the younger and of luncheon for the elder  they then went out and on their return from evening service which began at halfpast four the little ones had their lessons to learn and the others were variously employed till dinner the time of which was rather uncertain but always late  the evening passed pleasantly and quickly away in reading work music and chatter  as emily had expected her first troubles were with phyllis called not the neat handed by her sisters master phyl by her brothers and miss tomboy by the maids  she seemed born to be a trial of patience to all concerned with her yet without many actual faults except giddiness restlessness and unrestrained spirits  in the drawingroom schoolroom and nursery she was continually in scrapes and so often reproved and repentant that her loud roaring fits of crying were amongst the ordinary noises of the new court  she was terribly awkward when under constraint or in learning any female accomplishment but swift and ready when at her ease and glorying in the boyish achievements of leaping ditches and climbing trees  her voice was rather highly pitched and she had an inveterate habit of saying ill tell you what at the beginning of all her speeches she was not tall but strong square firm and active she had a round merry face a broad forehead and large bright laughing eyes of a doubtful shade between gray and brown  her mouth was wide her nose turned up her complexion healthy but not rosy and her stiff straight brown hair was more apt to hang over her eyes than to remain in its proper place behind her ears  adeline was very different her fair and brilliant complexion her deep blue eyes and golden ringlets made her a very lovely little creature her quietness was a relief after her sisters boisterous merriment and her dislike of dirt and brambles continually contrasted with poor phylliss recklessness of such impediments  ada readily learnt lessons which cost phyllis and her teacher hours of toil ada worked deftly when phylliss stiff fingers never willingly touched a needle ada played with a doll drew on scraps of paper or put up dissected maps while phyllis was in mischief or in the way a book was the only chance of interesting her but very few books took her fancy enough to occupy her longthose few however she read over and over again and when unusual tranquillity reigned in the drawingroom she was sure to be found curled up at the top of the library steps reading one of three booksrobinson crusoe little jack or german popular tales  then emily blamed her ungraceful position jane laughed at her uniform taste and lily proposed some story about modern children such as phyllis never could like and the constant speech was repeated only look at ada till phyllis considered her sister as a perfect model and sighed over her own naughtiness  german popular tales were a recent introduction of claudes for eleanor had carefully excluded all fairy tales from her sisters library so great was her dread of works of fiction that emily and lilias had never been allowed to read any of the waverley novels excepting guy mannering which their brother henry had insisted upon reading aloud to them the last time he was at home and that had taken so strong a hold on their imagination that eleanor was quite alarmed  one day mr mohun chanced to refer to some passage in waverley and on finding that his daughters did not understand him he expressed great surprise at their want of taste  poor things said claude they cannot help it do not you know that eleanor thinks the waverley novels a sort of slow poison  they know no more of them than their outsides  well the sooner they know the inside the better  then may we really read them papa cried lily  and welcome said her father  this permission once given the young ladies had no idea of moderation lilys heart and soul were wrapped up in whatever tale she chanced to be readingshe talked of little else she neglected her daily occupations and was in a kind of trance for about three weeks  at length she was recalled to her senses by her fathers asking her why she had shown him no drawings lately  lily hesitated for a moment and then said papa i am sorry i was so idle  take care said mr mohun let us be able to give a good account of ourselves when eleanor comes  i am afraid papa said lily the truth is that my head has been so full of woodstock for the last few days that i could do nothing  and before that  the bride of lammermoor  and last week  waverley  oh papa i am afraid you must be very angry with me  no no lily not yet said mr mohun i do not think you quite knew what an intoxicating draught you had got hold of i should have cautioned you  your negligence has not yet been a serious fault though remember that it becomes so after warning  then said lily i will just finish peveril at once and get it out of my head and then read no more of the dear books and she gave a deep sigh  lily would take the temperance pledge on condition that she might finish her bottle at a draught said mr mohun  lily laughed and looked down feeling quite unable to offer to give up peveril before she had finished it but her father relieved her by saying in his kind voice no no lily take my advice read those books for most of them are very good reading and very pretty reading and very useful reading and you can hardly be called a welleducated person if you do not know them but read them only after the duties of the day are donemake them your pleasure but do not make yourself their slave  lily said claude the next morning as he saw her prepare her drawingdesk why are you not reading peveril  you know what papa said yesterday was the answer  oh but i thought your feelings were with poor julian in the tower said claude  my feelings prompt me to sacrifice my pleasure in reading about him to please papa after he spoke so kindly  if that is always the effect of your principle i shall think better of it said claude  lily whether from her new principle or her old habits of obedience never ventured to touch one of her tempters till after five oclock but as she was a very rapid reader she generally contrived to devour more than a sufficient quantity every evening so that she did not enjoy them as much as she would had she been less voracious in her appetite and they made her complain grievously of the dulness of the latter part of russells modern europe which was being read in the schoolroom and yawn nearly as much as phyllis over the pragmatic sanction  however when that book was concluded and they began palgraves anglo saxons lily was seized within a sudden historical fever  she could hardly wait till one oclock before she settled herself at the schoolroom table with her work and summoned every one however occupied to listen to the reading    chapter ivhonest phyl    multiplication is a vexation  it was a bright and beautiful afternoon in march the song of the blackbird and thrush and the loud chirp of the titmouse came merrily through the schoolroom window mixed with the sounds of happy voices in the garden the western sun shone brightly in and tinged the white wainscoted wall with yellow light the cat sat in the windowseat winking at the sun and sleepily whisking her tail for the amusement of her kitten which was darting to and fro and patting her on the head in the hope of rousing her to some more active sport  but in the midst of all these joyous sights and sounds was heard a dolorous voice repeating three and four arethree and four areoh dear they areseven no but i do not think it is a four after all is it not a one  oh dear  and on the floor lay phyllis her back to the window kicking her feet slowly up and down and yawning and groaning over her slate  presently the door opened and claude looked in and very nearly departed again instantly for phyllis at that moment made a horrible squeaking with her slatepencil the sound above all others that he disliked  he however stopped and asked where emily was  out in the garden answered phyllis with a tremendous yawn  what are you doing here looking so piteous said claude  my sum said phyllis  is this your time of day for arithmetic asked he  no said phyllis only i had not done it by one oclock today and lily said i must finish after learning my lessons for tomorrow but i do not think i shall ever have done it is so hard  oh another stretch and a yawn verging on a howl and jane and ada are sowing the flowerseeds  oh dear  oh dear and phylliss face contracted in readiness to cry  and is that the best position for doing sums said claude  i was obliged to lie down here to get out of the way of adas sum said phyllis getting up  get out of the way of adas sum repeated claude  yes she left it on the table where i was sitting where i could see it and it is this very one so i must not look at it i wish i could do sums as fast as she can  could you not have turned the other side of the slate upwards said claude smiling  so i could said phyllis as if a new light had broken in upon her but then i wanted to be out of sight of pussy for i could not think a bit while the kitten was at play so prettily and i kicked my heels to keep from hearing the voices in the garden for it does make me so unhappy  some goodnatured brothers would have told the little girl not to mind and sent her out to enjoy herself but claude respected phylliss honesty too much to do so and he said well phyl let me see the sum and we will try if we cannot conquer it between us  phylliss face cleared up in an instant as she brought the slate to her brother  what is this said he i do not understand  compound addition said phyllis i did one with emily yesterday and this is the second  oh these are marks between the pounds shillings and pence said claude i took them for elevens well i do not wonder at your troubles i could not do this sum as it is set  could not you indeed cried phyllis quite delighted  no indeed said claude  suppose we set it again more clearly but how is this  when i was in the schoolroom we always had a sponge fastened to the slate  yes said phyllis i had one before eleanor went but my string broke and i lost it and emily always forgets to give me another  i will run and wash the slate in the nursery but how shall we know what the sum is  why i suppose i may look at adas slate though you must not said claude laughing to himself at poor little honest simplicity as he applied himself to cut a new point to her very stumpy slatepencil and she scampered away and returned in a moment with her clean slate  oh how nice and fresh it all looks said she as he set down the clear large figures  i cannot think how you can do it so evenly  now phyl do not let the pencil scream if you can help it  claude found that phylliss great difficulty was with the farthings she could not understand the fractional figures and only knew thus far that emily said it never meant four  claude began explaining but his first attempt was far too scientific  phyllis gave a desponding sigh looking so mystified that he began to believe that she was hopelessly dull and to repent of having offered to help her but at last by means of dividing a card into four pieces he succeeded in making her comprehend him and her eyes grew bright with the pleasure of understanding  even then the difficulties were not conquered her addition was very slow and dividing by twelve and twenty seemed endless work at length the last figure of the pounds was set down the slate was compared with adelines and the sum pronounced to be right  phyllis capered up to the kitten and tossed it up in the air in her joy then coming slowly back to her brother she said with a strange awkward air hanging down her head claude ill tell you what  well what said claude  i should like to kiss you  then away she bounded clattered down stairs and flew across the lawn to tell every one she met that claude had helped her to do her sum and that it was quite right  did you expect that it would be too hard for him phyl said jane laughing  no said phyllis but he said he could not do it as it was set  and whose fault was that said jane  oh but he showed me how to set it better said phyllis and he said that when he learnt the beginning of fractions he thought them as hard as i do  fractions said jane you do not fancy you have come to fractions yet  fine work you will make of them when you do  in the evening as soon as the children were gone to bed jane took a paper out of her workbasket saying there emily is my account of phyls scrapes through this whole week i told you i should write them all down  how kind muttered claude  regardless of her brother who had not looked up from his book jane began reading her list of poor phylliss misadventures  on monday she tore her frock by climbing a laureltree to look at a blackbirds nest  i gave her leave said emily  rachel had ordered her not to climb and she was crying because she could not see the nest that wat greenwood had found  on tuesday she cried over her french grammar and tore a leaf out of the old spellingbook  that was nearly out before said emily maurice and redgie spoilt that long ago  i do not know of anything on wednesday but on thursday she threw ada down the steps out of the nursery  oh that accounts for the dreadful screaming that i heard said claude i forgot to ask the meaning of it  i am sure it was phyl that was the most dismayed and cried the loudest said lily  that she always does said jane  on friday we had an uproar in the schoolroom about her hemming and on saturday she tumbled into a wet ditch and tore her bonnet in the brambles on sunday she twisted her ancles together at church  well there i did chance to observe her said lily there seemed to be a constant struggle between her ancles and herself they were continually coming lovingly together but were separated the next moment  and today this sum said jane seven scrapes in one week  i really am of opinion as rachel says when she is angry that school is the best place for her  i think so too said claude  i do not know said emily she is very troublesome but  oh claude cried lily you do not mean that you would have that poor dear merry master phyl sent to school she would pine away like a wild bird in a cage but papa will never think of such a thing  if i thought of her being sent to school said claude it would be to shield her fromthe rule of love  oh you think we are too indulgent said emily perhaps we are but you know we cannot torment a poor child all day long  if you call the way you treat her indulgent i should like to know what you call severe  what do you mean claude said emily  i call your indulgence something like the tender mercies of the wicked said claude  on a fine day when every one is taking their pleasure in the garden to shut an unhappy child up in the schoolroom with a hard sum that you have not taken the trouble to teach her how to do and late in the day when no ones head is clear for difficult arithmetic  hard sum do you call it said jane  indeed i explained it to her said emily  and well she understood you said claude  she might have learnt if she had attended said emily ada understood clearly with the same explanation  and do not you be too proud of the effect of your instructions claude said jane for when honest phyl came into the garden she did not know farthings from fractions  and pray mrs senior wrangler said claude will you tell me where is the difference between a halfpenny and half a penny  after a good laugh at janes expense emily went on now claude i will tell you how it happened phyllis is so slow and dawdles over her lessons so long that it is quite a labour to hear her ada is quick enough but if you were to hear phyllis say one column of spelling you would know what misery is  then before she has half finished the clock strikes one it is time to read and the lessons are put off till the afternoon  i certainly did not know that she was about her sum all that time or i would have sent her out as i did on saturday  and the reading at one is as fixed as fate said claude  oh no said jane when we were about old russell we did not begin till nearly two but since we have been reading this book lily will never let us rest till we begin she walks up and down and hurries and worries and  yes said emily in a murmuring voice we should do better if lily would not make such a point of that one thing but she never minds what else is cut short and she never thinks of helping me  it never seems to enter her head how much i have on my hands and no one does anything to help me  oh emily you never asked me said lily  i knew you would not like it said emily  no it is not my way to complain people may see how to help me if they choose to do it  lily lily take care said claude in a low voice is not the rule you admire the rule of love of yourself  oh claude returned lily do not say so you know it was emily that i called an example of it not myself and see how forbearing she has been  now i see that i am really wanted i will help  it must be love not duty that calls me to the schoolroom for no one ever said that was my province  poor duty you give it a very narrow boundary  lilias who to say the truth had been made more careful of her own conduct by the wish to establish her principle really betook herself to the schoolroom for an hour every morning with a desire to be useful  she thought she did great things in undertaking those tasks of phylliss which emily most disliked  but lilias was neither patient nor humble enough to be a good teacher though she could explain difficult rules in a sensible way  she could not or would not understand the difference between dulness and inattention her sharp hasty manner would frighten away all her pupils powers of comprehension she sometimes fell into the great error of scolding when phyllis was doing her best and the poor childs tears flowed more frequently than ever  emilys gentle manner made her instructions far more agreeable though she was often neither clear nor correct in her explanations she was contented if the lessons were droned through in any manner so long as she could say they were done she disliked a disturbance and overlooked or half corrected mistakes rather than cause a cry phyllis naturally preferred being taught by her and lily was vexed and unwilling to persevere  she went to the schoolroom expecting to be annoyed created vexation for herself and taught in anything but a loving spirit  still however the thought of claude and the wish to do more than her duty kept her constant to her promise and her love of seeing things well done was useful though sadly counterbalanced by her deficiency in temper and patience    chapter vvillage gossip    the deeds we do the words we say    into still air they seem to fleet we count them past    but they shall last  soon after easter claude went to oxford  he was much missed by his sisters who wanted him to carve for them at luncheon to escort them when they rode or walked to hear their music talk over their books advise respecting their drawings and criticise lilys verses  a new subject of interest was however arising for them in the neighbours who were shortly expected to arrive at broom hill a house which had lately been built in a hamlet about a mile and a half from the new court  these new comers were the family of a barrister of the name of weston who had taken the house for the sake of his wife her health having been much injured by her grief at the loss of two daughters in the scarlet fever  two still remained a grownup young lady and a girl of eleven years old and the miss mohuns learnt with great delight that they should have near neighbours of their own age  they had never had any young companions as young ladies were scarce among their acquaintance and they had not seen their cousin lady florence devereux since they were children  it was with great satisfaction that emily and lilias set out with their father to make the first visit and they augured well from their first sight of mrs weston and her daughters  mrs weston was alone her daughters being out walking and lily spent the greater part of the visit in silence though her mind was made up in the first ten minutes as she told emily on leaving the house that miss westons tastes were in complete accordance with her own  rapid judgment said emily  love before first sight  but mrs weston is a very sweet person  and emily did you see the musicbook open at angels ever bright and fair  if miss weston sings that as i imagine it  how could you see what was in the musicbook at the other end of the room  i only saw it was a beautiful piano  and what handsome furniture it made me doubly ashamed of our faded carpet and chairs almost as old as the house itself  emily said lily in her most earnest tones i would not change one of those dear old chairs for a kings ransom  the visit was in a short time returned and though it was but a formal morning call lilias found her bright expectations realised by the sweetness of alethea westons manners and the next time they met it was a determined thing in her mind that as claude would have said they had sworn an eternal friendship  she had the pleasure of lionising the two sisters over the old court telling all she knew and all she imagined about the siege sir maurice mohun and his faithful servant walter greenwood  miss weston said she in conclusion have you read old mortality  yes said alethea amused at the question  because they say i am as bad as lady margaret about the kings visit  i have not heard the story often enough to think so said miss weston i will warn you if i do  in the meantime phyllis and adeline were equally charmed with marianne though shocked at her ignorance of country manners and indeed alethea was quite diverted with lilys pity at the discovery that she had never before been in the country in the spring  what she cried have you never seen the tufts of red on the hazel nor the fragrant golden palms and never heard the blackbird rush twittering out of the hedge nor the first nightingales note nor the nightjars low chirr nor the chattering of the rooks  o what a store of sweet memories you have lost  why how can you understand the beginning of the allegro  both the miss westons had so much pleasure in making acquaintance with these delights as quite to compensate for their former ignorance and soon the new court rang with their praises  mr mohun thought very highly of the whole family and rejoiced in such society for his daughters and they speedily became so well acquainted that it was the ordinary custom of the westons to take luncheon at the new court on sunday  on her side however alethea weston felt some reluctance to become intimate with the young ladies of the new court she was pleased with emilys manners interested by lilys earnestness and simplicity and thought jane a clever and amusing little creature but even their engaging qualities gave her pain by reminding her of the sisters she had lost or by making her think how they would have liked them  a country house and neighbours like these had been the objects of many visions of their childhood and now all the sweet sights and sounds around her only made her think how she should have enjoyed them a year ago  she felt almost jealous of mariannes liking for her new friends lest they should steal her heart from emma and lucy but knowing that these were morbid and unthankful feelings she struggled against them and though she missed her sisters even more than when her mother and marianne were in greater need of her attention she let no sign of her sorrowful feeling appear and seeing that marianne was benefited in health and spirits by intercourse with young companions she gave no hint of her disinclination to join in the walks and other amusements of the miss mohuns  she also began to take interest in the poor people  by mrs westons request mr devereux had pointed out the families which were most in need of assistance and alethea made it her business to find out the best way of helping them  she visited the village school with lilias and when requested by her and by the rector to give her aid in teaching she did not like to refuse what might be a duty though she felt very diffident of her powers of instruction  marianne like phyllis and adeline became a sunday scholar and was catechised with the others in church  both mr mohun and his nephew thought very highly of the family and the latter was particularly glad that lily should have some older person to assist her in those parish matters which he left partly in her charge  mr devereux had been rector of beechcroft about a year and a half and had hitherto been much liked  his parishioners had known him from a boy and were interested about him and though very young there was something about him that gained their respect  almost all his plans were going on well and things were on the whole in a satisfactory state though no one but lilias expected even cousin robert to make a dreamland of beechcroft and there were days when he looked worn and anxious and the girls suspected that some one was behaving ill  have you a headache robert asked emily a few evenings before whitsunday you have not spoken three words this evening  not at all thank you said mr devereux smiling you need not think to make me your victim now you have no claude to nurse  then if it is not bodily it is mental said lily  i am in a difficulty about the christening of mrs naylors child  naylor the blacksmith said jane  i thought it was high time for it to be christened  it must be six weeks old  is it not to be on whitsunday said lily disconsolately  oh no  mrs naylor will not hear of bringing the child on a sunday and i could hardly make her think it possible to bring it on whit tuesday  why did you not insist said lily  perhaps i might if there was no other holy day at hand or if there was not another difficulty a point on which i cannot give way  oh the godfathers and godmothers said lily does she want that charming brother of hers edward gage  yes and what is worse edward gages dissenting wife and dick rodd who shows less sense of religion than any one in the parish and has never been confirmed  could you make them hear reason  they were inclined to be rather impertinent said mr devereux old mrs gage  oh interrupted jane there is no hope for you if the sour gage is in the pie  the sour gage told me people were not so particular in her younger days and perhaps they should not have the child christened at all since i was such a contrary gentleman  tom naylor was not at home i am to see him tomorrow  well i do not think tom naylor is as bad as the rest said lily he would have been tolerable if he had married any one but martha gage  yes he is an open goodnatured fellow and i have hopes of making an impression on him  if not said lily i hope papa will take away his custom  what said mr mohun who always heard any mention of himself  mr devereux repeated his history and discussed the matter with his uncle only once interrupted by an inquiry from jane about the childs name a point on which she could gain no intelligence  his report the next day was not decidedly unfavourable though he scarcely hoped the christening would be so soon as tuesday  he had not seen the father and suspected he had purposely kept out of the way  jane disappointed that the babys name remained a mystery resolved to set out on a voyage of discovery  accordingly as soon as her cousin was gone she asked emily if she had not been saying that ada wanted some more cotton for her sampler  yes said emily but i am not going to walk all the way to mrs appletons this afternoon  shall i go said jane  ada run and fetch your pattern  emily and ada were much obliged by janes disinterested offer and in a quarter of an hour adas thoughts and hands were busy in mrs appletons drawer of manycoloured cotton  what a pity this is about mrs naylors baby began jane  it is a sad story indeed miss jane i am sure it must be grievous to mr devereux said mrs appleton  betsy wall said he had been there three times about it  ah we all know that walls have ears said jane how that betsy does run about gossiping  yes miss jane there she bides all day long at the stile gaping not a stitch does she do for her mother i cannot tell what is to be the end of it  and do you know what the childs name is to be mrs appleton  no miss jane answered mrs appleton  betsy did say they talked of naming him after his uncle edward gage only mr devereux would not let him stand  no said jane  since he married that dissenting wife he never comes near the church he is too much like the sour gage as we call his mother to be good for much  but after all he is not so bad as dick rodd who has never been confirmed and has never shown any sense of religion in his life  yes miss dick rodd is a sad fellow  did you hear what a row there was at the mohun arms last week miss jane  aye said jane and papa says he shall certainly turn dick rodd out of the house as soon as the lease is out and it is only till next michaelmas twelvemonths  yes miss as i said to betsy wall it would be more for their interest to behave well  indeed it would said jane  robert and papa were talking of having their horses shod at stoney bridge if tom naylor will be so obstinate only papa does not like to give tom up if he can help it because his father was so good and tom would not be half so bad if he had not married one of the gages  here is cousin robert coming down the lane said ada who had chosen her cotton and was gazing from the door  jane gave a violent start took a hurried leave of mrs appleton and set out towards home she could not avoid meeting her cousin  oh jenny have you been enjoying a gossip with your great ally said he  we have only been buying pink cotton said ada whose conscience was clear  ah said mr devereux beechcroft affairs would soon stand still without those useful people mrs appleton miss wall and miss jane mohun and he passed on  jane felt her face colouring his freedom from suspicion made her feel very guilty but the matter soon passed out of her mind  blithe whitsunday came the five miss mohuns appeared in white frocks new bonnets were plenty the white tippets of the children and the bright shawls of the mothers made the village look gay wat greenwood stuck a pink between his lips and the green boughs of hazel and birch decked the dark oak carvings in the church  and whitmonday came  at halfpast ten the rude music of the band of the friendly society came pealing from the top of the hill then appeared two tall flags crowned with guelder roses and peonies then the great blue drum the clarionet blown by redwaistcoated and red faced mr appleton the three flutes and the triangle all at their loudest causing some of the spectators to start and others to dance  then behold the whole procession of labourers in white round frocks blue ribbons in their hats and tall blue staves in their hands  in the rear the confused mob women and children cheerful faces and mirthful sounds everywhere  these were hushed as the flags were lowered to pass under the lowroofed gateway of the churchyard and all was still except the trampling of feet on the stone floor then the service began the responses were made in full and hearty tones almost running into a chant the old 133rd psalm was sung as loudly and as badly as usual a very short but very earnest sermon was preached and forth came the troop again  mr devereux always dined with the club in a tent at the top of the hill but his uncle made him promise to come to a second dinner at the new court in the evening  robert looks anxious said lily as she parted with him after the evening service i am afraid something is going wrong  trust me for finding out what it is said jane  no no jenny do not ask him said lily if he tells us to relieve his mind i am very glad he should make friends of us but do not ask  let us talk of other things to put it out of his head whatever it may be  jane soon heard more of the cause of the depression of her cousins spirits than even she had any desire to do  after dinner the girls were walking in the garden enjoying the warmth of the evening when mr devereux came up to her and drew her aside from the rest telling her that he wished to speak to her  oh said jane when am i to meet you at school again  you never told me which chapter i was to prepare i cannot think what would become of your examinations if it was not for me you could not get an answer to one question in three  that was not what i wished to speak to you about said mr devereux  what had you been saying to mrs appleton when i met you at her door on saturday  the colour rushed into janes cheeks but she replied without hesitation oh different things la pluie et le beau temps just as usual  cannot you remember anything more distinctly  i always make a point of forgetting what i talk about said jane trying to laugh  now jane let me tell you what has happened in the villageas i came down the hill from the clubdinner  oh said jane hoping to make a diversion wat greenwood came back about a quarter of an hour ago and he  mr devereux proceeded without attending to her as i came down the hill from the clubdinner old mrs gage came out of naylors house and her daughter with her in great anger calling me to account for having spoken of her in a most unbecoming way calling her the sour gage and trying to set the squire against them  oh that abominable chattering woman jane exclaimed and betsy wall too i saw her all alive about something  what a nuisance such people are  in short said mr devereux i heard an exaggerated account of all that passed here on the subject the other day  now jane am i doing you any injustice in thinking that it must have been through you that this history went abroad into the village  well said jane i am sure you never told us that it was any secret  when a story is openly told to half a dozen people they cannot be expected to keep it to themselves  i spoke uncharitably and incautiously said he i am willing to confess but it is nevertheless my duty to set before you the great matter that this little fire has kindled  why it cannot have done any great harm can it asked jane the agitation of her voice and laugh betraying that she was not quite so careless as she wished to appear  only the sour gage will ferment a little  oh jane  i did not expect that you would treat this matter so lightly  but tell me what harm has it done asked she  do you consider it nothing that the poor child should remain unbaptized that discord should be brought into the parish that anger should be on the conscience of your neighbour that he should be driven from the church  is it as bad as that said jane  we do not yet see the full extent of the mischief our idle words may have done said mr devereux  but it is their own fault if they will do wrong said jane they ought not to be in a rage we said nothing but the truth  i wish i was clear of the sin said her cousin  and after all said jane i cannot see that i was much to blame i only talked to mrs appleton as i have done scores of times and no one minded it  you only laughed at me on saturday and papa and eleanor never scolded me  you cannot say that no one has ever tried to check you said the rector  and how was i to know that that mischiefmaker would repeat it said jane  i do not mean to say said mr devereux that you actually committed a greater sin than you may often have done by talking in a way which you knew would displease your father  i know we are too apt to treat lightly the beginnings of evil until some sudden sting makes us feel what a serpent we have been fostering  think this a warning pray that the evil we dread may be averted but should it ensue consider it as a punishment sent in mercy  it will be better for you not to come to school tomorrow instead of the references you were to have looked out i had rather you read over in a humble spirit the epistle of st james  janes tears by this time were flowing fast and finding that she no longer attempted to defend herself her cousin said no more  he joined the others and jane escaping to her own room gave way to a passionate fit of crying  whether her tears were of true sorrow or of anger she could not have told herself she was still sobbing on her bed when the darkness came on and her two little sisters came in on their way to bed to wish her goodnight  oh jane jane what is the matter have you been naughty asked the little girls in great amazement  never mind said jane shortly goodnight and she sat up and wiped away her tears  the children still lingered  go away do said she  is robert gone  no said phyllis he is reading the newspaper  phyllis and adeline left the room and jane walked up and down considering whether she should venture to go down to tea perhaps her cousin had waited till the little girls had gone before he spoke to mr mohun or perhaps her red eyes might cause questions on her troubles she was still in doubt when lily opened the door a lamp in her hand  my dear jenny are you here  ada told me you were crying what is the matter  then you have not heard said jane  only robert began just now poor jenny she has been the cause of getting us into a very awkward scrape but then ada came to tell me about you and i came away  yes said jane angrily he will throw all the blame upon me when i am sure it was quite as much the fault of that horrible mrs appleton and papa will be as angry as possible  but what has happened asked lily  oh that chatterer that worst of gossipers has gone and told the naylors and mrs gage all we said about them the other day  so you told mrs appleton said lily so that was the reason you were so obliging about the marking thread  oh jane you had better say no more about mrs appleton  and has it done much mischief  oh  mrs gage pitched into robert as wat greenwood would say and the christening is off again  jane this is frightful said lily i do not wonder that you are unhappy  well i daresay it will all come right again said jane there will only be a little delay papa and robert will bring them to their senses in time  suppose the baby was to die said lily  oh it will not die said jane a great fat healthy thing like that likely to die indeed  i cannot make you out jane said lily  if i had done such a thing i do not think i could have a happy minute till it was set right  well i told you i was very sorry said jane only i wish they would not all be so hard upon me  robert owns that he should not have said such things if he did not wish them to be repeated  does he cried lily  how exactly like robert that is to own himself in fault when he is obliged to blame others  jane how could you hear him say such things and not be overcome with shame  and then to turn it against him  oh jane i do not think i can talk to you any more  i do not mean to say it was not very good of him said jane  good of himwhat a word cried lily  well goodnight i cannot bear to talk to you now  shall i say anything for you downstairs  oh tell papa and robert i am very sorry said jane  i shall not come down again you may leave the lamp  on her way downstairs in the dark lilias was led by the example of her cousin to reflect that she was not without some share in the mischief that had been done the words which report imputed to mr devereux were mostly her own or janes  there was no want of candour in lily and as soon as she entered the drawingroom she went straight up to her father and cousin and began poor jenny is very unhappy she desired me to tell you how sorry she is  but i really believe that i did the mischief robert  it was i who said those foolish things that were repeated as if you had said them  it is a grievous affair but who could have thought that we were doing so much harm  perhaps it may not do any said emily  the naylors have a great deal of good about them  they must have more than i suppose if they can endure what robert is reported to have said of them said mr mohun  what did you say robert said lily did you not tell them all was said by your foolish young cousins  i agreed with you too much to venture on contradicting the report you know i could not even deny having called mrs gage by that name  oh if i could do anything to mend it cried lily  but wishes had no effect  lilias and jane had to mourn over the full extent of harm done by hasty words  after the more respectable men had left the mohun arms on the evening of whitmonday the rest gave way to unrestrained drunkenness not so much out of reckless self indulgence as to defy the clergyman and the squire  they came to the front of the parsonage yelled and groaned for some time and ended by breaking down the gate  this conduct was repeated on tuesday and on many saturdays following some young trees in the churchyard were cut and abuse of the parson written on the walls the idle young men taking this opportunity to revenge their own quarrels caused by mr devereuxs former efforts for their reformation  on sunday several children were absent from school all those belonging to farmer gages labourers were taken away and one man was turned off by the farmers for refusing to remove his child  now that the war was carried on so openly mr mohun considered it his duty to withdraw his custom from one who chose to set his pastor at defiance  he went to the forge and had a long conversation with the blacksmith but though he was listened to with respect it was not easy to make much impression on an ignorant hottempered man who had been greatly offended and prided himself on showing that he would support the quarrel of his wife and her relations against both squire and parson and though mr mohun did persuade him to own that it was wrong to be at war with the clergyman the effect of his arguments was soon done away with by the gages and no ground was gained  mr gages farm was unhappily at no great distance from a dissenting chapel and school in the adjoining parish of stoney bridge and thither the farmer and blacksmith betook themselves with many of the cottagers of broom hill  one alone of the family of tom naylor refused to join him in his dissent and that was his sister mrs eden a widow with one little girl about seven years old who though in great measure dependent upon him for subsistence knew her duty too well to desert the church or to take her child from school and continued her even course toiling hard for bread and uncomplaining though often munch distressed  all the rest of the parish who were not immediately under mr mohuns influence were in a sad state of confusion  jane was grieved at heart but would not confess it and lilias was so restless and unhappy that emily was quite weary of her lamentations  her best comforter was miss weston who patiently listened to her sighed with her over the evident sorrow of the rector and the mischief in the parish and proved herself a true friend by never attempting to extenuate her fault    chapter vithe new friend    maidens should be mild and meek swift to hear and slow to speak  miss weston had been much interested by what she heard respecting mrs eden and gladly discovered that she was just the person who could assist in some needlework which was required at broom hill she asked lilias to tell her where to find her cottage and lily replied by an offer to show her the way miss weston hesitated thinking that perhaps in the present state of things lily had rather not see her but her doubts were quickly removed by this speech i want to see her particularly  i have been there three times without finding her  i think i can set this terrible matter right by speaking to her  accordingly lilias and phyllis set out with alethea and marianne one afternoon to mrs edens cottage which stood at the edge of a long field at the top of the hill  very fast did lily talk all the way but she grew more silent as she came to the cottage and knocked at the door it was opened by mrs eden herself a pale but rather pretty young woman with a remarkable gentle and pleasing face and a manner which was almost ladylike although her hands were freshly taken out of the washtub  she curtsied low and coloured at the sight of lilias set chairs for the visitors and then returned to her work  oh mrs eden lily began intending to make her explanation but feeling confused thought it better to wait till her friends business was settled and altered her speech into miss weston is come to speak to you about some work  mrs eden looked quite relieved and alethea proceeded to appoint the day for her coming to broom hill and arrange some small matters during which lily not only settled what to say but worked herself into a fit of impatience at the length of aletheas instructions when they were concluded however and there was a pause her words failed her and she wished that she was miles from the cottage or that she had never mentioned her intentions  at last she stammered out oh mrs edeni wanted to speak to you aboutabout mr devereux and your brother  mrs eden bent over her washtub miss weston examined the shells on the chimneypiece marianne and phyllis listened with all their ears and poor lily was exceedingly uncomfortable  i wished to tell youi do not thinki do not meanit was not his saying  indeed he did not say those things about the gages  i told my brother i did not think mr devereux would go for to say such a thing said mrs eden as much confused as lily  oh that was right mrs eden  the mischief was all my making and janes  we said those foolish things and they were repeated as if it was he  oh do tell your brother so mrs eden  it was very good of you to think it was not cousin robert  pray tell tom naylor  i cannot bear that things should go on in this dreadful way  indeed miss i am very sorry said mrs eden  but mrs eden i am sure that would set it right again said lily are not you  i would do anything to have that poor baby christened  lilys confidence melted away as she saw that mrs edens tears were falling fast and she ended with only tell them and we shall see what will happen  very well miss lilias said mrs eden  i am very sorry  let us hope that time and patience will set things right said miss weston to relieve the embarrassment of both parties  your brother must soon see that mr devereux only wishes to do his duty  alethea skilfully covered lilys retreat and the party took leave of mrs eden and turned into their homeward path  lily at first seemed disposed to be silent and miss weston therefore amused herself with listening to the chatter of the little girls as they walked on before them  there are only thirtysix days to the holidays said phyllis ada and i keep a paper in the nursery with the account of the number of days  we shall be so glad when claude and maurice and redgie come home  are they not very boisterous said marianne  not maurice said phyllis  no indeed said lily maurice is like nobody else  he takes up some scientific pursuit each time he comes home and cares for nothing else for some time and then quite forgets it  he is an odd looking boy too thick and sturdy with light flaxen hair and dark overhanging eyebrows and he makes the most extraordinary grimaces  and reginald said alethea  oh redgie is a noblelooking fellow  but just eleven and taller than jane  his complexion so fair yet fresh and boyish and his eyes that beautiful blue that adas arereal blue  then his hair in dark brown waves with a rich auburn shine  the old knights must have been just like redgie  and claudeoh miss weston have you ever seen claude  no but i have seen your eldest brother  william  why he has been in canada these three years  where could you have seen him  at brighton about four years ago  ah the year before he went  i remember that his regiment was there  well it is curious that you should know him and did you ever hear of harry the brother that we lost  i remember captain mohuns being called away to oxford by his illness said alethea  ah yes  william was the only one of us who was with him even papa was not there  his illness was so short  yes said alethea i think it was on a tuesday that captain mohun left brighton and we saw his death in the paper on saturday  william only arrived the evening that he died  papa was gone to ireland to see about cousin rotherwoods property  robert not knowing that wrote to him at beechcroft eleanor forwarded the letter without opening it and so we knew nothing till robert came to tell us that all was over  without any preparation  with none  harry had left home about ten days before quite well and looking so handsome  you know what a finelooking person william is  well harry was very like him only not so tall and strong with the same clear hazel eyes and more pink in his cheeksfairer altogether  then harry wrote saying that he had caught one of his bad colds  we did not think much of it for he was always having coughs  we heard no more for a week and then one morning eleanor was sent for out of the schoolroom and there was robert come to tell us  oh it was such a thunderbolt  this was what did the mischief you know papa and mamma being from home so long the elder boys had no settled place for the holidays sometimes they stayed with one friend sometimes with another and so no one saw enough of them to find out how delicate poor harry really was  i think papa had been anxious the only winter they were at home together and harry had been talked to and advised to take care but in the summer and autumn he was well and did not think about it  he went to oxford by the coachit was a bitterly cold frosty daythere was a poor woman outside shivering and looking very ill and harry changed places with her  he was horribly chilled but thinking he had only a common cold he took no care  robert coming to oxford about a week after found him very ill and wrote to papa and william but william scarcely came in time  harry just knew him and that was all  he could not speak and died that night  then william stayed at oxford to receive papa and robert came to tell us  it must have been a terrible shock  such a losshe was so very good and clever  every one looked up to himwilliam almost as much as the younger ones  he never was in any scrape had all sorts of prizes at eton besides getting his scholarship before he was seventeen  whenever lily could get miss weston alone it was her way to talk in this manner  she loved the sound of her own voice so well that she was never better satisfied than when engrossing the whole conversation  having nothing to talk of but her books her poor people and her family she gave her friend the full benefit of all she could say on each subject while alethea had kindness enough to listen with real interest to her long rambling discourses well pleased to see her happy  the next time they met lilias told her all she knew or imagined respecting eleanor and of her own debate with claude and ended now miss weston tell me your opinion which would you choose for a sister eleanor or emily  i have some experience of miss mohuns delightful manners and none of mrs hawkesworths so i am no fair judge said alethea  i really have done justice to eleanors sterling goodness said lily  now what should you think  i can hardly imagine greater proofs of affection than mrs hawkesworth has given you said miss weston smiling  it was because it was her duty said lilias  you have only heard the facts but you cannot judge of her ways and looks  now only think when frank came home after seven years of perils by field and floodthere she rose up to receive him as if he had been mr nobody making a morning call  and all the time before they were married i do believe she thought more of showing emily how much tea we were to use in a week than anything else  perhaps some people might have admired her selfcommand said alethea  selfcommand the refuge of the insensible  and now i told you about dear harry the other day  he was eleanors especial brother yet his death never seemed to make any difference to her  she scarcely cried  she heard our lessons as usual talked in her quiet voiceshowed no tokens of feeling  was her health as good as before asked miss weston  she was not ill said lily if she had i should have been satisfied  she certainly could not take long walks that winter but she never likes walking  people said she looked ill but i do not know  shall i tell you what i gather from your history  pray do  then do not think me very perverse if i say that perhaps the grief she then repressed may have weighed down her spirits ever since so that you can hardly remember any alteration  that i cannot said lily  she is always the same but then she ought to have been more cheerful before his death  did not you lose him soon after your mother said alethea  two whole years said lily  oh and aunt robert too and frank went to india the beginning of that year yes there was enough to depress her but i never thought of grief going on in that quiet dull way for so many years  you would prefer one violent burst and then forgetfulness  not exactly said lily but i should like a little evidence of it if it is really strong it cannot be hid  little did lily think of the grief that sat heavy upon the spirit of alethea who answeredsome people can do anything that they consider their duty  duty  what are you a duty lover exclaimed lilias  i never suspected it because you are not disagreeable  thank you said alethea laughing your compliment rather surprises me for i thought you told me that your brother claude was on the duty side of the question  he thinks he is said lily but love is his real motive of action as i can prove to you  poor claude had a very bad illness when he was about three years old and ever since he has been liable to terrible headaches and he is not at all strong  of course he cannot always study hard and when first he went to school every one scolded him for being idle  i really believe he might have done more but then he was so clever that he could keep up without any trouble and as robert says that was a great temptation but still papa was not satisfied because he said claude could do better  so said harry  oh you cannot think what a person harry was as high spirited as william and as gentle as claude and in his kind way he used to try hard to make claude exert himself but it never would do he was never in mischief but he never took pains  then harry died and when claude came home and saw how changed things were how gray papas hair had turned and how silent and melancholy william had grown he set himself with all his might to make up to papa as far as he could  he thought only of doing what harry would have wished and papa himself says that he has done wonders  i cannot see that henry himself could have been more than claude is now he has not spared himself in the least his tutor says and he would have had the newcastle scholarship last year if he had not worked so hard that he brought on one of his bad illnesses and was obliged to come home now i am sure that he has acted from love for it was as much his duty to take pains while harry was alive as afterwards  certainly said miss weston but what does he say himself  oh he never will talk of himself said lily  have you not overlooked one thing which may be the truth said alethea as if she was asking for information that duty and love may be identical  is not st pauls description of charity very like the duty to our neighbour  the practice is the same but not the theory said lily  now what is called duty seems to me to be love doing unpleasant work said miss weston love disguised under another name when obliged to act in a way which seems only seems out of accordance with its real title  that is all very well for those who have love said lily  some have not who do their duty conscientiouslyanother word which i hate by the bye  they have love in a rough coat perhaps said alethea and i should expect it soon to put on a smoother one    chapter viisir maurice    shall thought was his in after time thus to be hitched into a rhyme the simple sire could only boast that he was loyal to his cost the banished race of kings revered and lost his land  the holidays arrived and with them the three brothers for during the first few weeks of the oxford vacation claude accompanied lord rotherwood on visits to some college friends and only came home the same day as the younger ones  maurice did not long leave his sisters in doubt as to what was to be his reigning taste for as soon as dinner was over he made jane find the volume of the encyclopaedia containing entomology and with his elbows on the table proceeded to study it so intently that the young ladies gave up all hopes of rousing him from it  claude threw himself down on the sofa to enjoy the luxury of a desultory talk with his sisters and reginald his head on the floor and his heels on a chair talked loud and fast enough for all three with very little regard to what the damsels might be saying  oh claude said lily you cannot think how much we like miss weston she lets us call her alethea and  here came an interruption from mr mohun who perceiving the position of reginalds dusty shoes gave a loud ahh as if he was scolding a dog and ordered him to change them directly  here phyl said reginald kicking off his shoes just step up and bring my shippers rachel will give them to you  away went phyllis well pleased to be her brothers fag  ah  redgie does not know the misfortune that hangs over him said emily  what said reginald will not the baron let viper come to the house  worse said emily rachel is going away  rachel cried claude starting up from the sofa  rachel said maurice without raising his eyes  rachel  rachel botheration roared reginald with a wondrous caper  yes rachel said emily rachel who makes so much of you for no reason that i could ever discover but because you are the most troublesome  you will never find any one to mend your jackets and dress your wounds like rachel said lily and make a baby of you instead of a great schoolboy  what will become of you redgie  what will become of any of us said claude i thought rachel was the mainspring of the house  have you quarrelled with her emily said reginald  nonsense said emily it is only that her brother has lost his wife and wants her to take care of his children  well said reginald her master has lost his wife and wants her to take care of his children  i cannot think what i shall do said ada i cry about it every night when i go to bed  what is to be done  send her brother a new wife said maurice  send him emily said reginald we could spare her much better  only i dont wish him joy said maurice  well i hope you wish me joy of my substitute said emily i do not think you would ever guess but lily after being in what rachel calls quite a way has persuaded every one to let us have esther bateman  what the baron said claude in surprise  yes said lily is it not delightful  he said at first emily was too inexperienced to teach a young servant but then we settled that hannah should be upper servant and esther will only have to wait upon phyl and ada  then he said faith longley was of a better set of people but i am sure it would give one the nightmare to see her lumbering about the house and then he talked it over with robert and with rachel  and was not rachel against it or was she too kind to her young ladies  oh she was cross when she talked it over with us said lily but we coaxed her over and she told the baron it would do very well  and robert  he was quite with us for he likes esther as much as i do said lily  now lily said jane how can you say he was quite with you when he said he thought it would be better if she was farther from home and under some older person  yes but he allowed that she would be much safer here than at home said lily  but i thought she used to be the head of all the ill behaviour in school said claude  oh that was in eleanors time said lily there was nothing to draw her out she never was encouraged but since she has been in my class and has found that her wishes to do right are appreciated and met by affection she has been quite a new creature  since she has been in my class claude repeated  well said lily with a slight blush it is just what robert says he told her when he gave her her prize bible on palm sunday that she had been going on very well but she must take great care when removed from those whose influence now guided her and who could he have meant but me  and now she is to go on with me always  she will be quite one of the old sort of faithful servants who feel that they owe everything to their masters and will it not be pleasant to have so sweet and expressive a face about the house  do i know her face said claude  oh yes  i do  she has black eyes i think and would be pretty if she did not look pert  you provoking claude cried lily you are as bad as alethea who never will say that esther is the best person for us  i was going to inquire for the allforlove principle said claude but i see it is in full force  and how are the verses lily  have you made a poem upon michael moone or mohun the actor our uncle whom i discovered for you in pepyss memoirs  nonsense said lily but i have been writing something about sir maurice which you shall hear whenever you are not in this horrid temper  the next afternoon as soon as luncheon was over lily drew claude out to his favourite place under the planetree where she proceeded to inflict her poem upon his patient ears while he lay flat upon the grass looking up to the sky emily and jane had promised to join them there in process of time and the four younger ones were as usual diverting themselves among the farm buildings at the old court  lily began  i meant to have two parts about sir maurice going out to fight when he was very young and then about his brothers being killed and king charles knighting him and his betrothed phyllis crossthwayte embroidering his black engrailed cross on his banner and then the taking the castle and his being wounded and escaping and phyllis not thinking it right to leave her father but i have not finished that so now you must hear about his return home   a romaunt in six cantos entitled woe woe by miss fanny f known more commonly so   muttered claude to himself but as lily did not understand or know whence his quotation came it did not hurt her feelings and she went merrily on   tis the twentyninth of merry may full cheerily shine the sunbeams today    their joyous light revealing full many a troop in garments gay with cheerful steps who take their way    by the green hill and shady lane while merry bells are pealing and soon in beechcrofts holy fane the villagers are kneeling dreary and mournful seems the shrine where sound their prayers and hymns divine    for every mystic ornament    by the rude spoilers hand is rent    scarce is its ancient beauty traced    in woodwork broken and defaced    reft of each quaint device and rare    of foliage rich and mouldings fair    yet happy is each spirit there       the simple peasantry rejoice    to see the altar decked with care       to hear their ancient pastors voice    reciting oer each wellknown prayer    to view again his robe of white    and hear the services aright    once more to chant their glorious creed    and thankful own their nation freed    from those who cast her glories down    and rent away her cross and crown    a stranger knelt among the crowd    and joined his voice in praises loud    and when the holy rites had ceased    held converse with the aged priest    then turned to join the village feast    where raised on the hills summit green    the maypoles flowery wreaths were seen    beneath the venerable yew    the stranger stood the sports to view    unmarked by all for each was bent    on his own scheme of merriment    on talking laughing dancing playing     there never was so blithe a maying    so thought each laughing maiden gay    whose headgear bore the oaken spray    so thought that hand of shouting boys    unchecked in their best joyin noise    but grayhaired men whose deepmarked scars    bore token of the civil wars    and hooded dames in cloaks of red    at the blithe youngsters shook the head    gathering in eager clusters told    how joyous were the days of old    when beechcrofts lords those barons bold    came forth to join their vassals sport    and here to hold their rustic court    throned in the ancient chair you see    beneath our noble old yew tree    alas all empty stands the throne    reserved for mohuns race alone    and the old folks can only tell    of the good lords who ruled so well    ah  i bethink me of the time    the last before those years of crime    when with his open hearty cheer    the good old squire was sitting here    twas then another voice replied    that brave young master maurice tried    to pitch the ball with andrew grey     we neer shall see so blithe a day        all the young squires have long been dead    no master webb quoth andrew grey       young master maurice safely fled    at least so all the greenwoods say    and walter greenwood with him went    to share his masters banishment    and now king charles is ruling here    our own good landlord may be near    small hope of that the old man said    and sadly shook his hoary head    sir maurice died beyond the sea    last of his noble line was he    look master webb he turned and there    the stranger sat in mohuns chair    at ease he sat and smiled to scan    the face of each astonished man    then on the ground he laid aside    his plumed hat and mantle wide    one moment andrew deemed he knew    those glancing eyes of hazel hue    but the sunk cheek the figure spare    the lines of white that streak the hair     how can this he the stripling gay    erst victor in the sports of may    full twenty years of cheerful toil    and labour on his native soil    on andrews head had left no trace        the summers sun the winters storm    they had but ruddier made his face       more hard his hand more strong his form    forth from the wandering whispering crowd    a farmer came and spoke aloud    with rustic bow and welcome fair    but with a hesitating air     he told how custom well preserved    the throne for mohuns race reserved    the stranger laughed what harrington    hast thou forgot thy landlords son    loud was the cry and blithe the shout    on beechcroft hill that now rang out    and still remembered is the day    that merry twentyninth of may    when to his fathers home returned    that knight whose glory well was earned    in poverty and banishment    his prime of manhood had been spent    a wanderer scorned by charless court    one faithful servant his support    and now he seeks his home forlorn    broken in health with sorrow worn    and two short years just passed away    between that joyous meetingday    and the sad eve when beechcrofts bell    tolled forth sir maurices funeral knell and phyllis whose love was so constant and tried was a widow the year she was maurices bride yet the path of the noble and truehearted knight was brilliant with honour and glory and light and still his descendants shall sing of the fame of sir maurice de mohun the pride of his name   it is a pity they should sing of it in such lines as those last four said claude  let me see i like your bringing in the real names though i doubt whether any but greenwood could have been found here  oh here come emily and jane said lily let me put it away  you are very much afraid of jane said claude  yes jane has no feeling for poetry said lily with simplicity which made her brother smile  jane and emily now came up the former with her work the latter with a campstool and a book  i wonder said she where those boys are  by the bye what character did they bring home from school  the same as usual said claude  maurices mind only half given to his work and redgies whole mind to his play  maurices talent does not lie in the direction of latin and greek said emily  no said jane it is nonsense to make him learn it and so he says  perhaps he would say the same of mathematics and mechanics if as great a point were made of them said lily  i think not said claude he has more notion of them than of latin verses  then you are on my side said jane triumphantly  did i say so said claude  why not said jane  what is the use of his knowing those stupid languages  i am sure it is wasting time not to improve such a genius as he has for mechanics and natural history  now claude i wish you would answer  i was waiting till you had done said claude  why do you not think it nonsense persisted jane  because i respect my fathers opinion said claude letting himself fall on the grass as if he had done with the subject  pooh said jane that sounds like a good little boy of five years old  very likely said claude  but you have some opinion of your own said lily  certainly  then i wish you would give it said jane  come emily said claude have you brought anything to read  but your opinion claude said jane  i am sure you think with me only you are too grand and too correct to say so  claude made no answer but jane saw she was wrong by his countenance before she could say anything more however they were interrupted by a great outcry from the old court regions  oh said emily i thought it was a long time since we had heard anything of those uproarious mortals  i hope there is nothing the matter said lily  oh no said jane i hear redgies laugh  aye but among that party said emily redgies laugh is not always a proof of peace  they are too much in the habit of acting the boys and the frogs  we were better off said lily with the gentle claude as miss middleton used to call him  miss molly as william used to call him with more propriety said claude not half so well worth playing with as such a fellow as redgie  not even for young ladies said emily  no phyllis and ada are much the better for being teased said claude  i am convinced that i never did my duty by you in that respect  there were others to do it for you said jane  harry never teased said emily and william scorned us  his teasing was all performed upon claude said lily and a great shame it was  not at all said claude only an injudicious attempt to put a little life into a tortoise  a bad comparison said lily but what is all this  here come the children in dismay  what is the matter my dear child  this was addressed to phyllis who was the first to come up at full speed sobbing and out of breath oh the dragonfly  oh do not let him kill it  the dragonfly the poor dear blue dragonfly screamed adeline hiding her face in emilys lap oh do not let him kill it he is holding it he is hurting it  oh tell him not  i caught it said phyllis but not to have it killed  oh take it away  a fine rout indeed you chicken said reginald i know a fellow who ate up five horsestingers one morning before breakfast  stingers said phyllis they do not sting anything pretty creatures  i told you i would catch the old pony and put it on him to try said reginald  in the meantime maurice came up at his leisure holding his prize by the wings  look what a beautiful libellulla puella said he to jane  a demoiselle dragonfly said lily what a beauty what are you going to do with it  put it into my museum said maurice  here jane put it under this flowerpot and take care of it while i fetch something to kill it with  oh maurice do not said emily  one good squeeze said reginald  i will do it  how came you be so cruel said lily  no a squeeze will not do said maurice it would spoil its beauty i must put it ever the fumes of carbonic acid  maurice you really must not said emily  now do not dear maurice said ada theres a dear boy i will give you such a kiss  nonsense get out of the way said maurice turning away  now maurice this is most horrid cruelty said lily what right have you to shorten the brief happy life which  well interrupted maurice if you make such a fuss about killing it i will stick a pin through it into a cork and let it shift for itself  poor phyllis ran away to the other end of the garden sat down and sobbed ada screamed and argued emily complained lily exhorted claude to interfere while reginald stood laughing  such useless cruelty said emily  useless said maurice  pray how is any one to make a collection of natural objects without killing things  i do not see the use of a collection said lily you can examine the creatures and let them go  such a young ladys tenderhearted notion said reginald  who ever heard of a man of science managing in such a ridiculous way  man of science exclaimed lily when he will have forgotten by next christmas that insects ever existed  it was not convenient to hear this speech so maurice turned an empty flowerpot over his prisoner and left it in janes care while he went to fetch the means of destruction probably choosing the lawn for the place of execution in order to show his contempt for his sisters  fair damsel in boddice blue said lily peeping in at the hole at the top of the flowerpot i wish i could avert your melancholy fate  i am very sorry for you but i cannot help it  you might help it now at any rate muttered claude  no said lily i know monsieur maurice too well to arouse his wrath so justly  if you choose to release the pretty creature i shall be charmed  you forget that i am in charge said jane  there is a carriage coming to the front gate cried ada  emily may i go into the drawingroom  oh jenny will you undo my brown holland apron  that is right little mincing miss said reginald with a low bow how fine we are today  how visitors break into the afternoon said emily with a languid turn of her head  jenny brownie called maurice from his bedroom window i want the sulphuric acid  jane sprang up and ran into the house though her sisters called after her that she would come full upon the company in the hall  they shall not catch me here cried reginald rushing off into the shrubbery  are you coming in claude said emily  send ada to call me if there is any one worth seeing said claude  they will see you from the window said emily  no said claude no one ever found me out last summer under these friendly branches  the old butler joseph now showed himself on the terrace and the young ladies knowing that he had no intention of crossing the lawn hastened to learn from him who their visitors were and entered the house  just then phyllis came running back from the kitchen garden and without looking round or perceiving claude she took up the flowerpot and released the captive which unconscious of its peril rested on a blade of grass vibrating its gauzy wings and rejoicing in the restored sunbeams  fly away fly away you pretty creature said phyllis make haste or maurice will come and catch you again  i wish i had not given you such a fright  i thought you would have been killed and a pin stuck all through that pretty blue and black body of yours  oh that would be dreadful  make haste and go away  i would not have caught you you beautiful thing if i had known what he wanted to do  i thought he only wanted to look at your beautiful body like a little bit of the sky come down to look at the flowers and your delicate wings and great shining eyes  oh i am very glad god made you so beautiful  oh there is maurice coming  i must blow upon you to make you go  oh that is rightup quite high in the airquite safe and she clapped her hands as the dragonfly rose in the air and disappeared behind the laurels just as maurice and reginald emerged from the shrubbery the former with a bottle in his hand  well where is the libellulla said he  the dragonfly said phyllis  i let it out  sold maurice cried reginald laughing at his brothers disaster  upon my word phyl you are very kind said maurice angrily  if i had known you were such an illnatured crab  oh  maurice dear dont say so exclaimed phyllis  i thought i might let it out because i caught it myself and i told you i did not catch it for you to kill maurice indeed i am sorry i vexed you  what else did you do it for said maurice  it is horrid not to be able to leave ones things a minute  but i did not know the dragonfly belonged to you maurice said phyllis  that is a puzzler mohun senior said reginald  now redgie do get maurice to leave off being angry with me implored his sister  i will leave off being angry said maurice seeing his advantage if you will promise never to let out my things again  i do not think i can promise said phyllis  o yes you can said reginald you know they are not his  promise you will not let out any insects i may get said maurice or i shall say you are as cross as two sticks  ill tell you what maurice said phyllis i do wish you would not make me promise for i do not think i can keep it for i cannot bear to see the beautiful live things killed  nonsense said maurice fiercely i am very angry indeed you naughty child promise  i cannot said phyllis beginning to cry  then said maurice i will not speak to you all day  no no shouted reginald we will only treat her like the horse stinger you wanted a puella mauricehere is one for you here give her a dose of the turpentine  yes said maurice advancing with his bottle and do you take the poker down to naylors to be sharpened it will just do to stick through her back  oh no not naylorsthe girls have made a hash there as they do everything else but we will settle her before they come out again  phyllis screamed and begged for mercyher last ally had deserted her  promise cried the boys  oh dont was all her answer  reginald caught her and held her fast maurice advanced upon her she struggled and gave a scream of real terror  the matter was no joke to any one but reginald for maurice was very angry and really meant to frighten her  hands off boys i will not have her bullied said claude half rising  maurice gave a violent start reginald looked round laughing and exclaimed who would have thought of claude sneaking there and phyllis ran to the protecting arm which he stretched out  to her great surprise he drew her to him and kissed her forehead saying well done phyl  oh i knew he was not going to hurt me said phyllis still panting from the struggle  to be sure not said maurice i only meant to have a little fun  claude with his arm still round his sisters waist gave maurice a look expressing is that the truth and reginald tumbled head over heels exclaiming i would not have been phyl just them  ada now came running up to them saying maurice and redgie you are to come in mr and mrs burnet heard your voices and begged to see you because they never saw you last holidays  mores the pity they should see us now said maurice  i shall not go said reginald  papa is there and he sent for you said ada  plague was the answer  see what you get by making such a row said claude  if you had been as orderly members of society as i am  oh but claude said ada papa told me to see if i could find you dear claude i wish she proceeded taking his hand and looking engaging i wish you would put your arm round me as you do round phyl  you are not worth it ada said reginald and claude did not contradict him    chapter viiithe brothers    but smiled to hear the creatures he had known so long were now in class and order shown  genus and species  is it meet said he this creatures name should one so sounding be  tis but a fly though firstborn of the spring bombylius majus dost thou call the thing  it was not till sunday that lilys eager wish was fulfilled of introducing her friend and her brothers but as she might have foreseen their first meeting did not make the perfections of either party very clear to the other  claude never spoke to strangers more than he could help maurice and reginald were in the room only a short time so that the result of miss westons observations when communicated in reply to lilys eager inquiries was only that claude was very like his father and eldest brother reginald very handsome and maurice looked like a very funny fellow  on monday reginald and maurice were required to learn what they had always refused to acknowledge that the holidays were not intended to be spent in idleness  a portion of each morning was to be devoted to study claude having undertaken the task of tutorand hard work he found it and much did lily pity him when as not unfrequently happened the summons to the childrens dinner would bring him from the study looking thoroughly faggedmaurice in so sulky a mood that he would hardly deign to open his lipsreginald talking fast enough indeed but only to murmur at his duties in terms which though they made every one laugh were painful to hear  then claude would take his brothers back to the study and not appear for an hour or more and when he did come forth it was with a bad headache  sometimes as if to show that it was only through their own fault that their tasks were wearisome one or both boys would finish quite early when reginald would betake himself to the schoolroom and employ his idle time in making it nearly impossible for ada and phyllis to learn by talking laughing teasing the canary overturning everything in pursuing wasps making emily fretful by his disobedience and then laughing at her and in short proving his right to the title he had given himself at the end of the only letter he had written since he first went to school and which he had subscribed your affectionate bother r mohun  so that for their own sake all would have preferred the inattentive mornings  lily often tried to persuade claude to allow her to tell her father how troublesome the boys were but never with any effect  he once took up a book he had been using with them and pointing to the name in the first page in writing which lily knew full well henry mohun she perceived that he meant to convince her that it was useless to try to dissuade him as he thought the patience and forbearance his brother had shown to him must be repaid by his not shrinking from the task he had imposed upon himself with his young brothers though he was often obliged to sit up part of the night to pursue his own studies  if claude had rather injudiciously talked too much to lilias of her principle and thus kept it alive in her mind yet his example might have made its fallacy evident  she believed that what she called love had been the turning point in his character that it had been his earnest desire to follow in henrys steps and so try to comfort his father for his loss that had roused him from his indolence but she was beginning to see that nothing but a sense of duty could have kept up the power of that first impulse for six years  lily began to enter a little into his principle and many things that occurred during these holidays made her mistrust her former judgment  she saw that without the unvarying principle of right and wrong fraternal love itself would fail in outward acts and words  forbearance though undeniably a branch of love could not exist without constant remembrance of duty and which of them did not sometimes fail in kindness meekness and patience  did emily show that softness which was her most agreeable characteristic in her whining reproofs in her complaints that no one listened to a word she saidin her refusal to do justice even to those who had vainly been seeking for peace  did lily herself show any of her much valued love by the sharp manner in which she scolded the boys for roughness towards herself or for language often used by them on purpose to make her displeasure a matter of amusement  she saw that her want of command of temper was a failure both in love and duty and when irritated the thought of duty came sooner to her aid than the feeling of love  and maurice and reginald were really very provoking  maurice loved no amusement better than teasing his sisters and this was almost the only thing in which reginald agreed with him  reginald was affectionate but too reckless and violent not to be very troublesome and he too often flew into a passion if maurice attempted to laugh at him the little girls were often frightened and made unhappy phyllis would scream and roar and ada would come sobbing to emily to be comforted after some rudeness of reginalds it was not very often that quarrels went so far but many a time in thought word and deed was the rule of love transgressed and more than once did emily feel ready to give up all her dignity to have eleanors hand over the boys once more  claude finding that he could do much to prevent mischief took care not to leave the two boys long together with the elder girls  they were far more inoffensive when separate as maurice never practised his tormenting tricks when no one was present to laugh with him and reginald was very kind to phyllis and ada although somewhat rude  it was a day or two after they returned that phyllis was leaning on the windowsill in the drawingroom watching a passing shower and admiring the soft bright tints of a rainbow upon the dark gray mass of cloud  i do set my bow in the cloud repeated she to herself over and over again until adeline entering the room she eagerly exclaimed oh ada come and look at this beautiful rainbow green and pink and purple  a double one with so many stripes ada  see there is a little bit more green  there is no green in a rainbow said ada  but look ada that is green  it is not real green  blue red and yellow are the pragmatic colours said ada with a most triumphant air  now are not they maurice said she turning to her brother who was as usual deep in entomology  pragmatic you foolish child said he  prismatic you mean  i am glad you remember what i tell you however i think i might teach you some science in time  you are right in saying that blue red and yellow are the prismatic colours  now do you know what causes a rainbow  it is to show there is never to be another flood said phyllis gravely  oh i did not mean that said maurice addressing himself to ada whose love of hard words made him deem her a promising pupil and whom he could lecture without interruption  the rainbow is caused by  but maurice exclaimed phyllis remaining with mouth wide open  the rainbow is occasioned by the refraction of the rays of the sun in the drops of water of which a cloud is composed  but maurice again said phyllis  well what do you keep on but mauricing about  but maurice i thought it said i do set my bow in the cloud  is not that right  i will look  i know that but i know the iris or rainbow is a natural phenomenon occasioned by the refraction  but maurice i cant bear you to say that and poor phyllis sat down and began to cry  ada interfered  why maurice you believe the bible dont you  this last speech was heard by lilias who just now entered the room and greatly surprised her  what can you be talking of said she  only some nonsense of the childrens said maurice shortly  but only hear what he says cried ada  he says the rainbow was not put there to show there is never to be another flood  now lily said maurice i do not think there is much use in talking to you but i wish you to understand that all i said was that the rainbow or iris is a natural phenomenon occasioned by the refraction of the solar  you will certainly bewilder yourself into something dreadful with that horrid science said lily  what is the matter with phyl  only crying because of what i said answered maurice  so childish and you are just as bad  but do you mean to say exclaimed lily that you set this human theory above the authority of the bible  it is common sense said maurice i could make a rainbow any day  whereupon phyllis cried the more and lily looked infinitely shocked this is philosophy and vain deceit said she the very thing that tends to infidelity  i cant help itit is universally allowed said the boy doggedly  it was fortunate that the next person who entered the room was claude and all at once he was appealed to by the four disputants lily the loudest and most vehement  claude listen to him and tell him to throw away these hateful new lights which lead to everything that is shocking  listen to him with three ladies talking at once said claude no not phylher tears only are eloquent but it is a mighty war about the token of peace and love lily  the love would be in driving these horrible philosophical speculations out of maurices mind said lily  no one can ever drive out the truth said maurice with provoking coolness  dont let her scratch out my eyes claude  i am not so sure of that maxim said claude  truth is chiefly injuredi mean her force weakened by her own supporters  then you agree with me said maurice as in fact every rational person must  then you are with me said lily in the same breath and you will convince maurice of the danger of this nonsense  umph sighed claude throwing himself into his fathers armchair tis a herculean labour  it seems i agree with you both  why every christian must be with me who has not lost his way in a mist of his own raising said lilias  do you mean to say said maurice that these colours are not produced by refraction  look at them on those prisms and he pointed to an oldfashioned lustre on the chimneypiece  i hope this is not a part of the christian faith  take care maurice and claudes eyes were bent upon him in a manner that made him shrink  and he added of course i do believe that chapter about noah  i only meant that the immediate cause of the rainbow is the refraction of light  i did not mean to be irreverent only the girls took me up in such a way  and i know well enough that you can make those colours by light on drops of water said lily  so you agreed all the time said claude  but added lily i never liked to know it for it always seemed to be explaining away the bible and i cannot bear not to regard that lovely bow as a constant miracle  you will remember said claude that some commentators say it should be i have set my bow in the cloud which would make what already existed become a token for the future  i dont like that explanation said lily  others say added claude that there might have been no rain at all till the windows of heaven were opened at the flood and in that case the first recurrence of rain must have greatly alarmed noahs family if they had not been supported and cheered by the sight of the rainbow  that is reasonable said maurice  i hate reason applied to revelation said lily  it is a happier state of mind which does not seek to apply it said claude looking at phyllis who had dried her tears and stood in the window gazing at him in the happy certainty that he was setting all right  maurice respected claude for his science as much as his character and did not make game of this observation as he would if it had been made by one of his sisters but he looked at him with an odd expression of perplexity  you do not think ignorant credulity better than reasonable belief said he at length  it is not i only who think most highly of childlike unquestioning faith maurice said claudefaith that is based upon love and reverence added he to lily  but come the shower is over and philosophers or no philosophers i invite you to walk in the wood  aye said maurice i daresay i can find some of the arachne species there  by the bye claude do you think papa would let me have a piece of plateglass eighteen by twenty to cover my case of insects  ask and you will discover said claude  accordingly maurice began the next morning at breakfast papa may i have a piece of plateglass eighteen by  but no one heard for emily was at the moment saying the westons are to dine here today  claude and maurice both looked blank  i persuaded papa to ask the westons said lily because i am determined that claude shall like alethea  you must expect that i shall not you have given me so many orders on the subject said claude  take care it has not the same effect as to tell maurice to like a book said emily nothing makes his aversion so certain  except when he takes it up by mistake and forgets that it has been recommended to him said claude  take care redgie with your knife dont put out my eyes in your ardour against that wretched wasp  wat greenwood may well say there is a terrible sight of waspses this year  i killed twentynine yesterday said reginald  and i will tell you what i saw said phyllis i was picking up apples and the wasps were flying all round and there came a hornet  vespa crabro cried maurice oh i must have one  well what of the hornet said mr mohun  ill tell you what resumed phyllis he saw a wasp flying and so he went up in the air and pounced on the poor wasp as the hawk did on janes bantam  so then he hung himself up to the branch of a tree by one of his legs and held the wasp with the other five and began to pack it up  first he bit off the yellow tail then the legs and threw them away and then there was nothing left but the head and so he flew away with it to his nest  which way did he go said maurice  to the old court answered phyllis i think the nest is in the roof of the old cowhouse for they were flying in and out there yesterday and one was eating out the wood from the old rails  well said mr mohun you must show me a hornet hawking for wasps before the nest is taken phyllis i suppose you have seen the wasps catching flies  oh yes papa but they pack them up quite differently  they do not hang by one leg but they sit down quite comfortably on a branch while they bite off the wings and legs  there maurice said mr mohun i had rather hear of one such wellobserved fact than of a dozen of your hard names and impaled insects  phyllis looked quite radiant with delight at his approbation  but papa said maurice may i have a piece of plateglass eighteen by twenty  when you observe facts in natural history perhaps i may say something to your entomology said mr mohun  but papa all my insects will be spoilt if i may not have a piece of glass eighteen by  he was interrupted by the arrival of the postbag which jane as usual opened  a letter from rotherwood said she i hope he is coming at last  he is said claude reading the letter but only from saturday till wednesday  he never gave us so little of his good company as he has this summer said emily  you will have them all in the autumn to comfort you said claude for he hereby announces the marvellous fact that the marchioness sends him to see if the castle is fit to receive her  are you sure he is not only believing what he wishes said mr mohun  i think he will gain his point at last said claude  how stupid of him to stay no longer said reginald  i think he has some scheme for this vacation said claude and i suppose he means to crowd all the beechcroft diversions of a whole summer into those few days  emily said mr mohun i wish him to know the carringtons invite them and the westons to dinner on tuesday  oh dont cried reginald  it will be so jolly to have him to take wasps nests and may i go out rabbitshooting with him  if he goes  and may i carry a gun  if it is not loaded said his father  indeed i would do no mischief said reginald  let me give you one piece of advice reginald said mr mohun with a mysterious airnever make rash promises  lilias was rather disappointed in her hopes that miss weston and claude would become better acquainted  at dinner the conversation was almost entirely between the elder gentlemen claude scarcely spoke except when referred to by his father or mr devereux  miss weston never liked to incur the danger of having to repeat her insignificant speeches to a deaf ear and being interested in the discussion that was going on she by no means seconded lilys attempt to get up an undercurrent of talk  in general lily liked to listen to conversation in silence but she was now in very high spirits and could not be quiet fortunately she had no interest in the subject the gentlemen were discussing so that she could not meddle with that and finding alethea silent and claude out of reach she turned to reginald and talked and tittered with him all dinnertime  in the drawingroom she had it all her own way and talked enough for all the sisters  have you heard that cousin rotherwood is coming  yes you said so before dinner  we hope said emily that you and mr weston will dine here on tuesday  the carringtons are coming and a few others  thank you said alethea i daresay papa will be very glad to come  have you ever seen rotherwood said lilias  never was the reply  do not expect much said lily laughing though she knew not why he is a very little fellow no one would suppose him to be twenty he has such a boyish look  then he never sits down  literally said emily  literally persisted lily such a quick person you never did see  is he at oxford  oh yes it was all papas doing that he was sent to eton  papa is his guardian  aunt rotherwood never would have parted with him  he is the only son interposed emily  uncle rotherwood put him quite in papas power aunt rotherwood wanted to keep him at home with a tutor and what she would have made of him i cannot think said lily and regardless of emilys warning frowns and aletheas attempt to change the subject she went on when he was quite a child he used to seem a realisation of all the naughty dicks and toms in storybooks  miss middleton had a perfect horror of his coming here for he would mind no one and played tricks and drew claude into mischief but he is quite altered since papa had the management of himoh such talks as papa has had with aunt rotherwooddo you know papa says no one knows what it is to lose a father but those who have the care of his children and aunt rotherwood is so provoking  here alethea determined to put an end to this oration and to emilys great relief she cut short the detail of lady rotherwoods offences by saying do you think faith longley likely to suit us if we took her to help the housemaid  are you thinking of taking her cried lily  yes for steady stupid household work faith would do very well she is just the stuff to make a servant offor dulness ever must be regulari mean for those who like mere steadiness better than anything more lovable  as alethea said laughing i must confess my respect for that quality mr devereux and claude entered the room  oh robert cried lily mrs weston is going to take faith longley to help the housemaid  you are travelling too fast lily said alethea she is only going to think about it  i should be very glad said mr devereux that faith should have a good place the longleys are very respectable people and they behaved particularly well in refusing to let this girl go and live with some dissenters at stoney bridge  i like what i have seen of the girl very much said miss weston  in spite of her sad want of feeling said robert smiling as he looked at lily  oh she is a good workaday sort of person said lily like all other poor people hard and passive  now do not set up your eyebrows claude i am quite serious there is no warmth about any except  so this is what lily is come to cried emily the grand supporter of the poor on poetical principles  the poor not affectionate said alethea  not compared within people whose minds and affections have been cultivated said lily  now just hear what mrs wall said to me only yesterday she asked for a black stuff gown out of the clothing club for said she i had a misfortune miss i thought it would be and tore my gown but it was i had a misfortune miss and lost my brother  a very harsh conclusion on very slight grounds said mr devereux  prove the contrary said lily  facts would scarcely demonstrate it either way said mr devereux they would only prove what was the case with individuals who chanced to come in our way and if we are seldom able to judge of the depth of feeling of those with whom we are familiar how much less of those who feel our presence a restraint  intense feeling mocks restraint said lily  violent not intense said mr devereux  besides you talk of cultivating the affections  now what do you mean  exercising them or talking about them  ah said emily the affection of a poor person is more tried we blame a poor man for letting his old mother go to the workhouse without considering how many of us would do the same if we had as little to live upon  still said alethea the same man who would refuse to maintain her if poor would not bear with her infirmities if rich  are the poor never infirm and peevish said mr devereux  oh how much worse it must be to bear with illtemper in poverty said emily when we think it quite wonderful to see a young lady kind and patient with a cross old relation what must it be when she is denying herself not only her pleasure but her food for her sake not merely sitting quietly with her all day and calling a servant to wait upon her but toiling all day to maintain her and keeping awake half the night to nurse her  those are realities indeed said alethea our greatest efforts seem but childs play in comparison  lilias could hardly have helped being sobered by this conversation if she had attended to it but she had turned away to repeat the story of mrs walls to jane and then fancying that the others were still remarking upon it she said in a light laughing tone well so far i agree with you  i know of a person who may well be called one of ourselves who i could quite fancy making such a speech  whom do you mean said mr devereux  alethea wished she did not know  no very distant relation said jane  do not talk nonsense jane said claude gravely  no nonsense at all claude cried jane in her very very pertest tone it is exactly like eleanor i am sure i can see her with her hands before her saying in her prim voice i must turn my old black silk and trim it with crape for i have had a misfortune and lost my brother  lilias said miss weston somewhat abruptly did you not wish to sing with me this evening  and thus she kept lilias from any further public mischief that evening  claude exceedingly vexed by what had passed with great injustice laid the blame upon miss weston and instead of rendering her the honour which she really deserved for the tact with which she had put an end to the embarrassment of all parties he fancied she was anxious to display her talents for music and thus only felt fretted by the sounds  mr weston and his daughter intended to walk home that evening as it was a beautiful moonlight night  oh let us convoy you exclaimed lilias i do long to show alethea a glowworm  will you come claude  may we papa  feel how still and warm it is  a perfect summer night not a breath stirring  mr mohun consented and lily almost hurried alethea upstairs to put on her bonnet and shawl  when she came down she found that the walking party had increased  jane and reginald would both have been in despair to have missed such a frolic maurice hoped to fall in with the droning beetle or to lay violent hands on a glowworm emily did not like to be left behind and even mr mohun was going being in the midst of an interesting conversation with mr weston lily with an absurd tragic gesture told alethea that amongst so many such a crowd all the grace and sweet influence of the walk was ruined  the sweet influence was ruined as far as lily was concerned but not by the number of her companions  it was the uneasy feeling caused by her overstrained spirits and foolish chattering that prevented her from really entering into the charm of the soft air the clear moon the solemn deep blue sky the few stars the white lilies on the dark pond the long shadows of the trees the freshness of the dewy fields  her simplicity and her genuine delight in the loveliness of the scene was gone for the time and though she spoke much of her enjoyment it was in a high flown affected style  when the last goodnight had been exchanged and lily had turned homeward she felt the stillness which succeeded their farewells almost oppressive she started at the dark shadow of a tree which lay across the path and to shake off a sensation of fear which was coming over her she put her arm within claudes exclaiming you naughty boy you will be stupid and silent say what i will  i heard enough tonight to strike me dumb said claude  for one moment lily thought he was in jest but the gravity of his manner showed her that he was both grieved and displeased and she changed her tone as she said oh  claude what do you mean  do you not know said claude  what you mean about eleanor said lily you must fall upon miss jenny thereit was her doing  janes tongue is a pest said claude but she was not the first to speak evil falsely of one to whom you owe everything  oh  lily i cannot tell you how that allusion of yours sounded  what allusion asked lily in alarm for she had never seen her gentle brother so angry  you know said he  indeed i do not exclaimed lily munch frightened  claude claude you must mistake i never could have said anything so very shocking  i hope i do said claude i could hardly believe that one of the little ones who cannot remember him could have referred to him in that waybut for you  him said lilias  i do not like to mention his name to one who regards him so lightly said claude  think over what passed if you are sufficiently come to yourself to remember it  after a little pause lily said in a subdued voice claude i hope you do not believe that i was thinking of what really happened when i said that  pray what were you thinking of  the abstract view of eleanors character  abstract nonsense said claude  a fine demonstration of the rule of love to go about the world slandering your sister  to go about the world  oh  claude it was only robert one of ourselves and alethea to whom i tell everything  so much the worse  i always rejoiced that you had no foolish young lady friend to make missish confidences to  she is no foolish young lady friend said lilias indignant in her turn she is five years older than i am and papa wishes us to be intimate with her  then the fault is in yourself said claude  you ought not to have told such things if they were true and being utterly false  but claude i cannot see that they are false  not false that eleanor cared not a farthing for harry cried claude shaking off lilys arm and stopping short  ohshe cared she really did care said lily as fast as she could speak  oh  claude how could you think that  i told you i did not mean what really happened only thateleanor is coldnot as warm as some peopleshe did care for him of course she didi know thati believe she loved him with all her heartbut yeti mean she did notshe went on as usualsaid nothingscarcely criedlooked the sametaught usneveroh it did not make half the difference in her that it did in william  i cannot tell how she behaved at the time said claude i only know i never had any idea what a loss harry was till i came home and saw her face  i used never to trouble myself to think whether people looked ill or well but the change in her did strike me  she was bearing up to comfort papa and to cheer william and to do her duty by all of us and you could take such noble resignation for want of feeling  lilias looked down and tried to speak but she was choked by her tears she could not bear claudes displeasure and she wept in silence  at last she said in a voice broken by sobs i was unjust i know eleanor was all kindnessall selfsacrificei have been very ungratefuli wish i could help itand you know well claude how far i am from regarding dear harry with indifferencehow the thought of him is a star in my mindhow happy it makes me to think of him at the end of the church militant prayer do not believe i was dreaming of him  and pray said claude laughing in his own goodhumoured way which of us is it that she is so willing to lose  oh claude no such thing said lily you know what i meant or did not mean  it was nonsensei hope nothing worse  lily felt that she might take his arm again  there was a little silence and then lily resumed in a timid voice i do not know whether you will be angry claude but honestly i do not think that ifthat eleanor would be so wretched about you as i should  eleanor knew harry better than you did no lily i never could have been what harry was even if i had never wasted my time and if my headaches had not interfered with my best efforts  i do not believe that say what you will said lily  ask william then said claude sighing  i am sure papa does not think so said lily no i cannot feel that harry is such a loss when we still have you  oh lily it is plain that you never knew harry said claude  i do not believe you ever didthat is one ting to be said for you  not as you did said lily remember he was six years older  then think how little we saw of him whilst they were abroad he was always at school or spending the holidays with aunt robert and latterly even farther off and only coming sometimes for an hour or two to see us  then he used to kiss us all round we went into the garden with him looked at him and were rather afraid of him then he walked off to wat greenwood came back wished us goodbye and away he went  yes said claude but after they came home  then he was a tall youth and we were silly girls said lilias he avoided miss middleton and we were always with her  he was good natured but he could not get on with us he did very well with the little ones but we were of the wrong age  he and william and eleanor were one faction we were another and you were between both he was too old too sublime too good too grave for us  too grave said claude i never heard a laugh so full of glee except perhaps phylliss  the last time he was at home continued lily we began to know him better there was no miss middleton in the way and after you and william were gone he used to walk with us and read to us  he read guy mannering to us and told us the story of sir maurice de mohun but the loss was not the same to us as to you elder ones and then sorrow was almost lost in admiration and in pleasure at the terms in which every one spoke of him  claude i have no difficulty in not wishing it otherwise he is still my brother and i would not change the feeling which the thought of his death gives meno not for himself in life and health  ah sighed claude you have no cause for selfreproachno reason to lament over wasted hours and love misspent  you will always talk of your old indolence as if it was a great crime said lily  it was my chief temptation said claude  as long as we know we are out of the path of duty it does not make much difference whether we have turned to the right hand or to the left  was it harrys death that made you look upon it in this light said lily  i knew it well enough before said claude it was what he had often set before me  indeed till i came home and saw this place without him i never really knew what a loss he was  at eton i did not miss him more than when he went to oxford and i did not dwell on what he was to papa or what i ought to be and even when i saw what home was without him i should have contented myself with miserable excuses about my health if it had not been for my confirmation then i awoke i saw my duty and the wretched way in which i had been spending my time  thoughts of harry and of my father came afterwards i had not vigour enough for them before  here they reached the house and partedclaude ashamed of having talked of himself for the first time in his life and lily divided between shame at her own folly and pleasure at claudes having thus opened his mind  jane who was most in fault escaped censure  her father was ignorant of her improper speech  emily forgot it and it was not claudes place to reprove his sisters though to lily he spoke as a friend  it passed away from her mind like other idle words which however could not but leave an impression on those who heard her  an unlookedfor result of the folly of this evening was that claude was prevented from appreciating miss weston he could not learn to like her nor shake off an idea that she was prying into their family concerns he thought her overpraised and would not even give just admiration to her singing because he had once fancied her eager to exhibit it  it was unreasonable to dislike his sisters friend for his sisters folly but claudes wisdom was not yet arrived at its full growth and he deserved credit for keeping his opinion to himself    chapter ixthe wasp    whom he hath blessed and called his own he tries them early look and tone    bent brow and throbbing heart tries them with pain  the next week lily had the pleasure of fitting out faith longley for her place at mrs westons  she rejoiced at this opportunity of patronising her because in her secret soul she felt that she might have done her a little injustice in choosing her own favourite esther in her stead  esthers popularity at the new court however made lilias confident in her own judgment the servants liked her because she was quick and obliging mr mohun said she looked very neat phyllis liked her because a mischance to her frock was not so brave an offence with her as with rachel and ada was growing very fond of her because she was in the habit of bestowing great admiration on her golden curls as she arranged them and both little girls were glad not to be compelled to put away the playthings they took out  maurice and reginald had agreed to defer their onslaught on the wasps till lord rotherwoods arrival and the war was now limited to attacks on foraging parties  reginald most carefully marked every nest about the garden and farm and on his cousins arrival on saturday evening began eagerly to give him a list of their localities  lord rotherwood was as ardent in the cause as even reginald could desire and would have instantly set out with him to reconnoitre had not the evening been rainy  then turning to claude he said but i have not told you what brought me here i came to persuade you to make an expedition with me up the rhine i set off next week i would not write about it because i knew you would only say you should like it very much but some but that meant it was a great deal too much trouble  how fast the plan has risen up said claude i heard nothing of it when i was with you  oh it only came into my head last week but i do not see what there is to wait for second thoughts are never best  oh claude how delightful said lily  claude stirred his tea meditatively and did not speak  it is too much trouble i perceive said lord rotherwood just as i told you  not exactly said claude  lord rotherwood now detailed his plan to his uncle who said with a propitious smile well claude what do you think of it  mind you catch a firefly for me said maurice  why dont you answer claude said lilias only imagine seeing undines castle  eh claude said his father  it would be very pleasant said claude slowly but  what said mr mohun  only a but said the marquis  i hope he will have disposed of it by the morning i start next tuesday week i would not go later for the universe we shall be just in time for the summer in its beauty and to have a peep at switzerland  we shall not have time for mont blanc without rattling faster than any man in his senses would do i do not mean to leave any place till i have thoroughly seen twice over everything worth seeing that it contains  then perhaps you will get as far as antwerp and spend the rest of the holidays between the cathedral and paul potters bull  no i shall have nothing to say to you at that rate said claude  depend upon it it will be you that will wish to stand still when i had rather be on the move said the marquis  then you had better leave me behind  i have no intention of being hurried over the world and never having my own way said claude trying to look surly  i am sure i should not mind travelling twice over the world to see cologne cathedral or the field of waterloo said lily  let me only show him my route said lord rotherwood  redgie look in my greatcoat pocket in the hall for murrays handbook will you  go and get it phyl said reginald who was astride on the window sill peeling a stick  away darted lord rotherwood to fetch it himself but phyllis was before him her merry laugh was heard as he chased her round the hall to get possession of his book throwing down two or three cloaks to intercept her path  mr mohun took the opportunity of his absence to tell claude that he need not refuse on the score of expense  thank you was all claudes answer  lord rotherwood returned and after punishing the discourteous reginald by raising him up by his ears he proceeded to give a full description of the delights of his expedition the girls joining heartily with him in declaring it as well arranged as possible and bringing all their knowledge of german travels to bear upon it claude sometimes put in a word but never as if he cared much about the matter and he was not to be persuaded to give any decided answer as to whether he would accompany the marquis  the next morning at breakfast lord rotherwood returned to the charge but claude seemed even more inclined to refuse than the day before lilias could not divine what was the matter with him and lingered long after her sisters had gone to school to hear what answer he would make and when mr mohun looked at his watch and asked her if she knew how late it was she rose from the breakfasttable with a sigh and thought while she was putting on her bonnet how much less agreeable the school had been since the schism in the parish  and besides now that faith and esther and one or two others of her best scholars had gone away from school there seemed to be no one of any intelligence or knowledge left in the class except marianne weston who knew too much for the others and one or two clever inattentive little girls  lily almost disliked teaching them  phyllis and adeline were in miss westons class and much did they delight in her teaching  there was a quiet earnestness in her manner which attracted her pupils and fixed their attention so as scarcely to allow the careless room for irreverence while mere cleverness seemed almost to lose its advantage in learning what can only truly be entered into by those whose conduct agrees with their knowledge  phyllis never dreamt that she could be happy while standing still and learning till miss weston began to teach at the sunday school obedience at school taught her to acquire habits of reverent attention which gradually conquered the idleness and weariness which had once possessed her at church  first she learnt to be interested in the historical lessons then never to lose her place in the psalms then to think about and follow some of the prayers by this time she was far from feeling any fatigue at all on weekdays she had succeeded in restraining any contortions to relieve herself from the irksomeness of sitting still and had her thoughts in tolerable order through the greater part of the sunday service and now it was her great wish unknown to any one to abstain from a single yawn through the whole service including the sermon  her place chosen for her by eleanor when first she had begun to go to church as far as possible from reginald was at the end of the seat between her papa and the wall  this morning as she put her arm on the bookboard while rising from kneeling she felt a sudden thrill of sharp pain smear her left elbow which made her start violently and would have caused a scream had she not been in church  she saw a wasp fall on the ground and was just about to put her foot on it when she recollected where she was  she had never in her life intentionally killed anything and this was no time to begin in that place and when she was angry  the pain was severemore so perhaps than any she had felt beforeand very much frightened she pulled her papas coat to draw his attention  but her first pull was so slight that he did not feel it and before she gave a second she remembered that she could not make him hear what was the matter without more noise than was proper  no she must stay where she was and try to bear the pain and she knew that if she did try help would be given her  she proceeded to find out the psalm and join her voice with the others though her heart was beating very fast her forehead was contracted and she could not help keeping her right hand clasped round her arm and sometimes shifting from one foot to the other  the sharpness of the pain soon went off she was able to attend to the lessons and hoped it would soon be quite well but as soon as she began to think about it it began to ache and throb and seemed each moment to be growing hotter  the sermon especially tried her patience her cheeks were burning she felt sick and hardly able to hold up her head yet she would not lean it against the wall because she had often been told not to do so  she was exceedingly alarmed to find that her arm had swelled so much that she could hardly bend it and it had received the impression of the gathers of her sleeve she thought no sermon had ever been so long but she sat quite still and upright as she could not have done had she not trained herself unconsciously by her efforts to leave off the trick of kicking her heels together  she did not speak till she was in the churchyard and then she made emily look at her arm  my poor child it is frightful said emily what is the matter  a wasp stung me just before the psalms said phyllis and it goes on swelling and swelling and it does pant  what is the matter asked mr mohun  papa just look said emily a wasp stung this dear child quite early in the service and she has been bearing it all this time in silence  why did you not show me phyl  because it was in church said the little girl  why phyllis you are a very spartan said lord rotherwood  something better than a spartan said mr mohun  does it give you much pain now my dear  not so bad as in church said phyllis only i am very tired and it is so hot  we will help you home then said mr mohun  as he took her up in his arms phyllis laughed thanked him replied to various inquiries from her sisters and the westonslaughed again at sundry jokes from her brothers then became silent and was almost asleep with her head on her papas shoulder by the time they reached the halldoor she thought it very strange to be laid down on the sofa in the drawingroom and to find every one attending to her  mrs weston bathed her forehead with lavenderwater and lily cut open the sleeve of her frock jane fetched all manner of remedies and emily pitied her  she was rather frightened  she thought such a fuss would not be made about her unless she was very ill she was faint and tired and was glad when mrs weston proposed that they should all come away and leave her to go to sleep quietly  marianne was so absorbed in admiration of phyllis that she did not speak one word all the way from church to the new court and stood in silence watching the operations upon her friend till mrs weston sent every one away  adeline rather envied phyllis she would willingly have endured the pain to be made of so much importance and said to be better than a spartan which must doubtless be something very fine indeed  phyllis was waked by the bells ringing for the afternoon service mrs weston was sitting by her reading claude came to inquire for her and to tell her that as she had lost her early dinner she was to join the rest of the party at six  to her great surprise she felt quite well and fresh and her arm was much better mrs weston pinned up her sleeve and she set off with her to church wondering whether ada would remember to tell her what she had missed that afternoon at school  those whose approbation was valuable honoured phyllis for her conduct but she did not perceive it or seek for it she did not look like a heroine while running about and playing with reginald and the dogs in the evening but her papa had told her she was a good child claude had given her one of his kindest smiles and she was happy  even when esther was looking at the mark left by the sting and telling her that she was sure miss marianne weston would have not been half so good her simple humble spirit came to her aid and she answered ill tell you what esther marianne would have behaved much better for she is older and never fidgets and she would not have been angry like me and just going to kill the wasp    chapter xcousin rotherwood    we care not who says    and intends it dispraise that an angler to a fool is next neighbour  in the evening lord rotherwood renewed his entreaties to claude to join him on his travels  he was very much bent on taking him for his own pleasure depended not a little on his cousins company claude lay on the glassy slope of the terrace while lord rotherwood paced rapidly up and down before him persuading him with all the allurements he could think of and looking the picture of impatience lily sat by adding her weight to all his arguments  but claude was almost contemptuous to all the beauties of germany and all the promised sights he scarcely gave himself the trouble to answer his tormentors only vouchsafing sometimes to open his lips to say that he never meant to go to a country where people spoke a language that sounded like cracking walnuts that he hated steamers had no fancy for tumbledown castles that it was so common to travel there was more distinction in staying at home that the field of waterloo had been spoilt and was not worth seeing his ideas of glaciers would be ruined by the reality and he did not care to see cologne cathedral till it was finished  on this lily set up an outcry of horror  one comfort is lily said lord rotherwood he does not mean it he did not say it from the bottom of his heart  now confess you did not claude  claude pretended to be asleep  i see plainly enough said the marquis to lily it is as wat greenwood says mr reynold and the grapes  but it is not said lily and that is what provokes me papa says he is quite welcome to go if he likes and that he thinks it will do him a great deal of good but that foolish boy will say nothing but i will think about it and thank you  then i give him up as regularly dense  it is the most delightful plan ever thought of said lily so easily done and just bringing within his compass all he ever wished to see  oh his sole ambition is to stretch those long legs of his on the grass like a great vegetable marrow said lord rotherwood  it is vegetating like a plant that makes him so much taller than any rational creature with a little animal life  i think jane has his share of curiosity said lily i am sure i had no idea that anything belonging to us could be so stupid  well said the marquis i shall not go  no said lily  no i shall certainly not go  nonsense said claude waking from his pretended sleep why do you not ask travers to go with you  he would like nothing better  he is a botanist and would bore me with looking for weeds  no i will have you or stay at home  claude proposed several others as companions but lord rotherwood treated them all with as much disdain as claude had shown for germany and ended with now claude you know my determination only tell me why you will not go  then i do tell you rotherwood the truth is that those boys maurice and reginald are perfectly unmanageable when they are left alone with the girls  have a tutor for them said the marquis  very much obliged to you they would be for the suggestion said claude  oh but claude said lily  i really cannot go  they mind no one but the baron and me and besides that it would be no small annoyance to the house ten tutors could not keep them from indescribable bits of mischief  i undertook them these holidays and i mean to keep them  lilias was just flying off to her father when claude caught hold of her saying i desire you will not and she stood still looking at her cousin in dismay  it is all right cried the marquis joyfully it is only to set off three weeks later  oh i thought you would not go a week later for the universe said claude smiling  not for the universe but for u said lord rotherwood  worthy of a companion true of the university of gottingen said claude but rotherwood do you really mean that it will make no difference to you  none whatever i meant to spend three weeks with my mother at the end of the tour and i shall spend them now instead  i only talked of going immediately because nothing is done at all that is not done quickly and i hate delays but it is all the same and now it stands for tuesday three weeks  now we shall see what he says to cologne lily  claude sprung up and began talking over arrangements and possibilities with zest which showed what his wishes had been from the first  all was quickly settled and as soon as his father had given his cordial approbation to the scheme it was amusing to see how animated and active claude became and in how different a style he talked of the once slighted rhine  lord rotherwood told the boys that their brother was a great deal too good for them but they never troubled themselves to ask in what respect lilias took very great delight in telling emily of the sacrifice which he had been willing to make and looked forward to talking it over with alethea but she refrained as long as he was at home as she knew it would greatly displease him and she had heard enough about missish confidences  the marquis of rotherwood was certainly the very reverse of his chosen travelling companion in the matter of activity  he made an appointment with the two boys to get up at halfpast four on monday morning for some fishing before the sun was too highmaurice not caring for the sport but intending to make prize of any of the insect youth which might prefer the sunrise for their gambols and reginald in high delight at the prospect of real fishing something beyond his own performances with a stick and a string in pursuit of minnows in the ditches  reginald was making contrivances for tying a string round his wrist and hanging the end of it from the window that andrew grey might give it a pull as he went by to his work to wake him when lord rotherwood exclaimed what cannot you wake yourself at any time you please  no said reginald i never heard of any one that could  then i advise you to learn the art in the meantime i will call you tomorrow  loud voices and laughter in the hall and the front door creaking on its hinges at sunrise convinced the household that this was no vain boast before breakfast was quite over the fishermen were seen approaching the house  lord rotherwood was an extraordinary figure in an old shooting jacket of his uncles an enormous pair of fishingboots of williams and the broadbrimmed straw hat which always hung up in the hall and was not claimed by any particular owner  maurice displayed to jane the contents of two phials strange little creatures with stranger names of which he was as proud as reginald of his three fine trout  lord rotherwood did not appear till he had made himself look like other people which he did in a surprisingly short time  he began estimating the weight of the fish and talking at his most rapid rate till at last claude said phyllis told us just now that you were coming back for that she heard cousin rotherwood talking and it proved to be janes old turkey cock gobbling  no bad compliment said emily for phyllis was once known to say on hearing a turkey cock how melodiously that nightingale sings  no no that was ada said lilias  i could answer for that said claude  phyllis is too familiar with both parties to mistake their notes  besides she never was known to use such a word as melodiously  do you remember said the marquis that there was some great lawyer who had three kinds of handwriting one that the public could read one that only his clerk could read and one that nobody could read  i suppose i am the clerk said claude unless i divide the honour with florence  i do not think i am unintelligible anywhere but here said lord rotherwood  there is nothing sufficiently exciting at home if grosvenor square is to be called home  sometimes you do it without knowing it said lily  yes said claude when you do not exactly know what you are going to say  then it is no bad plan said lord rotherwood  people are satisfied and you dont commit yourself  ill tell you what cousin rotherwood exclaimed phyllis your hand is bleeding  is it  thank you phyllis i thought i had washed it off  now do find me some sealingwaxindiarub herstickingplaster i mean  oh  rotherwood said emily what a bad cut how did it happen  only i am the victim to maurices first essay in fishing  just fancy what an awkward fellow maurice is said reginald he had but one throw and he managed to stick the hook into rotherwoods hand  one of those barbed hooks  oh rotherwood how horrid said emily  and he cut it out with his knife and caught that great trout with it directly said reginald  and neither half drowned maurice nor sent him home again asked lily  i contented myself with taking away his weapon said the marquis and he wished for nothing better than to poke about in the gutters for insects it was only redgie that teased him into the nobler sport  emily was inclined to make a serious matter of the accident but her cousin said ten words while she said one and by the time her first sentence was uttered she found him talking about his ride to devereux castle  he and claude set out as soon as breakfast was over and came back about three oclock claude was tired with the heat and betook himself to the sofa where he fell asleep under pretence of reading but the indefatigable marquis was ready and willing to set out with reginald and wat greenwood to shoot rabbits  dinnertime came and emily sat at the drawingroom window with claude and lilias lamenting her cousins bad habits  nothing will ever make him punctual said she  i am in duty bound to let you say nothing against him said claude  it is very goodnatured in him to wait for you said lily but it would be horribly selfish to leave you behind  delay is his great horror said claude and the wonder of his character is that he is not selfish  no one had ever better training for it  he does like his own way very much said lilias  who does not said claude  nothing shows his sense so much said emily as his great attachment to papathe only person who ever controlled him  and to claudehis opposite in everything said lilias  i think he will tire you to death in germany said emily  never fear said claude my vis inertiae is enough to counterbalance any amount of restlessness  here they come said lily how wat greenwood is grinning at rotherwoods jokes  a happy day for wat said emily  he will be quite dejected if william is not at home next shooting season  he thinks you a degenerate mohun claude  he must comfort himself with redgie said claude  rotherwood is only eager about shooting in common with everything else said lily but redgie i fear will care for nothing else  lord rotherwood came in accounting for being late as in passing through a harvest field he could not help attempting to reap  the beechcroft farming operations had been his especial amusement from very early days and his plans were numerous for farming on a grand scale as soon as he should be of age  his talk during dinner was of turnips and wheat till at length mr mohun asked him what he thought of the appearance of the castle  he said it was very forlorn the rooms looked so dreary and deserted that he could not bear to be in them and had been out of doors almost all the time  indeed he was afraid he had disappointed the housekeeper by not complimenting her as she deserved for the freezing dismal order in which she kept everything  and really said he i must go again tomorrow and make up for it and emily you must come with me and try to devise something to make the unhappy place less like the abode of the prince of the black islands  emily willingly promised to go and she went on talking to him and telling him whom he was to meet on the next day when an unusual silence making her look up she beheld him more than half asleep  reginald fidgeted and sighed and maurice grew graver and graver as they thought of the wasps  maurice wanted to take a nest entire and began explaining his plan to claude  you see claude burning some straw and then digging spoils the combs as wat does it now i have got some puffballs and sulphur to put into the hole and set fire to them with a lucifer match so as to stifle the wasps and then dig them out quietly tomorrow morning  it is all of no use if that rotherwood will do nothing but sleep said reginald in a disconsolate tone  you should not have made him get up at four said emily  who  i exclaimed the marquis  i never was wider awake  what are you waiting for reginald  i thought you were going to take wasps nests  you are much too tired i am sure said emily  tired not in the least i have done nothing today to tire me said lord rotherwood walking up and down the room to keep himself awake  the whole party went out and found wat greenwood waiting for them with a bundle of straw a spade and a little gunpowder  maurice carried a basket containing all his preparations on which wat looked with supreme contempt telling him that his puffs were too green to make a smeech  maurice not condescending to argue the point ran on to a nest which reginald had marked on one of the green banks of the ancient moat  take care that the wasps are all come in mind what you are about maurice called his father  master maurice shouted wat you had better take a green bough  never mind wat said lord rotherwood he would not stay long enough to use it if he had it  reginald ran after maurice who had just reached the nest  there is one coming in the evening is so warm they are not quiet yet  ill quiet them said maurice kneeling down and putting his first puffball into the hole  reginald stood by with a sly smile as he pulled a branch off a neighbouring filberttree  the next moment maurice gave a sudden yell the wasps the wasps and jumping up and tripping at his first step rolled down the bank and landed safely at lord rotherwoods feet  the shouts of laughter were loud but he regarded them not and as soon as he recovered his feet rushed past his sisters and never stopped till he reached the house  redgie stood alone in the midst of a cloud of wasps beating them off with a bough roaring with laughter and calling wat to bring the straw to burn them  no no redgie come away leave them for maurice to try again said his father  the brute he stung me cried reginald knocking down a wasp or two as he came down  what is this added he as he stumbled over something at the bottom of the slope  oh  maurices basket look herelaudanumdid he mean to poison the wasps  no said jane to cure their stings  the poor unhappy quiz cried reginald  while the others were busy over a nest mr mohun asked emily how the boy got at the medicine chest  emily looked confused and said she supposed jane had given him a bottle  jane is too young to be trusted there said mr mohun i thought you knew better do not let the key be out of your possession again  after a few more nests had been taken in the usual manner they returned to the house  maurice was lying on the sofa reading the penny magazine from which he raised his eyes no more that evening in spite of all the jokes which flew about respecting wounded knights courage and the balsam of fierabras  he called jane to teach her how flies were made and as soon as tea was over he went to bed  reginald after many yawns prepared to follow his example and as he was wishing his sisters goodnight emily said now redgie do not go out at such a preposterous hour tomorrow morning  what is that to you was reginalds courteous inquiry  i do not wish to see every one fast asleep tomorrow evening said emily and she looked at her cousin whose head was far back over his chair  he is a trojan said reginald  is a trojan better than a spartan asked ada meditatively  helen thought so said claude  when greek meets greek then comes the tug of war muttered the marquis  you are all talking greek said jane  arabic said claude  as far as it could be comprehended lord rotherwoods answer related to maurice and the wasps  there said emily what is to be done if he is in that condition tomorrow  i am not asleep what makes you think i am  i wish you would sit in that great chair said emily i am afraid you will break your neck you look so uncomfortable i cannot bear to see you  i never was more comfortable in my life said lord rotherwood asleep while finishing the sentence but this time happily with his elbows on the table and his head in a safer position  the next day was spent rather more rationally  lord rotherwood met with a book of irish tales with which he became so engrossed that he did not like to leave it when emily and claude were ready to ride to devereux castle with him  when there he was equally eager and vehement about each matter that came under consideration and so many presented themselves that emily began to be in agonies lest she should not be at home in time to dress and receive her guests  they did however reach the house before lilias who had been walking with miss weston came in and when she went upstairs she found emily full of complaints at the inconvenience of having no rachel to assist her in dressing and to see that everything was in order and that phyllis was fit to appear when she came down in the evening but by the assistance of lily and jane she got over her troubles and when she went into the drawingroom she was much relieved to find her two gentlemen quite safe and dressed  she had been in great fear of lord rotherwoods straying away to join in some of reginalds sports and was grateful to the irish book for keeping him out of mischief  emily was in her glory it was the first large dinnerparty since eleanor had gone and though she pitied herself for having the trouble of entertaining the people she really enjoyed the feeling that she now appeared as the mistress of new court with her cousin the marquis by her side to show how highly she was connected  and everything went off just as could be wished  lord rotherwood talked intelligibly and sensibly and mr mohuns neighbour at dinner had a voice which he could hear  lilys pleasure was not less than her sisters though of a different kind  she delighted in thinking how well emily did the honours in watching the varied expression of lord rotherwoods animated countenance in imagining claudes forehead to be finer than that of any one else and in thinking how people must admire reginalds tall active figure and very handsome face  she was asked to play and did tolerably well but was too shy to sing nor indeed was reginald encouraging  what is the use of your singing lily  if it was like miss westons now  reginald had taken a great fancy to miss weston he stood by her all the evening and afterwards let her talk to him and then began to chatter himself at last becoming so confidential as to impart to her the grand object of his ambition which was to be taller than claude  the next morning lord rotherwood left beechcroft somewhat to emilys relief for though she was very proud of him and much enjoyed the dignity of being seen to talk familiarly with him yet when no strangers were present and he became no more than an ordinary cousin she was worried by his incessant activity and desire to see know and do everything as fast and as thoroughly as possible  she could not see the use of such vehemence she liked to take things in a moderate way and as claude said much preferred the passive to the active voice  claude on the contrary was ashamed of his constitutional indolence looked on it as a temptation and struggled against it almost envying his cousin his unabated eagerness and untiring energy and liking to be with him because no one else so effectually roused him from his habitual languor  his indolence was however so much the effect of ill health that exertion was sometimes scarcely in his power especially in hot weather and by the time his brothers studies were finished each day he was unfit for anything but to lie on the grass under the planetree  the days glided on and the holidays came to an end maurice spent them in adding to his collection of insects which with janes assistance he arranged very neatly and reginald and phyllis performed several exploits more agreeable to themselves than satisfactory to the more rational part of the new court community at the same time reginalds devotion to miss weston increased he never moved from her side when she sang did not fail to be of the party when she walked with his sisters offered her one of his own puppies named his little ship alethea and was even tolerably civil to marianne  at length the day of departure came the boys returned to school claude joined lord rotherwood and the new court was again in a state of tranquillity    chapter xidancing    prescribe us not our duties  well phyllis said her father as he passed through the hall to mount his horse how do you like the prospect of monsieur le rois instructions  not at all papa answered phyllis running out to the hall door to pat the horse and give it a piece of bread  take care you turn out your toes said mr mohun  you must learn to dance like a dragon before cousin rotherwoods birthday next year  papa how do dragons dance  that is a question i must decide at my leisure said mr mohun mounting  stand out of the way phyl or you will feel how horses dance  away he rode while phyllis turned with unwilling steps to the nursery to be dressed for her first dancing lesson marianne weston was to learn with her and this was some consolation but phyllis could not share in the satisfaction adeline felt in the arrival of monsieur le roi  jane was also a pupil but lily whose recollections of her own dancing days were not agreeable absented herself entirely from the dancingroom even though alethea weston had come with her sister  poor phyllis danced as awkwardly as was expected but adeline seemed likely to be a pupil in whom a master might rejoice marianne was very attentive and not ungraceful but alethea soon saw reason to regret the arrangement that had been made for she perceived that jane considered the master a fair subject for derision and her nods and becks and wreathed smiles called up corresponding looks in mariannes face  oh brownie you are a naughty thing said emily as soon as m le roi had departed  he really was irresistible said jane  i suppose ridicule is one of the disagreeables to which a dancing master makes up his mind said alethea  yes said jane one can have no compunction in quizzing that species  i do not think i can quite say that jane said miss weston  this man especially lays himself open to ridicule said jane do you know alethea that he is an englishman and his name is king only he calls himself le roi and speaks broken english  though alethea joined in the general laugh she did not feel quite satisfied she feared that if not checked in time jane would proceed to actual impertinence and that marianne would be tempted to follow her example but she did not like to interfere and only advised marianne to be on her guard hoping that emily would also speak seriously to her sister  on the next occasion however jane ventured still farther her grimaces were almost irresistible and she had a most comical manner of imitating the masters attitudes when his eye was not upon her and putting on a demure countenance when he turned towards her which sorely tried marianne  what shall i do alethea said the little girl as the sisters walked home together i do not know how to help laughing if jane will be so very funny  i am afraid we must ask mamma to let us give up the dancing replied alethea the temptation is almost too strong and i do not think she would wish to expose you to it  but alethea why do not you speak to jane asked marianne no one seems to tell her it is wrong miss mohun was almost laughing  i do not think jane would consider that i ought to find fault with her said alethea  but you would not scold her urged marianne only put her in mind that it is not right not kind that monsieur le roi is in authority over her for the time  i will speak to mamma said alethea perhaps it will be better next time  and it was better for mr mohun happening to be at home was dragged into the dancingroom by emily and ada  once when she thought he was looking another way jane tried to raise a smile but a stern jane what are you thinking of recalled her to order and when the lesson was over her father spoke gravely to her telling her that he thought few things more disgusting in a young lady than impertinence towards her teachers and then added miss weston i hope you keep strict watch over these giddy young things  awed by her father jane behaved tolerably well at that time and the next and miss weston hoped her interference would not be needed but as if to make up for this restraint her conduct a fortnight after was quite beyond bearing  she used every means to make marianne laugh and at last went so far as to pretend to think that m le roi had not understood what she said in english and to translate it into french  poor marianne looked imploringly at her sister and alethea hoped that emily would interpose but emily was turning away her head to conceal a laugh and miss weston was obliged to give jane a very grave look which she perfectly understood though she pretended not to see it  when the exercise was over miss weston made her a sign to approach and said jane do you think your papa would have liked  what do you mean said jane i have not been laughing  you know what i mean said alethea and pray do not be displeased if i ask you not to make it difficult for marianne to behave properly  jane drew up her head and went back to her place  she played no more tricks that day but as soon as the guests were gone began telling lilias how miss weston had been meddling and scolding her  and well you must have deserved it said lily  i do not say that jenny was right said emily but i think miss weston might allow me to correct my own sister in my own house  you correct jane cried lily and jane laughed  i only mean said emily that it was not very polite and papa says the closest friendship is no reason for dispensing with the rules of politeness  certainly not said lily the rules of politeness are rules of love and it was in love that alethea spoke she sees how sadly we are left to ourselves and is kind enough to speak a word in season  perhaps said jane since it was in love that she spoke you would like to have her for our reprover for ever and i can assure you more unlikely things have happened  i have heard it from one who can judge  let me hear no more of this said emily it is preposterous and ridiculous and very disrespectful to papa  jane for once rather shocked at her own words went back to what had been said just before  then perhaps you would like to have eleanor back again  i am sure you want some one to put you in mind of your duty said lily  eleanor and duty cried emily you who thought so much of the power of love  of emily and love she would say if it sounded well said jane  i cannot see what true love you or jane are showing now said lily it is no kindness to encourage her pertness or to throw away a friendly reproof because it offends your pride  nobody reproved me replied emily besides i know love will prevail for my sake jane will not expose herself and me to a strangers interference  if you depend upon that i wish you joy said lilias as she left the room  what a weathercock lily is cried jane she has fallen in love with alethea weston and echoes all she says  not considering her own inconsistency said emily  that alethea weston exclaimed jane in an angry tonebut emily beginning to recover some sense of propriety said jenny you know you were very illbred and you made it difficult for the little ones to behave well  not our own little ones said jane honest phyl did not understand the joke and ada was thinking of her attitudes one comfort is that i shall be confirmed in three weeks time and then people cannot treat me as a mere childlittle as i am  oh  jane said emily i do not like to hear you talk of confirmation in that light way  no no said jane i do not mean itof course i do not mean it dont look shockedit was only by the byeand another by the bye emily you know i must have a cap and white ribbons and i am afraid i must make it myself  ay that is the worst of having esther said emily she and hannah have no notion of anything but the plainest work i am sure if i had thought of all the trouble of that kind which having a young girl would entail i would never have consented to esthers coming  that was entirely lilys scheme said jane  yes it is impossible to resist lily she is so eager and anxious and it would have vexed her very much if i had opposed her and that i cannot bear besides esther is a very nice girl and will learn  there is robert talking to papa on the green said jane what a deep conference what can it be about  if jane had heard that conversation she might have perceived that she could not wilfully offend even in what she thought a trifling matter without making it evident even to others that there was something very wrong about her  at that moment the rector was saying to his uncle i am in doubt about jane i cannot but fear she is not in a satisfactory state for confirmation and i wished to ask you what you think  act just as you would with any of the village girls said mr mohun  i should be very sorry to do otherwise said mr devereux but i thought you might like since every one knows that she is a candidate that she should not be at home at the time of the confirmation if it is necessary to refuse her  no said mr mohun i should not wish to shield her from the disgrace  it may be useful to her and besides it will establish your character for impartiality  i have not been satisfied with all i saw of little jane for some time past and i am afraid that much passes amongst my poor girls which never comes to my knowledge  her pertness especially is probably restrained in my presence  it is not so much the pertness that i complain of said mr devereux for that might be merely exuberance of spirits but there is a sort of habitual irreverence which makes one dread to bring her nearer to sacred tings  i know what you mean said mr mohun and i think the pertness is a branch of it more noticed because more inconvenient to others  yes said mr devereux i think the fault i speak of is most evident when there is occasion to reprove her i am always baffled by a kind of levity which makes every warning glance aside  then i should decidedly say refuse her said mr mohun  it would be a warning that she could not disregard and the best chance of improving her  yet said mr devereux if she is eager for confirmation and regards it in its proper light it is hard to say whether it is right to deny it to her it may give her the depth and earnestness which she needs  poor child said mr mohun she has great disadvantages i am quite sure our present system is not fit for her  things shall be placed on a different footing and in another year or two i hope she may be fitter for confirmation  however before you finally decide i should wish to have some conversation with her and speak to you again  that is just what i wish said mr devereux    chapter xiithe fever    jane borrowed maxims from a doubting school and took for truth the test of ridicule  the question of janes confirmation was decided in an unexpected manner for the day after mr mohuns conversation with his nephew she was attacked by a headache and sore throat spent a feverish night and in the morning was so unwell that a medical man was sent for from raynham  on his arrival he pronounced that she was suffering from scarlet fever and emily began to feel the approach of the same complaint  phyllis and adeline were shut up in the drawingroom and a system of quarantine established which was happily brought to a conclusion by a note from mrs weston who kindly begged that they might be sent to her at broomhill and mr mohun gladly availing himself of the offer the little girls set off so well pleased to make a visit alone as almost to forget the occasion of it  mrs weston had extended her invitation to lilias but she begged to be allowed to remain with her sisters and mr mohun thought that she had been already so much exposed to the infection that it was useless for her to take any precautions  she was therefore declared head nurse and it was well that she had an energetic spirit and so sweet a temper that she was ready to sympathise with all emilys petulant complaints and even to find fault with herself for not being in two places at once  two of the maids were ill and the whole care of emily and jane devolved upon her with only the assistance of esther  emily was not very seriously ill but janes fever was very high and lily thought that her father was more anxious than he chose to appear  of janes own thoughts little could be guessed she was often delirious and at all times speaking was so painful that she said as little as possible  lilys troubles seemed at their height one sunday afternoon while her father was at church  she had been reading the psalms and lessons to emily and she then rose to return to jane  do not go entreated emily  i will send esther  esther is of no use  and therefore i do not like to leave her so long alone with jane pray spare me a little smile  then come back soon  lily was glad to escape with no more objections  she found jane complaining of thirst but to swallow gave her great pain and she required so much attendance for some little time that emilys bell was twice rung before esther could be spared to go to her  she soon came back saying miss mohun wants you directly miss lilias  tell her i will come presently said lily who had one hand pressed on janes burning temples while the other was sprinkling her with ether  stay said jane faintly and esther left the room  jane drew her breath with so much difficulty that a dreadful terror seized upon lily lest she should be suffocated  she raised her head and supported her till esther could bring more pillows  esther brought a message from emily to hasten her return but jane could not be left and the grateful look she gave her as she arranged the pillows repaid her for all her toils  after a little time jane became more comfortable and said in a whisper dear lily i wish i was not so troublesome  back came esther at this moment saying miss emily says she is worse and wants you directly miss lilias  lily hurried away to emilys room and found what might well have tried her temper  emily was flushed indeed and feverish but her breathing was smooth and even and her hand and pulse cool and slow compared with the parched burning hands and throbbings too quick to count which lily had just been watching  well my dear emily i am sorry you do not feel better what can i do for you  how can i be better while i am left so long and esther not coming when i ring  what would happen if i were to faint away  indeed i am very sorry said lily but when you rang poor jenny could spare neither of us  how is poor jenny said emily  her throat is very bad but she is quite sensible now and wishes to have me there  what did you want emily  oh  i wish you would draw the curtain the light hurts me that will dononow it is worse pray put it as it was before  oh lily if you knew how ill i am you would not leave me  can i do anything for youwill you have some coffee  oh no it has a bad taste i am sure it is carelessly made  shall i make you some fresh with the spirit lamp  no i am tired of it  i wonder if i might have some tamarinds  i will ask as soon as papa comes from church  is he gone to church how could he go when we are all so ill  perhaps he was doing us more good at church than he could at home you will be glad to hear emily that he has sent for rachel to come and help us  oh has he but she lives so far off and gets her letters so seldom i dont reckon at all upon her coming  if she could come directly it would be a comfort  it would indeed said lily she would know what to do for jane  lily where is the ether  you are always taking it away  in janes room i will fetch it  no no if you once get into janes room i shall never see you back again  now emily knew that jane was very ill and lilys pale cheeks heavy eyes and failing voice might have reminded her that two sick persons were a heavy charge upon a girl of seventeen without the addition of her caprices and fretfulness  and how was it that the kindhearted affectionate emily never thought of all this  it was because she had been giving way to selfishness for nineteen years and now the contemplation of her own sufferings was quite enough to hide from her that others had much to bear and illness instead of teaching her patience and consideration only made her more exacting and querulous  to lilys unspeakable relief miss weston accompanied mr mohun from church and offered to share her attendance  no one knew what it cost alethea to come into the midst of a scene which constantly reminded her of the sisters she had lost but she did not shrink from it and was glad that her parents saw no objection to her offering to share lilys toils  her experience was most valuable and relieved lilias of the fear that was continually haunting her lest her ignorance might lead to some fatal mistake  the next day brought rachel and both patients began to mend  janes recovery was quicker than emilys for her constitution was not so languid and having no pleasure in the importance of being an invalid she was willing to exert herself and make the best of everything while emily did not much like to be told that she was better and thought it cruel to hint that exertion would benefit her  both were convalescent before the fever attacked lily who was severely ill but not alarmingly so and her gentleness and patience made alethea delight in having the care of her  lily was full of gratitude to her kind friend and felt quite happy when alethea chanced one day to call her by the name of emma she almost hoped she was taking the place of that sister and the thought cheered her through many languid hours and gave double value to all aletheas kindness  she did not feel disposed to repine at an illness which brought out such affection from her friend and still more from her father who when he came to see her would say things which gave her a thrill of pleasure whenever she thought of them  it happened one day that jane having finished her book looked round for some other occupation she knew that miss weston had walked to broomhill rachael was with lilias and there was no amusement at hand  at last she recollected that her papa had said in the morning that he hoped to see her and emily in the schoolroom in the course of the day and hoping to meet her sister she resolved to try and get there  the room had been mr mohuns sittingroom since the beginning of their illness and it looked so very comfortable that she was glad she had come though she was so tired she wondered how she should get back again  emily was not there so she lay down on the sofa and took up a little book from the table  the title was susan harvey or confirmation and she read it with more interest as she remembered with a pang that this was the day of the confirmation to which she had been invited she soon found herself shedding tears over the book she who had never yet been known to cry at any story however affecting  she had not finished when mr devereux came in to look for mr mohun and finding her there was going away as soon as he had congratulated her on having left her room but she begged him to stay and began asking questions about the confirmation  were there many people  three hundred  did the stoney bridge people make a disturbance  no  how many of our people  twentyseven  did all the girls wear caps  most of them  jane was rather surprised at the shortness of her cousins answers but she went on as he stood before the fire apparently in deep thought  was miss burnet confirmed  she is the dullest girl i ever knew and she is older than i am  was she confused  she was  did you give mary wright a ticket  no  then of course you did not give one to ned long  i thought you would never succeed in making him remember which is the ninth commandment  i did not refuse him  indeed did he improve in a portentous manner  not particularly  well you must have been more merciful than i expected  indeed  robert you must have lost the use of your tongue for want of us to talk to  i shall be affronted if you go into a brown study the first day of seeing me  he smiled in a constrained manner and after a few minutes said i have been considering whether this is a fit time to tell you what will give you pain  you must tell me if you can bear it  about lily or the little ones  no no only about yourself  your father wished me to speak to you but i would not have done so on this first meeting but what you have just been saying makes me think this is the best occasion  let me know i do not like suspense said jane sharply  i think it right to tell you jane that neither your father nor i thought it would be desirable for you to be confirmed at this time  do you really mean it said jane  look back on the past year and say if you sincerely think you are fit for confirmation  as to that said jane the best people are always saying that they are not fit for these things  none can call themselves worthy of them but i think the conscience of some would bear them witness that they had profited so far by their present means of grace as to give grounds for hoping that they would derive benefit from further assistance  well i suppose i must be very bad since you see it said jane in a manner rather more subdued but i did not think myself worse than other people  is a christian called only to be no worse than others  oh no  i see i meanpray tell me my great fault  pertness i supposelove of gossip  there must be a deeper root of evil of which these are but the visible effects jane  what do you mean robert said jane now seeming really impressed  i think jane that the greatest and most dangerous fault of your character is want of reverence  i think it is want of reverence which makes you press forward to that for which you confess yourself unfit it is want of reverence for holiness which makes you not care to attain it want of reverence for the holy word that makes you treat it as a mere lesson and in smaller matters your pertness is want of reverence for your superiors you would not be ready to believe and to say the worst of others if you reverenced what good there may be in them  take care that your want of reverence is not in reality want of faith  janes spirits were weak and subdued  it was a great shock to her to hear that she was not thought worthy of confirmation her faults had never been called by so hard a name she was in part humbled and in part grieved and what she thought harshness in her cousin she turned away her face and did not speak  he continued jane you must not think me unkind your father desired me to talk to you and indeed the time of recovery from sickness is too precious to be trifled away  jane wept bitterly  presently he said it grieves me to have been obliged to speak harshly to you you must forgive me if i have talked too much to you jane  jane tried to speak but sobs prevented her and she gave way to a violent fit of crying  her cousin feared he had been unwise in saying so much and had weakened the effect of his own words  he would have been glad to see tears of repentance but he was afraid that she was weeping over fancied unkindness and that he might have done what might be hurtful to her in her weak state  he said a few kind words and tried to console her but this change of tone rather added to her distress and she became hysterical  he was much vexed and alarmed and ringing the bell hastened to call assistance  he found esther and sent her to jane and on returning to the schoolroom with some water he found her lying exhausted on the sofa he therefore went in search of his uncle who was overlooking some farming work and many were the apologies made and many the assurances he received that it would be better for her in the end as the impression would be more lasting  jane was scarcely conscious of her cousins departure or of esthers arrival but after drinking some water and lying still for a few moments she exclaimed oh robert oh esther the confirmation and gasped and sobbed again  esther thought she had guessed the cause of her tears and tried to comfort her  ah miss jane there will be another confirmation some day it was a sad thing you were too ill to be sure but  oh if i hadif he would not sayif he had thought me fit  esther was amazed and asked if she should call miss weston who was now with lilias  no no cried jane nearly relapsing into hysterics  she shall not see me in this state  esther hardly knew what to do but she tried to soothe and comfort her by following what was evidently the feeling predominating in janes mind as indicated by her broken sentences and said it was a pity to be sure that mr devereux came and talked so long he could not know of your being so very weak miss jane  yes said jane faintly i could have borne it better if he had waited a few days  yes miss when you had not been so very ill  mr devereux is a very good gentleman but they do say he is very sharp  he means to be kind said jane but i do not think he has much consideration always  yes miss jane that is just what mrs white said when  esthers speech was cut short by the entrance of miss weston  jane started up dashed off her tears and tried to look as usual but the paleness of her face and the redness of her eyes made this impossible and she was obliged to lie down again  esther left the room and miss weston did not feel intimate enough with jane to ask any questions she gave her some sal volatile talked kindly to her of her weakness and offered to read to her all the time leaving an opening for confidence if jane wished to relieve her mind  the book which lay near her accounted as she thought for her agitation and she blamed herself for having judged her harshly as deficient in feeling now that she found her so much distressed because illness had prevented her confirmation  under this impression she honoured her reserve while she thought with more affection of lilys open heart  jane who never took or expected others to take the most favourable view of peoples motives thought alethea knew the cause of her distress and disliked her the more as having witnessed her humiliation  such was janes love of gossip that the next time she was alone with esther she asked for the history of mrs white thus teaching her maid disrespect to her pastor indirectly complaining of his unkindness and going far to annul the effect of what she had learnt at school  perhaps during her hysterics janes conduct was not under control but subsequent silence was in her power and could she be free from blame if esthers faults gained greater ascendency  the next day mr mohun attempted to speak to jane but being both frightened and unhappy she found it very easy and natural as well as very convenient to fall into hysterics again and her father was obliged to desist regretting that at the only time she was subdued enough to listen to reproof she was too weak to bear it without injury  rachel who was nearly as despotic among the young ladies as she had been in former times in the nursery now insisted on emilys going into the schoolroom and when there she made rapid progress alethea was amused to see how janes decided will and lively spirit would induce emily to make exertions which no persuasions of hers could make her think other than impossible  a few days more and they were nearly well again and lilias so far recovered as to be able to spare her kind friend who returned home with a double portion of lilys love and of deep gratitude from mr mohun but these feelings were scarcely expressed in words  emily gave her some graceful thanks and jane disliked her more than ever  it was rather a dreary time that now commenced with the young ladies they were tired of seeing the same faces continually and dispirited by hearing that the fever was spreading in the village  the autumn was far advanced the weather was damp and gloomy and the sisters sat round the fire shivering with cold feeling the large room dreary and deserted missing the merry voices of the children and much tormented by want of occupation  they could not go out their hands were not steady enough to draw they felt every letter which they had to write a heavy burden neither emily nor lily could like needlework they could have no music for the piano at the other end of the room seemed to be in an arctic region and they did little but read novels and childish stories and play at chess or backgammon jane was the best off  mrs weston sent her a little sock with a request that she would make out the way in which it was knit in a complicated feathery pattern and in puzzling over her cotton taking stitches up and letting them down she made the time pass a little less heavily with her than with her sisters    chapter xiiia curiosity map    keek into the drawwell       janet janet there yell see your bonny sell       my jo janet  it was at this time that lady rotherwood and her daughter arrived at devereux castle and mr mohun was obliged to go to meet her there leaving his three daughters to spend a long winter evening by themselves in their doleful and dismal way as lily called it  the evening had closed in but they did not ring for candles lest they should make it seem longer and jane was just beginning to laugh at emily for the deplorable state of her frock and collar tumbled with lying on the sofa when the three girls all started at the unexpected sound of a ring at the front door  with a rapid and joyful suspicion who it might be emily and lilias sprang to the door jane thrust the poker into the fire in a desperate attempt to produce a flame drove an armchair off the hearthrug whisked an old shawl out of sight and flew after them into the hall just as the deep tones of a wellknown voice were heard greeting old joseph  william cried the girls  oh is it you  are you not afraid of the scarlet fever  no who has it  we have had it but we are quite well now  how cold you are  but where is my father  gone to hetherington with robert to meet aunt rotherwood  come into the drawingroom  here emily glided off to perform a hurried toilette  and the little ones  at broomhill  mrs weston was so kind as to take them out of the way of the infection said lily  oh  william those westons  westons what westons  not those i knew at brighton  the very same said lily  they have taken the house at broomhill oh they have been so very kind i do not know what would have become of us without alethea  why did you not tell me they were living here  and you like them  like them  no one can tell the comfort alethea has been  she came to us and nursed us and has been my great support  and phyllis and ada are with them  yes they have been at broomhill these six weeks and more  here emily came in and told william that his room was ready and rachel on the stairs wishing to see the captain  how well he looks cried lily as he closed the door it is quite refreshing to see any one looking so strong and bright  and more like sir maurice than ever said emily  ah but claude is more like said lily because he is pale  well said jane do let us in the meantime make the room look more fit to be seen before he comes down  the alacrity which had long been wanting to lilias and jane had suddenly returned and they succeeded in making the room look surprisingly comfortable compared with its former desolate aspect before william came down and renewed his inquiries after all the family  and how is my fathers deafness was one of his questions  worse said emily  i am afraid all the younger ones will learn to vociferate  he hears no one well but ourselves  oh and alethea weston said lily  her voice is so clear and distinct that she hardly ever raises it to make him hear  and have you ever heard her sing  yes she sings very well  i cannot think why you never told me they were living here  because you never honour us with your correspondence said emily if you had vouchsafed to write to your sisters you could not have escaped hearing of the westons  and has mr weston given up the law  no he only came home in the vacation said emily  did you know they had lost two daughters  i saw it in the paper  emma and lucy were nice girls but not equal to miss weston  what a shock to mrs weston  yes she quite lost her health and the doctors said she must move into the country directly  mrs carrington who is some distant connection told them of this place and they took it rather hastily  do they like it  oh yes very much said emily  mrs weston is very fond of the garden and drives about in the ponycarriage and it is quite pleasant to see how she admires the views  and added lily alethea walks with us and sings with me and teaches at school and knows all the poor people  i must go and see those children tomorrow said william  the evening passed very pleasantly and perhaps in truth captain mohun and his sisters were surprised to find each other so agreeable for in the eyes of the young ladies he was by far the most awful person in the family  when he had been last at home harrys recent death had thrown a gloom over the whole family and he had especially missed him  himself quick sensible clever and active he was intolerant of opposite qualities and the principal effect of that visit to beechcroft was to make all the younger ones afraid of him to discourage poor claude and to give to himself a gloomy remembrance of that home which had lost its principal charms in his mother and harry  he had now come home rather from a sense of duty than an expectation of pleasure and he was quite surprised to find how much more attractive the new court had become  emily and lilias were now conversible and intelligent companions better suited to him than eleanor had ever been and he had himself in these four years acquired a degree of gentleness and consideration which prevented him from appearing so unapproachable as in days of old  this was especially the case with regard to claude whose sensitive and rather timid nature had in his childhood suffered much from williams boyish attempts to make him manly and as he grew older had almost felt himself despised but now william appreciated his noble qualities and was anxious to make amends for his former unkindness  claude came home from oxford not actually ill but in the ailing condition in which he often was just weak enough to give his sisters a fair excuse for waiting upon him and petting him all day long about the same time phyllis and adeline came back from broomhill and there was great joy at the new court at the news that mrs hawkesworth was the happy mother of a little boy  claude was much pleased by being asked by eleanor to be godfather to his little nephew whose name was to be henry  perhaps he hoped what lilias was quite sure of that eleanor did not think him unworthy to stand in harrys place  the choice of the other sponsors did not meet with universal approbation  emily thought it rather hard that mr hawkesworths sister mrs ridley should have been chosen before herself and both she and ada would have greatly preferred either lord rotherwood mr devereux or william to mr ridley while phyllis had wanderings of her own how claude could be godfather without being present at the christening  one evening claude was writing his answer to eleanor sitting at the sofa table where a small lamp was burning  jane attracted by its bright and soft radiance came and sat down opposite to him with her work  what a silence said lily after about a quarter of an hour  what made you start jane said william  did i said jane  my speaking i suppose said lily breaking the awful spell of silence  how red you look jane  what is the matter said william  do i asked jane becoming still redder  it is holding your face down over that babys hood said emily you will sacrifice the colour of your nose to your nephew  claude now asked jane for the sealingwax folded up his letter sealed it put on a stamp and as jane was leaving the room at bedtime said jenny my dear as you go by just put that letter in the postbag  jane obeyed and left the room  claude soon after took the letter out of the bag went to emilys door listened to ascertain that jane was not there and then knocked and was admitted  i could not help coming said he to tell you of the trap in which brownie has been caught  ah said lily i fancied i saw her peeping slyly at your letter  just so said claude and i hope she has experienced the truth of an old proverb  oh tell us what you have said cried the sisters  claude read jane desires me to say that a hood for the baby shall be sent in the course of a week and she hopes that it may be worn at the christening  i should rather say i hope it may be lost in the transit for assuredly the head that it covers must be infected with something far worse than the scarlet feverthe fever of curiosity the last quality which i should like my godson to possess  my only consolation is that he will see the full deformity of the vice as poor little fellow he becomes acquainted with that worst of plagues a prying maiden aunt  if jane was simply curious i should not complain but her love of investigation is not directed to what ought to be known but rather to find out some wretched subject for petty scandal to blacken every action and to add to the weight of every misdeed and all for the sake of detailing her discoveries in exchange for similar information with mrs appleton or some equally suitable confidante  is that all said lily  and enough too i hope said claude  it ought to cure her cried emily  cure her said claude no such thing cures are not wrought in this way this is only a joke and to keep it up i will tell you a piece of news which jane must have spied out in my letter as i had just written it when i saw her eyes in a suspicious direction  it was settled that messieurs maurice and redgie are to go for two hours a day three times a week to mr stevens during the holidays  the new stoney bridge curate said emily  i am very glad you are not to be bored by them said lily but how they will dislike it  it is very hard upon them said claude and i tried to prevent it but the baron was quite determined  now i will begin to talk about this plan and see whether jenny betrays any knowledge of it  oh it will be rare cried lily but do not speak of it before the baron or william  let it be at luncheon said emily you know they never appear  do you mean to send the letter  not that part of it said claude you see i can tear off the last page and it is only to add a new conclusion  goodnight  jane had certainly not spent the evening in an agreeable manner she had not taken her seat at claudes table with any evil designs towards his letter but his writing was clear and legible and her eye caught the word maurice she wished to know what claude could be saying about him and having once begun she could not leave off especially when she saw her own name  when aware of the compliments he was paying her she looked at him but his eyes were fixed on his pen and no smile no significant expression betrayed that he was aware of her observations and even when he gave her the letter to put into the postbag he looked quite innocent and unconcerned  on the other hand she did not like to think that he had been sending such a character of her to eleanor in sober sadness it was impossible to find out whether he had sent the letter she could not venture to beg him to keep it back she could only trust to his good nature  at luncheon as they had agreed lily began by asking where her papa and william were gone  claude answered to stoney bridge to call upon mr stevens they mean to ask him to dine one day next week to be introduced to his pupils  is he an oxford or cambridge man asked lily  oxford exclaimed jane quite forgetting whence she had derived her information he is a fellow of  indeed said lily how do you know that  why we have all been talking of him lately said jane  not i said emily why should he interest us  because he is to tutor the boys said jane  when did you hear that he is to tutor the boys asked lily  when you did i suppose said jane blushing  you did did you said claude  i feel convinced if so that you must really be what you are so often called a changeling  i heard it or rather read it first at oxford where the baron desired me to make inquiries about him  you were doubtless looking over my shoulder at the moment  this is quite a discovery  we shall have to perform a brewery of eggshells this evening and put the elf to flight with a redhot poker and what a different sister jane we shall recover instead of this little mischiefmaking sprite so quiet so reserved never intruding her opinion showing constant deference to all her superiorsyes and to her inferiors shutting her eyes to the faults of others and when they come before her trying to shield the offender from those who regard them as merely exciting news  claudes speech had become much more serious than he intended and he felt quite guilty when he had finished so that it was not at all an undesirable interruption when phyllis and adeline asked for the story of the brewery of eggshells  emily and lilias kindly avoided looking at jane who after fidgeting on her chair and turning very red succeeded in regaining outward composure  she resolved to let the matter die away and think no more about it  when mr mohun and william came home they brought the news that lady rotherwood had invited the whole party to dinner  i am very glad we are allowed to see them said emily i am quite tired of being shut up  if it was not for the westons we might as well live in nova zembla said jane  i am glad you damsels should know a little more of florence said mrs mohun  yes said claude cousins were made to be friends  in that case one ought to be able to choose them said william  and know them said emily  we have not seen florence since she was eleven years old  cousin or not said lilias florence can hardly be so much my friend as alethea  right lily said william stand up for old friends against all the cousins in the universe  has alethea a right to be called an old friend said emily does three quarters of a year make friendship venerable  no one can deny that she is a tried friend said lilias  but pray good people said claude what called forth those vows of eternal constancy why was my innocent general observation construed into an attack upon miss weston  because there is something invidious in your tone said lily  what kind of girl is that florence asked william  oh a nice lively pleasant girl said claude  i cannot make out what her pursuits are said lily rotherwood never talks of her reading anything  she has been governessed and crammed till she is half sick of all reading said claude of all studyay and all accomplishments  so that is the friend you recommend lily said william  well claude that is what i call a great shame said emily  stay said claude you have heard but half my story i say that this is the reaction  florence has no lack of sense and if you young ladies are wise you may help her to find the use of it  claudes further opinion did not transpire as dinner was announced and nothing more was said about lady florence till the girls had an opportunity of judging for themselves  she had a good deal of her brothers vivacity with gentleness and grace which made her very engaging and her perfect recollection of the new court and of childish days charmed her cousins  lady rotherwood was very kind and affectionate and held out hopes of many future meetings  the next day maurice and reginald came home from school bringing a better character for diligence than usual on which they founded hopes that the holidays would be left to their own disposal  they were by no means pleased with the arrangement made with mr stevens and most unwillingly did they undertake the expedition to stony bridge performing the journey in a very unsociable manner  maurice was no horseman and chose to jog on foot through three miles of lane while reginalds pony cantered merrily along its masters head being intent upon the various winter sports in which william and lord rotherwood allowed him to share  little did maurice care for such diversions he was as adeline said studying another apology this time it was phrenology for which the cropped heads of lilias and jane afforded unusual facility  there was however but a limited supply of heads willing to be fingered and maurice returned to the most abiding of his tastes and in an empty room at the old court laboured assiduously to find the secret of perpetual motion  a few days before christmas rachel harvey again took leave of beechcroft with a promise that she would make them another visit when eleanor came home  before she went she gave emily a useful caution telling her it was not right to trust her keys out of her own possession  it was what miss mohun never would have done she had never once committed them even to rachel  with due deference to eleanor said emily with her winning smile we must allow that that was being over cautious  rachel smiled but her lecture was not averted by the compliment  it might have been very well since you have known me miss emily but i do not know what would have come of it if i had been too much trusted when i was a giddy young thing like esther that girl comes of a bad lot and if anything is to be made of her it is by keeping temptation out of her way and not letting her be with that mother of hers  rachel had rather injured the effect of her advice by behaving too like a mistress during her visit emily had more than once wished that all servants were not privileged people and she was more offended than convinced by the remonstrance    chapter xivchristmas       slee sla slud    stuck in the mud o it is pretty to wade through a flood    come wheel round    the dirt we have found would he an estate at a farthing a pound  lilys illness interrupted her teaching at the village school for many weeks and she was in no great haste to resume it  alethea weston seemed to enjoy doing all that was required and lily left it in her hands glad to shut her eyes as much as possible to the disheartening state the parish had been in ever since her former indiscretion  the approach of christmas however made it necessary for her to exert herself a little more and her interest in parish matters revived as she distributed the clothingclub goods and in private conference with each good dame learnt the wants of her family  but it was sad to miss several names struck out of the list for non attendance at church and when mrs eden came for her childs clothing lily remarked that the articles she chose were unlike those of former years the cheapest and coarsest she could find  st thomass day was marked by the custom called at beechcroft gooding  each mother of a family came to all the principal houses in the parish to receive sixpence towards providing a christmas dinner and it was lilys business to dispense this dole at the new court  with a long list of names and a heap of silver before her she sat at the oaken table by the open chimney in the hall returning a nod or a smiling greeting to the thanks of the women as they came one by one to receive the little silver coins and warm themselves by the glowing wood fire  pleasant as the task was at first it ended painfully  agnes eden appeared in order to claim the double portion allotted to her mother as a widow  this was the first time that mrs eden had asked for the goodingmoney and lily knew that it was a sign that she must be in great distress  agnes made her a little courtesy and crept away again as soon as she had received her shilling but mrs grey who was mrs edens neighbour had not quite settled her pennyclub affairs and remained a little longer  an unassuming and lightly principled person was mrs grey and lily enjoyed a talk with her while she was waiting for the purple stuff frock which jane was measuring off for kezia  they spoke of the children and of a few other little matters and presently something was said about mrs eden lily asked if the blacksmith helped her  oh no miss lilias he will do nothing for her while she sends her child to school and to church  he will not speak to her even  not a bit of butter nor a morsel of bacon has been in her house since michaelmas and what she would have done if it was not for mr devereux and mrs weston i cannot think  lilias much shocked by this account of the distress into which she and jane had been the means of bringing the widow reported it to her father and to the rector entreating the former to excuse her rent which he willingly promised to do and also desired his daughters to give her a blanket and tell her to come to dine house whenever any broth was to be given away  mr devereux who already knew of her troubles and allowed her a small sum weekly now told his cousins how much the greys had assisted her  andrew grey had dug up and housed her winters store of potatoes he had sought work for her and little agnes often shared the meals of his children  the greys had a large family very young so that all that they did for her was the fruit of selfdenial  innumerable were the kindnesses which they performed unknown to any but the widow and her child  more by a hundred times did they assist her than the thoughtless girls who had occasioned her sufferings though lily was not the only one who felt that nothing was too much for them to do  nothing perhaps would have been too much except to bear her in mind and steadily aid her in little things but lily took no account of little things talked away her feelings and thus all her grand resolutions produced almost nothing  lord rotherwood sent mrs eden a sovereign the girls newly clothed little agnes phyllis sometimes carried her the scraps of her dinner mrs eden once came to work at the new court and a few messes of broth were given to her but in general she was forgotten and when remembered indolence or carelessness too often prevented the miss mohuns from helping her  in emilys favourite phrase each individual thing was not worth while  when lilias did think it worth while she would do a great deal upon impulse sometimes with more zeal than discretion as she proved by an expedition which she took on christmas eve  mr mohun did not allow the poor of the village to depend entirely on the gooding for their christmas dinner but on the 24th of december a large mess of excellent beef broth was prepared at the new court and distributed to all his own labourers and the most respectable of the other cottagers  in the course of the afternoon lily found that one portion had not been given out  it was that which was intended for the martins a poor old rheumatic couple who lived at south end the most distant part of the parish  neither of them could walk as far as the new court and most of their neighbours had followed farmer gage and had therefore been excluded from the distribution so that there was no one to send  lily therefore resolved herself to carry the broth to them if she could find an escort which was not an easy matter as the frost had that morning broken up and a good deal of snow and rain had been falling in the course of the day  in the hall she met reginald just turned out of maurices workshop and much at a loss for employment  redgie said she you can do me a great kindness  if it is not a bore returned reginald  i only want you to walk with me to south end  eh said reginald i thought the little misses were too delicate to put their dear little proboscises outside the door  that is the reason i ask you i do not think emily or jane would like it and it is too far for claude  those poor old martins have not got their broth and there is no one to fetch it for them  then do not be half an hour putting on your things  thank you and do not run off and make me spend an hour in hunting for you and then say that i made you wait  i will wait fast enough  you are not so bad as emily said reginald while lily ran upstairs to equip herself  when she came down she was glad to find her escort employed in singeing the end of the tail of the old rockinghorse at the fire in the hall so that she was not obliged to seek him in the drawingroom where her plans would probably have met with opposition  she had however objections to answer from an unexpected quarter  reginald was much displeased when she took possession of the pitcher of broth  i will not walk with such a thing as that said he it makes you look like one of the dirty girls in the village  then you ought like the courteous rinaldo to carry it for me said lily  i touch the nasty thing  faugh  throw it into the gutter lily  he made an attempt to dispose of it in that manner which it required all lilys strength to withstand as well as an imploring now redgie think of the poor old people  remember you have promised  promised  i never promised to walk with a greasy old pitcher  what am i to do if we meet miss weston  lily contrived to overcome reginalds refined notions sufficiently to make him allow her to carry the pitcher and when he had whistled up two of the dogs they proceeded merrily along the road dirty and wet though it was  their walk was not entirely without adventures first they had to turn back in the path by the river side which would have saved them half a mile but was now flooded  then as they were passing through a long lane which led them by edward gages farm a great dog rushed out of the yard and fell upon the little terrier viper  old neptune flew to the rescue and to the great alarm of lily reginald ran up with a stick happily however a labourer at the same time came out with a pitchfork and beat off the enemy  these two delays together with reginalds propensity for cutting sticks and for breaking ice made it quite late when they arrived at south end  when there they found that a kind neighbour had brought the old people their broth in the morning and intended to go for her own when she came home from her work in the evening it was not often that lily went to south end the old people were delighted to see her and detained her for some time by a long story about their daughter at service while reginald looked the picture of impatience drumming on his knee switching the leg of the table and tickling neptunes ears  when they left the cottage it was much later and darker than they had expected but lily was unwilling again to encounter the perils of the lane and consulted her brother whether there was not some other way  he gave notice of a cut across some fields which would take them into the turnpike road and lily agreeing they climbed over a gate into a pathless turnip field reginald strode along first calling to the dogs while lily followed abstaining from dwelling on the awkward circumstance that every step she took led her farther from home and rejoicing that it was so dark that she could not see the mud which plastered the edge of her petticoats  after plodding through three very long fields they found themselves shut in by a high hedge and tall ditch  that fool of a farmer cried reginald  what is to be done said lily disconsolately  there is the road said reginald  how do you propose to get into it  there was a gap here last summer said the boy  very likely  come back try the next field it must have a gate somewhere  back they went after seeing the carriers cart from raynham pass by  redgie it must be halfpast five  we shall never be in time  aunt rotherwood coming too  after a desperate plunge through a swamp of ice water and mud they found themselves at a gate and safely entered the turnpike road  how it rains said lily  one comfort is that it is too dark for any one to see us  not very dark either said reginald i believe there is a moon if one could see it  ha here comes some one on horseback  it is a gray horse it is william  come to look for us said lily  oh redgie  coming home from raynham said reginald  do not fancy yourself so important lily  william is that you  reginald exclaimed william suddenly checking his horse  lily what is all this  we set out to south end to take the broth to the old martins and we found the meadows flooded which made us late but we shall soon be at home said lily in a makethebestofit tone  soon  you are a mile and a half from home now and do you know how late it is  halfpast five said lily  six at least how could you be so absurd  william rode quickly on reginald laughed and they plodded on at length a tall dark figure was seen coming towards them and lily started as it addressed her now what is the meaning of all this  oh william have you come to meet us  thank you i am sorry  how were you to come through the village in the dark without some one to take care of you  i am taking care of her said reginald affronted  make haste my aunt is come  how could you make the people at home so anxious  william gave lily his arm and on finding she was both tired and wet again scolded her walked so fast that she was out of breath then complained of her folly and blamed reginald  it was very unpleasant and yet she was very much obliged to him and exceedingly sorry he had taken so much trouble  they came home at about seven oclock  jane met them in the hall full of her own and lady rotherwoods wonderings she hurried lily upstairs andskilful quick and readyshe helped her to dress in a very short time  as they ran down reginald overtook them and they entered the drawingroom as the dinnerbell was ringing  william did not appear for some time and his apologies were not such as to smooth matters for his sister  perhaps it was for this very reason that mr mohun allowed lily to escape with no more than a jesting reproof  lord rotherwood wished to make his cousins hardihood and enterprise an example to his sister and in his droll exaggerating way represented such walks as everyday occurrences  this was just the contrary to what emily wished her aunt to believe and claude was much diverted with the struggle between her politeness to lord rotherwood and her desire to maintain the credit of the family  lady florence though liking lilias thought this walk extravagant emily feared lilias had lost her aunts good opinion and prepared herself for some hints about a governess  it was untoward but in the course of the evening she was a little comforted by a proposal from lady rotherwood to take her and lilias to a ball at raynham which was to take place in january and as soon as the gentlemen appeared they submitted the invitation to their father while lady rotherwood pressed william to accompany them and he was refusing  what are soldiers intended for but to dance said lord rotherwood  i never dance said william with a grave emphasis  i am out of the scrape said the marquis  i shall be gone before it takes place i reserve all my dancing for july 30th  well young ladies is the baron propitious  he says he will consider of it said emily  oh then he will let you go said florence people never consider when they mean no  no florence said her brother uncle mohuns consider of it is equivalent to le rois avisera  what is he saying asked lily turning to listen  oh that my wig is in no ballgoing condition  a wreath would hide all deficiencies said florence i am determined to have you both  i give small hopes of both said claude you will only have emily  why do you think so claude cried both florence and lilias  from my own observation claude answered gravely  i am very angry with the baron said lord rotherwood he is grown inhospitable  he will not let me come here tomorrowthe first christmas these five years that i have missed paying my respects to the new court sirloin and turkey  it is too badand the westons dining here too  cousin turkeycock well may you be in a passion muttered claude as if in soliloquy  lord rotherwood and lilias both caught the sound and laughed but emily unwilling that florence should see what liberties they took with her brother asked quickly why he was not to come  i think we are much obliged to him said florence it would be too bad to leave mamma and me to spend our christmas alone when we came to the castle on purpose to oblige him  ay and he says he will not let me come here because i ought to give the hetherington people ocular demonstration that i go to church said lord rotherwood  very right as eleanor would say observed claude  very likely but i dont care for the hetherington folks they do not know how to make the holly in the church fit to be seen and they will not sing the good old christmas carols  andrew grey is worth all the hetherington choir put together  possibly but how are they to mend if their marquis contents himself with despising them said claude  that is too bad claude  when you heard how submissively i listened to the baron and know i mean to abide by what he said you ought to condole with me a little if you have not the grace to lament my absence on your own account  why i thought myself as regular a part of the feast as the mincepies and almost as necessary  here a request for some music put an end to his lamentations  lilias was vexed by the uncertainty about the ball and was besides too tired to play with spirit  she saw that emily was annoyed and she felt ready to cry before the evening was over but still she was proud of her exploit and when after the party was gone emily began to represent to her the estimate that her aunt was likely to form of her character she replied if she thinks the worse of me for carrying the broth to those poor old people i am sure i do not wish for her good opinion  mr mohun was not propitious when the question of lilys going to the ball was pressed upon him  he said that he thought her too young for gaieties and besides that late hours never agreed with her and he advised her to wait for the 30th of july  lilias knew that it was useless to say any more  she was much disappointed and at the same time provoked with herself for caring about such a matter  her temper was out of order on christmas day and while she wondered why she could not enjoy the festival as formerly with thoughts fitted to the day she did not examine herself sufficiently to find out the real cause of her uncomfortable feelings  the clear frost was only cold the bright sunshine did not rejoice her the holly and the mistletoe seemed ill arranged and none of the pleasant sights of the day could give her such blitheness as once she had known  she was almost angry when she saw that the westons had left off their mourning declaring that they did not look like themselves and her vexation came to a height when she found that alethea actually intended to go to the ball with mrs carrington  the excited manner in which she spoke of it convinced mr mohun that he had acted wisely in not allowing her to go since the very idea seemed to turn her head    chapter xv  minor misfortunes    loving she is and tractable though wild  in a day or two lady rotherwood and her daughter called at the new court  on this occasion lilias was employed in as rational and lady like a manner as could be desiredin practising her music in the drawingroom emily was reading and ada threading beads  lady rotherwood greeted her nieces very affectionately gave a double caress to adeline stroked her pretty curls admired her beadwork talked to her about her doll and then proceeded to invite the whole family to a twelfthday party given for their especial benefit  the little carringtons and the weston girls were also to be asked  emily and lilias were eagerly expressing their delight when suddenly a trampling like a charge of horse was heard in the hall the door was thrown back and in rushed reginald and phyllis shouting such funthe pigs are in the garden  at the sight of their aunt they stopped short looking aghast and certainly those who beheld them partook of their consternation reginald was hot and gloveless his shoes far from clean his brown curls hanging in great disorder from his scotch cap his handkerchief loose his jacket dustybut this was no great matter since as emily said he was only a boy  his bright open smile the rough yet gentlemanlike courtesy of his advance to the marchioness his comical roguish glance at emily to see if she was very angry and to defy her if she were and his speedy exit all greatly amused lady florence and made up for what there might have been of the wild schoolboy in his entrance  poor phyllis had neither the excuse of being a schoolboy nor the goodhumoured fearlessness that freed her brother from embarrassment and she stood stockstill awkward and dismayed not daring to advance longing to join in the pigchase yet afraid to run away her eyes stretched wide open her hair streaming into them her bonnet awry her tippet powdered with seeds of hay her gloves torn and soiled the colour of her brown holland apron scarcely discernible through its various stains her frock tucked up her stockings covered with mud and without shoes which she had taken off at the door  phyllis said emily what are you thinking of  what makes you such a figure  come and speak to aunt rotherwood  phyllis drew off her lefthand glove and held out her hand making a few sidelong steps towards her aunt who gave her a rather reluctant kiss  lily bent her bonnet into shape and pulled down her frock while florence laughed patted her cheek and asked what she had been doing  helping redgie to chop turnips was the answer  afraid of some further exposure emily hastily sent her away to be made fit to be seen and lady rotherwood went on caressing ada and talking of something else  emily had no opportunity of explaining that this was not phylliss usual condition and she was afraid that lady rotherwood would never believe that it was accidental  she was much annoyed especially as the catastrophe only served to divert mr mohun and claude  of all the family william and adeline alone took her view of the case  ada lectured phyllis on her naughtiness and plumed herself on her aunts evident preference but william was not equally sympathetic  he was indeed as fastidious as emily herself and as much annoyed by such misadventures but he maintained that she was to blame for them saying that the state of things was not such as it should be and that the exposure might be advantageous if it put her on her guard in future  it appeared as if poor phyllis was to be punished for the vexation which she had caused for in the course of her adventures with reginald she caught a cold which threatened to prevent her from being of the party on twelfthday  she had a cough which did not give her by any means as much inconvenience as the noise it occasioned did to other people  every morning and every evening she anxiously asked her sisters whether they thought she would be allowed to go  another of the party seemed likely to fail  on the 5th of january claude came down to breakfast later even than usual but he had no occasion to make excuses for his heavy eyes the dark lines under them his pale cheeks and the very sit of his hair were sure signs that he had a violent headache  he soon betook himself to the sofa in the drawingroom attended by lily with pillows cushions ether and lavender  late in the afternoon the pain diminished a little and he fell asleep to the great joy of his sister who sat watching him scarcely daring to move  suddenly a frightful scream and loud crash was heard in the room above them  claude started up and lily exclaiming those tiresome children hurried to the room whence the noise had come  reginald phyllis and ada all stood there laughing  reginald and phyllis had been climbing to the top of a great wardrobe by means of a ladder of chairs and tables  while phyllis was descending her brother had made some demonstration that startled her and she fell with all the chairs over her but without hurting herself  you naughty troublesome child cried lily in no gentle tone  how often have you been told to leave off such boyish tricks  and you choose the very place for disturbing poor claude with his bad headache making it worse than ever  phyllis tried to speak but only succeeded in giving a dismal howl she went on screaming sobbing and roaring so loud that she could not hear lilys attempts to quiet her  the next minute claude appeared looking half distracted  reginald ran off and as he dashed out of the room came full against william who caught hold of him calling out to know what was the matter  only phyllis screaming said lily  oh claude i am very sorry  is that all said claude  i thought some one was half killed  he sank into a chair pressing his hand on his temples and looking very faint  william supported him and lily stood by repeating i am very sorryit was all my faultmy scolding  hush said william you have done mischief enough  go away children  phyllis had already gone and the next moment thrust into lilys hand the first of the medicaments which she had found in the drawingroom the faintness soon went off but claude thought he had better not struggle against the headache any longer but go to bed in hopes of being better the next day  william went with him to his room and lilias lingered on the stairs very humble and very wretched william soon came forth again and asked the meaning of the uproar  it was all my fault said she i was vexed at claudes being waked and that made me speak sharply to phyllis and set her roaring  i do not know which is the most inconsiderate of you said william  you cannot blame me more than i deserve said lily  may i go to poor claude  i suppose so but i do not see what good you are to do  quiet is the only thing for him  lily however went and claude gave her to understand that he liked her to stay with him  she arranged his blinds and curtains comfortably and then sat down to watch him  william went to the drawingroom to write a letter  just as he had sat down he heard a strange noise a sound of sobbing which seemed to come from the corner where the library steps stood  looking behind them he beheld phyllis curled up her head on her knees crying bitterly  you there  come out  what is the matter now  i am so very sorry sighed she  well leave off crying  she would willingly have obeyed but her sobs were beyond her own control and he went on if you are sorry there is no more to be said  i hope it will be a lesson to you another time  you are quite old enough to have more consideration for other people  i am very sorry again said phyllis in a mournful note  be sorry only do not roar  you make that noise from habit i am convinced and you may break yourself off it if you choose  phyllis crept out of the room and in a few minutes more the door was softly opened by emily returning from her walk  i thought claude was here  is he gone to bed  is his head worse  yes the children have been doing their best to distract him emily i want to know why it is that those children are for ever in mischief and yelling in all parts of the house  i wish i could help it said emily with a sigh they are very troublesome  there must be great mismanagement said her brother  oh william  why do you think so  other children do not go on in this way and it was not so in eleanors time  it is only phyllis said emily  phyllis or not it ought not to be  what will that child grow up if you let her be always running wild with the boys  consider william that you see us at a disadvantage we are all unsettled by this illness and the children have been from home  as if they learnt all these wild tricks at broomhill  that excuse will not do emily  and then they are always worse in the holidays pleaded emily  yes there are reasons to be found for everything that goes wrong but if you were wise you would look deeper  now emily i do not wish to be hard upon you for i know you are in a very difficult position and very young for such a charge but i am sure you might manage better  i do not think you use your energies  there is no activity nor regularity nor method about this household  i believe that my father sees that this is the case but it is not his habit to find fault with little things  you may think that therefore i need not interfere but  oh william  i am glad  but remember that comfort is made up of little things  and emily when you consider how much my father has suffered and how desolate his home must be at the best i think you will be inclined to exert yourself to prevent him from being anxious about the children or harassed by your negligence  indeed william returned emily with many tears it is my most earnest wish to make him comfortable  thank you for what you have said  now that i am stronger i hope to do more and i will really do my best  at this moment emily was sincere but the good impulse of one instant was not likely to endure against long cherished habits of selfish apathy  claude did not appear again till the middle of the next day  his headache was nearly gone but he was so languid that he gave up all thoughts of devereux castle that evening  lord rotherwood who always seemed to know what was going on at beechcroft came to inquire for him and very unwillingly allowed that it would be better for him to stay at home  lilias wished to remain with him but this her cousin would not permit saying that he could not consent to lose three of the party and florence would be disappointed in all her plans  neither would claude hear of keeping her at home and she was obliged to satisfy herself with putting his armchair in his favourite corner by the fire with the little table before it supplied with books newspaper inkstand paperknife and all the new periodicals and he declared that he should enjoy the height of luxury  phyllis considered it to be entirely her fault that he could not go and was too much grieved on that account to have many regrets to spare for herself  she enjoyed seeing adeline dressed and hearing esthers admiration of her  and having seen the party set off she made her way into the drawingroom opening the door as gently as possible just wide enough to admit her little person then shutting it as if she was afraid of hurting it she crept across the room on tiptoe  she started when claude looked up and said why phyl i have not seen you today  good morning she mumbled advancing in her sidelong way  claude suspected that she had been more blamed the day before than the occasion called for and wishing to make amends he kissed her and said something goodnatured about spending the evening together  phyllis a little reassured went to her own occupations  she took out a large heavy volume laid it on the windowseat and began to read  claude was interested in his own book and did not look up till the light failed him  he then closing his book gave a long yawn and looked round for his little companion almost thinking from the stillness of the room that she must have gone to seek for amusement in the nursery  she was however still kneeling against the windowseat her elbows planted on the great folio and her head between her hands reading intently  little madam said he what great book have you got there  as you like it said phyllis  what are you promoted to reading shakspeare  i have not read any but this said phyllis  ada and i have often looked at the pictures and i liked the poor wounded stag coming down to the water so much that i read about it and then i went on  was it wrong claude no one ever told me not  you are welcome to read it said claude but not nowit is too dark  come and sit in the great chair on the other side of the fire and be sociable  and what do you think of as you like it  i like it very much answered phyllis only i cannot think why jacks did not go to the poor stag and try to cure it when he saw its tears running into the water  to save the character of jacks claude gravely suggested the difficulty of catching the stag and then asked phyllis her opinion of the heroines  oh it was very funny about rosalind dressing like a man and then being ready to cry like a girl when she was tired and then pretending to pretend to be herself and celia it was very kind of her to go away with rosalind but i should have liked her better if she had stayed at home and persuaded her father to let rosalind stay too  i am sure she would if she had been like ada  then it is so nice about old adam and orlando  do not you think so claude  it is just what i am sure wat greenwood would do for redgie if he was to be turned out like orlando  it is just what wat greenwoods ancestor did for sir maurice mohun said claude  yes dame greenwood tells us that story  well phyl i think you show very good taste in liking the scene between orlando and adam  i am glad you like it too claude  but i will tell you what i like best exclaimed the little girl springing up i do like it when orlando killed the lioness and the snakeand saved oliver how glad he must have been  glad to have done good to his enemy said claude yes indeed  his enemy he was his brother you know  i meant it must be so very nice to save anybodydont you think so claude  certainly  claude do you know there is nothing i wish so much as to save somebodys life  it was very nice to save the dragonfly and it is very nice to let flies out of spiders webs only they always have their legs and wings torn and look miserable and it was very nice to put the poor little thrushes back into their nest when they tumbled out and then to see their mother come to feed them and it was very pleasant to help the poor goose that had put its head through the pales and could not get it back  mrs harrington said it would have been strangled if i had not helped it  that was very nice but how delightful it would be to save some real human persons life  claude did not laugh at the odd medley in her speech but answered well those little things train you in readiness and kindness  will they said phyllis pressing on to express what had long been her earnest wish  if i could but save some one i should not mind being killed myselfi think noti hope it is not naughty to say so i believe there is something in the bible about it about laying down ones life for ones friend  there is phyl and i quite agree with you it must be a great blessing to have saved some one  and little girls have sometimes done it claude  i know a story of one who saved her little brother from drowning and another waked the people when the house was on fire  and when i was at broomhill marianne showed me a story of a young lady who helped to save the prince that prince charlie that miss weston sings about  i wish the prince of wales would get into some misfortunei should like to save him  i do not quite echo that loyal wish said claude  well but claude redgie wishes for a rebellion like sir maurices for he says all the boys at his school would be one regiment in green velvet coats and white feathers in their hats  indeed and redgie to be field marshal  no he is to be sir reginald mohun a knight of the garter and to ask the queen to give william back the title of baron of beechcroft and make papa a duke  well done he is to take good care of the interests of the family  but it is not that that i should care about said phyllis  i should like it better for the feeling in ones own self i think all that fuss would rather spoil itdont you claude  indeed i do but phyllis if you only wish for that feeling you need not look for dangers or rebellions to gain it  oh you mean the feeling that very good people indeed havepeople like harrybut that i shall never be  i hope you mean to try though  i do try i wish i was as good as ada but i am so naughty and so noisy that i do not know what to do  every day when i say my prayers i think about being quiet and not idling at my lessons and sometimes i do stop in time and behave better but sometimes i forget and i do not mind what i am about and my voice gets loud and i let the things tumble down and make a noise and so it was yesterday  here she looked much disposed to cry  no no we will not have any crying this evening said claude  i do not think you did me much mischief my head ached just as much before  that was a thing i wanted to ask you about  william says my crying loud is all habit and that i must cure myself of it  how does he mean  ought i to cry every day to practise doing it without roaring  do you like to begin said claude laughing shall i beat you or pinch you  oh it would make your head bad again said phyllis but i wish you would tell me what he means  when i cry i only think about what makes me unhappy  try never to cry said claude i assure you it is not pleasant to hear you even when i have no headache  if you wish to do anything right you must learn selfcontrol and it will be a good beginning to check yourself when you are going to cry  do not look melancholy now  here comes the tea  let me see how you will perform as tea maker  i wish the evening would not go away so fast  and what are we to do after tea  you are queen of the evening  if you would but tell me a story claude  they lingered long over the teatable talking and laughing and when they had finished phyllis discovered with surprise that it was nearly bedtime  the promised story was not omitted however and phyllis sitting on a little footstool at her brothers feet looked up eagerly for it  well phyl i will tell you a true history that i heard from an officer who had served in the peninsular warthe war in spain you know  yes with the french who killed their king  lily told me  and the portuguese were helping us  just after we had taken the town of ciudad rodrigo some of the portuguese soldiers went to find lodgings for themselves and entering a magazine of gunpowder made a fire on the floor to dress their food  a most dangerous thingdo you know why  the book would be burnt said phyllis  what book you wise child  the magazine i thought a magazine was one of the paper books that maurice is always reading  oh said claude laughing a magazine is a store and as many different things are stored in those books they are called magazines  a powder magazine is a store of barrels of gunpowder now do you see why it was dangerous to light a fire  it blows up said phyllis that was the reason why robinson crusoe was afraid of the lightning  right phyl and therefore a candle is never allowed to be carried into a powder magazine and even nailed shoes are never worn there lest they should strike fire  one spark lighting on a grain of gunpowder scattered on the floor might communicate with the rest make it all explode and spread destruction everywhere  think in what fearful peril these reckless men had placed not only themselves but the whole town and the army  an english officer chanced to discover them and what do you think he did  told all the people to run away  how could he have told every one soldiers inhabitants and all where could they have gone  no he raised no alarm but he ordered the portuguese out of the building and with the help of an english sergeant he carried out piece by piece all the wood which they had set on fire  now imagine what that must have been  an explosion might happen at any moment yet they had to walk steadily slowly and with the utmost caution in and out of this place several times lest one spark might fly back  then they were saved cried phyllis breathlessly and what became of them afterwards  they were both killed in battle the officer i believe in badajoz and the sergeant sometime afterwards  phyllis gave a deep sigh and sat silent for some minutes  next claude began a droll irish fairytale which he told with spirit and humour such as some people would have scorned to exert for the amusement of a mere child  phyllis laughed and was so happy that when suddenly they heard the sound of wheels she started up wondering what brought the others home so soon and was still more surprised when claude told her it was past ten  oh dear what will papa and emily say to me for being up still  but i will stay now it would not be fair to pretend to be gone to bed  well said honest phyl now for the news from the castle  why claude said his eldest brother entering you are alive again  i doubt whether your evening could have been pleasanter than ours said claude  phyl cried ada do you know mary carringtons governess thought i was florences sister  you look so bright claude said jane i think you must have taken cinderellas friend with the pumpkin to enliven you  my fairy was certainly sister to a brownie said claude stroking phylliss hair  claude again began ada miss car  i wish cinderellas fairy may be forthcoming the day of the ball said lily disconsolately  and william is going after all said emily  indeed has the great captain relented  yes  is it not good of him  aunt rotherwood is so much pleased that he consents to go entirely to oblige her  sensible of his condescension said claude  by the bye what makes the baron look so mischievous  mischievous said emily looking round with a start he is looking very comical and so he has been all the evening  what  you thought mischievous was meant in hannahs sense when she complains of master reginald being very mischievious  ada now succeeded in saying the carringtons governess called me lady ada  how could she bring herself to utter so horrid a sound said claude  ada is more cockahoop than ever now said reginald she does not think miss weston good enough to speak to  but claude she really did she thought i was florences sister and she said i was just like her  i wish you would hold your tongue or go to bed said william i have heard nothing but this nonsense all the way home  while william was sending off ada to bed and phyllis was departing with her lily told claude that the captain had been most agreeable i feared said she that he would be too grand for this party but he was particularly entertaining rotherwood was quite eclipsed  rotherwood wants claude to set him off said mr mohun  now young ladies reserve the rest of your adventures for the morning  adeline had full satisfaction in recounting the governesss mistake to the maids and in hearing from esther that it was no wonder for that she looked more like a born lady than lady florence herself  liliass fit of petulance about the ball had returned more strongly than ever she partly excused herself to her own mind by fancying she disliked the thought of the lonely evening she was to spend more than that of losing the pleasure of the ball  mr mohun would be absent conducting maurice to a new school and claude and reginald would also be gone  her temper was affected in various ways she wondered that william and emily could like to goshe had thought that miss weston was wiser  her daily occupations were irksomeshe was cross to phyllis  it made her very angry to be accused by the young brothers of making a fuss and claudes silence was equally offensive  it was upon principle that he said nothing  he knew it was nothing but a transient attack of silliness of which she was herself ashamed but he was sorry to leave her in that condition and feared lady rotherwoods coming into the neighbourhood was doing her harm as certainly as it was spoiling ada  the ball day arrived and it was marked by a great burst of fretfulness on the part of poor lilias occasioned by so small a matter as the being asked by emily to write a letter to eleanor  emily was dressing to go to dine at devereux castle when she made the request  what have i to say  i never could write a letter in my life at least not to the duennathere is no news  about the boys going to school emily suggested  as if she did not know all about them as well as i can tell her she does not care for my news i see no one to hear gossip from  i thought you undertook all the formal correspondence emily  do you call a letter to your sister formal correspondence  everything is formal with her  all i can say is that you and william are going to the ball and she will say that is very silly  eleanor once went to this raynham ball it was her first and last said emily  yes not long before they went to italy it will only make her melancholy to speak of iti declare i cannot write  and i have no time said emily and you know how vexed she is if she does not get her letter every saturday  all for the sake of punctuality nothing else said lily  i rather like to disappoint fidgety peopledont you emily  well said emily only papa does not like that she should be disappointed  you might have written if you had not dawdled away all the morning  this was true and it therefore stung emily who complained that lily was very unkind  lily defended herself sharply and the dispute was growing vehement when william happily cut it short by a summons to emily to make haste  when they were gone lily had time for reflection  goodtemper was so common a virtue and generally cost her so little effort that she took no pains to cultivate it but she now felt she had lost all claim to be considered amiable under disappointment  it was too late to bear the privation with a good grace  she was heartily ashamed of having been so cross about a trifle and ashamed of being discontented at emilys having a pleasure in which she could not share  would this have been the case a year ago  she was afraid to ask herself the question and without going deep enough into the history of her own mind to make her sorrow and shame profitable she tried to satisfy herself with a superficial compensation by making herself particularly agreeable to her three younger sisters and by writing a very long and entertaining letter to eleanor  she met emily with a cheerful face the next day and listened with pleasure to her history of the ball and when mr mohun returned home he saw that the cloud had passed away  but alas  lilias neglected to take the only means of preventing its recurrence  the next week william departed  before he went he gave his sisters great pleasure by desiring them to write to him and not to let him fall into his ancient state of ignorance respecting the affairs of beechcroft  mind was his farewell speech i expect you to keep me au courant du jour  i will not be in the dark about your best friends and neighbours when i come home next july    chapter xvivanity and vexation    and still i have to tell the same sad tale of wasted energies and idle dreams  devereux castle now became the great resort of the miss mohuns  they were always sure of a welcome there  lady rotherwood liked to patronise them and florence was glad of their society  this was quite according to the wishes of emily who now had nothing left to desire but that the style of dress suitable in her opinion to the granddaughter of the marquis of rotherwood was more in accordance with the purse of the daughter of the esquire of beechcroft  it was no part of emilys character to care for dress she was at once too indolent and too sensible she saw the vulgarity of finery and only aimed at simplicity and elegance  during their girlhood emily and lilias had had no more concern with their clothes than with their food eleanor had carefully taught them plain needlework and they had assisted in making more than one set of shirts but they had nothing to do with the choice or fashion of their own apparel  they were always dressed alike and in as plain and childish a manner as they could be consistently with their station  on eleanors marriage a suitable allowance was given to each of them in order that they might provide their own clothes and until rachel left them they easily kept themselves in very good trim when esther came lily cheerfully took the trouble of her own small decorations considering it as her payment for the pleasure of having esther in the house  emily however neglected the useful stitch in time till even nine were unavailing  she soon found herself compelled to buy new readymade articles and expected lilias to do the same  but lilias demurred for she was too wise to think it necessary to ruin herself in company with emily and thus the two sisters were no longer dressed alike  a constant fear tormented emily lest she should disgrace lady rotherwood or be considered by some stranger as merely a poor relation of the great people and not as the daughter of the gentleman of the oldest family in the county she was therefore anxious to be perfectly fashionable and not to wear the same things too often and in her disinterested desire to maintain the dignity of the family the allowance which she received at christmas melted away in her hands  lily though exempt from this folly was not in a satisfactory state of mind  she was drawn off from her duties by a kind of spell  it was not that she liked florences society better than her home pursuits  florence was indeed a very sweettempered and engaging creature but her mind was not equal to that of lilias and there was none of the pleasure of relying upon her and looking up to her which lilias had learnt to enjoy in the company of her brother claude and of alethea weston  it was only that lilys own mind had been turned away from her former occupations and that she did not like to resume them she had often promised herself to return to her really useful studies and her positive duties as soon as her brothers were gone but day after day passed and nothing was done though her visits to the cottages and her lessons to phyllis were often neglected  her calls at devereux castle took up many afternoons  florence continually lent her amusing books her aunt took great interest in her music and she spent much time in practising  the mornings were cold and dark and she could not rise early and thus her time slipped away she knew not how uselessly and unsatisfactorily  the three younger ones were left more to themselves and to the maids jane sought for amusement in village gossip and the little ones finding the nursery more agreeable than the deserted drawingroom made esther their companion  mr mohun had at this time an unusual quantity of business on his hands he saw that the girls were not going on well but he had reasons for not interfering at present and he looked forward to eleanors visit as the conclusion of their trial  i cannot think said marianne weston one day to her sister why mr mohun comes here so often  alethea told her he had some business with their mamma and she thought no more of the matter till she was one day questioned by jane  she was rather afraid of jane who as she thought disliked her and wished to turn her into ridicule so it was with no satisfaction that she found herself separated from the others in the course of a walk and submitted to a crossexamination  jane asked in a mysterious manner who had been at broomhill that morning  mr mohun said marianne  what did he go there for said jane  alethea says he has some business with mamma  then you did not hear what it was  i was not in the room  are you never there when he comes  sometimes  and is alethea there  oh yes  his business must be with her too  cannot you guess it  no said marianne looking amazed  how can you be so slow  i am not sure that i would guess if i could said marianne for i do not think they wish me to know  oh nonsense it is fine fun to find out secrets said jane  you will know it at last you may be sure so there can be no harm in making it out beforehand so as to have the pleasure of triumph when the wise people vouchsafe to admit you into their confidence i am sure i know it all  then please do not tell me jane i ought not to hear it  little mrs propriety said jane you are already assuming all the dignity of my aunt marianne and williams aunt marianneoh and of little henrys greataunt marianne  now she added laughing can you guess the secret  marianne stood still in amazement for a moment and then exclaimed jane jane you do not mean it you are only trying to tease me  i am quite serious said jane  you will see that i am right  here they were interrupted and as soon as she returned from her walk marianne perplexed and amazed went to her mother and told her all that jane had said  how can she be so silly said mrs weston  then it is all nonsense as i thought said marianne joyfully  i should not like alethea to marry an old man  mr mohun is very unlikely to make himself ridiculous said mrs weston  do not say anything of it to alethea it would only make her uncomfortable  if it had been captain mohun now  marianne stopped and blushed finding her speech unanswered  a few days after mr mohun overtook marianne and her mother as he was riding home from raynham and dismounting led his horse and walked on with them  either not perceiving marianne or not caring whether she heard him he said  has miss weston received the letter she expected  no said mrs weston she thinks as there is no answer the family must be gone abroad and very probably they have taken miss aylmer with them but she has written to another friend to ask about them  from all i hear said mr mohun i should prefer waiting to hear from her before we make further inquiries we shall not be ready before midsummer as i should wish my eldest daughter to assist me in making this important decision  in that case said mrs weston there will be plenty of time to communicate with her  i can see some of the friends of the family when i go to london for we must not leave mr weston in solitude another spring  perhaps i shall see you there said mr mohun  i have some business in london and i think i shall meet the hawkesworths there in may or june  after a little more conversation mr mohun took his leave and as soon as he had ridden on marianne said oh mamma i could not help hearing  my dear said mrs weston i know you may be trusted but i should not have told you as you may find such a secret embarrassing when you are with your young friends  and so they are to have a governess  yes and we are trying to find miss aylmer for them  miss aylmer  i am glad of it how much phyllis and ada will like her  yes it will be very good for them i wish i knew the grants direction  well i hope jane will not question me any more it will be very difficult to manage now i know the truth  but poor marianne was not to escape  jane was on the watch to find her alone and as soon as an opportunity offered she began  well auntie any discoveries  indeed jane it is not right to fancy mr mohun can do anything so absurd  that is as people may think said jane  i wish you would not talk in that way said marianne  now marianne pursued the tormentor if you can explain the mystery i will believe you otherwise i know what to think  i am certain you are wrong jane but i can tell you no more  very well my good aunt i am satisfied  jane really almost persuaded herself that she was right as she perceived that her father was always promoting intercourse with the westons and took pleasure in conversing with alethea  she twisted everything into a confirmation of her idea while the prospect of having miss weston for a stepmother increased her former dislike but she kept her suspicions to herself for the present triumphing in the idea that when the time came she could bring marianne as a witness of her penetration  the intercourse between the elder miss mohuns and miss weston was however not so frequent as formerly and alethea herself could not but remark that while mr mohun seemed to desire to become more intimate his daughters were more backward in making appointments with her  this was chiefly remarkable in emily and jane  lilias was the same in openness earnestness and affection but there was either a languor about her spirits or they were too much excited and her talk was more of novels and less of poor children than formerly the constant visits to devereux castle prevented emily and lilias from being as often as before at church and thus they lost many walks and talks that they used to enjoy in the way home  marianne began to grow indignant especially on one occasion when emily and lily went out for a drive with lady rotherwood forgetting that they had engaged to take a walk with the westons that afternoon  it is really a great deal too bad said she to alethea it is exactly what we have read of in books about grandeur making people cast off their old friends  do not be unfair marianne said alethea  lady florence has a better right to  better right exclaimed marianne  what because she is a marquiss daughter  because she is their cousin  i do not believe lilias really cares for her half as much as for you said marianne  it is all because they are fine people  nay marianne if our cousins were to come into this neighbourhood we should not be as dependent on the mohuns as we now feel  i hope we should not break our engagements with them  perhaps they could not help it  when their aunt came to fetch them knowing how seldom they can have the carriage it would have been scarcely civil to say that they had rather take a walk with people they can see any day  last year lilias would have let emily go by herself said marianne alethea they are all different since that lady rotherwood cameall except phyl  ada is a great deal more conceited than she was when she was staying here she pulls out her curls and looks in the glass much more and she is always talking about some one having taken her for lady florences sister  and alethea just fancy she does not like me to go through a gate before her because she says she has precedence  alethea was much amused but she would not let marianne condemn the whole family for adas folly  it will all come right said she let us be patient and goodhumoured and nothing can be really wrong  though alethea made the best of it to her sister she could not but feel hurt and would have been much more so if her temper had been jealous or sentimental  almost in spite of herself she had bestowed upon lilias no small share of her affection and she would have been more pained by her neglect if she had not partaken of that spirit which thinketh no evil but beareth all things believeth all things hopeth all things and endureth all things  lilias was not satisfied with either herself her home her sisters or her school she was far from being the fresh happy creature that she had been the year before  she had seen the fallacy of her principle of love but in her selfwilled adherence to it she had lost the strong sense and habit of duty which had once ruled her and in a vague and restless frame of mind she merely sought from day to day for pleasure and idle occupation  lent came but she was not roused she was only more uncomfortable when she saw the rector or alethea or went to church  aletheas unfailing gentleness she felt almost as a rebuke and mr devereux though always kind and good natured had ceased to speak to her of those small village matters in which she used to be prime counsellor  the school became a burthen instead of a delight and her attendance there a fatigue  on going in one sunday morning very late she found alethea teaching her class as well as her own  with a look of vexation she inquired as she took her place if it was so very late and on the way to church she said again i thought i was quite in time i do not like to hurry the childrenthe distant ones have not time to come  it was only halfpast nine  oh lilias said marianne it was twenty minutes to ten i know for i had just looked at the clock  that clock is always too fast said lily  the next sunday was very cold and lilias did not feel at all disposed to leave the fire when the others prepared to go to the afternoon school  is it time said she  i was chilled at church and my feet are still like ice i will follow you in five minutes  alethea went and lilias lingered by the fire  mrs weston once asked her if she knew how late it was but still she waited until she was startled by the sound of the bell for evening service  as she went to church with mrs weston and emily she met jane who told her that her class had been unemployed all the afternoon  i would have taken them said she but that robert does not like me to teach the great girls and i do think alethea might have heard them  it is very provoking said lily pettishly i thought i might depend  she turned and saw miss weston close to her  oh alethea said she i thought you would have heard those girls  i thought you were coming said alethea  so i was but i am sure the bell rang too early  i do wish you had taken them alethea  i am sorry you are vexed said alethea simply  what makes you think i am vexed  i only thought you liked hearing my class  they were by this time at the church door and as they entered alethea blamed herself for feeling grieved and lily awoke to a sense of her unreasonableness  she longed to tell alethea how sorry she felt but she had no opportunity and she resolved to go to broomhill the next day to make her confession  in the night however snow began to fall and the morning showed the february scene of thawing snow and pouring rain  going out was impossible both on that day and the next  wednesday dawned fair and bright but just after breakfast lily received a little note with the intelligence that mr weston had arrived at broomhill on monday evening and with his wife and daughters was to set off that very day to make a visit to some friends on the way to london  had not the weather been so bad alethea said she should have come to take leave of her new court friends on tuesday but she could now only send this note to tell them how sorry she was to go without seeing them and to beg emily to send back a piece of music which she had lent to her  the messenger was faith longley who was to accompany them and who now was going home to take leave of her mother and would call again for the music in a quarter of an hour  lily ran to ask her when they were to go at eleven was the answer and lily telling her she need not call again as she herself would bring the music went to look for it high and low did she seek and so did jane but it was not to be found in any nook likely or unlikely and when at last lily in despair gave up the attempt to find it it was already a quarter to eleven  emily sent many apologies and civil messages and lily set out at a rapid pace to walk to broomhill by the road for the thaw had rendered the fields impassable  fast as she walked she was too late  she had the mortification of seeing the carriage turn out at the gates and take the raynham road she was not even seen nor had she a wave of the hand or a smile to comfort her  almost crying with vexation she walked home and sat down to write to alethea but alas she did not know where to direct a letter bitterly did she repent of the burst of illtemper which had stained her last meeting with her friend and she was scarcely comforted even by the long and affectionate letter which she received a week after their departure  kindness from her was now forgiveness never did she so strongly feel florences inferiority and she wondered at herself for having sought her society so much as to neglect her patient and superior friend  she became careless and indifferent to florence and yet she went on in her former course following emily and fancying that nothing at beechcroft could interest her in the absence of her dear alethea weston    chapter xvii  little agnes    o guide us when our faithless hearts    from thee would start aloof where patience her sweet skill imparts    beneath some cottage roof  palm sunday brought lily many regrets  it was the day of the school prize giving and she reflected with shame how much less she knew about the children than last year and how little they owed to her she feared to think of the approach of easter day a dread which she had never felt before and which she knew to be a very bad sign but her regret was not repentanceshe talked and laughed and tried to feel at ease  agnes edens happy face was the most pleasant sight on that day  the little girl received a bible and as it was given to her her pale face was coloured with bright pink her blue eyes lighted up her smile was radiant with the beauty of innocence but lily could not look at her without selfreproach  she resolved to make up for her former neglect by double kindness and determined that at any rate passion week should be properly spentshe would not once miss going to church  but on monday when emily proposed to ride to devereux castle she assented only saying that they would return for evening service she took care to remind her sister when it was time to set out homewards but emily was as usual so long in taking her leave that it was too late to think of going to church when they set off  about two miles from beechcroft lily saw a little figure in a gray cloak trudging steadily along the road and as she came nearer she recognised kezia grey  she stopped and asked the child what brought her so far from home  i am going for the doctor miss said the child  is your mother worse asked lily  mother is pretty well said kezia but it is for agnes eden miss she is terrible bad  poor little agnes exclaimed lily  why she was at school yesterday  yes miss but she was taken bad last night  after a moments consultation between the sisters kezia was told that she might return home and the servant who accompanied the miss mohuns was sent to raynham for the doctor  the next afternoon lily was just setting out to inquire for agnes when lord rotherwood arrived at the new court with his sister  he wanted to show florence some of his favourite haunts at beechcroft and had brought her to join his cousins in their walk  a very pleasant expedition they made but it led them so far from home that the church bell was heard pealing over the woods far in the distance  lily could not go to mrs edens cottage because she did not know the nature of agness complaint and her aunt could not bear that florence should go into any house where there was illness  in the course of the walk however she met kezia on her way to the new court to ask for a blister for agnes the doctor having advised mrs eden to apply to the miss mohuns for one as it was wanted quickly and it was too far to send to raynham  lily promised to send the blister as soon as possible and desired the little messenger to return home where she was much wanted to help her mother who had a baby of less than a week old  alas in the mirth and amusement of the evening lily entirely forgot the blister until just as she went to bed when she made one of her feeble resolutions to take it or send it early in the morning  she only awoke just in time to be ready for breakfast went downstairs without one thought of the sick child and never recollected her until at church just before the litany she heard these words  the prayers of the congregation are desired for agnes eden  she felt as if she had been shot and scarcely knew where she was for several moments  on coming out of church she stood almost in a dream while emily and jane were talking to the rector who told them how very ill the child was and how little hope there was of her recovery  he took leave of them and lily walked home scarcely hearing the soothing words with which emily strove to comfort her the meaning passed away mournfully lily sat over the fire without speaking and without attempting to do anything  in the afternoon rain came on but lily too unhappy not to be restless put on her bonnet and cloak and went out  she walked quickly up the hill and entered the field where the cottage stood  there she paused  she did not dare to knock at the cottage door she could not bear to speak to mrs eden she dreaded the sight of mrs grey or kezia and she gazed wistfully at the house longing yet fearing to know what was passing within it  she wandered up and down the field and at last was trying to make up her mind to return home when she heard footsteps behind her and turning saw mr devereux advancing along the path at the other end of the field  have you been to inquire for agnes said he  i could not  i long to know but i cannot bear to ask i cannot venture in  do you like to go in with me said her cousin  i do not think you will see anything dreadful  thank you said lily i would give anything to know about her  how you tremble but you need not be afraid  he knocked at the door but there was no answer he opened it and going to the foot of the stairs gently called mrs eden who came down calm and quiet as ever though very pale  how is she  no better sir thank you lightheaded still  oh  mrs eden i am so sorry sobbed lily  oh can you forgive me  pray do not take on so miss said mrs eden  you have always been a very kind friend to her miss lilias  do not take on so miss  if it is his will nothing could have made any difference  lily was going to speak again but mr devereux stopped her saying we must not keep mrs eden from her lily  thank you sir her aunt is with her said mrs eden and no one is any good there now she does not know any one  will you walk up and see her sir will you walk up miss lilias  lily silently followed her cousin up the narrow stairs to the upper room where in the whitecurtained bed lay the little child tossing about and moaning her cheeks flushed with fever and her blue eyes wide open but unconscious  a woman whom lily did not at first perceive to be mrs naylor rose and courtsied on their entrance  agness new bible was beside her and her mother told them that she was not easy if it was out of sight for an instant  at this moment agnes called out mother and mrs eden bent down to her but she only repeated mother two or three times and then began talking  kissy i want my bagwhere is my thimbleno not that i cant remembermy catechismbookmy godfathers and godmothers in my baptism wherein i was made a membermy christian namemy name it is my christian name no that is not it    it is a name by which i am    writ in the hook of life and here below a charm to keep    unharmed by sin and strife as often as my name i hear    i hear my saviours voice   then she began the creed but breaking off exclaimed where is my bible mother i shall read it tomorrowread that pretty verse about i am the good shepherdthe lord is my shepherd therefore can i lack nothingyea though i walk through the valley of the shadow of death i will fear no evil for thou art within me   i now am of that little flock    which christ doth call his own for all his sheep he knows by name    and he of them is known   let us call upon your good shepherd agnes said the pastor and the child turned her face towards him as if she understood him kneeling down he repeated the lords prayer and the feeble voice followed his  he then read the prayer for a sick child and left the room for he saw that lily would be quite overcome if she remained there any longer  mrs eden followed them downstairs and again stung poor lily to the heart by thanks for all her kindness  they then left the house of mourning lily trembled violently and clung to her cousins arm for support  her tears streamed fast but her sobs were checked by awe at mrs edens calmness  she felt as if she had been among the angels  how pale you are said her cousin i would not have taken you there if i thought it would overset you so much  come into mrs greys and sit down and recover a little  no no do not let me see any one said lily  oh that dear child  robert let me tell you the worst for your kindness is more than i can bear  i promised agnes a blister and forgot it  she could say no more for some minutes but her cousin did not speak recovering her voice she added only speak to me robert  i am very sorry for you answered he in a kind tone  but tell me what shall i do  what to do you ask said the rector i am not sure that i know what you mean  if your neglect has added to her sufferings you cannot remove them and i would not add to your sorrow unless you wished me to do so for your good  i do not see how i could be more unhappy than i am now said lily  i think if you wish to turn your grief to good account you must go a little deeper than this omission  you mean that it is a result of general carelessness said lily i know i have been in an odd idle way for some time i have often resolved but i seem to have no power over myself  may i ask you one question lily  how have you been spending this lent  robert you are right cried lily you may well ask  i know i have not gone to church properly but how could you guess the terrible way in which i have been indulging myself and excusing myself every unpleasant duty that came in my way  that was the very reason of this dreadful neglect well do i deserve to be miserable at easter the proper time for joy  oh how different it will be  it will be i hope an easter marked by repentance and amendment said the rector  no robert do not begin to be kind to me yet you do not know how very bad i have been said lily it all began from just after eleanors wedding  a mad notion came into my head and laid hold of me  i fancied eleanor stern and cold and unlovable i was ingratitude itself  i made a foolish theory that regard for duty makes people cold and stern and that feeling which i confused with christian love was all that was worth having and the more claude tried to cure me the more obstinate i grew i drew emily over to my side and we set our follies above everything  justified ourselves for idling neglecting the children indulging ourselves calling it love and so it was selflove  so my temper has been spoiling and my mind getting worse and worse ever since we lost eleanor  at last different things showed me the fallacy of my principle but then i do believe i was beyond my own management  i felt wrong and could not mend and went on recklessly  you know but too well what mischief i have done in the village but you can never know what harm i have done at home  i have seen more and more that i was going on badly but a sleep a spell was upon me  perhaps the pain you now feel may be the means of breaking the spell  but is it not enough to drive me mad to think that improvement in me should be bought at such a pricethe widows only child  you forget that the loss is a blessing to her  still i may pray that my punishment may not be through them said lily  surely was the answer it is grievous to see that dear child cut off and her patient mother left desolateyet how much more grievous it would be to see that spotless innocence defiled  if it was to fall on any one said lilias i should be thankful that it is on one so fit to die  the church bell began to ring and they quickened their steps in silence  presently lily said tell me of something to do robert something that may be a pledge that my sorrow is not a passing shower something unnecessary but disagreeable which may keep me in remembrance that my lent was not one of selfdenial  you must be able to find more opportunities of selfdenial than i can devise said her cousin  of course said lily but some one thing some punishment  i will answer you tomorrow said mr devereux  one thing more said lily looking down after this great fall ought i to come to next sundays feast  i would turn away if you thought fit  lily you can best judge said the rector kindly  i should think that you were now in a humble contrite frame and therefore better prepared than when selfconfident  how many times how shall i think of them but i will said lily and robert will you think of me when you say the absolution now and next sunday at the altar  they were by this time at the churchporch  as mr devereux uncovered his head he turned to lilias and said in a low tone god bless you lilias and grant you true repentance and pardon  early the next morning the toll of the passingbell informed lily that the little lamb had been gathered into the heavenly fold  when she took her place in church she found in her prayerbook a slip of paper in the handwriting of her cousin  it was thus  you had better find out in which duty you have most failed and let the fulfilment of that be your proof of selfdenial  r d  afterwards lily learnt that agnes had been sensible for a short time before her peaceful death  she had spoken much of her baptism had begged to be buried next to a little sister of kezias and asked her mother to give her new bible to kezia  it was not till sunday that lilias felt as if she could ever be comforted  her heart was indeed ready to break as she walked at the head of the school children behind the whitecovered coffin and she felt as if she did not deserve to dwell upon the childs present happiness but afterwards she was relieved by joining in prayer for the pardon of our sins and negligences and she felt as if she was forgiven at least by man when she joined with mrs eden in the appointed feast of easter day  mrs naylor was at church on that and several following sundays but though her husband now showed every kindness to his sister he still obstinately refused to be reconciled to mr devereux  for many weeks poor little kezia looked very unhappy  her blithe smiles were gone her eyes filled with tears whenever she was reminded of her friend she walked to school alone she did not join the sports of the other children but she kept close to the side of mrs eden and seemed to have no pleasure but with her or in nursing her little sister who two sundays after the funeral was christened by the name of agnes  it was agreed by mr mohun and lilias that the grave of the little girl should be marked by a stone cross thus inscribed  agnes eden april 8th 1846 aged 7 years he shall gather the lambs in his arms    chapter xviii  double double toil and trouble    truly the tender mercies of the weak as of the wicked are but cruel  and how did lilias show that she had been truly benefited by her sorrows  did she fall back into her habits of selfindulgence or did she run into illdirected activity selfish as her indolence because only gratifying the passion of the moment  those who lived with her saw but little change kindhearted and generous she had ever been and many had been her good impulses so that while she daily became more steady in welldoing and exerting herself on principle no one remarked it and no one entered into the struggles which it cost her to tame her impetuosity or force herself to do what was disagreeable to herself and might offend emily  however emily could forgive a great deal when she found that lily was ready to take any part of the business of the household and schoolroom which she chose to impose upon her without the least objection yet to leave her to assume as much of the credit of managing as she choseto have no will or way of her own and to help her to keep her wardrobe in order  the schoolroom was just now more of a labour than had ever been the case at least to one who like lilias if she did a thing at all would not be satisfied with half doing it  phyllis was not altered except that she cried less and had in a great measure cured herself of dawdling habits and tricks by her honest efforts to obey well remembered orders of eleanors but still her slowness and dulness were trying to her teachers and lily had often to reproach herself for being angry with her when she was doing her best  but adeline was lilys principal trouble there was a change in her for which her sister could not account  last year when eleanor left them ada was a sweettempered affectionate child docile gentle and excepting a little occasional affectation and carelessness very free from faults but now her attention could hardly be commanded for five minutes together she had lost the habit of ready and implicit obedience was petulant when reproved and was far more eager to attract notice from strangersmore conceited and therefore more affected and worse than all lily sometimes thought she perceived a little slyness though she was never able to prove any one instance completely to herself much less to bring one before her father thus if ada had done any mischief she would indeed confess it on being examined but when asked why she had not told of it directly would say she had forgotten she would avail herself of phylliss assistance in her lessons without acknowledging it and lilias found it was by no means safe to leave the key to the french exercises alone in the room with her  emilys mismanagement had fostered adas carelessness and inattention  lady rotherwoods injudicious caresses helped to make her more affected other faults had grown up for want of sufficient control but this last was principally esthers work  esther had done well at school she liked learning was stimulated by notice was really attached to lilias and tried to deserve her goodwill but her training at school and at home were so different that her conduct was even at the best far too much of eyeservice and she had very little idea of real truth and sincerity  on first coming to the new court she flattered the children because she did not know how to talk to them otherwise and afterwards because she found that miss adas affections were to be gained by praise  then in her ignorant goodnature she had no scruples about concealing mischief which the children had done or procuring for ada little forbidden indulgences on her promise of secrecy a promise which phyllis would not give thus putting a stop to all those in which she would have participated  it was no wonder that ada sometimes helping esther to deceive sometimes deceived by her should have learnt the same kind of cunning and ceased to think it a matter of course to be true and just in all her dealings  but how was it that phyllis remained the same honest phyl that she had ever been not one word savouring of aught but strict truth having ever crossed her lips her thoughts and deeds full of guileless simplicity  she met with the same temptations the same neglect the same bad example as her sister why had they no effect upon her  in the first place flattery could not touch her it was like water on a ducks back she did not know that it was flattery but so thoroughly humble was her mind that no words of esthers would make her believe herself beautiful agreeable or clever  yet she never found out that esther overpraised her sister she admired ada so much that she never suspected that any commendation of her was more than she deserved  again phyllis never thought of making herself appear to advantage and her humility saved her from the habit of concealing small faults for which she expected no punishment and when seriously to blame punishment seemed so natural a consequence that she never thought of avoiding it otherwise than by expressing sorrow for her fault  she was uninfected by esthers deceit though she never suspected any want of truth her singleness of mind was a shield from all evil she knew she was no favourite in the nursery but she never expected to be liked as much as ada her pride and glory  in the meantime emily went on contriving opportunities and excuses for spending her time at devereux castle letting everything fall into lilys hands everything that she had so eagerly undertaken little more than a year ago  and now all was confusion the excellent order in which eleanor had left the household affairs was quite destroyed  attention to the storeroom was one of the ways in which lilias thought that she could best follow the advice of mr devereux since eleanor had always taught that great exactness in this point was most necessary  great disorder now however prevailed there and she found that her only chance of rectifying it was to measure everything she found there and to beg emily to allow her to keep the key for when several persons went to the storeroom no one ever knew what was given out and she was sure that the sweet things diminished much faster than they ought to do but her sister treated the proposal as an attempt to deprive her of her dignity and she was silenced  she was up almost with the light to despatch whatever household affairs could be settled without emily before the time came for the childrens lessons many hours were spent on these while she was continually harassed by phylliss dulness adas inattention and the interruption of work to do for emily and often was she baffled by interference from jane or emily  she was conscious of her unfitness to teach the children and often saw that her impatience ignorance and inefficiency were doing mischief but much as this pained her she could not speak to her father without compromising her sister and to argue with emily herself was quite in vain  emily had taken up the principle of love and defended herself with it on every occasion so that poor lily was continually punished by having her past follies quoted against herself  each day emily grew more selfish and indolent now that lily was willing to supply all that she neglected and to do all that she asked she proved how tyrannical the weak can be  the whole of her quarters allowance was spent in dress and lily soon found that the only chance of keeping her out of debt was to spend her own time and labour in her behalf and what an exertion of patience and kindness this required can hardly be imagined  emily did indeed reward her skill with affectionate thanks and kind praises but she interfered with her sleep and exercise by her want of consideration and hardened herself more and more in her apathetic selfishness  some weeks after easter lilias was arranging some books on a shelf in the schoolroom when she met with a crumpled piece of musicpaper squeezed in behind the books  it proved to be miss westons lost song creased torn duststained and spoiled she carried it to emily who decided that nothing could be done but to copy it for alethea and apologise for the disaster  framing apologies was more in emilys way than copying music and the former task therefore devolved upon lily and occupied her all one afternoon when she ought to have been seeking a cure for the headache in the fresh air it was no cure to find the name of emma weston in the corner and to perceive how great and irreparable the loss of the paper was to her friend  the thought of all her wrongs towards alethea caused more than one large tear to fall to blot the heads of her crotchets and quavers and thus give her all her work to do over again  the letter that she wrote was so melancholy and repentant that it gave great pain to her kind friend who thought illness alone could account for the dejection apparent in the general tone of all her expressions  in answer she sent a very affectionate consoling letter begging lily to think no more of the matter and though she had too much regard for truth to say that she had not been grieved by the loss of emmas writing she added that lilys distress gave her far more pain and that her copy would have great value in her eyes  the beginning of june now arrived and brought with it the time for the return of claude and lord rotherwood  the marquiss carriage met him at raynham and he set down claude at new court on his way to hetherington just coming in to exchange a hurried greeting with the young ladies  their attention was principally taken up by their brother  claude how well you look  how fat you are was their exclamation  is not he said lord rotherwood  i am quite proud of him  not one headache since he went  he will have no excuse for not dancing the polka  i do not return the compliment to you lily said claude looking anxiously at his sister  what is the matter with you  have you been ill  oh no not at all said lily smiling  i am sure there is enough to make any one ill said emily in her deplorable tone i thought this poor parish had had its share of illness with the scarlet fever and now it has turned to a horrible typhus fever  indeed said claude  where  who  oh the naylors and the rays and the walls  john ray died this morning and they do not think that tom naylor will live  well interrupted lord rotherwood i shall not stop to hear any more of this chapter of accidents  i am off but mind remember the 30th and do not any of you frighten yourselves into the fever  he went and lily now spoke  there is one thing in all this claude that is matter of joy tom naylor has sent for robert  then lily i do most heartily congratulate you  i hope things may go better said lily with tears in her eyes the poor baby is with its grandmother  mrs naylor is ill too and every one is so afraid of the fever that nobody goes near them but robert and mrs eden and old dame martin  robert says naylor is in a satisfactory framedetermined on having the baby christenedbut oh i am afraid the christening is to be bought by something terrible  i do not think those fevers are often very infectious said claude  so papa says replied emily but robert looks very ill  he is wearing himself out with sitting up  making himself nurse as well as everything else  this was very distressing but still claude scarcely thought it accounted for the change that had taken place in lilias  her cheek was pale her eye heavy her voice had lost its merry tone claude knew that she had had much to grieve her but he was as yet far from suspecting how she was overworked and harassed  he spoke of eleanors return and she did not brighten she smiled sadly at his attempts to cheer her and he became more and more anxious about her he was not long in discovering what was the matter  the second day after his return robert told them at the churchyard gate that tom naylor was beginning to mend and this seemed to be a great comfort to lily who walked home with a blither step than usual  claude betook himself to the study and saw no more of his sisters till two oclock when lily appeared with the languid dejected look which she had lately worn and seemed to find it quite an effort to keep the tears out of her eyes  ada and phyllis were in very high spirits because they were going to raynham with emily and jane and at every speech of adas lily looked more grieved  after the raynham party were gone claude began to look for lily  he found her in her room an evening dress spread on the bed a roll of ribbon in one hand and with the other supporting her forehead while tears were slowly rolling down her cheeks  lily my dear what is the matter  oh nothing nothing claude said she quickly  nothing no that is not true  tell me lily  you have been disconsolate ever since i came home and i will not let it go on so no answer  then am i to suppose that these new pearlins are the cause of her sorrow  come lily be like yourself and speak  more tears  here drink this water be yourself again or i shall be angry and vexed  now then that is right  make an effort and tell me  there is nothing to tell said lily only you are very kindi do not know what is the matter with meonly i have been very foolish of lateand everything makes me cry  my poor child i knew you had not been well  they do not know how to take care of you lily and i shall take you in hand  i am going to order the horses and we will have a gallop over the downs and put a little colour into your cheeks  no no thank you claude i cannot come indeed i cannot i have this work which must be done today  at work at your finery instead of coming out  you must be altered indeed lily  it is not for myself said lily but i promised emily she should have it ready to wear tomorrow  emily oh  so she is making a slave of you  no no it was a voluntary promise  she does not care about it only she would be disappointed and i have promised  i hate promises said claude  well what must be must be so i will resign myself to this promise of yours only do not make such another  well but that was not all you were not crying about that fine green thing were you  oh no said lily smiling as now she could smile again  what then  i will know lily  i was only vexed at something about the children  then what was it  it was only that ada was idle at her lessons i told her to learn a verb as a punishment she went to emily and somehow or other emily did not find out the exact facts excused her and took her to raynham  i was vexed because i am sure it does ada harm and emily did not understand what i said afterwards i am sure she thought me unjust  how came she not to be present  emily does not often sit in the schoolroom in the morning since she has been about that large drawing  so you are governess as well as ladiesmaid are you lily  what else  housekeeper i suppose as i see you have all the weekly bills on your desk  why lily this is perfectly philanthropic of you you are exemplifying the rule of love in a majestic manner  crying again  water lily once more  lily looked up and smiled claude how can you talk of that old silly nay wicked nonsense of my principle  i was wise above what was written and i have my punishment in the wreck which my frenzy of spirit and folly of tongue have wrought  the unchristened child agness death the confusion of this house all are owing to my hateful principle  i see the folly of it now but emily has taken it up and acts upon it in everything  i do struggle against it a little but i cannot blame any one i can do no good it is all owing to me  we have betrayed papas confidence if he does not see it now it will all come upon him when eleanor comes home and what is to become of us  how it will grieve him to see that we cannot be trusted  poor lily said claude  it is a bad prospect but i think you see the worst side of it  you are not well and therefore doleful this lily i can tell you that the baron always considered emilys government as a kind of experiment and so perhaps he will not be so grievously disappointed as you expect  besides i have a strong suspicion that emilys own nature has quite as much to do with her present conduct as your principle which after all did not live very long  just long enough to unsettle me and make it more difficult for me to get any way right said lily  oh dear what would i give to force backward the wheels of time  but as you cannot you had better try to brighten up your energies come you know i cannot tell you not to look back but i can tell you not to look forward  nay i do tell you literally to look forward out of the window instead of back into this hot room  do not you think the planetree there looks very inviting  suppose we transport emilys drapery there and i want to refresh my memory with spenser i do not think i have touched him since planetree time last year  i believe spenser and the planetree are inseparably woven together in your mind said lily  yes ever since the time when i first met with the book  i remember well roving over the bookcase and meeting with it and taking it out there for fear eleanor should see me and tell mama  phyl with as you like it put me much in mind of myself with that  claude talked in this manner while lily listening with a smile prepared her work  he read and she listened  it was such a treat as she had not enjoyed for a long time for she had begun to think that all her pleasant reading days were past  her work prospered and her face was bright when her sisters came home  but alas  emily was not pleased with her performance she said that she intended something quite different and by manner rather than by words indicated that she should not be satisfied unless lily completely altered it  it was to be worn at the castle the next evening and lily knew she should have no time for it in the course of the day  accordingly at halfpast twelve as claude was going up to bed he saw a light under his sisters door and knocked to ask the cause  lily was still at work upon the trimming and very angry he was particularly when she begged him to take care not to disturb emily  at last by threatening to awake her for the express purpose of giving her a scolding he made lily promise to go to bed immediately a promise which she poor weary creature was very glad to make  claude now resolved to tell his father the state of things for he well knew that though it was easy to obtain a general promise from emily it was likely to be of little effect in preventing her from spurring her willing horse to death  the next morning he rose in time to join his father in the survey which he usually took of his fields before breakfast and immediately beginning on the subject on which he was anxious he gave a full account of his sisters proceedings  in short said he emily and ada torment poor lily every hour of her life she bears it all as a sort of penance and how it is to end i cannot tell  unless said mr mohun smiling as rotherwood would say jupiter will interfere  well jupiter has begun to take measures and has asked mrs weston to look out for a governess  eh  claude he continued after a pause you set up your eyebrows do you  you think it will be a bore  very likely but there is nothing else to be done  jane is under no control phyllis running wild ada worse managed than any child of my acquaintance  and poor lily wearing herself to a shadow in vain attempts to mend matters said claude  if lily was the eldest things would be very different said mr mohun  or even if she had been as wise last year as she is now said claude she would have kept emily in order then but now it is too late  this year is on many accounts much to be regretted said mr mohun but i think it has brought out lilys character  and a very fine character it is said claude  very  she has been and is more childish than eleanor ever was but she is her superior in most points  she has been your pupil claude and she does you credit  thereby hangs a tale which does me no credit muttered claude as he remembered how foolishly he had roused her spirit of contradiction besides the original mischief of naming eleanor the duenna but we will not enter into that now  i see this governess is their best chance  have you heard of one  of several but the only one who seems likely to suit us is out of reach for the present and i do not regret it for i shall not decide till eleanor comes  emily will not be much pleased said claude  it has long been her great dread that aunt rotherwood should recommend one  ay emilys objections and your aunts recommendations are what i would gladly avoid said mr mohun  but lily said claude returning to the subject on which he was most anxious  she is already what ada calls a monotony and there will be nothing left of her by the time eleanor comes if matters go on in their present fashion  i have a plan for her  a little change will set her to rights and we will take her to london when we go next week to meet eleanor  she deserves a little extra pleasure you must take her under your protection and lionise her well  trust me for that said claude  it is the best news i have heard for a long time  well i am glad that one of my remedies meets with your approbation said his father smiling  for the other you are much inclined to pronounce the cure as bad as the disease  not for lily said claude laughing  and said mr mohun i think i can promise you that a remedy will be found for all the other grievances by michaelmas  claude looked surprised but as mr mohun explained no further only observing upon the potatoes through which they were walking he only said then it is next week that you go to london  there is much to do both for rotherwood and for eleanor i shall go as soon as i can but i do not think it will be while this fever is so prevalent  i had rather not be from homei do not like roberts looks    chapter xix  the rectors illness    thou drooping sick man bless the guide that checked or turned thy headstrong youth  the thought of her brothers kindness and the effect of his consolation made lilias awake that morning in more cheerful spirits but it was not long before grief and anxiety again took possession of her  the first sound that she heard on opening the schoolroom window was the tolling of the church bell giving notice of the death of another of those to whom she felt bound by the ties of neighbourhood  at church she saw that mr devereux was looking more ill than he yet had done and it was plainly with very great exertion that he succeeded in finishing the service  the mohun party waited as usual to speak to him afterwards for since his attendance upon naylor had begun he had not thought it safe to come to the new court as usual lest he should bring the infection to them  he was very pale and walked wearily but he spoke cheerfully as he told them that naylor was now quite out of danger  then i hope you did not stay there all last night said mr mohun  no i did not i was so tired when i came back from poor john rays funeral that i thought i would take a holiday and sleep at home  i am afraid you have not profited by your nights rest said emily you look as if you had a horrible headache  now said mr mohun i prescribe for you that you go home and lie down  i am going to raynham and i will tell your friend there that you want help for the evening service  do not think of moving again today  i shall send claude home with you to see that you obey my prescription  claude went home with his cousin and his sisters saw him no more till late in the day when he came to tell them that mr mohun had brought back dr leslie from raynham with him that dr leslie had seen mr devereux and had pronounced that he had certainly caught the fever  lily had made up her mind to this for some time but still it seemed almost as great a blow as if it had come without any preparation the next day was the first sunday that mr devereux had not read the service since he had been rector of beechcroft  the villagers looked sadly at the stranger who appeared in his place and many tears were shed when the prayers of the congregation were desired for robert devereux and thomas and martha naylor  it was announced that the daily service would be discontinued for the present and lily felt as if all the blessings which she had misused were to be taken from her  for some time mr devereux continued very ill and dr leslie gave little hope of his improvement  mr mohun and claude were his constant attendantsan additional cause of anxiety to the miss mohuns  emily was listless and melancholy talking in a maundering dismal way not calculated to brace her spirits or those of her sisters  jane was not without serious thoughts but whether they would benefit her depended on herself for as we have seen by the events of the autumn sorrow and suffering do not necessarily produce good effects though some effects they always produce  thus it was with lilias  grief and anxiety aided her in subduing her will and learning resignation  she did not neglect her daily duties but was more exact in their fulfilment and low as her spirits had been before she now had an inward spring which enabled her to be the support of the rest  she was useful to her father always ready to talk to claude or walk with him in the intervals when he was sent out of the sickroom to rest and breathe the fresh air  she was cheerful and patient with emily and devoid of petulance when annoyed by the spirits of the younger ones rising higher than accorded with the sad and anxious hearts of their elders  her most painful feeling was that it was possible that she might be punished through her cousin as she had already been through agnes that her follies might have brought this distress upon every one and that this was the price at which the childs baptism was to be bought  yet lily would not have changed her present thoughts for any of her varying frames of mind since that fatal whitsuntide  better feelings were springing up within her than she had then known the church service and sunday were infinitely more to her and she was beginning to obtain peace of mind independent of external things  she could not help rejoicing to see how many evidences of affection to the rector were called forth by this illness presents of fruit poured in from all quarters from lord rotherwoods choice hothouse grapes to poor little kezia greys woodstrawberries inquiries were continual and the stillness of the village was wonderful  there was no cricket on the hill no talking in the street no hallooing in the hayfield and no burst of noise when the children were let out of school  many of the people were themselves in grief for the loss of their own relations and when on sunday the miss mohuns saw how many were dressed in black they thought with a pang how soon they themselves might be mourning for one whose influence they had crippled and whose plans they had thwarted during the three short years of his ministry  during this time it was hard to say whether lord rotherwood was more of a comfort or a torment  he was attached to his cousin with all the ardour of his affectionate disposition and not one day passed without his appearing at beechcroft  at first it was always in the parlour at the parsonage that he took up his station and waited till he could find some means of getting at claude or his uncle to hear the last report from them and if possible to make claude come out for a walk or ride with him  and once mr mohun caught him standing just outside mr devereuxs door waiting for an opportunity to make an entrance  he could not or would not see why mr mohun should allow claude to run the risk of infection rather than himself and thus he kept his mother in continual anxiety and even his uncle could not feel by any means certain that he would not do something imprudent  at last a promise was extracted from him that he would not again enter the parsonage but he would not gratify lady rotherwood so far as to abstain from going to beechcroft a place which she began to regard with horror  he now was almost constantly at the new court talking over the reports and quite provoking emily by never desponding and never choosing to perceive how bad things really were  every day which was worse than the last was supposed to be the crisis and every restless sleep that they heard of he interpreted into the beginning of recovery  at last however after ten days of suspense the report began to improve and claude came to the new court with a more cheerful face to say that his cousin was munch better  the world seemed immediately to grow brighter people went about with joyful looks lord rotherwood declared that from the first he had known all would be well and lily began to hope that now she had been spared so heavy a punishment it was a kind of earnest that other things would mend that she had suffered enough  the future no longer hung before her in such dark colours as before mr devereuxs illness though still the new court was in no satisfactory state and still she had reason to expect that her father and eleanor would be disappointed and grieved  thankfulness that mr devereux was recovering and that claude had escaped the infection made her once more hopeful and cheerful she let the morrow take thought for the things of itself rejoicing that it was not her business to make arrangements    chapter xx  the little nephew    you must be father mother both    and uncle all in one  mr mohun had much business to transact in london which he could not leave undone and as soon as his nephew began to recover he thought of setting off to meet mr and mrs hawkesworth who had already been a week at lady rotherwoods house in grosvenor square which she had lent to them for the occasion  claude had intended to stay at home as his cousin was not yet well enough to leave the room but just at this time a college friend of the rectors hearing of his illness wrote to propose to come and stay with him for a month or six weeks and help him in serving his church  mr devereux was particularly glad to accept this kind offer as it left him no longer dependent on mr stephens and the raynham curates and set claude at liberty for the london expedition  all was settled in the short space of one day  the very next they were to set off and in great haste lily did all she could for the regulation of the house packed up her goods and received the commissions of her sisters  ada gave her six shillings with orders to buy either a doll or a bookthe former if eleanor did not say it was silly and phyllis put into her hands a weighty crown piece begging for as many things as it could buy  janes wants and wishes were moderate and sensible and she gave lily the money for them  with emily there was more difficulty  all lilys efforts had not availed to prevent her from contracting two debts at raynham  more than four pounds she owed to lily and this she offered to pay her giving her at the same time a list of commissions sufficient to swallow up double her quarters allowance  lily though really in want of the money for her own use thought the debts at raynham so serious that she begged emily to let her wait for payment till it was convenient and to pay the shoemaker and dressmaker immediately  emily thanked her and promised to do so as soon as she could go to raynham and lily next attempted to reduce her list of london commissions to something more reasonable  in part she succeeded but it remained a matter of speculation how all the necessary articles which she had to buy for herself and all emilys various orders were to come out of her own means reduced as they were by former loans  the next day lilias was on her way to london feeling as she left beechcroft that it was a great relief that the schoolroom and storeroom could not follow her  she was sorry that she should miss seeing alethea weston who was to come home the next day but she left various messages for her and an affectionate note and had received a promise from her sisters that the copy of the music should be given to her the first day that they saw her  her journey afforded her much amusement and it was not till towards the end of the day that she had much time for thinking when her companions being sleepily inclined she was left to her own meditations and to a dull country  she began to revolve her own feelings towards eleanor and as she remembered the contempt and ingratitude she had once expressed she shrank from the meeting with shame and dread and knew that she should feel reproached by eleanors wonted calmness of manner  and as she mused upon all that eleanor had endured and all that she had done such a reverence for suffering and sacrifice took possession of her mind that she was ready to look up to her sister with awe  she began to recollect old reproofs and found herself sitting more upright and examining the sit of the folds of her dress with some uneasiness at the thought of eleanors preciseness  in the midst of her meditations her two companions were roused by the slackening speed of the train and starting up informed her that they were arriving at their journeys end  the next minute she heard her father consigning her and the umbrellas to mr hawkesworths care and all was bewilderment till she found herself in the hall of her aunts house receiving as warm and affectionate a greeting from eleanor as emily herself could have bestowed  and the baby eleanor  asleep but you shall see him and how is ada and all of them why claude how well you look  papa let me help you to take off your greatcoatyou are coldwill you have a fire  never had lily heard eleanor say so much in a breath or seen her eye so bright or her smile so ready yet when she entered the drawing room she saw that mrs hawkesworth was still the eleanor of old  in contrast with the splendid furniture of the apartments a pile of shirts was on the table eleanors wellknown workbasket on the floor and the ceaseless knitting close at hand  much news was exchanged in the few minutes that elapsed before eleanor carried off her sister to her room indulging her by the way with a peep at little harry and one kiss to his round red cheek as he lay asleep in his little bed  it was not eleanors fault that she did not entirely dress lily and unpack her wardrobe but lilias liked to show that she could manage for herself and eleanors praise of her neat arrangements gave her as much pleasure as in days of yore  the evening passed very happily  eleanors heart was open she was full of enjoyment at meeting those she loved and the two sisters sat long together in the twilight talking over numerous subjects all ending in beechcroft or the baby  yet when lily awoke the next morning her awe of eleanor began to return and she felt like a child just returned to school  she was however mistaken eleanor assumed no authority she treated lily as her equal and thus made her feel more like a woman than she had ever done before  lily thought either that eleanor was much altered or that in her folly she must have fancied her far more cold and grave than she really was  she had however no time for studying her character shopping and sightseeing filled up most of her time and the remainder was spent in resting and in playing with little henry  one evening when mr mohun and claude were dining out lilias was left alone with mr and mrs hawkesworth  lily was very tired but she worked steadily at marking eleanors pockethandkerchiefs until her sister seeing how weary she was made her lie down on the sofa  here is a gentleman who is tired too said eleanor dancing the baby we will carry you off sir and leave aunt lily to go to sleep  aunt lily is not so tired as that said lily pray keep him  it is quite bedtime said eleanor in her decided tone and she carried him off  lilias took up the knitting which she had laid down and began to study the stitches  i should like this feathery pattern said she if it did not remind me so much of the fever but by the bye frank have you completed master henrys outfit  i looked forward to helping to choose his pretty little things but i see no preparation but of stockings  why lily did not you know that he was to stay in england  to stay in england  no i never thought of thathow sorry you must be  at this moment eleanor returned and mr hawkesworth told her he had been surprised to find lily did not know their intentions with regard to the baby  if we had any certain intentions we should have told her said eleanor i did not wish to speak to her about it till we had made up our minds  well i know no use in mysteries said mr hawkesworth especially when lily may help us to decide  on his going or staying exclaimed lily eagerly looking to mr hawkesworth who was evidently more disposed to speak than his wife  not on his going or stayingi am sorry to say that point was settled long agobut where we shall leave him  lilys heart beat high but she did not speak  the truth is proceeded mr hawkesworth that this young gentleman has as perhaps you know a grandpapa a grandmamma and also six or seven aunts  with his grandmamma he cannot be left for sundry reasons unnecessary to mention  now one of his aunts is a staid matronly lady and his godmother besides and in all respects the person to take charge of himonly she lives in a small house in a town and has plenty of babies of her own without being troubled with other peoples  master henrys other five aunts live in one great house in a delightful country with nothing to do but make much of him all day long yet it is averred that these said aunts are a parcel of giddy young colts amongst whom if henry escapes being demolished as a baby he will infallibly be spoilt as he grows up now how are we to decide  you have heard the true state of the case lily said mrs hawkesworth  i did not wish to harass papa by speaking to him till something was settled you are certainly old enough to have an opinion  yes lily said frank do you think that the hospitable new court will open to receive our poor deserted child and that these said aunts are not wild colts but discreet damsels  playful as mr hawkesworths manner was lily saw the earnestness that was veiled under it  she felt the solemnity of eleanors appeal and knew that this was no time to let herself be swayed by her wishes  there was a silence  at last after a great struggle lilys better judgment gained the mastery and raising her head she said oh  frank do not ask mei wishbut eleanor when you see how much harm we have done how utterly we have failed  lilys newlyacquired habits of selfcommand enabled her to subdue a violent fit of sobbing which she felt impending but her tears flowed quietly down her cheeks  remember said frank those who mistrust themselves are the most trustworthy  no frank it is not only the feeling of the greatness of the charge it is the knowledge that we are not fit for itthat our own faults have forfeited such happiness  again lily was choked with tears  well said frank we shall judge at beechcroft  at all events one of those aunts is to be respected  eleanor added her very right  this kindness on the part of her brotherinlaw which lily felt to be undeserved caused her tears to flow faster and eleanor seeing her quite overcome led her out of the room helped her to undress and put her to bed with tenderness such as lily had never experienced from her excepting in illness  in spite of bitter regrets when she thought of the happiness it would have been to keep her little nephew and of importunate and disappointing hopes that mrs ridley would find it impossible to receive him lily felt that she had done right and had made a real sacrifice for dutys sake  no more was said on the subject and lily was very grateful to eleanor for making no inquiries which she could not have answered without blaming emily  sightseeing prospered very well under claudes guidance and lilys wonder and delight was a constant source of amusement to her friends her shopping was more of a care than a pleasure for in spite of the handsome equipments which mr mohun presented to all his daughters it was impossible to contract emilys requirements within the limits of what ought to be her expenditure and the different views of her brother and sister were rather troublesome in this matter  claude hated the search for ladies finery and if drawn into it insisted on always taking her to the grandest and most expensive shops while on the other hand though eleanor liked to hunt up cheap things and good bargains she had such rigid ideas about plainness of dress that there was little chance that what she approved would satisfy emily    chapter xxi  charity begins at home    suddenly a mighty jerk a mighty mischief did  in the meantime emily and jane went on very prosperously at home looking forward to the return of the rest of the party on saturday the 17th of july  in this however they were doomed to disappointment for neither mr mohun nor mr hawkesworth could wind up their affairs so as to return before the 24th  maurices holidays commenced on monday the 19th and claude offered to go home on the same day and meet him but in a general council it was determined to the contrary  claude was wanted to stay for a concert on thursday and both mr mohun and eleanor thought maurice without reginald would not be formidable for a few days  at first he seemed to justify this opinion  he did not appear to have any peculiar pursuit unless such might be called a very earnest attempt to make phyllis desist from her favourite preface of ill tell you what and to reform her habit of saying please for instead of if you please  he walked with the sisters carried messages for mr devereux performed some neat little bits of carpentry and was very useful and agreeable  on wednesday afternoon lord rotherwood and florence called their heads the more full of the 30th because the marquis had not once thought of it while mr devereux was ill  among the intended diversions fireworks were mentioned and from that moment rockets wheels and serpents commenced a wild career through maurices brain  through the whole evening he searched for books on what he was pleased to call the art of pyrotechnics studied them all wednesday and the next morning announced his intention of making some fireworks on a new plan  no you must not said emily you will be sure to do mischief  i am going to ask wat for some powder was maurices reply and he walked off  stop him jane stop him cried emily  nothing can be so dangerous  tell him how angry papa would be  though jane highly esteemed her brothers discretion she did not much like the idea of his touching powder and she ran after him to suggest that he had better wait till papas return  then redgie will be at home said maurice and i could not be answerable for the consequence of such a careless fellow touching powder  this great proof of caution quite satisfied jane but not so wat greenwood who proved himself a faithful servant by refusing to let master maurice have one grain of gunpowder without express leave from the squire  maurice then had recourse to jane and his power over her was such as to triumph over strong sense and weak notions of obedience so that she was prevailed upon to supply him with the means of making the dangerous and forbidden purchase  emily was both annoyed and alarmed when she found that the gunpowder was actually in the house and she even thought of sending a note to the parsonage to beg mr devereux to speak to maurice but jane had gone over to the enemy and emily never could do anything unsupported  besides she neither liked to affront maurice nor to confess herself unable to keep him in order and she therefore tried to put the whole matter out of her head in the thoughts of an expedition to raynham which she was about to make in the manner she best liked with jane in the close carriage and the horses reluctantly spared from their farm work  as they were turning the corner of the lane they overtook phyllis and adeline on their way to the school with some work and emily stopped the carriage to desire them to send off a letter which she had left on the chimneypiece in the schoolroom  then proceeding to raynham they made their visits paid emilys debts performed their commissions and met the carriage again at the booksellers shop at the end of about two hours  look here emily exclaimed jane  read this can it be mrs aylmer  the truly charitable said emily contemptuously  mrs aylmer is above  but read  it says unbeneficed clergyman and deceased nobleman and who can that be but uncle rotherwood and mr aylmer  well let us see said emily those things are always amusing  it was an appeal to the truly charitable from the friends of the widow of an unbeneficed clergyman of the diocese one of whose sons had it was said by the kindness of a deceased nobleman received the promise of an appointment in india of which he was unable to avail himself for want of the funds needful for his outfit  this appeal was it added made without the knowledge of the afflicted lady but further particulars might be learnt by application to e f no 5 west street raynham  e f is plainly that bustling little old miss fitchett who wrote to papa for some subscription said emily  you know she is a regular beggar always doing these kind of things but i can never believe that mrs aylmer would consent to appear in this manner  ah but it says without her knowledge said jane  dont you remember rotherwoods lamenting that they were forgotten  yes it is shocking said emily the clergyman that married papa and mamma  ask mr adam what he knows said jane  emily accordingly applied to the bookseller and learnt that mrs aylmer was indeed the person intended  something must be done said she returning to jane  our name will be a help  speak to aunt rotherwood said jane  or suppose we apply to miss fitchett we should have time to drive that way  i am sure i shall not go to miss fitchett said emily she only longs for an excuse to visit us  what can you be thinking of  lend me your pencil jenny if you please  and emily wrote down miss mohun 5 pounds and handed to the bookseller all that she possessed towards paying her just debts to lilias  while she was writing jane had turned towards the window and suddenly exclaiming there is ben  oh that gunpowder darted out of the shop  she had seen the groom on horseback and the next moment she was asking breathlessly is it maurice  no miss jane but miss ada is badly burnt and master maurice sent me to fetch mr saunders  how did it happen  i cant say miss the schoolroom has been on fire and master maurice said the young ladies had got at the gunpowder  emily had just arrived at the door looking dreadfully pale and followed by numerous kind offers of salts and glasses of water but jane perceiving that at least she had strength to get into the carriage refused them all helped her in and with instant decision desired to be driven to the surgeons  emily obeyed like a child and threw herself back in the carriage without a word jane trembled like an aspen leaf but her higher spirit took the lead and very sensibly she managed stopping at mr saunderss door to offer to take him to beechcroft and getting a glass of salvolatile for emily while they were waiting for him  his presence was a great relief for emilys natural courtesy made her exert herself and thus warded off much that would have been very distressing  in the meantime we will return to beechcroft where emilys request respecting her letter had occasioned some discussion between the little girls as they returned from a walk with marianne  phyllis thought that emily meant them to wafer the letter since they were under strict orders never to touch fire or candle but ada argued that they were to seal it and that permission to light a candle was implied in the order  at last phyllis hoped the matter might be settled by asking maurice to seal the letter and meeting him at the front door she began in fortunately with please maurice  i never listen to anything beginning with please said maurice who was in a great hurry only dont touch my powder  away he went deaf to all his sisters shouts of maurice maurice and they went in ada not sorry to be unheard as she was bent on the grand exploit of lighting a lucifer match but phyllis still pleading for the wafer  they found the schoolroom strewed with maurices preparations for fireworks and emilys letter on the chimneypiece  let us take the letter downstairs and put on a wafer said phyllis  wont you come ada  no the stamps are here and so are the matches i can do it easily  but ada ada it would be naughty  only wait and i will show you such a pretty wafer that i know of in the drawingroom  i will run and fetch it  phyllis went and ada stood a few moments in doubt looking at the letter  the recollection of duty was not strong enough to balance the temptation and she took up a match and drew it along the sandpaper  it did not lighta second pull and the flame appeared more suddenly than she had expected while at the same moment the lock of the door turned and fancying it was maurice she started and dropped the match  phyllis opened the door heard a loud explosion and a scream saw a bright flash and a cloud of smoke  she started back but the next moment again opened the door and ran forward  hannah rushed in at the same time and caught up ada who had fallen to the ground  a light in the midst of the smoke made phyllis turn and she beheld the papers on the table on fire maurices powderhorn was in the midst but the flames had not yet reached it and mindful of claudes story she sprung forward caught it up and dashed it through the window she felt the glow of the fire upon her cheek and stood still as if stunned till hannah carried ada out of the room and screamed to her to come away and call joseph  the table was now one sheet of flame and phyllis flew to the pantry where she gave the summons in almost inaudible tones the servants hurried to the spot and she was left alone and bewildered she ran hither and thither in confusion till she met hannah eagerly asking for master maurice and saying that the surgeon must be instantly sent for as adas face and neck were badly burnt  phyllis ran down calling maurice and at length met him at the front door looking much frightened and asking for ada  oh  maurice her face and neck are burnt and badly  she does scream  did i not tell you not to meddle with the powder said maurice  indeed i could not help it said phyllis  stuff and nonsense  it is very well that you have not killed ada and i think that would have made you sorry  phyllis with difficulty mentioned hannahs desire that a surgeon should be sent for  maurice went to look for ben and she followed him  then he began asking how she had done the mischief  i do not know said she i do not much think i did it  mind you cant humbug me  did you not say that you touched the powder  yes but  no buts said maurice making the most of his brief authority  i hate false excuses  what were you doing when it exploded  coming into the room  oh that accounts for it said maurice the slightest vibration causes an explosion of that sort of rocket and of course it was your bouncing into the room  you have had a lesson against rushing about the house  come though cheer up phyl it is a bad business but it might have been worse you will know better next time  dont cry phyl i will explain to you all about the patent rocket  but do you really think that i blew up ada  blew up ada caused the powder to ignite  the inflammable matter  as he spoke he followed phyllis to the nursery and there was so much shocked that he could no longer lord it over her but shrinking back shut himself up in his room and bolted the door  nearly an hour passed away before the arrival of emily jane and mr saunders  phyllis ran down and meeting them at the door exclaimed oh emily poor ada  i am so sorry  the sisters hurried past her to the nursery where ada was lying on the bed half undressed and her face neck and arm such a spectacle that emily turned away ready to faint  mr saunders was summoned and phyllis thrust out of the room  she sat down on the step of the stairs resting her forehead on her knees and trembling listened to the sounds of voices and the screams which now and then reached her ears  after a time she was startled by hearing herself called from the stairs by below a voice which she had not heard for many weeks and springing up saw mr devereux leaning on the banisters  the great change in his appearance frightened her almost as much as the accident itself and she stood looking at him without speaking phyllis said he in a voice hoarse with agitation what is it tell me at once  she could not speak and her wild and frightened air might well give him great alarm  she pointed to the nursery and put her finger to her lips and he beckoning to her to follow him went downstairs and turning into the drawingroom said as he sank down upon the sofa now phyllis what has happened  the gunpowderi made it go off and it has burnt poor adas face mr saunders is there and she screams  phyllis finding herself ready to roar left off speaking and laying her head on the table burst into an agony of crying while mr devereux was too much exhausted to address her at last she exclaimed  i hear the nursery door he is going  she flew to the door and listened and then called out emily jane here is cousin robert  jane came down leaving emily to finish hearing mr saunderss directions  she was even more shocked at her cousins looks than phyllis had been and though she tried to speak cheerfully her manner scarcely agreed with her words  it is all well robert i am sorry you have been so frightened  it is but a slight affair though it looks so shocking  there is no danger  but oh robert you ought not to be here  what shall we do for you you are quite knocked up  oh no said mr devereux i am only a little out of breath  a terrible report came to me and i set off to learn the truth  i should like to hear what mr saunders says of her  i will call him in here before he goes said jane how tired you are you have not been out before  only to the gate to speak to rotherwood yesterday and prevent him from coming in said mr devereux but i have great designs for sunday  they come home tomorrow do not they  jane was much relieved by hearing her cousin talk in this manner and answered yes and a dismal coming home it will be it is too late to let them know  mr saunders now entered and gave a very favourable account of the patient saying that even the scars would probably disappear in a few weeks  his gig had come from raynham and he offered to set mr devereux down at the parsonage a proposal which the latter was very glad to accept  emily and jane had leisure when they were gone to inquire into the manner of the accident  phyllis answered that maurice said that her banging the door had made the powder go off jane then asked where maurice was and phyllis reporting that he was in his own room she repaired thither and knocked twice without receiving an answer  on her call however he opened the door she saw that he had been in tears and hastened to tell him mr saunderss opinion  he fastened the door again as soon as she had entered  if i could have thought it sighed he  fool that i was not to lock the door  then you were not there  phyllis says that she did it by banging the door  is not that nonsense  not at all  did i not read to you in the year book of facts about the patent signal rockets which explode with the least vibration even when a carriage goes by  now mine was on the same principle i was making an experiment on the ingredients i did not expect to succeed the first time and so i took no precautions  well pyrotechnics are a dangerous science  next time i study them it shall be at the workshop at the old court  maurice was sincerely sorry for the consequence of his disobedience and would have been much to be pitied had it not been for his secret satisfaction in the success of his art  he called his sister into the schoolroom to explain how it happened  the room was a dismal sight blackened with smoke and flooded with water the table and part of the floor charred a mass of burnt paper in the midst and a stifling smell of fire  a pane of glass was shattered and maurice ran down to the lawn to see if he could find anything there to account for it  the next moment he returned the powderhorn in his hand  see jenny how fortunate that this was driven through the window with the force of the explosion  the whole place might have been blown to atoms with such a quantity as this  then what was it that blew up asked jane  what i had put out for my rocket about two ounces  if this half pound had gone there is no saying what might have happened  now maurice said jane i must go back to ada and will you run down to the parsonage with a parcel directed to robert that you will find in the hall  this was a device to occupy maurice who as jane saw was so restless and unhappy that she did not like to leave him much as she was wanted elsewhere  he went but afraid to see his cousin only left the parcel at the door  as he was going back he heard a shout and looking round saw lord rotherwood mounted on cedric his most spirited horse galloping up the lane  maurice cried he what is all this they say the new court is blown up and you and half the girls killed but i hope one part is as true as the other  nobody is hurt but ada said maurice but her face is a good deal burnt  eh then she wont be fit for the 30th poor child tell me how it was make haste  i heard it from mr burnet as i came down to dinner  we have a dozen people at dinner  i told him not to mention it to my mother and rode off to hear the truth  make haste half the people were come when i set off  the horses caperings so discomposed maurice that he could scarcely collect his wits enough to answer  some signal rocket on a new principledetonating powder composed of oxymuriateoh rotherwood take care  speak sense and go on  then phyllis came in banged the door and the vibration caused the explosion said maurice scared into finishing promptly  eh banging the door  you had better not tell that story at school  but rotherwood the detonoh that horseyou will be off  not half so dangerous as patent rockets  is emily satisfied with such stuff  dont you know that fulminating silver  what does robert devereux say  really rotherwood i could show you  show me  no if rockets are so perilous i shall have nothing to do with them  stand still cedric  just tell me about ada  is there much harm done  her face is scorched a good deal but they say it will soon be right  i am gladwe will send to inquire tomorrow but i cannot comeha ha a new infernal machine  goodbye friar bacon  away he went and maurice stood looking after him with complacent disdain  there they go cedric and rotherwood equally well provided with brains  what is the use of talking science to either  it was late when he reached the house and his two sisters shortly came down to tea with news that adeline was asleep and phyllis was going to bed  the accident was again talked over  well said emily i do not understand it but i suppose papa will  the telling papa is a bad part of the affair with william and eleanor there too said jane  i do not mean to speak to phyllis about it again said emily it makes her cry so terribly  it will come out fast enough sighed maurice  goodnight  more than once in the course of the night did poor phyllis wake and cry and the next day was the most wretched she had ever spent she was not allowed to stay in the nursery and the schoolroom was uninhabitable so she wandered listlessly about the garden sometimes creeping down to the churchyard where she looked up at the old tower or pondered over the graves and sometimes forgetting her troubles in converse with the dogs in counting the rings in the inside of a foxglove flower or in rescuing tadpoles stranded on the broad leaf of a waterlily  her sisters and brothers were not less forlorn  emily sighed and lamented adeline was feverish and petulant and jane toiled in vain to please and soothe both and to comfort maurice but with all her goodtemper and goodnature she had not the spirit which alone could enable her to be a comfort to any one  ada whined fretted and was disobedient and from maurice she met with nothing but rebuffs he was silent and sullen and spent most of the day in the workshop slowly planing scraps of deal board and watching with a careless eye the curled shavings float to the ground  in the course of the afternoon alethea and marianne came to inquire after the patient  jane came down to them and talked very fast but when they asked for a further explanation of the cause of the accident jane declared that maurice said it was impossible that any one who did not understand chemistry should know how it happened and alethea went away strongly reminded that it was no affair of hers  notes passed between the new court and the vicarage but mr devereux was feeling the effect of his yesterdays exertion too much to repeat it and no persuasion of the sisters could induce maurice to visit him    chapter xxii  the baronial court    still in his eyes his soul revealing he dreams not knows not of concealing does all he does with single mind and thinks of others that are kind  the travellers were expected to arrive at about seven oclock in the evening and in accordance with a wellknown taste of eleanors emily had ordered no dinner but a substantial meal under the name of tea  when the sound of carriage wheels was heard jane was with adeline maurice was in his retreat at the old court and it was with no cheerful alacrity that emily went alone into the hall  phyllis was already at the front door and the instant mr mohun set foot on the threshold her hand grasped his coat and her shrill voice cried in his ear papa i am very sorry i blew up the gunpowder and burnt ada  what my dear where is ada  in bed  i blew up the gunpowder and burnt her face repeated phyllis  we have had an accident said emily but i hope it is nothing very serious only poor ada is a sad figure  in another moment mr mohun and eleanor were on the way to the nursery lilias was following but she recollected that a general rush into a sickroom was not desirable and therefore paused and came back to the hall  the worst was over with phyllis when the confession had been made  she was in raptures at the sight of the baby and was presently showing the nurse the way upstairs but her brother william called her back  phyllis you have not spoken to any one  phyllis turned and came down slowly in her most ungainly manner believing herself in too great disgrace to be noticed by anybody and she was quite surprised and comforted to be greeted by her brothers and lily just as usual  and how did you meet with this misfortune asked mr hawkesworth  i banged the door and made it go off said phyllis  what can you mean said william in a tone of surprise which phyllis took for anger and she hid her face to stifle her sobs  no no do not frighten her said claudes kind voice  run and make friends with your nephew phyllis said mr hawkesworth do not greet us with crying  first tell me what is become of maurice said claude is he blown up too  no he is at the old court said phyllis  shall i tell him that you are come  i will look for him said claude and out he went  the others dispersed in different directions and did not assemble again for nearly half an hour when they all met in the drawingroom to drink tea claude and maurice were the last to appear and on entering the first thing the former said was where is phyllis  in the nursery said jane she has had her supper and chooses to stay with ada  has any one found out the history of the accident said william  i have vainly been trying to make sense of maurices account said claude  sense said william there is none  i am perfectly bewildered said lily every one has a different story only consenting in making phyllis the victim  and added claude i strongly suspect she is not in fault  why should you doubt what she says herself said eleanor  what does she say herself said william nothing but that she shut the door and what does that amount tonothing  she says she touched the powder interposed jane  that is another matter said william no one told me of her touching the powder  but why do you not ask her  she is publicly condemned without a hearing  who accuses her said mr mohun  i can hardly tell said emily she met us saying she was very sorry  yes she accuses herself  every one has believed it to be her  and why  there was a pause but at last emily said how would you account for it otherwise  i have not yet heard the circumstances  maurice i wish to hear your account  i will not now ask how you procured the powder whoever was the immediate cause of the accident you are chiefly to blame  where was the powder  maurice gave his theory and his facts ending with the powderhorn being driven out of the window upon the green  i hear said mr mohun  but maurice did you not say that phyllis touched the powder  how do you reconcile that with this incomprehensible statement  she might have done that before said maurice  now call phyllis said his father  is it not very formidable for her to be examined before such an assembly said emily  the accusation has been public and the investigation shall be the same said mr mohun  then you do not think she did it papa cried lily  not by shutting the door said william  phyllis entered and mr mohun holding out both hands to her drew her towards him and placing her with her back to the others still retained her hands while he said phyllis do not be frightened but tell me where you were when the powder exploded  coming into the room said phyllis in a trembling voice  where had you been  fetching a wafer out of the drawingroom  what was the wafer for  to put on emilys letter which she told us to send  and where was ada  in the schoolroom reading the direction of the letter  tell me exactly what happened when you came back  i opened the door and there was a flash and a bang and a smoke and ada tumbled down  i have one more question to ask  when did you touch the powder  then said phyllis  when it had exploded  take care what you say  was it naughty  i am very sorry said phyllis beginning to cry  what powder did you touch  i do not understand you tell me quietly  i touched the powderhorn  what went off was only a little in a paper on the table and there was a great deal more  when the rocket blew up there was a great noise and ada and i both screamed and hannah ran in and took up ada in her arms  then i saw a great fire and looked and saw emilys musicbook and all the papers blazing so i thought if it got to the powder it would blow up again and i laid hold of the horn and threw it out of the window  that is all i know papa only i hope you are not very angry with me  she looked into his face not knowing how to interpret the unusual expression she saw there  angry with you said he  no my dear child you have acted with great presence of mind  you have saved your sister and hannah from great danger and i am very sorry that you have been unjustly treated  he then gave his little daughter a kiss and putting his hand on her head added whoever caused the explosion phyllis is quite free from blame and i wish every one to understand this because she has been unjustly accused without examination and because she has borne it patiently and without attempting to justify herself  very right observed eleanor  shake hands phyllis said william  the others said more with their eyes than with their lips  phyllis stood like one in a dream and fixing her bewildered looks upon claude said did not i do it  no phyllis you had nothing to do with it was the general exclamation  maurice said it was the door said phyllis  maurice talked nonsense said claude you were only foolish in believing him  phyllis went up to claude and laid her head on his arm mr hawkesworth held out his hand to her but she did not look up and claude withdrawing his arm and raising her head found that she was crying  eleanor and lilias both rose and came towards her but claude made them a sign and led her away  what a fine story this will be for reginald said william  and for rotherwood said mr mohun  i do not see how it happened said eleanor  of course ada did it herself said william  of course said maurice  it was all from emilys setting them to seal her letter that is plain now  would not ada have said so asked eleanor  lily sighed at the thought of what eleanor had yet to learn  did you tell them to seal your letter emily said mr mohun  i am sorry to say that i did tell them to send it said emily but i said nothing about sealing as jane remembers and i forgot that maurices gunpowder was in the room  eleanor shook her head sorrowfully and looked down at her knitting and lily knew that her mind was made up respecting little henrys dwellingplace  it was some comfort to have raised no false expectations  ada must not be frightened and agitated tonight said mr mohun but i hope you will talk to her tomorrow eleanor  well claude have you made phyllis understand that she is acquitted  scarcely said claude she is so overcome and worn out that i thought she had better go to bed and wake in her proper senses to morrow  a very unconscious heroine said william  she is a wonderi never thought her anything but an honest sort of romp  i have long thought her a wonderful specimen of obedience said mr mohun  william and claude now walked to the parsonage and the council broke up but it must not be supposed that this was the last that emily and maurice heard on the subject    chapter xxiii  joys and sorrows    complaint was heard on every part of something disarranged  the next day sunday was one of the most marked in lilys life  it was the first time she saw mr devereux after his illness and though claude had told her he was going to church it gave her a sudden thrill of joy to see him there once more and perhaps she never felt more thankful than when his name was read before the thanksgiving after the service there was an exchange of greetings but lily spoke no word she felt too happy and too awestruck to say anything and she walked back to the new court in silence  in the afternoon she had hopes that a blessing would be granted to her for which at one time she had scarcely dared to hope and she felt convinced that so it would be when she saw that mr devereux wore his surplice although as in the morning his friend read the service  after the second lesson there was a pause and then mr devereux left the chair by the altar walked along the aisle and took his stand on the step of the font  lilys heart beat high as she saw who were gathering round himmrs eden andrew grey james harrington and mrs naylor who held in her arms a healthy rosy checked boy of a year old  she could not have described the feelings which made her eyes overflow with tears as she saw mr devereuxs thin hand sprinkle the drops over the brow of the child and heard him say robert i baptize theewords which she had heard in dreams and then awakened to remember that the parish was at enmity with the pastor the child unbaptized and herself in part the cause  the name of the little boy was an additional pledge of reconciliation and at the same time it made her feel again what had been the price of his baptism  when she looked back upon the dreary feelings which she had so lately experienced it seemed to her as if she might believe that this christening was as it were a pledge of pardon and an earnest of better things  naylor who had recovered much more slowly than mr devereux was at church for the first time and after the service mr mohun sought him out in the churchyard and heartily shook hands with him  lily would gladly have followed his example but she only stood by eleanor and mrs weston who were speaking to mrs eden and mrs naylor admiring the little boy and praising him for his good behaviour in church  love of babies was a strong bond between mrs weston and mrs hawkesworth who seemed to become well acquainted from the first moment that little henry was mentioned and lily was well pleased to see that in janes phrase eleanor took to her friends so well  and yet this day brought with it some annoyances which once would have fretted her so much as to interfere even with such joy as she now felt  the song with which she had taken so much pains ought to have been sent home a week before but owing to the delay caused by emilys carelessness it had been burnt in the fire in the schoolroom and lily could not feel herself forgiven till she had talked the disaster over in private with her friend and this was out of her power throughout the day for something always prevented her from getting alethea alone  in the morning jane stuck close to her and in the afternoon william walked to the school gate with them but aletheas manner was kinder towards her than ever and she was quite satisfied about her  it gave her more pain to perceive that emily in every possible manner avoided being alone with her  it was by her desire that phyllis came to sleep in their room she would keep jane talking there give esther some employment which kept her in their presence linger in the drawingroom while lilias was dressing and at bedtime be too sleepy to say anything but goodnight  that sunday was a sorrowful one to eleanor for in the course of the conversation with ada which mr mohun had desired her to hold she became conscious of the little girls doubledealing ways  it was only by a very close crossexamination that she was able to extract from her a true account of the disaster and though ada never went so far as actually to tell a falsehood it was evident that she was willing to conceal as much as possible and to throw the blame on other people  and when the real facts were confessed she did not seem able to comprehend why she was regarded with displeasure her instinct of truth and obedience was lost for the time and eleanor saw it with the utmost pain  adeline had been her especial darling and cold as her manner had often been towards the others it ever was warm towards the motherless little one whom she had tended and cherished with most anxious care from her earliest infancy  she had left her gentle candid and affectionate a loving engaging little creature and how did she find her now  her fair bright face disfigured her caresses affected her mind turned to deceit and prevarication  well might eleanor feel it more than ever painful to leave her own little henry to the care of others and well it was for her that she had learned to find comfort in the consciousness that her duty was clear  the next morning emily learned what was henrys destination  oh eleanor said she why do you not leave him here  we should be so rejoiced to have him  thank you i am afraid it is out of the question answered eleanor quietly  why dear eleanor  you know how glad we should be  i should have thought proceeded emily a little hurt that you would have wished him to live in your own home  eleanor did not speak and emily who had the little boy in her arms went on talking to him  come baby let us persuade mamma to let you stay with aunt emily  ask papa henry wont you  seriously eleanor has frank considered how much better it would be to have him in the country  he has emily he once wished much to leave him here  i am sure grandpapa would like it said emily  do you observe eleanor how fond he is of baby always calling him harry too as if he liked the sound of the name  it has all been talked over emily and it cannot be  with papa asked emily in surprise  no with lily  with lily exclaimed emily  did not aunt lily wish to keep you harry  i thought she was very fond of you  you had better inquire no further said eleanor except of your own conscience  did lily think us unfit to take care of him asked emily in surprise  as she spoke lily herself came in the key of the storeroom in her hand and looks of consternation on her face  she came to announce a terrible deficiency in the preserved quinces which she herself had carefully put aside on a shelf in the storeroom and which emily said she had not touched in her absence  let me see said eleanor rising and setting off to the storeroom emily and lily followed with a sad suspicion of the truth  on the way they looked into the nursery to give little henry to his nurse and to ask jane who was sitting with ada what she remembered about it  jane knew nothing and they went on to the storeroom where eleanor quite in her element began rummaging arranging and sighing over the confusion while lily lent a helping hand and emily stood by wishing that her sister would not trouble herself presently jane came running up with a saucer in her hand containing a quarter of a quince and some syrup which she said she had found in the nursery cupboard in searching for a puzzle which ada wanted  and said jane i should guess that miss ada herself knew something about it for when i could not find the puzzle in the righthand cupboard she was so very unwilling that i should look into that one she said there was nothing there but the boys old playthings and esthers clothes  and i do not know whether you saw how she fidgeted when you were talking about the quinces before you went up  it is much too plain sighed lily  oh rachel why did we not listen to you  do you suppose said eleanor that ada has been in the habit of taking the key and helping herself  no said emily but that esther has helped her  ah said eleanor i never thought it wise to take her but how could she get the key  you do not mean that you trusted it out of your own keeping  it began while we were ill faltered emily and afterwards it was difficult to bring matters into their former order  but oh eleanor what is to be done sighed lily  speak to papa of course said eleanor  he is gone to the castle and in the meantime we had better take an exact account of everything here  and esther  and ada inquired the sisters  i think it will be better to speak to him before making so grave an accusation said eleanor  they now commenced that wearisome occupationa complete settingto rights eleanor counted weighed and measured and extended her cares from the stores to every other household matter  emily made her escape and went to sit with ada but lily and jane toiled for several hours with eleanor till lily was so heated and wearied that she was obliged to give up a walk to broomhill and spend another day without a talk with alethea  however she was so patient ready and goodhumoured that eleanor was well pleased with her  she could hardly think of the slight vexation when her mind was full of sorrow and shame on esthers account  it was she who contrary to the advice of her elders had insisted on bringing her into the house she had allowed temptation to be set in her way and had not taken sufficient pains to strengthen her principles and how could she do otherwise than feel guilty of all esthers faults and of those into which she had led adeline  on mr mohuns return ada was interrogated  she pitied herselfsaid she did not think papa would be angryprevaricatedand tried to coax away his inquiries but all in vain and at length by slow degrees the confession was drawn from her that she had been used to asking esther for morsels of sweet things when she was sent to the storeroom that afterwards she had seen her packing up some tea and sugar to take to her mother and that esther on that occasion and several others purchased her silence by giving her a share of pilfered sweetmeats  telling her that he only spared her a very severe punishment for the present on account of her illness mr mohun left her and on his way downstairs met phyllis  phyl said he did esther ever give you sweet things out of the storeroom  once papa when she had been putting out some currant jam she offered me what had been left in the spoon  did you take it  no papa for eleanor used to say it was a bad trick to lick out spoons  did you ever know that she took tea and sugar from the storeroom for her mother  took home tea and sugar to her mother  she could not have done it papa  it would be stealing  esther who was next called for cried a great deal and begged for pardon pleading again and again that   it was mother an answer which made her young mistresses again sigh over the remembrance of rachels disregarded advice  her fate was left for consideration and consultation with mr devereux for mr mohun seeing himself to blame for having allowed her to be placed in a situation of so much trial and thinking that there was much that was good about her did not like to send her to her home where she was likely to learn nothing but what was bad    chapter xxiv  loves labour lost    and well with ready hand and heart     each task of toilsome duty taking did one dear inmate take her part    the last asleep the earliest waking  in the course of the afternoon lord rotherwood and florence called to see eleanor inquire after ada and make the final arrangements for going to a morning concert at raynham the next day  lady rotherwood was afraid of the fatigue and florence therefore wished to accompany her cousins who as eleanor meant to stay at home were to be under mrs westons protection  lady florence and her brother therefore agreed to ride home by broomhill and mention the plan to mrs weston and took their leave appointing adams shop as the place of rendezvous  next morning emily lilias and jane happened to be together in the drawingroom when mr mohun and claude came in the former saying to lily here is the masons account for the gravestone which you wished to have put up to agnes eden it comes to two pounds  you undertook half the expense and as claude is going to raynham he will pay for it if you will give him your sovereign  i will said lily but first i must ask emily to pay me for the london commissions  emily repented not having had a private conference with lily  so you have not settled your accounts said mr mohun  i hope lily has not ruined you emily  i thought her a mirror of prudence said claude  well emily is the sovereign forthcoming  i am going directly for frank has something to do at raynham and william is going to try his gray in the phaeton  i am afraid you will think me very silly said emily after some deliberation but i hope lily will not be very angry when i confess that seven shillings is the sum total of my property  oh emily cried lily in dismay what has become of your five pounds  i gave them as a subscription for a clergymans widow in distress said emily it was the impulse of a moment i could not help it and dear lily i hope it will not inconvenience you  if papa will be kind enough to wait for this pound till michaelmas said lily  i would wait willingly said mr mohun but i will not see you cheated  how much does she owe you  the commissions came to six pounds three said lily looking down  but lily said jane you forget the old debt  never mind whispered lily but mr mohun asked what jane had said and claude repeated her speech upon which he inquired what old debt  papa said emily in her most candid tone i do not know what i should have done but for lilys kindness  really i cannot get on with my present allowance being the eldest so many expenses come upon me  then am i to understand replied mr mohun that your foolish vanity has led you to encroach on your sisters kindness and to borrow of her what you had no reasonable hope of repaying  again lily what does she owe you  emily felt the difference between the sharp curious eyes with which jane regarded her and the sorrowful downcast looks of lily who replied the old debt is four pounds but that does not signify  well resumed her father i cannot blame you for your goodnature though an older person might have acted otherwise  you must have managed wonderfully well to look always so well dressed with only half your proper income  here is the amount of the debt  is it right  and lily one thing more i wish to thank you for what you have done towards keeping this house in order  you have worked hard and endured much and from all i can gather you have prevented much mischief  much has unfairly been thrown upon you and you have well and steadily done your duty  for you emily i have more to say to you but i shall not enter on it at present for it is late  you had better get ready or you will keep the others waiting  i do not think i can go sighed emily  you are wanted said mr mohun  i do not think your aunt would like florence to go without you  lily had trembled as much under her fathers praise as emily under his blame  she did not feel as if his commendation was merited and longed to tell him of her faults and follies but this was no fit time and she hastened to prepare for her expedition her spirits scarcely in time for a party of pleasure  jane talked about the 30th and asked questions about london all the way to raynham and both emily and lily were glad to join in her chatter in hopes of relieving their own embarrassment  on arriving at the place of meeting they found lady florence watching for them  i am glad you are come said she rotherwood will always set out either too soon or too late and this time it was too soon so here we have been full a quarter of an hour but he does not care  there he is quite engrossed with his book  lord rotherwood was standing by the counter reading so intently that he did not see his cousins arrival  when they entered he just looked up shook hands asked after ada and went on reading  lily began looking for some books for the school which she had long wished for and was now able to purchase emily sat down in a melancholy abstracted mood and florence and jane stood together talking  you know you are all to come early said the former i do not know how we should manage without you  rotherwood insists on having everything the same daypoor people first and gentry and farmers altogether  mamma does not like it and i expect we shall be dreadfully tired but he says he will not have the honest poor men put out for the fashionables and you know we are all to dance with everybody  but jenny who is this crossing the street  look you have an eye for oddities  miss fitchett the subscriptionhunter said jane  she is actually coming to hunt us  i believe i have my purse  oh emily is to be the first victim  miss fitchett advanced to emily and saying that she believed she had the honour to address miss mohun began to tell her that her friend having been prematurely informed of her small efforts had with a noble spirit of independence begged that the subscription might not be continued and that what had already been given might be returned and she rejoiced in this opportunity of making the explanation  but miss fitchett could not bear to relinquish the fivepound note and added that perhaps miss mohun might not object to apply her subscription to some other object the dorcas society for instance  thank you i have no interest in the dorcas society said emily a reply which brought upon her a full account of all its aims and objects and as still her polite looks spoke nothing of assent miss fitchett went on with a string of other societies speaking the louder and the more eagerly in the hope of attracting the attention of the young marquis and his sister  emily was easily overwhelmed with words and not thinking it ladylike to claim her money yet feeling that none of these societies were fit objects for it she stood confused and irresolute unwilling either to consent or refuse jane perceiving her difficulty turned to lord rotherwood and rousing him from his book explained emilys distress in a few words and sent him to her rescue  he stepped forward just as miss fitchett taking silence for consent was proceeding to thank emily i think you misunderstand miss mohun said he  since her subscription is not needed by the person for whom it was intended she would be glad to have it restored  she does not wish to encourage any unauthorised societies  boy as he was in appearance still more than in age there was a dignity in his manner which together with the principle on which he spoke overawed miss fitchett even more than his rank  she only said oh my lord i beg your pardon  certainly only  the note was placed in emilys hands and with a bow from lord rotherwood she retreated murmuring to herself the remonstrance which she had not courage to bestow upon the marquis  thank you thank you rotherwood said emily you have done me a great service  well done rotherwood said florence you have given the old lady something to reflect upon  made a public announcement of principle said lily  i was determined to give her a reason said the marquis laughing but i assure you i felt like the stork with its head in the wolfs mouth i thought she would give me a screed of doctrine  how came you to let your property get unto her clutches emily  it was a subscription for mrs aylmer said emily  our curates wife cried he with a start how was it  florence did you know anything  i thought she was in london  why were we in the dark  tell me all  all i know is that she is living somewhere in raynham and last week there was a paper here to say that she was in want of the means of fitting out her son for india  yes yes johnny i know my father did get a promise for himwell  that is all i know except that she does not choose to be a beggar  poor mrs aylmer shameful neglect she shall not be illused any longer i will find her out this instant  dont wait for me  and after a few words to mr adams off he went walking as fast as he could and leaving the young ladies not without fear of another invasion  soon however the brothers came in and presently after mrs weston appeared  it was agreed that lord rotherwood should be left to his own devices and they set out for the concertroom  poor florence lost much pleasure in disappointment at his nonappearance but when the concert was over they found him sitting in the carriage reading  as soon as they appeared he sprang out and came to meet them pouring rapidly out a history of his adventures  then you have found them and what can be done for them  everything ought to be done but mrs aylmer has a spirit of independence  that foolish womans advertisement was unknown to her till emilys five pounds came in so fine a nestegg that she could not help cackling whereupon mrs aylmer insisted on having every farthing returned  can she provide the boys outfit  she says so or rather that her daughter can but i shall see about that  it is worth while to be of age  imagine  that bank which failed was the end of my fathers legacy  they must have lived on a fraction of nothing  edward went to sea  miss aylmer went out as a governess  now she is at home  miss aylmer exclaimed miss weston i know she was a clergymans daughter  do you know the name of the family she lived with  was it grant said william  i remember hearing of her going to some grants  it was said alethea she must be the same  is she at home  yes said lord rotherwood and you may soon see her for i mean to have them all to stay at the castle as soon as our present visitors are gone  my mother and florence shall call upon them on friday  now said claude i have not found out what brought them back to raynham  have you lived at beechcroft all your life and never discovered that there is a grammarschool at raynham with special privileges for the sons of clergymen of the diocese  a few more words and the cousins parted emily by no means sorry that she had been obliged to go to raynham  she tendered the five pound note to her father but he desired her to wait till friday and then to bring him a full account of her expenditure of the year  her irregular ways made this almost impossible especially as in the present state of affairs she wished to avoid a private conference with either lily or jane  she was glad that an invitation to dine and sleep at the castle on wednesday would save her from the peril of having to talk to lily in the evening  reginald came home on tuesday to the great joy of all the party and especially to that of phyllis  this little maiden was more puzzled by the events that had taken place than conscious of the feeling which she had once thought must be so delightful  she could scarcely help perceiving that every one was much more kind to her than usual especially claude and lily and lord rotherwood said things which she could not at all understand  her observation to reginald was was it not lucky i had a cough on twelfth day or claude would not have told me what to do about gunpowder  reginald troubled phyllis much by declaring that nothing should induce him to kiss his nephew and she was terribly shocked by the indifference with which eleanor treated his neglect even when it branched out into abuse of babies in general and in particular of henrys bald head and turnedup nose  in the evening of wednesday phyllis was sitting with ada in the nursery when reginald came up with the news that the party downstairs were going to practise country dances  eleanor was to play claude was to dance with lily and frank with jane and he himself wanted phyllis for a partner  oh sighed ada i wish i was there to dance with you redgie what are the others doing  maurice is reading and william went out as soon as dinner was over make haste phyl  dont go said ada i shall be alone all tomorrow and i want you  nonsense said reginald do you think she is to sit poking here all day playing with those foolish london things of yours  but i am ill redgie  i wish you would not be cross  everybody is cross to me now i think  i will stay ada said phyllis  you know redgie i dance like a cow  you dance better than nothing said reginald i must have you  but you are not ill redgie said phyllis  he went down in displeasure and was forced to consider sir maurices picture as his partner until presently the door opened and phyllis appeared  so you have thought better of it cried he  no said phyllis i cannot come to dance but ada wants you to leave off playing  she says the music makes her unhappy for it makes her think about tomorrow  rather selfish miss ada said claude  stay here phyllis now you are come said mr mohun i will go and speak to ada  phyllis was now captured and made to take her place opposite to reginald but more than once she sighed under the apprehension that ada was receiving a lecture  this was the case and very little did poor ada comprehend the change that had taken place in the conduct of almost every one towards her she did not perceive that she was particularly naughty and yet she had suddenly become an object of blame instead of a spoiled pet  formerly her little slynesses had been unnoticed and her overbearing ways towards phyllis scarcely remarked but now they were continually mentioned as grievous faults esther her especial friend and comforter was scarcely allowed to come into the same room with her hannah treated her with a kind of grave silent respect far from the familiarity which she liked little henrys nurse never would talk to her and if it had not been for phyllis she would have been very miserable  on phyllis however she repaid herself for all the mortifications that she received while the sweettempered little girl took all her fretfulness and exactions as results of her illness and went on pitying her and striving to please her  when phyllis came up to wish her goodnight she was received with an exclamation at her lateness in a peevish tone  yes i am late said phyllis merrily but we had not done dancing till teatime and then eleanor was so kind as to say i might sit up to have some tea with them  ah and you quite forgot how tiresome it is up here with nobody to speak to said ada  how cross they were not to stop the music when i said it made me miserable  claude said it was selfish to want to stop five peoples pleasure for one said phyllis  but i am so ill said ada  if claude was as uncomfortable as i am he would know how to be sorry for me  and only thinkphyl what are you doing  do not you know i do not like the moonlight to come on me  it is like a great face laughing at me  well i like the moon so much said phyllis creeping behind the curtain to look out there is something so white and bright in it when it comes on the bedclothes it makes me go to sleep thinking about white robes oh and all sorts of nice things  i cant bear the moon said ada do not you know maurice says that the moon makes the people go mad and that is the reason it is called lunacy after la lune  i asked miss weston about that said phyllis because of the psalm and she said it was because it was dangerous to go to sleep in the open air in hot countries  ada i wish you could see now  there is the great round moon in the middle of the sky and the sky such a beautiful colour and a few such great bright stars and the trees so dark and the white lilies standing up on the black pond and the lawn all white with dew what a fine day it will be tomorrow  a fine day for you said ada but only think of poor me all alone by myself  you will have baby said phyllis  babyif he could talk it would be all very well  it is just like the cross people in books  here i shall lie and cry all the time while you are dancing about as merry as can be  no no ada you will not do that said phyllis with tears in her eyes  there is baby with all his pretty ways and you may teach him to say aunt ada and i will bring you in numbers of flowers and there is your new doll and all the pretty things that came from london and the new book of fairy tales and all sortsoh no do not cry ada  but i shall for i shall think of you dancing and not caring for me  i do care adawhy do you say that i do not  i cannot bear it ada dear ada  you dont or you would not go and leave me alone  then ada i will not go said phyllis i could not bear to leave you crying here all alone  thank you dear good phyl but i think you will not have much loss you know you do not like dancing and you cannot do it well and they will be sure to laugh at you  and i daresay redgie and marianne will tell us all about it said phyllis sighing  i should rather like to have seen it but they will tell us  then do you promise to staytheres a dear said ada  yes said phyllis  cousin robert is coming in and that will be very nice and i hope he will not look as he did the day the gunpowder went offoh dear  she went back to the window to get rid of her tears unperceived  ah cried she there is some one in the garden  a man screamed adaa thief a robbercall somebody  no no said phyllis laughing it is only william he has been out all the evening and now papa has come out to speak to him and they are walking up and down together  i wonder whether he has been sitting with cousin robert or at broomhill  well goodnight ada here comes hannah    chapter xxv  the thirtieth of july    the heir with roses in his shoes that night might village partner choose  the 30th of july was bright and clear and phyllis was up early gathering flowers which with the help of janes nimble fingers she made into elegant little bouquets for each of her sisters and for claude  how is this said mr hawkesworth pretending to look disconsolate am i to sing fair phyllida flouts me or why is my buttonhole left destitute  perhaps that is for you on the sidetable said lily  oh no said phyllis those are some provence roses for miss weston and marianne because miss weston likes those and they have none at broomhill  redgie is going to take care of them  i will get you a nosegay frank  i did not know you liked it  she started up  how prudent phyllis said eleanor not to have put on your muslin frock yet  oh  i am not going said phyllis  not going was the general outcry  no poor ada cries so about being left at home with only baby that i cannot bear it and so i promised to stay  away went phyllis and reginald exclaimed well she shall not be served so  i will go and tell ada so this instant  off he rushed and putting in his head at the nursery door shouted ada i am come to tell you that phyl is not to be made your blacka moor slave  she shall go that is settled  down he went with equal speed without waiting for an answer and arrived while eleanor was saying that she thought ada was provided with amusement with the baby her playthings and books and that mr devereux had promised to make her a visit  anybody ought to stay at home rather than phyllis said lily i think i had better stay  no no lily said jane you are more wanted than i am you are really worth talking to and dancing with i had much better be at home  i forgot exclaimed william  mrs weston desired me to say that she is not going and she will take care of ada  mr weston will set her down at halfpast ten and take up one of us  i will be that one said reginald i have not seen miss weston since i came home  i meant to walk to broomhill after dinner yesterday only the baron stopped me about that countrydance  last christmas i made her promise to dance with me today  lily had hoped to be that one but she did not oppose reginald and turned to listen to eleanor who was saying let us clearly understand how every one is to go it will save a great deal of confusion  you and jane and maurice go in the phaeton do not you and who drives you  william i believe said lily  claude goes earlier so he rides the gray  then there is the chariot for you and frank and papa and phyllis  so it was proposed but matters turned out otherwise  the phaeton which with a promoted carthorse was rather a slow conveyance was to set out first but the whole of the freight was not ready in time the ladies were in the hall as soon as it came to the door but neither of the gentlemen were forthcoming  reginald who was wandering in the hall was sent to summon them but down he came in great wrath  maurice had declared that he was not ready and they must wait for him till he had tied his neckcloth which reginald opined would take three quarters of an hour as he was doing it scientifically and william had said that he was not going in the gig at all that he had told wat greenwood to drive and that reginald must go instead of maurice  in confirmation of the startling fact wat who had had a special invitation from the marquis was sitting in the phaeton in his best black velvet coat  jane only hoped that emily would not look out of the window or she would certainly go into fits on seeing them arrive with the old phaeton the thicklegged carthorse and wat greenwood for a driver and reginald after much growling at maurice much bawling at williams door and as jane said romping and roaring in all parts of the house was forced to be resigned to his fate and all the way to hetherington held a very amusing conversation with his goodnatured friend the keeper  they were overtaken nodded to and passed by the rest of their party  maurice had been reduced to ride the pony william came with the westons and the chariot load was just as had been before arranged  claude came out to meet them at the door saying i need not have gone so early  what do you think has become of the hero of the day guess i will just give you this hint   though on pleasure he was bent he had no selfish mind   oh the aylmers i suppose said lilias  right lily he heard something at dinner yesterday about a school for clergymens sons which struck him as likely to suit young devereux aylmer and off he set at seven oclock this morning to raynham to breakfast with mrs aylmer and talk to her about it never let me hear again that he is engrossed with his own affairs  and why is he in such a hurry asked lily  tis his nature said claude besides travers who mentioned this school goes away tomorrow  my aunt is in a fine fright lest he should not come back in time  did not you hear her telling papa so in the drawingroom  there he is riding up to the door said phyllis who had joined them in the hall  lord rotherwood stopped for a few moments at the door to give some directions to the servants and then came quickly in  ah there you arewhat time is it  it is all right claude devereux is just the right age  i asked him a few questions this morning and he will stand a capital examination  ha phyl i am glad to see you  i wish you many happy returns of the day cousin rotherwood  thank you phyl we had better see how we get through one such day before we wish it to return  are the rest come  he went on into the drawingroom and hastily informing his mother that he had sent the carriage to fetch miss aylmer and her brothers to the feast called claude to come out on the lawn to look at the preparations  the bowlinggreen was to serve as drawingroom and at one end was pitched an immense tent where the dinner was to be  i say claude said he in his quickest and most confused way i depend upon you for one thing  do not let the baron be too near me  the baron of beef said claude  no the baron of beechcroft  if you wish my speech to be radara tadara put him where i can imagine that he hears me  very well said claude laughing have you any other commands  noyes i have though  you know what we settled about the toasts hunt up old farmer elderfield as soon as he comes and do not frighten him  if you could sit next to him and make him get up at the right time it would be best  tell him i will not let any one propose my health but my greatgrandfathers tenant  you will manage it best  and tell frank hawkesworth and mr weston or some of them to manage so that the gentry may not sit together in a herd two or three together would be best  mind claude i depend on you for being attentive to all the damsels  i cannot be everywhere at once and i see your great captain will be of no use to me  here news was brought that the labourers had begun to arrive and the party went to the walnut avenue where the feast was spread  it was pleasant to see so many poor families enjoying their excellent dinner but perhaps the pleasantest sight was the lord of the feast speaking to each poor man with all his bright goodnatured cordiality  mr mohun was surprised to see how well he knew them all considering how short a time he had been among them and lilias found florence rise in her estimation when she perceived that the inside of the hetherington cottages were not unknown to her  do you know florence said she as they walked back to the house together i did you great injustice  i never expected you to know or care about poor people  no more i did till this winter said florence i could not do anything you know before  indeed i do not do much now only rotherwood has made me go into the school now and then and when first we came he made it his especial request that whenever a poor woman came to ask for anything i would go and speak to her  and so i could not help being interested about those i knew  how odd it is that we never talked about it said lily  i never talk of it said florence because mamma never likes to hear of my going into cottages with rotherwood  besides somehow i thought you did it as a matter of duty and not of pleasure  oh rotherwood is that you  the aylmers are come said lord rotherwood drawing her arm into his and i want you to come and speak to them florence and lily i cant find any one all the great elders have vanished  you know them of old do not you lily  of old  yes but of so old that i do not suppose they will know me you must introduce me  he hastened them to the drawingroom where they found miss aylmer a sensible ladylike looking person and two brothers of about fifteen and thirteen  well miss aylmer i have brought you two old friends so old that they think you have forgotten themmy cousin lilias and my sister florence  we have not forgotten you miss aylmer said florence warmly shaking hands with her  you seem so entirely to belong to hetherington that i scarcely knew the place without you  there was something that particularly pleased lily in the manner in which miss aylmer answered  florence talked a little while and then proposed to adjourn to the supplementary drawingroomthe lawn where the company were already assembling  florence was soon called off to receive some other guest and lilias spent a considerable time in sitting under a tree talking to miss aylmer whom she found exceedingly pleasant and agreeable remembering all that had happened during their former intercourse and interested in everything that was going on  lily was much amused when her companion asked her who that gentleman wasthat tall thin young man with dark hair whom she had seen once or twice speaking to lord rotherwood  the tall gentleman advanced spoke to miss aylmer told lily that the world was verging towards the tent and giving one arm to her and the other to miss aylmer took that direction  in the meantime phyllis had been walking about with her eldest sister and wondering what had become of all the others  in process of time she found herself seated on a high bench in the tent with a most beautiful pinkand white sugar temple on the table before her  she was between eleanor and frank  all along one side of the table was a row of faces which she had never seen before and she gazed at them in search of some wellknown countenance  at last mr weston caught her eye and nodded to her  next to him she saw marianne then reginald on the other side alethea and william  a little tranquillised by seeing that every one was not lost she had courage to eat some cold chicken to talk to frank about the sugar temple and to make an inventory in her mind of the smartest bonnets for adas benefit  she was rather unhappy at not having found out when grace was said before dinner and she made eleanor promise to tell her in time to stand up after dinner  she could not however hear much though warned in time and by this time more at ease and rather enjoying herself than otherwise  now eleanor told her to listen for cousin rotherwood was going to speak  she listened but knew not what was said until mr hawkesworth told her it was church and queen  what church and queen had to do with cousin rotherwoods birthday she could not imagine and she laid it up in her mind to ask claude  the next time she was told to listen she managed to hear more  by the help of eleanors directions she found out the speaker an aged farmer in a drab greatcoat his head bald excepting a little silky white hair which fell over the collar of his coat  it was mr elderfield the oldest tenant on the estate and he was saying in a slow deliberate tone that he was told he was to propose his lordships health  it was a great honour for the like of him and his lordship must excuse him if he did not make a fine speech  all he could say was that he had lived eightythree years on the estate and held his farm nearly sixty years he had seen three marquises of rotherwood besides his present lordship and he had always found them very good landlords he hoped and believed his lordship was like his fathers and he was sure he could do no better than tread in their steps  he proposed the health of lord rotherwood and many happy returns of the day to him  the simplicity and earnestness of the old mans tones were appreciated by all and the tremendous cheer which almost terrified phyllis was a fit assent to the hearty good wishes of the old farmer  now comes the trial whispered claude to lilias after he had vehemently contributed his proportion to the noise  lilias saw that his colour had risen as much as if he had to make a speech himself and he earnestly examined the coronet on his fork while every other eye was fixed on the marquis  eloquence was not to be expected but at least lord rotherwood spoke clearly and distinctly  my friends said he you must not expect much of a speech from me i can only thank you for your kindness say how glad i am to see you here and tell you of my earnest desire that i may not prove myself unworthy to be compared with my forefathers  here was a pause claudes hand shook and lily saw how anxious he was but in another moment the marquis went on smoothly  now i must ask you to drink the health of a gentleman who has done his utmost to compensate for the loss which we sustained nine years ago and to whom i owe any good intentions which i may bring to the management of this property i beg leave to propose the health of my uncle mr mohun of beechcroft  claude was much surprised for his cousin had never given him a hint of his intention  it was a moment of great delight to all the young mohuns when the cheer rose as loud and hearty as for the young lord himself and phyllis smiled and wondered when she saw her papa rise to make answer  he said that he could not attempt to answer lord rotherwood as he had not heard what he said but that he was much gratified by his having thought of him on this occasion and by the goodwill which all had expressed  this was the last speech that was interesting lady rotherwoods health and a few more toasts followed and the party then left the tent for the lawn where the cool air was most refreshing and the last beams of the evening sun were lighting the tops of the trees  the dancing was now to begin and this was the time for claude to be useful  he had spent so much time at home and had accompanied his father so often in his rides that he knew every one and he was inclined to make every exertion in the cause of his cousin and on this occasion seemed to have laid aside his indolence and disinclination to speak to strangers  lady florence was also indefatigable darting about with a wonderful perception who everybody was and with whom each would like to dance she seized upon little devereux aylmer for her own partner before any one else had time to ask her and carried him about the lawn hunting up and pairing other shy people  why reginald what are you about  you can manage a countrydance make haste where is your partner  i meant to dance with miss weston said reginald piteously  miss weston  here she is  that is only marianne said reginald  oh  miss weston is dancing with william  marianne will you accept my apologies for this discourteous cousin of mine  i am perfectly horrorstruck  there redgie take her with a good grace you will never have a better partner  marianne was only too glad to have reginald presented to her ungracious as he was but the poor little couple met with numerous disasters  they neither of them knew the way through a country dance and were almost run over every time they went down the middle reginalds heels were very inconvenient to his neighbours so much so that once claude thought it expedient to admonish him that dancing was not merely an elegant name for football without a ball every now and then some of their friends gave them a hasty intimation that they were all wrong but that they knew already but too well at last just when marianne had turned scarlet with vexation and reginald was growing so desperate that he had thoughts of running a way the dance came to an end and reginald with very scanty politeness to his partner rushed away to her sister saying in rather a reproachful tone miss weston you promised to dance with me  i have not forgotten my promise said alethea smiling  at the same moment claude hurried up saying william i want a partner for miss wilkins of the wold farm  miss wilkins let me introduce captain mohun  you see i have made the captain available said claude presently after meeting lord rotherwood as he speeded across the lawn  have you  i did not think him fair game said the marquis  where is your heroine claude  i have not seen her dancing  what heroine  what do you mean  honest phyl of course  did you think i meant miss weston  with eleanor somewhere  is the next dance a quadrille  lord rotherwood ran up the bank to the terraced walks where the undancing part of the company sat or walked about  soon he spied phyllis standing by eleanor looking rather wearied  phyllis can you dance a quadrille  phyllis opened her eyes and eleanor desired her to answer  come phyllis let me see what m le roi has done for you  he led her away wondering greatly and thinking how very good natured cousin rotherwood was  emily was much surprised to find phyllis her vis a vis  emily was very generally known and liked and had no lack of grand partners but she would have liked to dance with the marquis  when the quadrille was over she was glad to put herself in his way by coming up to take charge of phyllis  well done phyl said he no mistakes  you must have another dance  whom shall we find for you  oh rotherwood said emily you cannot think how you gratified us all with your speech  ah i always set my heart on saying something of the kind but i wished i could have dared to add the brides health  the bride  do not pretend to have no eyes said lord rotherwood with a significant glance which directed emilys eyes to the terrace where mr mohun and alethea were walking together in eager conversation  emily was ready to sink into the earth  janes surmises and the mysterious words of her father left her no further doubt  at this moment some one asked her to dance and scarcely knowing what she did or said she walked to her place  lord rotherwood now found a partner for phyllis and a farmers daughter for himself  this dance over phylliss partner did not well know how to dispose of her and she grew rather frightened on finding that none of her sisters were in sight  at last she perceived reginald standing on the bank and made her escape to him  redgie did you see who i have been dancing with  cousin rotherwood and claudes grand oxford friendmr travers  it is all nonsense said reginald  come out of this mob of people  but where is eleanor  somewhere in the midst  they are all absurd together  what is the matter redgie asked phyllis unable to account for this extraordinary fit of misanthropy  papa and william both driving me about like a dog said reginald first i danced with miss westonthen she saw that womanthat miss aylmershook handstalkedand then nothing would serve her but to find papa  as soon as the baron sees me he cries out why are not you dancing redgie  we do not want you  up and down they walk ever so long and presently papa turns off and begins talking to miss aylmer  then of course i went back to miss weston but then up comes william as savage as one of his canadian bears he orders me off too and so here i am  i am sure i am not going to ask any one else to dance  come and walk with me in peace phyl  do you see themmiss weston and marianne under that tuliptree and the captain helping them to ice  redgie did you give miss weston her nosegay  some one put such beautiful flowers in it such as i never saw before  how could i  they sent me off with lily and jane  i told william i had the flowers in charge and he said he would take care of them by the bye phyl and reginald gave a wondrous spring i have it i have it  i have it  if he is not in love with miss weston you may call me an ass for the rest of my life  i should not like to call you an ass redgie said phyllis  very likely but do not make me call you one  hurrah  now ask marianne if it is not so  marianne must know  how jolly  i say phyl stay there and i will fetch marianne  away ran reginald and presently returned with marianne who was very glad to be invited to join phyllis  she little knew what an examination awaited her  marianne began phyllis ill tell you what  no i will do it right said reginald you know nothing about it phyl  marianne is not something going on there  going on said marianne alethea is speaking to mrs hawkesworth  nonsense i know better marianne  i have a suspicion that i could tell what the captain was about yesterday when he walked off after dinner  how very wise you think you look reginald said marianne laughing heartily  but tell us do tell us marianne said phyllis  tell you whet  whether william is going to marry miss weston said the straightforward phyllis  redgie says soonly tell us  oh it would be so nice  how you blurt it out phyl said reginald  you do not know how those things are managed  mind i found it out all myself  just say marianne  am not i right  i do not know whether i ought to tell said marianne  oh then it is all right said reginald and i found it out  now marianne there is a good girl tell us all about it  you know i could not say no when you asked me said marianne i could not help it really but pray do not tell anybody or captain mohun will not like it  does any one know said reginald  only ourselves and mr mohun and i think lord rotherwood guesses from something i heard him say to jane  to jane said reginald  that is provoking she will think she found it out all herself and be so conceited  you need not be afraid said marianne laughing jane is on a wrong scent  jane  oh i should like to see her out in her reckonings  i should like to have a laugh against her  what does she think marianne  oh i cannot tell you it is too bad  oh do do pray  you may whisper it if it is too bad for phyllis to hear  no no said marianne it is nothing but nonsense  if you hear it phyllis shall too but mind you must promise not to say anything to anybody or i do not know what will become of me  well we will not said reginald boys can always keep secrets and ill engage for phyl  now for it  she is in a terrible fright lest it should be mr mohun  she got it into her head last autumn and all i could say would not persuade her out of it  why she always calls me aunt marianne when we are alone now reginald here comes maurice  do not say anything i beg and entreat  it is my secret you know  i daresay you will all be told tomorrowindeed mamma said sobut pray say nothing about me or jane  it was only settled yesterday evening  at this moment maurice came up with a message that miss weston and eleanor were going away and wanted the little girls  they followed him to the tent which had been cleared of the tables and lighted up in order that the dancing might continue there  most of their own party were collected at the entrance watching for them  lilias came up just as they did and exclaimed in a tone of disappointment on finding them preparing to depart  she had enjoyed herself exceedingly found plenty of partners and was not in the least tired  why should she not stay said william  claude has engaged to stay to the end of everything and he may as well drive her as ride the gray  and you jenny said mr mohun do you like to stay or go alethea will make room for you in the ponycarriage or you may go with eleanor  with eleanor if you please said jane  already jane said lily  are you tired  jane drew her aside  tired of hearing that i was right about what you would not believe  did you not hear what he called her  and rotherwood has found it out  it is all gossip and mistake said lily  here jane was called away by eleanor and departed with her lilias went to look for her aunt or florence but on the way was asked to dance by mr carrington  i suppose i may congratulate you said he in one of the pauses in the quadrille  lily thought it best to misunderstand and answered everything has gone off very well  very  lord rotherwood will be a popular man but my congratulations refer to something nearer home  i think you owe us some thanks for having brought them into the neighbourhood  report is very kind in making arrangements said lily with something of emilys haughty courtesy  i hope this is something more than report said her partner  indeed i believe not  i think i may safely say that it is at present quite unfounded said lily  mr carrington much surprised said no more  lily did not believe the report sufficiently to be annoyed by it during the excitement and pleasure of the evening and at present her principal vexation was caused by the rapid diminution of the company she and her brother were the very last to depart even florence had gone to bed and lady rotherwood looking exceedingly tired kissed lily at the foot of the stairs pitied her for going home in an open carriage and wished her goodnight in a very weary tone  i should think you were the fiftieth lady i have handed across the hall said lord rotherwood as he gave lily his arm  but where were the fireworks rotherwood  countermanded long ago  we have had enough of them  well i am sorry it is over  i am very glad it is so well over said claude  thanks to your exertions claude said the marquis  you acted like a hero  like a dancing dervish you mean said claude  it will suffice for my whole life  i hope you are not quite exhausted  no thank you  i have turned over a new leaf  talking of new leaves said the marquis i always had a presentiment that emilys government would come to a crisis today  do you think it has said claude  trust my word you will hear great news tomorrow  and that reminds mecan you come here tomorrow morning  travers is goingi drive him to meet the coach at the town and you were talking of wanting to see the new windows in the cathedral  it will be a good opportunity and dine here afterwards to talk over the adventures  thank youthat last i cannot do  the baron was saying it would be the first time of having us all together  very well besides the great news  i wish i was going back with you it is a tame conclusion only to go to bed  if i was but to be on the scene of action tomorrow  tell the baron thatno use your influence to get me invited to dinner on saturdayi really want to speak to him  very well said claude ill do my best  goodnight  goodnight said the marquis  you have both done wonders  still i wish it was to come over again  few people would say so said lily as they drove off  few would say so if they thought so said claude  i have been quite admiring the way rotherwood has gone onenjoying the fun as if he was nobodyjust as reginald might making other people happy and making no secret of his satisfaction in it all  very free from affectation and nonsense said lily as william said of him last christmas  you were in a fine fright about his speech claude  more than i ought to have been  i should have known that he is too simpleminded and straightforward to say anything but just what he ought  what a nice person that miss aylmer is  is not she claude  i was very glad you had her for a neighbour happy the children who have her for a governess  how sensible and gentle she seems  the westonsbut oh  claude tell me one thing did you hear  well what  i am ashamed to say  that preposterous report about papa  why rotherwood himself seems to believe it and mr carrington began to congratulate  the public has bestowed so many ladies on the baron that i wonder it is not tired said claude  it is time it should patronise william instead  rotherwood is not the public said lily and he is the last person to say anything impertinent of papa  and i myself heard papa call her alethea which he never used to do  claude what do you think  after a long pause claude slowly replied think  why i think miss weston must be a person of great courage  she begins the world as a grandmother to say nothing of her eldest daughter and son being considerably her seniors  i do not believe it said lily  do you claude  i cannot make up my mindit is too amazing  my hair is still standing on end  when it comes down i may be able to tell you something  such were the only answers that lily could extract from him  he did not sufficiently disbelieve the report to treat it with scorn yet he did not sufficiently credit it to resign himself to such a state of things  on coming home lily found emily and jane in her room eagerly discussing the circumstances which to their prejudiced eyes seemed strong confirmation  while their tongues were in full career the door opened and eleanor appeared  she told them it was twelve oclock turned jane out of the room and made emily and lily promise not to utter another syllable that night    chapter xxvi  the crisis    is this your care of the nest cried he it comes of your gadding abroad said she  to the consternation of the disconsolate damsels the first news they heard the next morning was that mr mohun was gone to breakfast at broomhill and the intelligence was received by frank hawkesworth with a smile which they thought perfectly malicious  frank william and reginald talked a little at breakfast about the fete but no one joined them and claude looked so grave that eleanor was convinced that he had a headache and vainly tried to persuade him to stay at home instead of setting off to devereux castle immediately after breakfast  the past day had not been spent in vain by ada  mrs weston had led her by degrees to open her heart to her had made her perceive the real cause of her fathers displeasure see her faults and promise to confess them a promise which she performed with many tears as soon as she saw eleanor in the morning  on telling this to emily eleanor was surprised to find that she was not listened to with much satisfaction  emily seemed to think it a piece of interference on the part of mrs weston and would not allow that it was likely to be the beginning of improvement in ada  the words were put into her mouth said she and they were an easy way of escaping from her present state of disgrace  on the contrary said eleanor she seemed to think that she justly deserved to be in disgrace  did you think so said emily in a careless tone  you are in a strange mood today emily said eleanor  am i  i did not know it  i wonder where lily is  lily was in her own room teaching phyllis  phyllis was rather wild and flighty that morning scarcely able to command her attention and every now and then bursting into an irrepressible fit of laughter reginald and phyllis found it most difficult to avoid betraying marianne and as soon as luncheon was over they agreed to set out on a long expedition into the woods where they might enjoy their wonderful secret together  just at this time mr mohun returned  he came into the drawingroom and lilias perceiving that the threatened conversation with emily was about to take place made her escape to her own room whither she was presently followed by jane who could not help running after her to report the great news that emily was to be deposed  i am sure of it said she  they sent me out of the room but not before i had seen certain symptoms  it is very hard that poor emily should bear all the blame said lily  you have managed to escape it very well said jane laughing  you have all the thanks and praise  i suppose it is because the intimacy with miss weston was your work  i will not believe that nonsense said lily  seeing is believing they say said jane  remember it is not only me  think of rotherwood  and maurice guesses it too and redgie told him great things were going on  while jane was speaking they heard the drawingroom door open and in another moment emily came in  it was true that as jane said she had been deposed  mr mohun had begun by saying emily can you bring me such an account of your expenditure as i desired  i scarcely think i can papa said emily  i am sorry to say that my accounts are rather in confusion  that is to say that you have been as irregular in the management of your own affairs as you have in mine  well i have paid your debt to lilias and from this time forward i require of you to reduce your expenses to the sum which i consider suitable and which both eleanor and lilias have found perfectly sufficient  and now emily what have you to say for the management of my affairs  can you offer any excuse for your utter failure  indeed papa i am very sorry i vexed you said emily  our illness last autumndifferent thingsi know all has not been quite as it should be but i hope that in future i shall profit by past experience  i hope so said mr mohun but i am afraid to trust the management of the family to you any longer  your trial is over and you have failed merely because you would not exert yourself from wilful indolence and negligence  you have not attended to any one thing committed to your chargeyou have placed temptation in esthers way and allowed ada to take up habits which will not be easily corrected  i should not think myself justified in leaving you in charge any longer lest worse mischief should ensue  i wish you to give up the keys to eleanor for the present  mr mohun would perhaps have added something if emily had shown signs of repentance or even of sorrow  the moment was at least as painful to him as to her and he had prepared himself to expect either hysterical tears with vows of amendment or else an argument on her side that she was right and everybody else wrong  but there was nothing of the kind emily neither spoke nor looked she only carried the tokens of her authority to eleanor and left the room  she thought she knew well enough the cause of her deposition considered it quite as a matter of course and departed on purpose to avoid hearing the announcement which she expected to follow  she was annoyed by finding her sisters in her room and especially irritated by janes tone as she eagerly asked well what did he say  never mind replied emily pettishly  was it about miss weston persisted jane  not actually but i saw it was coming said emily  ah said jane i was just telling lily that she owes all her present favour to her having been aletheas bosom friend  i confess i thought miss weston was assuming authority long ago said emily  emily how can you say so cried lily  how can you be so unjust and ungrateful  i do not believe this report but if it should be true are not these foolish expressions of dislike so many attempts to make yourself undutiful  i have rather more sincerity more dignity more attachment to my own mother than to try to gain favour by affecting what i do not feel said emily  rather cutting emily said jane  do not give that speech an application which emily did not intend said lily sadly  what makes you think i did not intend it said emily coldly  emily exclaimed lily starting up and colouring violently are you thinking what you are saying  i do not know what you mean replied emily quietly in her soft unchanging voice i only mean that if you can feel satisfied with the new arrangement you are more easily pleased than i am  only tell me emily do you accuse me of attempting to gain favour in an unworthy manner  i only congratulate you on standing so well with every one  lily hid her face in her hands  at this moment eleanor opened the door saying can you come down  mrs burnet is here  eleanor went without observing lily and emily was obliged to follow  jane lingered in order to comfort lily  you know she did not quite mean it said she she is only very much provoked  i know i know said lily she is very sorry herself by this time of course she did not mean it but it is the first unkind thing she ever said to me  it is very silly and very unjust to take it seriously but i cannot help it  it is a very abominable shame said jane and so i shall tell emily  no do not jenny i beg  i know she thinks so herself and grieves too much over it  no wonder she is vexed  all my faults have come upon her  you had better go down jane mrs burnet is always vexed if she does not see a good many of us and i am sure i cannot go besides emily dislikes having that girl to entertain  lily you are so very gentle and forgiving that i wonder how any one can say what grieves you said jane for once struck with admiration  she went and lily remained weeping over the injustice which she had forgiven and feeling as if all the time it was fair that the rule of love should as it were recoil upon her  her tears flowed fast as she went over the long line of faults and follies which lay heavy on her conscience  and emily against her  that sister who from her infancy had soothed her in every trouble of whose sympathy she had always felt sure whose gentleness had been her admiration in her days of sharp answers and violent temper who had seemed her own beyond all the others this wound from her gave lily a bitter feeling of desertion and loneliness  it was like a completion of her punishmentthe broken reed on which she leant had pierced her deeply  she was still sitting on the side of her bed weeping when a slight tap at the door made her starta gentle tap the sound of which she had learned to love in her illness  the next moment alethea stood before her with outstretched arms  this was a time to feel the value of such a friend and every suspicion passing from her mind she flew to alethea kissed her again and again and laid her head on her shoulder  her caress was returned with equal warmth  but how is this said alethea now perceiving that her face was pale and marked by tears  how is this my dear lily  oh alethea  i cannot tell you but it is all misery  the full effect of my baneful principle has appeared  has anything happened exclaimed alethea  no said lily  there is nothing new except theoh  i cannot tell you  i wish i could do anything for you my poor lily said alethea  you can look kind said lily and that is a great comfort  oh alethea it was very kind of you to come and speak to me  i shall do nowi can bear it all better  you have a comforting face and voice like nobody else  when did you come  have you been in the drawing room  no said alethea  i walked here with marianne and finding there were visitors in the drawingroom we went to ada and she told me where to find you  i had something to tell youbut perhaps you know already  the colour on her cheek recalled all lilys fears and to hear the news from herself was an unexpected trial  she felt as if what she had said justified emilys reproach and turning away her head replied yes i know  alethea was a little hurt by her coldness but she ascribed it to dejection and embarrassment and blamed herself for hurrying on what she had to tell without sufficient regard for lilys distress  there was an awkward pause which alethea broke by saying your brother thought you would like to hear it from me  my brother cried lily with a most sudden change of tone william  oh alethea dearest alethea i beg your pardon  they almost made me believe it was papa  oh i am so very glad  alethea could not help laughing and lily joined her heartily  it was one of the brightest hours of her life as she sat with her hand in her friends pouring out her eager expressions of delight and affection  all her troubles were forgottenhow should they not when alethea was to be her sister  it seemed as if but a few minutes had passed when the sound of the great clock warned alethea that it was time to return to broomhill and she asked lilias to walk back with her  after summoning marianne they set out through the garden where on being joined by william lily thought it expedient to betake herself to marianne who was but too glad to be able freely to communicate many interesting particulars  at broomhill she had a very enjoyable talk with mrs weston but her chief delight was in her walk home with her brother  she was high in his favour as aletheas chief friend  though usually reserved he was now open and lily wondered to find herself honoured with confidence  his attachment had begun in very early days when first he knew the westons in brighton  harrys death had suddenly called him away and a few guarded expressions of his wishes in the course of the next winter had been cut short by his father  he then went to canada and had had no opportunity of renewing his acquaintance till the last winter when on coming home to his great joy and surprise he found the westons on the most intimate terms with his family  he then spoke to his father who wished him to take a little more time for consideration and he had accordingly waited till the summer  lily longed to know his plans for the future and presently he went on to say that his father wished him to leave the army live at home and let alethea be the head of the household  oh william it is perfect  there is an end of all our troubles it is as if a great black curtain was drawn up  they say such plans never succeed said william but we mean to prove the contrary  how good it will be for the children said lily  oh why had we not such a guide at first  she has all that eleanor wants said william  my follies were not eleanors fault said lily but i do think i should not have been quite so silly if i had known alethea from the first  it was not in the power of william himself to say more in her praise than lily  in the eagerness of their conversation they walked slowly and as they were crossing the last field the dinnerbell rang  as they quickened their steps they saw mr mohun looking at his wheat  lily told him how late it was  there said he i am always looking after other peoples affairs between rotherwood and william i have not a moment for my own crops however my turn is coming  william will have it all on his hands and the old deaf useless baron will sit in his great chair and take his ease  not a bit papa said lily the baron will grow young and take to dancing  he is talking nonsense already  eh  miss lily turned saucy  mrs william mohun must take her in hand  well lily has he your consent and approbation  i only wish this was eighteen months ago papa  we shall soon come into order lily  with miss aylmer for the little ones and mrs mohun for the great ones i have little fear  miss aylmer papa  yes if all turns out well  we propose to find a house for her mother in the village and let her come every day to teach the little ones  oh  i am very glad  we liked her so much  i hope said mr mohun that this plan will please claude better than my proposal of a governess last month  he looked as if he expected minerva with helmet and aegis and all  now make haste and dress  do not let us shock eleanor by keeping dinner waiting longer than we can help  lilias found that her sisters had long been dressed and gone down she dressed alone every now and then smiling at her own happy looks reflected in the glass  just as she had finished claude knocked at the door and putting in his head said well lily has the wonderful news come forth  i see it has by your face  and do you know what it is claude said lily  i know what rotherwood meant and i cannot think where all our senses were  and claude only say that you like her  i think it is a very good thing indeed  only say that you cordially like her  i do  i admire her sense and her gentleness very much and i think you owe a great deal to her  then you allow that you were unjust last summer  i do but it was owing to you  you were somewhat foolish and i thought it was her fault  besides i was quite tired of hearing that extraordinary name of hers for ever repeated  here they were summoned to dinner and hurried down  the dinner passed very strangely some were in very high spirits others in a very melancholy mood eleanor and maurice alone preserved the golden mean and the behaviour of the merry ones was perfectly unintelligible to the rest  reginald still bound by his promise to marianne was wild to make his discovery known and behaved in such a strange and comical manner as to call forth various reproofs from eleanor which provoked double mirth from the others  the cause of their amusement was ostensibly the talking over of yesterdays fete but the laughing was more than adequate even to the wonderful collection of odd speeches and adventures which were detailed  emily and jane could not guess what had come to lily and thought her merriment very illplaced  yet in justice to lily it must be said that her joy no longer made her wild and thoughtless  there was something guarded and subdued about her which made claude reflect how different she was from the untamed girl of last summer who could not be happy without a sort of intoxication  the ladies returned to the drawingroom where ada now appeared for the first time and while they were congratulating her mr mohun summoned eleanor away  jane followed at a safe distance to see where they went  they shut themselves into the study and jane now meeting maurice went into the garden with him  it must be coming now said she oh there are william and claude talking under the planetree  claude has his cunning smile on said maurice  no wonder said jane it is very absurd  i daresay william will hardly ever come home now  one comfort is they will see i was right from the first  jane and maurice remained in the garden till teatime and thus missed hearing the whole affair discussed in the drawingroom between emily lilias and frank  this was the first news that emily heard of it and a very great relief it was for she could imagine liking and even loving alethea as a sisterinlaw  her chief annoyance was at present from the perception of the difference between her own position and that of lilias  last year how was lily regarded in the family and what was her opinion worth  almost nothing she was only a clever romantic silly girl while emily had credit at least for discretion  now lily was consulted and sought out by father brothers eleanorno longer treated as a child  and what was emily blamed or pitied on every side and left to hear this important news from the chance mention of her brotherinlaw himself not fully informed  she had become nobody and had even lost the satisfaction such as it was of fancying that her father only made her bad management an excuse for his marriage  she heard many particulars from lily in the course of the evening as they were going to bed and the sisters talked with all their wonted affection although emily had not thought it worth while to revive an old grievance by asking lilys pardon for her unkind speech and rested satisfied with the knowledge that her sister knew her heart too well to care for what she said in a moment of irritation  on the other hand lily did not think that she had a right to mention the plan of aletheas government and the next day she was glad of her reserve for her father called her to share his early walk for the purpose of talking over the scheme telling her that he thought she understood the state of things better than eleanor could and that he considered that she had sufficient influence with emily to prevent her from making alethea uncomfortable  the conclusion of the conversation was that they thought they might depend upon emilys amiability her courtesy and her dislike of trouble to balance her love of importance and dignity  and that alethea would do nothing to hurt her feelings and would assume no authority that she could help they felt convinced  after breakfast mr mohun called emily into his study informed her of his resolution to which she listened with her usual submissive manner and told her that he trusted to her good sense and right feeling to obviate any collisions of authority which might be unpleasant to alethea and hurtful to the younger ones  she promised all that was desired and though at the moment she felt hurt and grieved she almost immediately recovered her usual spirits never high but always serene and only seeking for easy amusement and comfort in whatever happened  there was no public disgrace in her deposition it would not seem unnatural to the neighbours that her brothers wife should be at the head of the house  she would gain credit for her amiability and she would no longer be responsible or obliged to exert herself and as to alethea herself she could not help respecting and almost loving her  it was very well it was no worse  in the meantime lily struck by a sudden thought had hastened to her mothers little deserted morningroom to see if it could not be made a delightful abode for alethea and she was considering of its capabilities when she started at the sound of an approaching step it was the rapid and measured tread of the captain and in a few moments he entered  thank you said he smiling you are on the same errand as myself  exactly so said lily it will do capitally how pretty long acre looks and what a beautiful view of the church  this room used once to be pretty said william looking round disappointed it is very forlorn  ah but it will look very different when the chairs do not stand with their backs to the wall  i do not think alethea knows of this room for nobody has sat in it for years and we will make it a surprise  and here is your own picture at ten years old over the fireplace  i have such a vision you will not know the room when i have set it to rights  they went on talking eagerly of the improvements that might be made and from thence came to other subjectsalethea herself and the future plans  at last william asked if lily knew what made jane look as deplorable as she had done for the last two days and lily was obliged to tell him with the addition that eleanor had begun to inform her of the real fact but that she had stopped her by declaring that she had known it all from the first  just as they had mentioned her jane attracted by the unusual sound of voices in lady emilys room came in asking what they could be doing there  lily would scarcely have dared to reply but william said in a grave matteroffact way we are thinking of having this room newly fitted up  for alethea weston said jane how can you lily  i should have thought at least it was no laughing matter  i advise you to follow lilys example and make the best of it said william  i do but it is another thing to stand laughing here  i see one thing that i shall doi shall take away your picture and hang it in my room  we shall see said william following lilias who had left the room to hide her laughter  to mystify jane was the great amusement of the day reginald finding maurice possessed with the same notion did more to maintain it than the others would have thought right and maurice reporting his speeches to jane she had not the least doubt that her idea was correct  lord rotherwood came to dinner and no sooner had he entered the drawingroom than reginald rejoicing in the absence of the parties concerned informed him of the joke much to his diversion though rather to the discomfiture of the more prudent spectators who might have wished it confined to themselves  it has gone far enough said claude she will say something she will repent if we do not take care  i should like to reduce her to humble herself to ask an explanation from marianne said lily  and pray dont spoil the joke before i have enjoyed it said lord rotherwood  my years of discretion are not such centuries of wisdom as those of that gentleman who looks as grim as his namesake the emperor on a coin  the entrance of eleanor and jane here put an end to the conversation which was not renewed till the evening when the younger or as claude called it the middleaged part of the company were sitting on the lawn leaving the drawingroom to the elder and more prudent and the terrace to the wilder and more active  emily was talking of mrs burnets visit of the day before and her opinion of the hetherington festivities  and what an interminable visit it was said jane i thought they would never go  people always inflict themselves in a most merciless manner when there is anything going on said emily  i wonder if they guessed anything said lily  to be sure they did and stayed out of curiosity said lord rotherwood  in spite of emilys dignified contradictions of the report every one knew it the other evening  it was all in vain that she behaved as if i was speaking treasonpeople have eyes  ah i am very sorry for that contradiction said lily i hope people will not fancy we do not like it  no it will only prove my greatness said lord rotherwood  your marques was china in the map so absorbing all beholders that the magnanimous mohuns themselves  what nonsense rotherwood said jane sharply cant you suppose that one may shut ones eyes to what one does not wish to see  the singular inappropriateness of this answer occasioned a general roar of laughter and she looked in perplexity  every one whom she asked why they laughed replied by saying ask marianne weston and at length after much puzzling and guessing and being more laughed at than had ever before happened to her in her life she was obliged to seek an explanation from marianne who might well have triumphed had she been so disposed  janes character for penetration was entirely destroyed and the next morning she received as a present from claude an old book which had long belonged to the nursery entitled a puzzle for a curious girl    chapter xxvii  conclusion    there let hymen oft appear in saffron robe with taper clear and pomp and feast and revelry and mask and antique pageantry such sights as useful poets dream on summer eves by haunted stream  on the morning of a fine day late in september the beechcroft bells were ringing merrily and a wedding procession was entering the gate of the churchyard  in the afternoon there was a great feast on the top of the hill attended by all the mohuns who were forced to lilys great satisfaction to give it there as there was no space in the grounds at the new court  all was wonderfully suitable to old times inasmuch as the baron was actually persuaded to sit for five minutes under the yewtree where mohuns chair ought to have been and the cricketers were of all ranks from the marquis of rotherwood to little dick grey  the wedding had been hurried on and the wedding tour was shortened in order that mrs william mohun might be installed as mistress of the new court before eleanors departure which took place early in october and shortly after mrs ridley who had come on a visit to beechcroft to take leave of her brother returned to the north taking with her the little harry  he was nearly a year old and it gave great pain to his young aunts to part with him now that he had endeared himself to them by many engaging ways but lily felt herself too unequal to the task of training him up to make any objection and there were many promises that he should not be a stranger to his grandfathers home  mrs and miss aylmer had been about a month settled at a superior sort of cottage near the new court with mrs eden for their servant  lord rotherwood had fitted out the second son who sailed for india with mr and mrs hawkesworth had sent devereux to school and was lying in wait to see what could be done for the two others and jane was congratulated far more than she wished on having been the means of discovering such an excellent governess  jane was now a regular inhabitant of the schoolroom as much tied down to lessons and schoolroom hours as her two little sisters with the prospect of so continuing for two years if not for three  she made one attempt to be pert to miss aylmer but something in the manner of her governess quite baffled her and she was obliged to be more obedient than she had ever been  the mischief which emily and lilias had done to her by throwing off their allegiance to eleanor and thus unconsciously leading her to set her at nought was at her age not to be so easily repaired yet with no opportunity for gossiping and with involuntary respect for her governess there were hopes that she would lose the habit of her two great faults  there certainly was an improvement in her general tone and manner which made mr devereux hope that he might soon resume with her the preparation for confirmation which had been cut short the year before  phyllis and adeline had been possessed by reginald with a great dread of governesses and they were agreeably surprised in miss aylmer whom they found neither cross nor strict and always willing to forward their amusements and let them go out with their papa and sisters whenever they were asked  phyllis without much annoyance to one so obedient was trained into more civilisation and adas more serious faults were duly watched and guarded against  the removal of esther was a great advantage to ada an older and more steady person was taken in her place while to the great relief of mr mohun and lilias rachel harvey took esther to her brothers farmhouse where she promised to watch and teach her and hoped in time to make her a good servant  of emily there is little to say  she ate drank and slept talked agreeably read idle books and looked nice in the drawingroom wasting time throwing away talents weakening the powers of her mind and laying up a store of sad reflections for herself against the time when she must awake from her selfish apathy  as to lilias mohun the heroine of this tale the history of the formation of her character has been told and all that remains to be said of her is that the memory of her faults and her sorrows did not fleet away like a morning cloud though followed by many happy and prosperous days and though the effects of many were repaired agness death esthers theft adas accident the schism in the parish and her own numerous mistakes were constantly recalled and never without a thought of the danger of being wise above her elders and taking mere feeling for christian charity
