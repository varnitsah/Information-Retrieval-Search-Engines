that every time you get a scare said danny  he seized the other end of the string and began to pull  thats just what im afraid of croaked grandfather frog     the adventures of grandfather frog     i  billy mink finds little joe otter   billy mink ran around the edge of the smiling pool and turned down by the laughing brook his eyes twinkled with mischief and he hurried as only billy can as he passed jerry muskrats house jerry saw him  hi billy mink where are you going in such a hurry this fine morning he called  to find little joe otter have you seen anything of him replied billy  no said jerry hes probably down to the big river fishing i heard him say last night that he was going  thanks said billy mink and without waiting to say more he was off like a little brown flash  jerry watched him out of sight hump exclaimed jerry billy mink is in a terrible hurry this morning now i wonder what he is so anxious to find little joe otter for when they get their heads together it is usually for some mischief  jerry climbed to the top of his house and looked over the smiling pool in the direction from which billy mink had just come almost at once he saw grandfather frog fast asleep on his big green lilypad the legs of a foolish green fly were sticking out of one corner of his big mouth jerry couldnt help laughing for grandfather frog certainly did look funny  hes had a good breakfast this morning and his full stomach has made him sleepy thought jerry but hes getting careless in his old age he certainly is getting careless the idea of going to sleep right out in plain sight like that  suddenly a new thought popped into his head billy mink saw him and that is why he is so anxious to find little joe otter he is planning to play some trick on grandfather frog as sure as pollywogs have tails exclaimed jerry then his eyes began to twinkle as he added i think ill have some fun myself  without another word jerry slipped down into the water and swam over to the big green lilypad of grandfather frog then he hit the water a smart blow with his tail grandfather frogs big goggly eyes flew open and he was just about to make a frightened plunge into the smiling pool when he saw jerry  have a nice nap inquired jerry with a broad grin  i wasnt asleep protested grandfather frog indignantly i was just thinking  dont you think it a rather dangerous plan to think so long with your eyes closed asked jerry  well maybe i did just doze off admitted grandfather frog sheepishly  maybe you did replied jerry now listen then jerry whispered in grandfather frogs ear and both chuckled as if they were enjoying some joke for they are great friends you know afterward jerry swam back to his house and grandfather frog closed his eyes so as to look just as he did when he was asleep  meanwhile billy mink had hurried down the laughing brook halfway to the big river he met little joe otter bringing home a big fish for you know little joe is a great fisherman billy mink hastened to tell him how grandfather frog had fallen fast asleep on his big green lilypad  its a splendid chance to have some fun with grandfather frog and give him a great scare concluded billy  little joe otter put his fish down and grinned he likes to play pranks almost as well as he likes to go fishing  what can we do said he  ive thought of a plan replied billy do you happen to know where we can find longlegs the blue heron  yes said little joe i saw him fishing not five minutes ago  then billy told little joe his plan and laughing and giggling the two little scamps hurried off to find longlegs the blue heron     ii  longlegs the blue heron receives callers   longlegs the blue heron felt decidedly out of sorts it was a beautiful morning too beautiful for any one to be feeling that way indeed it was the same beautiful morning in which grandfather frog had caught so many foolish green flies  jolly round bright mr sun was smiling his broadest the merry little breezes of old mother west wind were dancing happily here and there over the green meadows looking for some good turn to do for others the little feathered people to whom old mother nature has given the great blessing of music in their throats were pouring out their sweetest songs so it seemed as if there was no good reason why longlegs should feel out of sorts the fact is the trouble with longlegs was an empty stomach yes sir that is what ailed longlegs the blue heron that sunshiny morning you know it is hard work to be hungry and happy at the same time  so longlegs stood on the edge of a shallow little pool in the laughing brook grumbling to himself just a little while before he had seen little joe otter carrying home a big fish and this had made him hungrier and more out of sorts than ever in the first place it made him envious and envy you know always stirs up bad feelings he knew perfectly well that little joe had got that fish by boldly chasing it until he caught it for little joe can swim even faster than a fish but longlegs chose to try to make himself think that it was all luck moreover he wanted to blame some one for his own lack of success as most people who fail do so when little joe had called out hi longlegs what luck this fine morning longlegs just pretended not to hear but when little joe was out of sight and hearing he began to grumble to himself  no wonder i have no luck with that fellow racing up and down the laughing brook said he he isnt content to catch what he wants himself but frightens the rest of the fish so that an honest fisherman like me has no chance at all i dont see what old mother nature was thinking of when she gave him a liking for fish he and billy mink are just two worthless little scamps born to make trouble for other people  he was still grumbling when these two same little scamps poked their heads out of the grass on the other side of the little pool you look happy longlegs must be that you have had a good breakfast said little joe nudging billy mink  longlegs snapped his great bill angrily what are you doing here spoiling my fishing he demanded havent you got the big river and all the rest of the laughing brook to fool around in this is my pool and ill thank you to keep away  billy mink chuckled so that longlegs heard him and that didnt improve his temper a bit but before he could say anything more little joe otter spoke  oh said he we beg your pardon we just happen to know that grandfather frog is sound asleep and we thought that if you hadnt had good luck this morning you might like to know about it as long as you think so ill of us well just run over and tell blackcap the night heron  little joe turned as if to start off in search of blackcap at once hold on a minute called longlegs and tried to make his voice sound pleasant a difficult thing to do because you know his voice is very harsh and disagreeable the truth is i havent had a mouthful of breakfast and to be hungry is apt to make me cross where did you say grandfather frog is  i didnt say replied little joe but if you really want to know he is sitting on his big green lilypad in the smiling pool fast asleep right in plain sight  thank you said longlegs i believe i have an errand up that way now i think of it i believe ill just go over and have a look at him i have never seen him asleep  illustration thank you said longlegs i believe i have an errand up that way page 10     iii  longlegs visits the smiling pool   longlegs the blue heron watched billy mink and little joe otter disappear down the laughing brook as long as they were in sight he sat without moving his head drawn down between his shoulders just as if he had nothing more important to think about than a morning nap but if you had been near enough to have seen his keen eyes you would never have suspected him of even thinking of a nap just as soon as he felt sure that the two little browncoated scamps were out of sight he stretched his long neck up until he was almost twice as tall as he had been a minute before he looked this way and that way to make sure that no danger was near spread his great wings flapped heavily up into the air and then with his head once more tucked back between his shoulders and his long legs straight out behind him he flew out over the green meadows and making a big circle headed straight for the smiling pool  all this time billy mink and little joe otter had not been so far away as longlegs supposed they had been hiding where they could watch him and the instant he spread his wings they started back up the laughing brook towards the smiling pool to see what would happen there you see they knew perfectly well that longlegs was flying up to the smiling pool in the hope that he could catch grandfather frog for his breakfast they didnt really mean that any harm should come to grandfather frog but they meant that he should have a great fright you see they were like a great many other people so heedless and thoughtless that they thought it fun to frighten others  of course well waken grandfather frog in time for him to get away with nothing more than a great scare said little joe otter as they hurried along it will be such fun to see his big goggly eyes pop out when he opens them and sees longlegs just ready to gobble him up and wont longlegs be hopping mad when we cheat him out of the breakfast he is so sure he is going to have  they reached the smiling pool before longlegs who had taken a roundabout way and they hid among the bulrushes where they could see and not be seen  theres the old fellow just as i left him fast asleep whispered billy mink  sure enough there on his big green lilypad sat grandfather frog with his eyes shut at least they seemed to be shut and over on top of his big house sat jerry muskrat jerry seemed to be too busy opening a freshwater clam to notice anything else but the truth is he was watching all that was going on you see he had suspected that billy mink was going to play some trick on grandfather frog so he had warned him when he had seen longlegs coming towards the smiling pool he had given grandfather frog another warning and he knew that now he was only pretending to be asleep  straight up to the smiling pool came longlegs the blue heron and on the very edge of it among the bulrushes he dropped his long legs and stood with his toes in the water his long neck stretched up so that he could look all over the smiling pool there just as little joe otter had said sat grandfather frog on his big green lilypad fast asleep at least he seemed to be fast asleep the eyes of longlegs sparkled with hunger and the thought of what a splendid breakfast grandfather frog would make very slowly putting each foot down as carefully as he knew how longlegs began to walk along the shore so as to get opposite the big green lilypad where grandfather frog was sitting and over in the bulrushes on the other side little joe otter and billy mink nudged each other and clapped their hands over their mouths to keep from laughing aloud     iv  the patience of longlegs the blue heron    patience often wins the day   when overhaste has lost the way   if there is one virtue which longlegs the heron possesses above another it is patience yes sir longlegs certainly has got patience he believes that if a thing is worth having it is worth waiting for and that if he waits long enough he is sure to get it perhaps that is because he has been a fisherman all his life and his father and his grandfather were fishermen you know a fisherman without patience rarely catches anything of course billy mink and little joe otter laugh at this and say that it isnt so but the truth is they sometimes go hungry when they wouldnt if they had a little of the patience of longlegs  now grandfather frog is another who is very very patient he can sit still the longest time waiting for something to come to him indeed he can sit perfectly still so long and longlegs can stand perfectly still so long that jerry muskrat and billy mink and little joe otter have had many long disputes as to which of the two can keep still the longest  he will make a splendid breakfast thought longlegs as very very carefully he walked along the edge of the smiling pool so as to get right opposite grandfather frog there he stopped and looked very hard at grandfather frog yes he certainly must be asleep for his eyes were closed longlegs chuckled to himself right down inside without making a sound and got ready to wade out so as to get within reach  now all the time grandfather frog was doing some quiet chuckling himself you see he wasnt asleep at all he was just pretending to be asleep and all the time he was watching longlegs out of a corner of one of his big goggly eyes very very slowly and carefully so as not to make the teeniest weeniest sound longlegs lifted one foot to wade out into the smiling pool grandfather frog pretended to yawn and opened his big goggly eyes longlegs stood on one foot without moving so much as a feather grandfather frog yawned again nodded as if he were too sleepy to keep awake and half closed his eyes longlegs waited and waited then little by little so slowly that if you had been there you would hardly have seen him move he drew his long neck down until his head rested on his shoulders  i guess i must wait until he falls sound asleep again said longlegs to himself  but grandfather frog didnt go to sleep he would nod and nod and then just when longlegs would make up his mind that this time he really was asleep open would pop grandfather frogs eyes so all the long morning longlegs stood on one foot without moving watching and waiting and growing hungrier and hungrier and all the long morning grandfather frog sat on his big green lilypad pretending that he was oh so sleepy and all the time having such a comfortable sunbath and rest for very early he had had a good breakfast of foolish green flies  over in the bulrushes on the other side of the smiling pool two little scamps in brown bathing suits waited and watched for the great fright they had planned for grandfather frog when they had sent longlegs to try to catch him they were billy mink and little joe otter at first they laughed to themselves and nudged each other at the thought of the trick they had played then as nothing happened they began to grow tired and uneasy you see they do not possess patience finally they gave up in disgust and stole away to find some more exciting sport grandfather frog saw them go and chuckled harder than ever to himself     v  grandfather frog jumps just in time   back and forth over the green meadows sailed whitetail the marsh hawk like longlegs the blue heron he was hungry his sharp eyes peered down among the grasses looking for something to eat but some good fairy seemed to have warned the very little people who live there that whitetail was out hunting perhaps it was one of old mother west winds children the merry little breezes you know they are always flitting about trying to do some one a good turn    they love to dance and romp and play   from dawn to dusk the livelong day   but more than this they love to find     a chance to do some favor kind  anyway little mr green snake seemed to know that whitetail was out hunting and managed to keep out of sight danny meadow mouse wasnt to be found only a few foolish grasshoppers rewarded his patient search and these only served to make him feel hungrier than ever but old whitetail has a great deal of persistence and in spite of his bad luck he kept at his hunting back and forth back and forth until he had been all over the green meadows at last he made up his mind that he was wasting time there  ill just have a look over at the smiling pool and if there is nothing there ill take a turn or two along the big river thought he and straightway started for the smiling pool long before he reached it his keen eyes saw longlegs the blue heron standing motionless on the edge of it and he knew by the looks of longlegs that he was watching something which he hoped to catch  if its a fish thought whitetail it will do me no good for i am no fisherman but if its a frogwell frogs are not as good eating as fat meadow mice but they are very filling  with that he hurried a little faster and then he saw what longlegs was watching so intently it was as you know grandfather frog sitting on his big green lilypad old whitetail gave a great sigh of satisfaction grandfather frog certainly would be very filling very filling indeed  now longlegs the blue heron was so intently watching grandfather frog that he saw nothing else and grandfather frog was so busy watching longlegs that he quite forgot that there might be other dangers besides his back was toward old whitetail of course whitetail saw this and it made him almost chuckle aloud ever so many times he had tried to catch grandfather frog but always grandfather frog had seen him long before he could get near him  now with all his keen sight old whitetail had failed to see some one else who was sitting right in plain sight he had failed because his mind was so full of grandfather frog and longlegs that he forgot to look around as he usually does just skimming the tops of the bulrushes he sailed swiftly out over the smiling pool and reached down with his great cruel claws to clutch grandfather frog who sat there pretending to be asleep but all the time watching longlegs and deep down inside chuckling to think how he was fooling longlegs  slap that was the tail of jerry muskrat hitting the water grandfather frog knew what that meantdanger he didnt know what the danger was and he didnt wait to find out there would be time enough for that later when jerry muskrat slapped the water with his tail that way danger was very near indeed with a frightened chugarum grandfather frog dived head first into the smiling pool and so close was old whitetail that the water was splashed right in his face he clutched frantically with his great claws but all he got was a piece of the big green lilypad on which grandfather frog had been sitting and of course this was of no use for an empty stomach  with a scream of disappointment and anger he whirled in the air and made straight for jerry muskrat but jerry just laughed in the most provoking way and ducked under water     vi  longlegs and whitetail quarrel    you did i didnt i didnt you did   such a terrible fuss when grandfather hid   you see longlegs the blue heron had stood very patiently on one foot all the long morning waiting for grandfather frog to go to sleep on his big green lilypad he had felt sure he was to have grandfather frog for his breakfast and lunch for he had had no breakfast and it was now lunch time he was so hungry that it seemed to him that the sides of his stomach certainly would fall in because there was nothing to hold them up and then without any warning at all old whitetail the marsh hawk had glided out across the smiling pool with his great claws stretched out to clutch grandfather frog and grandfather frog had dived into the smiling pool with a great splash just in the very nick of time  now is there anything in the world so hard on the temper as to lose a good meal when you are very very very hungry of course longlegs didnt really have that good meal but he had thought that he was surely going to have it so when grandfather frog splashed into the smiling pool of course longlegs lost his temper altogether his yellow eyes seemed to grow even more yellow  you robber you thief he screamed harshly at old whitetail  now old whitetail was just as hungry as longlegs and he had come even nearer to catching grandfather frog he is even quicker tempered than longlegs he had whirled like a flash on jerry muskrat but jerry had just laughed in the most provoking manner and ducked under water this had made old whitetail angrier than ever and then to be called bad namesrobber and thief it was more than any selfrespecting hawk could stand yes sir it certainly was he fairly shook with rage as he turned in the air once more and made straight for longlegs the blue heron  im no more robber and thief than you are he shrieked  you frightened away my frog screamed longlegs  i didnt  you did  i didnt it wasnt your frog it was mine  chugarum said grandfather frog to jerry muskrat as they peeped out from under some lilypads i didnt know i belonged to anybody i really didnt did you  no replied jerry his eyes sparkling with excitement as he watched longlegs and whitetail its news to me  youre too lazy to hunt like honest people taunted old whitetail as he wheeled around longlegs watching for a chance to strike with his great cruel claws  im too honest to take the food out of other peoples mouths retorted longlegs dancing around so as always to face whitetail one of his great broad wings held in front of him like a shield and his long strong bill ready to strike  every feather on whitetails head was standing erect with rage and he looked very fierce and terrible at last he saw a chance or thought he did and shot down but all he got was a feather from that great wing which longlegs kept in front of him and before he could get away that long bill had struck him twice so that he screamed with pain so they fought and fought till the ground was covered with feathers and they were too tired to fight any longer then slowly and painfully old whitetail flew away over the green meadows and with torn and ragged wings longlegs flew heavily down the laughing brook towards the big river and both were sore and stiff and still hungry  dear me dear me what a terrible thing and how useless anger is said grandfather frog as he climbed back on his big green lilypad in the warm sunshine     vii  grandfather frogs big mouth gets him in trouble   grandfather frog has a great big mouth you know that everybody does his friends of the smiling pool the laughing brook and the green meadows have teased grandfather frog a great deal about the size of his mouth but he hasnt minded in the least not the very least you see he learned a long time ago that a big mouth is very handy for catching foolish green flies especially when two happen to come along together so he is rather proud of his big mouth just as he is of his goggly eyes  but once in a while his big mouth gets him into trouble its a way big mouths have it holds so much that it makes him greedy sometimes he stuffs it full after his stomach already has all that it can hold and then of course he cant swallow then grandfather frog looks very foolish and silly and undignified and everybody calls him a greedy fellow who is old enough to know better and who ought to be ashamed of himself perhaps he is but he never says so and he is almost sure to do the same thing over again the first chance he has  now it happened that one morning when grandfather frog had had a very good breakfast of foolish green flies and really didnt need another single thing to eat who should come along but little joe otter who had been down to the big river fishing he had eaten all he could hold and he was taking the rest of his catch to a secret hidingplace up the laughing brook  now grandfather frog is very fond of fish for a change and when he saw those that little joe otter had his eyes glistened and in spite of his full stomach his mouth watered  good morning grandfather frog have you had your breakfast yet called little joe otter  grandfather frog wanted to say no but he always tells the truth yees he replied ive had my breakfast such as it was why do you ask  oh for no reason in particular i just thought that if you hadnt you might like a fish but as long as you have breakfasted of course you dont want one said little joe his bright eyes beginning to twinkle he held the fish out so that grandfather frog could see just how plump and nice they were  chugarum exclaimed grandfather frog those certainly are very nice fish very nice fish indeed it is very nice of you to think of a poor old fellow like me and ierwell i might find room for just a little teeny weeny one if you can spare it  little joe otter knows all about grandfather frogs greediness he looked at grandfather frogs white and yellow waistcoat and saw how it was already stuffed full to bursting the twinkle in his eyes grew more mischievous than ever as he said of course i can but i wouldnt think of giving such an old friend a teeny weeny one  with that little joe picked out the biggest fish he had and tossed it over to grandfather frog it landed close by his nose with a great splash and it was almost half as big as grandfather frog himself it was plump and looked so tempting that grandfather frog forgot all about his full stomach he even forgot to be polite and thank little joe otter he just opened his great mouth and seized the fish yes sir that is just what he did almost before you could wink an eye the fish had started down grandfather frogs throat head first  now you know grandfather frog has no teeth and so he cannot bite things in two he has to swallow them whole that is just what he started to do with the fish it went all right until the head reached his stomach but you cant put anything more into a thing already full and grandfather frogs stomach was packed as full as it could be of foolish green flies there the fish stuck and gulp and swallow as hard as he could grandfather frog couldnt make that fish go a bit farther then he tried to get it out again but it had gone so far down his throat that he couldnt get it back grandfather frog began to choke     viii  spotty the turtle plays doctor    greeds a dreadful thing to see   as everybody will agree   at first little joe otter sitting on the bank of the smiling pool laughed himself almost sick as he watched grandfather frog trying to swallow a fish almost as big as himself when his white and yellow waistcoat was already stuffed so full of foolish green flies that there wasnt room for anything more such greed would have been disgusting if it hadnt been so very very funny at least it was funny at first for the fish had stuck with the tail hanging out of grandfather frogs big mouth grandfather frog hitched this way and hitched that way on his big green lilypad trying his best to swallow twice he tumbled off with a splash into the smiling pool each time he scrambled back again and rolled his great goggly eyes in silent appeal to little joe otter to come to his aid  illustration as soon as they saw grandfather frog they began to laugh too page 37  but little joe was laughing so that he had to hold his sides and he didnt understand that grandfather frog really was in trouble billy mink and jerry muskrat came along and as soon as they saw grandfather frog they began to laugh too they just laughed and laughed and laughed until the tears came they rolled over and over on the bank and kicked their heels from sheer enjoyment it was the funniest thing they had seen for a long long time  did you ever see such greed gasped billy mink  why dont you pull it out and start over again shouted little joe otter  now this is just what grandfather frog was trying to do at least he was trying to pull the fish out he hadnt the least desire in the world to try swallowing it again in fact he felt just then as if he never never wanted to see another fish so long as he lived but grandfather frogs hands are not made for grasping slippery things and the tail of a fish is very slippery indeed he tried first with one hand then with the other and at last with both it was of no use at all he just couldnt budge that fish he couldnt cough it up because it had gone too far down for that the more he clawed at that waving tail with his hands the funnier he looked and the harder little joe otter and billy mink and jerry muskrat laughed they made such a noise that spotty the turtle who had been taking a sunbath on the end of an old log slipped into the water and started to see what it was all about  now spotty the turtle is very very slow on land but he is a good swimmer he hurried now because he didnt want to miss the fun at first he didnt see grandfather frog  whats the joke he asked  little joe otter simply pointed to grandfather frog little joe had laughed so much that he couldnt even speak spotty looked over to the big green lilypad and started to laugh too then he saw great tears rolling down from grandfather frogs eyes and heard little choky sounds he stopped laughing and started for grandfather frog as fast as he could swim he climbed right up on the big green lilypad and reaching out grabbed the end of the fish tail in his beaklike mouth then spotty the turtle settled back and pulled and grandfather frog settled back and pulled splash grandfather frog had fallen backward into the smiling pool on one side of the big green lilypad splash spotty the turtle had fallen backward into the smiling pool on the opposite side of the big green lilypad and the fish which had caused all the trouble lay floating on the water  thank you thank you gasped grandfather frog as he feebly crawled back on the lilypad a minute more and i would have choked to death  dont mention it replied spotty the turtle  i never never will promised grandfather frog     ix  old mr toad visits grandfather frog   grandfather frog and old mr toad are cousins of course you know that without being told everybody does but not everybody knows that they were born in the same place they were yes sir they were they were born in the smiling pool both had long tails and for a while no legs and they played and swam together without ever going on shore in fact when they were babies they couldnt live out of the water and people who saw them didnt know the difference between them and called them by the same namestadpoles or pollywogs but when they grew old enough to have legs and get along without tails they parted company  you see it was this way grandfather frog of course he wasnt grandfather then loved the smiling pool so well that he couldnt think of leaving it he heard all about the great world and what a wonderful place it was but he couldnt and wouldnt believe that there could be any nicer place than the smiling pool and so he made up his mind that he would live there always  but mr toad could hardly wait to get rid of his tail before turning his back on the smiling pool and starting out to see the great world nothing that grandfather frog could say would stop him and away mr toad went when he was so small that he could hide under a clover leaf grandfather frog didnt expect ever to see him again but he did though it wasnt for a long long time and when he did come back he had grown so that grandfather frog hardly knew him at first and right then and there began a dispute which they have kept up ever since whether it was best to go out into the great world or remain in the home of childhood each was sure that what he had done was best and each is sure of it to this day  so whenever old mr toad visits grandfather frog as he does every once in a while they are sure to argue and argue on this same old subject it was so on the day that grandfather frog had so nearly choked to death old mr toad had heard about it from one of the merry little breezes of old mother west wind and right away had started for the smiling pool to pay his respects to grandfather frog and to tell him how glad he was that spotty the turtle had come along just in time to pull the fish out of grandfather frogs throat  now all day long grandfather frog had had to listen to unpleasant remarks about his greediness it was such a splendid chance to tease him that everybody around the smiling pool took advantage of it grandfather frog took it goodnaturedly at first but after a while it made him cross and by the time his cousin old mr toad arrived he was sulky and just grunted when mr toad told him how glad he was to find grandfather frog quite recovered  old mr toad pretended not to notice how out of sorts grandfather frog was but kept right on talking  if you had been out in the great world as much as i have been you would have known that little joe otter wasnt giving you that fish for nothing said he  grandfather frog swelled right out with anger chugarum he exclaimed in his deepest gruffest voice chugarum go back to your great world and learn to mind your own affairs mr toad  right away old mr toad began to swell with anger too for a whole minute he glared at grandfather frog so indignant he couldnt find his tongue when he did find it he said some very unpleasant things and right away they began to dispute  what good are you to anybody but yourself never seeing anything of the great world and not knowing anything about what is going on or what other people are doing asked old mr toad  im minding my own affairs and not meddling with things that dont concern me as seems to be the way out in the great world you are so fond of talking about retorted grandfather frog wise people know enough to be content with what they have youve been out in the great world ever since you could hop and what good has it done you tell me that you havent even a decent suit of clothes to your back grandfather frog patted his white and yellow waistcoat as he spoke and looked admiringly at the reflection of his handsome green coat in the smiling pool  old mr toads eyes snapped for you know his suit is very plain and rough  people who do honest work for their living have no time to sit about in fine clothes admiring themselves he replied sharply ive learned this much out in the great world that lazy people come to no good end and i know enough not to choke myself to death  grandfather frog almost choked again he was so angry you see old mr toads remarks were very personal and nobody likes personal remarks when they are unpleasant especially if they happen to be true grandfather frog was trying his best to think of something sharp to say in reply when mr redwing sitting in the top of the big hickorytree shouted here comes farmer browns boy  grandfather frog forgot his anger and began to look anxious he moved about uneasily on his big green lilypad and got ready to dive into the smiling pool for he was afraid that farmer browns boy had a pocketful of stones as he usually did have when he came over to the smiling pool  old mr toad didnt look troubled the least bit he didnt even look around for a hidingplace he just sat still and grinned  youd better watch out or youll never visit the smiling pool again called grandfather frog  oh replied old mr toad im not afraid farmer browns boy is a friend of mine i help him in his garden how to make friends is one of the things the great world has taught me  chugarum said grandfather frog id have you to know that  but what it was that he was to know old mr toad never found out for just then grandfather frog caught sight of farmer browns boy and without waiting even to say goodby he dived into the smiling pool     x  grandfather frog starts out to see the great world   grandfather frog looked very solemn as he sat on his big green lilypad in the smiling pool he looked very much as if he had something on his mind a foolish green fly actually brushed grandfather frogs nose and he didnt even notice it the fact is he did have something on his mind it had been there ever since his cousin old mr toad had called the day before and they had quarreled as usual over the question whether it was best never to leave home or to go out into the great world  right in the midst of their quarrel along had come farmer browns boy now grandfather frog is afraid of farmer browns boy so when he appeared grandfather frog stopped arguing with old mr toad and with a great splash dived into the smiling pool and hid under a lilypad there he stayed and watched his cousin old mr toad grinning in the most provoking way for he wasnt afraid of farmer browns boy in fact he had boasted that they were friends grandfather frog had thought that this was just an idle boast but when he saw farmer browns boy tickle old mr toad under his chin with a straw while mr toad sat perfectly still and seemed to enjoy it he knew that it was true  grandfather frog had not come out of his hidingplace until after old mr toad had gone back across the green meadows and farmer browns boy had gone home for his supper then grandfather frog had climbed back on his big green lilypad and had sat there half the night without once leading the chorus of the smiling pool with his great deep bass voice as he usually did he was thinking thinking very hard and now this bright sunshiny morning he was still thinking  the fact is grandfather frog was beginning to wonder if perhaps after all mr toad was right if the great world had taught him how to make friends with farmer browns boy there really must be some things worth learning there not for the world would grandfather frog have admitted to old mr toad or to any one else that there was anything for him to learn for you know he is very old and by his friends is accounted very wise but right down in his heart he was beginning to think that perhaps there were some things which he couldnt learn in the smiling pool so he sat and thought and thought suddenly he made up his mind  chugarum said he ill do it  do what asked jerry muskrat who happened to be swimming past  ill go out and see for myself what this great world my cousin old mr toad is so fond of talking about is like replied grandfather frog  dont you do it advised jerry muskrat dont you do anything so foolish as that youre too old much too old grandfather frog to go out into the great world  now few old people like to be told that they are too old to do what they please and grandfather frog is no different from others you just mind your own affairs jerry muskrat he retorted sharply i guess i know what is best for me without being told if my cousin old mr toad can take care of himself out in the great world i can he isnt half so spry as i am im going and that is all there is about it  with that grandfather frog dived into the smiling pool swam across to a place where the bank was low and without once looking back started across the green meadows to see the great world     xi  grandfather frog is stubborn    fee fi fe fum   chug chug chugarum   grandfather actually had started out to see the great world yes sir he had turned his back on the smiling pool and nothing that jerry muskrat could say made the least bit of difference grandfather frog had made up his mind and when he does that it is just a waste of time and breath for any one to try to make him change it you see grandfather frog is stubborn yes that is just the wordstubborn he would see for himself what this great world was that his cousin old mr toad talked so much about and said was so much better than the smiling pool where grandfather frog had spent his whole life  if old mr toad can take care of himself i can take care of myself out in the great world said grandfather frog to himself as with great jumps he started out on to the green meadows i guess he isnt any smarter than i am he isnt half so spry as i am and i can jump three times as far as he can ill see for myself what this great world is like and then ill go back to the smiling pool and stay there the rest of my life chugarum how warm it is  it was warm jolly round bright mr sun was smiling his broadest and pouring his warmest rays down on the green meadows the merry little breezes of old mother west wind were taking a nap you see they had played so hard early in the morning that they were tired so there was nobody and nothing to cool grandfather frog and he just grew warmer and warmer with every jump he began to grow thirsty and how he did long for a plunge in the dear cool smiling pool but he was stubborn he wouldnt turn back no matter how uncomfortable he felt he would see the great world if it killed him so he kept right on jump jump jump jump  grandfather frog had been up the laughing brook and down the laughing brook where he could swim when he grew tired of traveling on the bank and where he could cool off whenever he became too warm but never before had he been very far away from water and he found this a very different matter at first he had made great jumps for that is what his long legs were given him for but the long grass bothered him and after a little the jumps grew shorter and shorter and shorter and with every jump he puffed and puffed and presently began to grunt you see he never before had made more than a few jumps at a time without resting and his legs grew tired in a very little while  now if grandfather frog had known as much about the green meadows as the little people who live there all the time do he would have taken the lone little path where the going was easy but he didnt he just started right out without knowing where he was going and of course the way was hard very hard indeed the grass was so tall that he couldnt see over it and the ground was so rough that it hurt his tender feet which were used to the soft mossy bank of the smiling pool he had gone only a little way before he wished with all his might that he had never thought of seeing the great world but he had said that he was going to and he would so he kept right onjump jump rest jump jump jump rest jump and then a long rest  it was during one of these rests that he heard footsteps and then a dreadful sound that made cold chills run all over him sniff sniff sniff it was coming nearer grandfather frog flattened himself down as close to the ground as he could get but it was of no use no use at all the sniffing came nearer and nearer and then right over him stood bowser the hound bowser looked just as surprised as he felt he put out one paw and turned grandfather frog over on his back grandfather frog struggled to his feet and made two frightened jumps  bow wow cried bowser and rolled him over again bowser thought it great fun but grandfather frog thought that his last day had come     xii  grandfather frog keeps on    grandfather frog is old and wise     but even age is foolish   im sure youll all agree with me     his stubbornness was mulish   that his very last day had come grandfather frog was sure he didnt have the least doubt about it here he was at the mercy of bowser the hound out on the green meadows far from the dear safe smiling pool every time he moved bowser flipped him over on his back and danced around him barking with joy every minute grandfather frog expected to feel bowsers terrible teeth and he grew cold at the thought when he found that he couldnt get away he just lay still he was too tired and frightened to do much of anything else anyway  now when he lay still he spoiled bowsers fun for it was seeing him jump and kick his long legs that tickled bowser so bowser tossed him up in the air two or three times but grandfather frog simply lay where he fell without moving  bow wow wow cried bowser in his great deep voice grandfather frog didnt so much as blink his great goggly eyes bowser sniffed him all over  i guess ive frightened him to death said bowser talking to himself i didnt mean to do that i just wanted to have some fun with him with that bowser took one more sniff and then trotted off to try to find something more exciting you see he hadnt had the least intention in the world of really hurting grandfather frog  grandfather frog kept perfectly still until he was sure that bowser was nowhere near then he gave a great sigh of relief and crawled under a big mullein leaf to rest and think things over  chugarum that was a terrible experience it was indeed said he to himself shivering at the very thought of what he had been through nothing like that ever happened to me in the smiling pool ive always said that the smiling pool is a better place in which to live than is the great world and now i know it the question is what had i best do now  now right down in his heart grandfather frog knew the answer of course the best thing to do was to go straight back to the smiling pool as fast as he could but grandfather frog is stubborn yes sir he certainly is stubborn and stubbornness is often just another name for foolishness he had told jerry muskrat that he was going out to see the great world now if he went back jerry would laugh at him  i wont said grandfather frog  what wont you do asked a voice so close to him that grandfather frog made a long jump before he thought you see at the smiling pool he always jumped at the least hint of danger and because one jump always took him into the water he was always safe but there was no water here and that jump took him right out where anybody passing could see him then he turned around to see who had startled him so it was danny meadow mouse  i wont go back to the smiling pool until i have seen the great world replied grandfather frog gruffly  illustration you wont see much of the great world if you jump like that every time you get a scare said danny page 62  you wont see much of the great world if you jump like that every time you get a scare said danny shaking his head no sir you wont see much of the great world because one of these times youll jump right into the claws of old whitetail the marsh hawk or his cousin redtail or reddy fox you take my advice grandfather frog and go straight back to the smiling pool you dont know enough about the great world to take care of yourself  but grandfather frog was set in his ways and nothing that danny meadow mouse could say changed his mind in the least i started out to see the great world and im going to keep right on said he  all right said danny at last if you will i suppose you will ill go a little way with you just to get you started right  thank you replied grandfather frog lets start right away     xiii  danny meadow mouse feels responsible   responsible is a great big word but it is just as big in its meaning as it is in its looks and that is the way words should be i think dont you anyway responsible is the way danny meadow mouse felt when he found grandfather frog out on the green meadows so far from the smiling pool and so stubborn that he would keep on to see the great world instead of going back to his big green lilypad in the smiling pool where he could take care of himself you remember peter rabbit felt responsible when he brought little miss fuzzy tail down from the old pasture to the dear old briarpatch he felt that it was his business to see to it that no harm came to her and that is just the way danny meadow mouse felt about grandfather frog  you see danny knew that if grandfather frog was going to jump like that every time he was frightened he wouldnt get very far in the great world it might be the right thing to do in the smiling pool where the friendly water would hide him from his enemies but it was just the wrong thing to do on the green meadows or in the green forest danny had learned when a very tiny fellow that there the only safe thing to do when danger was near was to sit perfectly still and hardly breathe  now danny meadow mouse is fond of grandfather frog and he couldnt bear to think that something dreadful might happen to him so when he found that he couldnt get grandfather frog to go back to the smiling pool he made up his mind that he just had to go along with grandfather frog to try to keep him out of danger yes sir he just had to do it he felt responsible for grandfather frogs safety so here they were danny meadow mouse running ahead anxious and worried and watching sharply for signs of danger and grandfather frog puffing along behind bound to see the great world which his cousin old mr toad said was a better place to live in than the smiling pool  now danny has a great many private little paths under the grass all over the green meadows and along these he can scamper ever so fast without once showing himself to those who may be looking for him of course he started to take grandfather frog along one of these little paths but grandfather frog doesnt walk or run he jumps there wasnt room in dannys little paths for jumping as they soon found out grandfather frog simply couldnt follow danny along those little paths danny sat down to think and puckered his brows anxiously he was more worried than ever it was very clear that grandfather frog would have to travel out in the open where there was room for him to jump and where also he would be right out in plain sight of all who happened along once more danny urged him to go back to the smiling pool but he might just as well have talked to a stick or a stone grandfather frog had started out to see the great world and he was going to see it  danny sighed if you will you will i suppose said he and i guess the only place you can travel in any comfort is the lone little path it is dangerous very dangerous but i guess you will have to do it  chugarum replied grandfather frog im not afraid you show me the lone little path and then go about your business danny meadow mouse  so danny led the way to the lone little path and grandfather frog sighed with relief for here he could jump without getting all tangled up in long grass and without hurting his tender feet on sharp stubble where the grass had been cut but danny felt more worried than ever he wouldnt leave grandfather frog because you know he felt responsible for him and at the same time he was terribly afraid for he felt sure that some of their enemies would see them he wanted to go back but he kept right on and that shows just what a brave little fellow danny meadow mouse was     xiv  grandfather frog has a strange ride    a thousand things may happen to     ten thousand things befall   the traveler who careless is     or thinks he knows it all   grandfather frog jumping along behind danny meadow mouse up the lone little path was beginning to think that danny was the most timid and easiest frightened of all the little meadow people of his acquaintance danny kept as much under the grass that overhung the lone little path as he could when there were perfectly bare places danny looked this way and looked that way anxiously and then scampered across as fast as he could make his little legs go when he was safely across he would wait for grandfather frog if a shadow passed over the grass danny would duck under the nearest leaf and hold his breath  foolish muttered grandfather frog foolish foolish to be so afraid now im not afraid until i see something to be afraid of time enough then whats the good of looking for trouble all the time now here i am out in the great world and im not afraid and heres danny meadow mouse who has lived here all his life acting as if he expected something dreadful to happen any minute pooh how very very foolish  now grandfather frog is old and in the smiling pool he is accounted very very wise but the wisest sometimes become foolish when they think that they know all there is to know it was so with grandfather frog it was he who was foolish and not danny meadow mouse you see danny knew all the dangers on the green meadows and how many sharp eyes were all the time watching for him he had long ago learned that the only way to feel safe was to feel afraid you see then he was watching for danger every minute and so he wasnt likely to be surprised by his hungry enemies  so while grandfather frog was looking down on danny for being so timid danny was really doing the wisest thing more than that he was really very very brave he was showing grandfather frog the way up the lone little path to see the great world when he himself would never never have thought of traveling anywhere but along his own secret little paths just because grandfather frog couldnt jump anywhere excepting where the way was fairly clear as in the lone little path and danny was afraid that unless grandfather frog had some one with him to watch out for him he would surely come to a sad end  the farther they went with nothing happening the more foolish dannys timid way of running and hiding seemed to grandfather frog and he was just about to tell danny just what he thought when danny dived into the long grass and warned grandfather frog to do the same but grandfather frog didnt  chugarum said he i dont see anything to be afraid of and im not going to hide until i do  so he sat still right where he was in the middle of the lone little path looking this way and that way and seeing nothing to be afraid of and just then around a turn in the lone little path camewho do you think why farmer browns boy he saw grandfather frog and with a whoop of joy he sprang for him grandfather frog gave a frightened croak and jumped but he was too late before he could jump again farmer browns boy had him by his long hindlegs  ha ha shouted farmer browns boy i believe this is the very old chap i have tried so often to catch in the smiling pool these legs of yours will be mighty fine eating mr frog they will indeed  with that he tied grandfather frogs legs together and went on his way across the green meadows with poor old grandfather frog dangling from the end of a string it was a strange ride and a most uncomfortable one and with all his might grandfather frog wished he had never thought of going out into the great world     xv  grandfather frog gives up hope   with his legs tied together hanging head down from the end of a string grandfather frog was being carried he knew not where by farmer browns boy it was dreadful halfway across the green meadows the merry little breezes of old mother west wind came dancing along at first they didnt see grandfather frog but presently one of them rushing up to tease farmer browns boy by blowing off his hat caught sight of grandfather frog  now the merry little breezes are great friends of grandfather frog many many times they have blown foolish green flies over to him as he sat on his big green lilypad and they are very fond of him so when this one caught sight of him in such a dreadful position he forgot all about teasing farmer browns boy he raced away to tell the other merry little breezes for a minute they were perfectly still they forgot all about being merry  its awful just perfectly awful cried one  we must do something to help grandfather frog cried another  of course we must said a third  but what can we do asked a fourth  nobody replied they just thought and thought and thought finally the first one spoke we might try to comfort him a little said he  of course we will do that they shouted all together  and if we throw dust in the face of farmer browns boy and steal his hat perhaps he will put grandfather frog down continued the merry little breeze  the very thing the others cried dancing about with excitement  then we can rush about and tell all grandfather frogs friends what has happened to him and where he is perhaps some of them can help us the little breeze continued  they wasted no more time talking but raced after farmer browns boy as fast as they could go one of them who was faster than the others ran ahead and whispered in grandfather frogs ear that they were coming to help him but poor old grandfather frog couldnt be comforted he couldnt see what there was that the merry little breezes could do his legs smarted where the string cut into the skin and his head ached for you know he was hanging head down no sir grandfather frog couldnt be comforted he was in a terrible fix and he couldnt see any way out of it he hadnt the least bit of hope left and all the time farmer browns boy was trudging along whistling merrily you see it didnt occur to him to think how grandfather frog must be suffering and how terribly frightened he must be he wasnt cruel no indeed farmer browns boy wasnt cruel that is he didnt mean to be cruel he was just thoughtless like a great many other boys and girls too  so he went whistling on his way until he reached the long lane leading from the green meadows up to farmer browns dooryard no sooner was he in the long lane than something happened a great cloud of dust and leaves and tiny sticks was dashed in his face and nearly choked him dirt got in his eyes his hat was snatched from his head and went sailing over into the garden he dropped grandfather frog and felt for his handkerchief to wipe the dirt from his eyes  phew exclaimed farmer browns boy as he started after his hat its funny where that wind came from so suddenly  but you know and i know that it was the merry little breezes working together who made up that sudden wind and grandfather frog ought to have known it too but he didnt you see the dust had got in his nose and eyes just as it had in those of farmer browns boy and he was so frightened and confused that he couldnt think so he lay just where farmer browns boy dropped him and he didnt have any more hope than before     xvi  the merry little breezes work hard   the merry little breezes almost shouted aloud with delight when they saw farmer browns boy drop grandfather frog to feel for his handkerchief and wipe out the dust which they had thrown in his eyes then he had to climb the fence and chase his hat through the garden they would let him almost get his hands on it and then just as he thought that he surely had it they would snatch it away it was great fun for the merry little breezes but they were not doing it for fun no indeed they were not doing it for fun they were doing it to lead farmer browns boy away from grandfather frog  just as soon as they dared they dropped the hat and then separated and rushed away in all directions across the green meadows over to the green forest and down to the smiling pool what were they going for why to hunt for some of grandfather frogs friends and ask their help you see the merry little breezes could make farmer browns boy drop grandfather frog but they couldnt untie a knot or cut a string and this is just what had got to be done to set grandfather frog free for his hindlegs were tied together so now they were looking for some one with sharp teeth who thought enough of grandfather frog to come and help him  one thought of striped chipmunk and started for the old stone wall to look for him another went in search of danny meadow mouse a third headed for the dear old briarpatch after peter rabbit a fourth remembered jimmy skunk and how he had once set blacky the crow free from a snare a fifth remembered what sharp teeth happy jack squirrel has and hurried over to the green forest to look for him a sixth started straight for the smiling pool to tell jerry muskrat and every one of them raced as fast as he could  all this time grandfather frog was without hope yes sir poor old grandfather frog was wholly in despair you see he didnt know what the merry little breezes were trying to do and he was so frightened and confused that he couldnt think when farmer browns boy dropped him he lay right where he fell for a few minutes then right close at hand he saw an old board without really thinking he tried to get to it for there looked as if there might be room for him to hide under it it was hard work for you know his long hindlegs which he uses for jumping were tied together the best he could do was to crawl and wriggle and pull himself along just as farmer browns boy started to climb the fence back into the long lane his hat in his hand grandfather frog reached the old board and crawled under it  now when the merry little breezes had thrown the dust in farmer browns boys face and snatched his hat he had dropped grandfather frog in such a hurry that he didnt notice just where he did drop him so now he didnt know the exact place to look for him but he knew pretty near and he hadnt the least doubt but that he would find him he had just started to look when the dinner horn sounded farmer browns boy hesitated he was hungry if he was late he might lose his dinner he could come back later to look for grandfather frog for with his legs tied grandfather frog couldnt get far so with a last look to make sure of the place farmer browns boy started for the house  if the merry little breezes had known this they would have felt ever so much better but they didnt so they hurried as fast as ever they could to find grandfather frogs friends and worked until they were almost too tired to move for it seemed as if every single one of grandfather frogs friends had taken that particular day to go away from home so while farmer browns boy ate his dinner and grandfather frog lay hiding under the old board in the long lane the merry little breezes did their best to find help for him     xvii  striped chipmunk cuts the string    hippy hop flippy flop all on a summer day   my mother turned me from the house and sent me out to play   striped chipmunk knew perfectly well that that was just nonsense but striped chipmunk learned a long time ago that when you are just bubbling right over with good feeling there is fun in saying and doing foolish things and that is just how he was feeling so he ran along the old rail fence on one side of the long lane saying foolish things and cutting up foolish capers just because he felt so good and all the time seeing all that those bright little eyes of his could take in  now striped chipmunk and the merry little breezes of old mother west wind are great friends very great friends indeed almost every morning they have a grand frolic together but this morning the merry little breezes hadnt come over to the old stone wall where striped chipmunk makes his home anyway they hadnt come at the usual time striped chipmunk had waited a little while and then because he was feeling so good he had decided to take a run down the long lane to see if anything new had happened there that is how it happened that when one of the merry little breezes did go to look for him and was terribly anxious to ask him to come to the help of grandfather frog he was nowhere to be found  but striped chipmunk didnt know anything about that he scampered along the top rails of the old fence jumped up on top of a post and sat up to wash his face and hands for striped chipmunk is very neat and cannot bear to be the least bit dirty he looked up and winked at ol mistah buzzard sailing round and round way way up in the blue blue sky he chased his own tail round and round until he nearly fell off of the post he made a wry face in the direction of redtail the hawk whom he could see sitting in the top of a tall tree way over on the green meadows he scolded bowser the hound who happened to come trotting up the long lane and didnt stop scolding until bowser was out of sight then he kicked up his heels and whisked along the old fence again  halfway across a shaky old rail he suddenly stopped his bright eyes had seen something that filled him with curiosity quite as much curiosity as peter rabbit would have had it was a piece of string yes sir it was a piece of string now striped chipmunk often had found pieces of string so there was nothing particularly interesting in the string itself what did interest him and make him very curious was the fact that this piece of string kept moving every few seconds it gave a little jerk whoever heard of a piece of string moving all by itself certainly striped chipmunk never had he couldnt understand it  for a few minutes he watched it from the top rail of the old fence then he scurried down to the ground and a few steps at a time stopping to watch sharply between each little run he drew nearer and nearer to that queer acting string it gave him a funny feeling inside to see a string acting like that so he was very careful not to get too near he looked at it from one side then ran around and looked at it from the other side at last he got where he could see that one end of the string was under an old board and then he began to understand of course there was somebody hiding under that old board and jerking the string  illustration he seized the other end of the string and began to pull page 88  striped chipmunk sat down and scratched his head thoughtfully whoever was pulling that string couldnt be very big or they would never have been able to crawl under that old board therefore he neednt be afraid a gleam of mischief twinkled in striped chipmunks eyes he seized the other end of the string and began to pull such a jerking and yanking as began right away but he held on and pulled harder then out from under the old board appeared the queer webbed feet of grandfather frog tied together striped chipmunk was so surprised that he let go of the string and nearly fell over backward  why grandfather frog what under the sun are you doing here he shouted  when striped chipmunk let go of the string grandfather frog promptly drew his feet back under the old board but when he heard striped chipmunks voice he slowly and painfully crawled out he told how he had been caught and tied by farmer browns boy and finally dropped near the old board he told how terribly frightened he was and how sore his legs were striped chipmunk didnt wait for him to finish in a flash he was at work with his sharp teeth and had cut the cruel string before grandfather frog had finished his story     xviii  grandfather frog hurries away   when striped chipmunk cut the string that bound the long legs of grandfather frog together grandfather frog was so relieved that he hardly knew what to do of course he thanked striped chipmunk over and over again striped chipmunk said that it was nothing just nothing at all and that he was very glad indeed to help grandfather frog  we folks who live out in the great world have to help one another said striped chipmunk because we never know when we may need help ourselves now you take my advice grandfather frog and go back to the smiling pool as fast as you can the great world is no place for an old fellow like you because you dont know how to take care of yourself  now when he said that striped chipmunk made a great mistake old people never like to be told that they are old or that they do not know all there is to know grandfather frog straightened up and tried to look very dignified  chugarum said he id have you to know striped chipmunk that people were coming to me for advice before you were born it was just an accident that farmer browns boy caught me and id like to see him do it again yes sir id like to see him do it again  dear me dear me grandfather frog was boasting if he had been safe at home in the smiling pool there might have been some excuse for boasting but way over here in the long lane not even knowing the way back to the smiling pool it was foolish very foolish indeed no one knew that better than striped chipmunk but he has a great deal of respect for grandfather frog and he knew too that grandfather frog was feeling very much out of sorts and very much mortified to think that he had been caught in such a scrape so he put a hand over his mouth to hide a smile as he said  of course he isnt going to catch you again i know how wise and smart you are but you look to me very tired and there are so many dangers out here in the great world that it seems to me that the very best thing you can do is to go back to the smiling pool  but grandfather frog is stubborn you know he had started out to see the great world and he didnt want the little people of the green meadows and the green forest to think that he was afraid the truth is grandfather frog was more afraid of being laughed at than he was of the dangers around him which shows just how foolish wise people can be sometimes so he shook his head  chugarum said he i am going to see the great world first and then i am going back to the smiling pool do you happen to know where there is any water i am very thirsty  now over on the other side of the long lane was a spring where farmer browns boy filled his jug with clear cold water to take with him to the cornfield when he had to work there striped chipmunk knew all about that spring for he had been there for a drink many times so he told grandfather frog just where the spring was and how to get to it he even offered to show the way but grandfather frog said that he would rather go alone  watch out grandfather frog and dont fall in because you might not be able to get out again warned striped chipmunk  grandfather frog looked up sharply to see if striped chipmunk was making fun of him the very idea of any one thinking that he who had lived in the water all his life couldnt get out when he pleased but striped chipmunk looked really in earnest so grandfather frog swallowed the quick retort on the tip of his tongue thanked striped chipmunk and hurried away to look for the spring for he was very very thirsty besides he was very very hot and he hurried still faster as he thought of the cool bath he would have when he found that spring     xix  grandfather frog jumps into more trouble   some people are heedless and run into trouble some people are stupid and walk into trouble grandfather frog was both heedless and stupid and jumped into trouble when striped chipmunk told him where the spring was it seemed to him that he couldnt wait to reach it you see grandfather frog had spent all his life in the smiling pool where he could get a drink whenever he wanted it by just reaching over the edge of his big green lilypad whenever he was too warm all he had to do was to say chugarum and dive head first into the cool water so he wasnt used to going a long time without water  jump jump jump grandfather frog was going as fast as ever he could in the direction striped chipmunk had pointed out every three or four jumps he would stop for just a wee wee bit of rest then off he would go again jump jump jump and each jump was a long one peter rabbit certainly would have been envious if he could have seen those long jumps of grandfather frog  at last the ground began to grow damp the farther he went the damper it grew presently it became fairly wet and there was a great deal of soft cool wet moss how good it did feel to grandfather frogs poor tired feet  must be im most there said grandfather frog to himself as he scrambled up on a big mossy hummock so as to look around right away he saw a little path from the direction of the long lane it led straight past the very hummock on which grandfather frog was sitting and he noticed that where the ground was very soft and wet old boards had been laid down that puzzled grandfather frog a great deal  its a sure enough path said he but what under the blue blue sky does any one want to spoil it for by putting those boards there  you see grandfather frog likes the soft wet mud and he couldnt understand how any one even farmer browns boy could prefer a hard dry path of course he never had worn shoes himself so he couldnt understand why any one should want dry feet when they could just as well have wet ones he was still puzzling over it when he heard a sound that made him nearly lose his balance and tumble off the hummock it was a whistle the whistle of farmer browns boy grandfather frog knew it right away because he often had heard it over by the smiling pool the whistle came from over in the long lane farmer browns boy had had his dinner and was on his way back to look for grandfather frog where he had been dropped  grandfather frog actually grinned as he thought how surprised farmer browns boy was going to be when he could find no trace of him suddenly the smile seemed to freeze on grandfather frogs face that whistle was coming nearer farmer browns boy had left the long lane and was coming along the little path the truth is he was coming for a drink at the spring but grandfather frog didnt think of this he was sure that in some way farmer browns boy had found out which way he had gone and was coming after him he crouched down as flat as he could on the big hummock and held his breath farmer browns boy went straight past just a few steps beyond he stopped and knelt down peeping through the grass grandfather frog saw him dip up beautiful clear water in an old cup and drink then grandfather frog knew just where the spring was  a few minutes later farmer browns boy passed again still whistling on his way to the long lane grandfather frog waited only long enough to be sure that he had really gone then with bigger jumps than ever he started for the spring a dozen long jumps and he could see the water two more jumps and then a long jump and he had landed in the spring with a splash  chugarum cried grandfather frog how good the water feels  and all the time grandfather frog had jumped straight into more trouble     xx  grandfather frog loses heart    look before you leap   the water may be deep   that is the very best kind of advice but most people find that out when it is too late grandfather frog did of course he had heard that little verse all his life indeed he had been very fond of saying it to those who came to the smiling pool to ask his advice but grandfather frog seemed to have left all his wisdom behind him when he left the smiling pool to go out into the great world you see it is very hard work for any one whose advice has been sought to turn right around and take advice themselves so grandfather frog had been getting into scrapes ever since he started out on his foolish journey and now here he was in still another and he had landed in it head first with a great splash  of course when he had seen the cool sparkling water of the spring it had seemed to him that he just couldnt wait another second to get into it he was so hot and dry and dreadfully thirsty and uncomfortable and sooh dear megrandfather frog didnt look at all before he leaped no sir he didnt he just dived in with a great long jump oh how good that water felt for a few minutes he couldnt think of anything else it was cooler than the water of the smiling pool because as you know it was a spring but it felt all the better for that and grandfather frog just closed his eyes and floated there in pure happiness  presently he opened his eyes to look around then he blinked them rapidly for a minute or so he rubbed them to make sure that he saw aright his heart seemed to sink way way down towards his toes chugarum exclaimed grandfather frog chugarum and after that for a long time he didnt say a word  you see it was this way all around him rose perfectly straight smooth walls he could look up and see a little of the blue blue sky right overhead and whispering leaves of trees and bushes over the edge of the smooth straight wall grasses were bending but they were so far above his head so dreadfully far there wasnt any place to climb out grandfather frog was in a prison he didnt understand it at all but it was so  of course farmer browns boy could have told him all about it a long time before farmer brown himself had found that spring and because the water was so clear and cold and pure he had cleared away all the dirt and rubbish around it then he had knocked the bottom out of a nice clean barrel and had dug down where the water bubbled up out of the sand and had set the barrel down in this hole and had filled in the bottom with clean white sand for the water to bubble up through about halfway up the barrel he had cut a little hole for the water to run out as fast as it bubbled in at the bottom of course the water never could fill the barrel because when it reached that hole it ran out this left a straight smooth wall up above a wall altogether too high for grandfather frog to jump over from the inside  poor old grandfather frog he wished more than ever that he never never had thought of leaving the smiling pool to see the great world round and round he swam but he couldnt see any way out of it the little hole where the water ran out was too small for him to squeeze through as he found out by trying and trying so far as he could see he had just got to stay there all the rest of his life worse still he knew that farmer browns boy sometimes came to the spring for a drink for he had seen him do it that meant that the very next time he came he would find grandfather frog because there was no place to hide when grandfather frog thought of that he just lost heart yes sir he just lost heart he gave up all hope of ever seeing the smiling pool again and two big tears ran out of his big goggly eyes     xxi  the merry little breezes try to comfort grandfather frog   when the merry little breezes of old mother west wind had left grandfather frog in the long lane where farmer browns boy had dropped him and had hurried as fast as ever they could to try to find some of his friends to help him not one of them had been successful no one was at home and no one was in any of the places where they usually were to be found the merry little breezes looked and looked then one by one they sadly turned back to the long lane they felt so badly that they just hated to go back where they had left grandfather frog  when they got there they found striped chipmunk who now was scolding farmer browns boy as fast as his tongue could go  where is he cried the merry little breezes excitedly  striped chipmunk stopped scolding long enough to point to farmer browns boy who was hunting in the grass for some trace of grandfather frog  we dont mean him you stupid we can see him for ourselves wheres grandfather frog cried the merry little breezes all speaking at once  i dont know replied striped chipmunk and whats more i dont care  now this wasnt true for striped chipmunk isnt that kind it was mostly talk and the merry little breezes knew it they knew that striped chipmunk really thinks a great deal of grandfather frog just as they do so they pretended not to notice what he said or how put out he seemed after a while he told them that he had set grandfather frog free and that then he had started for the spring on the other side of the long lane the merry little breezes were delighted to hear the good news and they said such a lot of nice things to striped chipmunk that he quite forgot to scold farmer browns boy then they started for the spring dancing merrily for they felt sure that there grandfather frog was all right and they expected to find him quite at home  hello grandfather frog they shouted as they peeped into the spring how do you like your new home  grandfather frog made no reply he just rolled his great goggly eyes up at them and they were full of tears  whywhywhy grandfather frog what is the matter now they cried  chugarum said grandfather frog and his voice sounded all choky i cant get out  then they noticed for the first time how straight and smooth the walls of the spring were and how far down grandfather frog was and they knew that he spoke the truth they tried bending down the grasses that grew around the edge of the spring but none were long enough to reach the water if they had stopped to think they would have known that grandfather frog couldnt have climbed up by them anyway then they tried to lift a big stick into the spring but it was too heavy for them and they couldnt move it however they did manage to blow an old shingle in and this gave grandfather frog something to sit on so that he began to feel a little better then they said all the comforting things they could think of they told him that no harm could come to him there unless farmer browns boy should happen to see him  illustration thats just what im afraid of croaked grandfather frog page 109  thats just what i am afraid of croaked grandfather frog he is sure to see me if he comes for a drink for there is no place for me to hide  perhaps he wont come said one of the little breezes hopefully  if he does come you can hide under the piece of shingle and then he wont know you are here at all said another  grandfather frog brightened up thats so said he thats a good idea and ill try it  then one of the merry little breezes promised to keep watch for farmer browns boy and all the others started off on another hunt for some one to help grandfather frog out of this new trouble     xxii  grandfather frogs troubles grow    head first in no way out   its best to know what youre about   grandfather frog had had plenty of time to realize how very true this is as he sat on the old shingle which the merry little breezes had blown into the spring where he was a prisoner he thought a great deal about that little word if if he hadnt left the smiling pool if he hadnt been stubborn and set in his ways if he hadnt been in such a hurry if he had looked to see where he was leapingwell any one of these ifs would have kept him out of his present trouble  it really wasnt so bad in the spring that is it wouldnt have been so bad but for the fear that farmer browns boy might come for a drink and find him there that was grandfather frogs one great fear and it gave him bad dreams whenever he tried to take a nap he grew cold all over at the very thought of being caught again by farmer browns boy and when at last one of the merry little breezes hurried up to tell him that farmer browns boy actually was coming poor old grandfather frog was so frightened that the merry little breeze had to tell him twice to hide under the old shingle as it floated on the water  at last he got it through his head and drawing a very long breath he dived into the water and swam under the old shingle he was just in time yes sir he was just in time if farmer browns boy hadnt been thinking of something else he certainly would have noticed the little rings on the water made by grandfather frog when he dived in but he was thinking of something else and it wasnt until he dipped a cup in for the second time that he even saw the old shingle  hello he exclaimed that must have blown in since i was here yesterday we cant have anything like that in our nice spring  with that he reached out for the old shingle and grandfather frog hiding under it gave himself up for lost but the anxious little breeze had been watching sharply and the instant he saw what farmer browns boy was going to do he played the old old trick of snatching his hat from his head the truth is he couldnt think of anything else to do farmer browns boy grabbed at his hat and then because he was in a hurry and had other things to do he started off without once thinking of the old shingle again  chugarum cried grandfather frog as he swam out from under the shingle and climbed up on it that certainly was a close call if i have many more like it i certainly shall die of fright  nothing more happened for a long time and grandfather frog was wondering if it wouldnt be safe to take a nap when he saw peeping over the edge above him two eyes they were greenish yellow eyes and they stared and stared grandfather frog stared and stared back he just couldnt help it he didnt know who they belonged to he couldnt remember ever having seen them before he was afraid and yet somehow he couldnt make up his mind to jump he stared so hard at the eyes that he didnt notice a long furry paw slowly very slowly reaching down towards him nearer it crept and nearer then suddenly it moved like a flash grandfather frog felt sharp claws in his white and yellow waistcoat and before he could even open his mouth to cry chugarum he was sent flying through the air and landed on his back in the grass pounce two paws pinned him down and the greenish yellow eyes were not an inch from his own they belonged to black pussy farmer browns cat     xxiii   the dear old smiling pool once more   black pussy was having a good time grandfather frog wasnt it was great fun for black pussy to slip a paw under grandfather frog and toss him up in the air it was still more fun to pretend to go away but to hide instead and the instant grandfather frog started off to pounce upon him and cuff him and roll him about but there wasnt any fun in it for grandfather frog in the first place he didnt know whether or not black pussy liked frogs to eat and he was terribly frightened in the second place black pussy didnt always cover up her claws and they pricked right through grandfather frogs white and yellow waistcoat and hurt for he is very tender there  at last black pussy grew tired of playing so catching up grandfather frog in her mouth she started along the little path from the spring to the long lane grandfather frog didnt even kick which was just as well because if he had black pussy would have held him tighter and that would have been very uncomfortable indeed  its all over and this is the end moaned grandfather frog im going to be eaten now oh why why did i ever leave the smiling pool  just as black pussy slipped into the long lane grandfather frog heard a familiar sound it was a whistle a merry whistle it was the whistle of farmer browns boy it was coming nearer and nearer a little bit of hope began to stir in the heart of grandfather frog  he didnt know just why but it did always he had been in the greatest fear of farmer browns boy but nowwell if farmer browns boy should take him he might get away from him as he did before but he was very sure that he never never could get away from black pussy  the whistle drew nearer black pussy stopped then she began to make a queer whirring sound deep down in her throat  hello black pussy have you been hunting come here and show me what youve got cried a voice  black pussy arched up her back and began to rub against the legs of farmer browns boy and all the time the whir ring sound in her throat grew louder and louder farmer browns boy stooped down to see what she had in her mouth  why he exclaimed i do believe this is the very same old frog that got away from me you dont want him puss ill just put him in my pocket and take him up to the house by and by  with that he took grandfather frog from black pussy and dropped him in his pocket he patted black pussy called her a smart cat and then started on his way whistling merrily it was dark and rather close in that pocket but grandfather frog didnt mind this it was a lot better than feeling sharp teeth and claws all the time he wondered how soon they would reach the house and what would happen to him then after what seemed like a long long time he felt himself swung through the air and then he landed on the ground with a thump that made him grunt farmer browns boy had taken off his coat and thrown it down  the whistling stopped everything was quiet grandfather frog waited and listened but not a sound could he hear then he saw a little ray of light creeping into his prison he squirmed and pushed and all of a sudden he was out of the pocket the bright light made him blink as soon as he could see he looked to see where he was then he rubbed his eyes with both hands and looked again he wasnt at farmer browns house at all where do you think he was why right on the bank of the smiling pool and a little way off was farmer browns boy fishing  chugarum cried grandfather frog and it was the loudest gladdest chugarum that the smiling pool ever had heard chugarum he cried again and with a great leap he dived with a splash into the dear old smiling pool which smiled more than ever  and never again has grandfather frog tried to see the great world he is quite content to leave it to those who like to dwell there and since his own wonderful adventures he has been ready to believe anything he is told about what happens there nothing can surprise him not even the astonishing things that happened to chatterer the red squirrel about which it takes a whole book to tell
