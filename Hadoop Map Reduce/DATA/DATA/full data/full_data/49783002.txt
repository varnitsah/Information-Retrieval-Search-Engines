             1903     a patent medicine testimonial   you might as well try to move the rock of gibraltar as attempt to change uncle abimelechs mind when it is once made up said murray gloomily  murray is like dear old dad he gets discouraged rather easily now im not like that im more like mothers folks as uncle abimelech has never failed to tell me when i have annoyed him im all foster uncle abimelech doesnt like the fosters but im glad i take after them if i had folded my hands and sat down meekly when uncle abimelech made known his good will and pleasure regarding murray and me after fathers death murray would never have got to collegenor i either for that matter only i wouldnt have minded that very much i just wanted to go to college because murray did i couldnt be separated from him we were twins and had always been together  as for uncle abimelechs mind i knew that he never had been known to change it but as he himself was fond of saying there has to be a first time for everything and i had determined that this was to be the first time for him i hadnt any idea how i was going to bring it about but it just had to be done and im not all foster for nothing  i knew i would have to depend on my own thinkers murray is clever at books and dissecting dead things but he couldnt help me out in this even if he hadnt settled beforehand that there was no use in opposing uncle abimelech  im going up to the garret to think this out murray i said solemnly dont let anybody disturb me and if uncle abimelech comes over dont tell him where i am if i dont come down in time to get tea get it yourself i shall not leave the garret until i have thought of some way to change uncle abimelechs mind  then youll be a prisoner there for the term of your natural life dear sis said murray sceptically youre a clever girl prueand youve got enough decision for twobut youll never get the better of uncle abimelech  well see i said resolutely and up to the garret i went i shut the door and bolted it good and fast to make sure then i piled some old cushions in the window seatfor one might as well be comfortable when one is thinking as notand went over the whole ground from the beginning  outside the wind was thrashing the broad leafy top of the maple whose tallest twigs reached to the funny grey eaves of our old house one rolypoly little sparrow blew or flew to the sill and sat there for a minute looking at me with knowing eyes down below i could see murray in a corner of the yard pottering over a sick duck he had set its broken leg and was nursing it back to health anyone except uncle abimelech could see that murray was simply born to be a doctor and that it was flying in the face of providence to think of making him anything else  from the garret windows i could see all over the farm for the house is on the hill end of it i could see all the dear old fields and the spring meadow and the beech woods in the southwest corner and beyond the orchard were the two grey barns and down below at the righthand corner was the garden with all my sweet peas fluttering over the fences and trellises like a horde of butterflies it was a dear old place and both murray and i loved every stick and stone on it but there was no reason why we should go on living there when murray didnt like farming and it wasnt our own anyhow it all belonged to uncle abimelech  father and murray and i had always lived here together fathers health broke down during his college course that was one reason why uncle abimelech was set against murray going to college although murray is as chubby and sturdy a fellow as you could wish to see anybody with foster in him would be that  to go back to father the doctors told him that his only chance of recovering his strength was an openair life so father rented one of uncle abimelechs farms and there he lived for the rest of his days he did not get strong again until it was too late for college and he was a square peg in a round hole all his life as he used to tell us mother died before we could remember so murray and dad and i were everything to each other we were very happy too although we were bossed by uncle abimelech more or less but he meant it well and father didnt mind  then father diedoh that was a dreadful time i hurried over it in my thinkingout of course when murray and i came to look our position squarely in the face we found that we were dependent on uncle abimelech for everything even the roof over our heads we were literally as poor as church mice and even poorer for at least they get churches rentfree  murrays heart was set on going to college and studying medicine he asked uncle abimelech to lend him enough money to get a start with and then he could work his own way along and pay back the loan in due time uncle abimelech is rich and murray and i are his nearest relatives but he simply wouldnt listen to murrays plan  i put my foot firmly down on such nonsense he said and you know that when i put my foot down something squashes  it was not that uncle abimelech was miserly or that he grudged us assistance not at all he was ready to deal generously by us but it must be in his own way his way was this murray and i were to stay on the farm and when murray was twentyone uncle abimelech said he would deed the farm to himmake him a present of it out and out  its a good farm murray he said your father never made more than a bare living out of it because he wasnt strong enough to work it properlythats what he got out of a college course by the way but you are strong enough and ambitious enough to do well  but murray couldnt be a farmer that was all there was to it i told uncle abimelech so firmly and i talked to him for days about it but uncle abimelech never wavered he sat and listened to me with a quizzical smile on that handsome cleanshaven ruddy old face of his with its cutgranite features and in the end he said  you ought to be the one to go to college if either of you did prue you would make a capital lawyer if i believed in the higher education of women but i dont murray can take or leave the farm as he chooses if he prefers the latter alternative well and good but he gets no help from me youre a foolish little girl prue to back him up in this nonsense of his  it makes me angry to be called a little girl when i put up my hair a year ago and uncle abimelech knows it i gave up arguing with him i knew it was no use anyway  i thought it all over in the garret but no way out of the dilemma could i see i had eaten up all the apples i had brought with me and i felt flabby and disconsolate the sight of uncle abimelech stalking up the lane as erect and lordly as usual served to deepen my gloom  i picked up the paper my apples had been wrapped in and looked it over gloomily then i saw something and uncle abimelech was delivered into my hand  the whole plan of campaign unrolled itself before me and i fairly laughed in glee looking out of the garret window right down on the little bald spot on the top of uncle abimelechs head as he stood laying down the law to murray about something  when uncle abimelech had gone i went down to murray  buddy i said ive thought of a plan im not going to tell you what it is but you are to consent to it without knowing i think it will quench uncle abimelech but you must have perfect confidence in me you must back me up no matter what i do and let me have my own way in it all  all right sis said murray  that isnt solemn enough i protested im serious promise solemnly  i promise solemnly cross my heart said murray looking like an owl  very well remember that your role is to lie low and say nothing like brer rabbit alloways anodyne liniment is pretty good stuff isnt it murray it cured your sprain after you had tried everything else didnt it  yes but i dont see the connection  it isnt necessary that you should well what with your sprain and my rheumatics i think i can manage it  look here prue are you sure that long brooding over our troubles up in the garret hasnt turned your brain  my brain is all right now leave me minion there is that which i would do  murray grinned and went i wrote a letter took it down to the office and mailed it for a week there was nothing more to do  there is just one trait of uncle abimelechs disposition more marked than his fondness for having his own way and that one thing is family pride the melvilles are a very old family the name dates back to the norman conquest when a certain roger de melville who was an ancestor of ours went over to england with william the conqueror i dont think the melvilles ever did anything worth recording in history since to be sure as far back as we can trace none of them has ever done anything bad either they have been honest respectable folks and i think that is something worth being proud of  but uncle abimelech pinned his family pride to roger de melville he had the melville coat of arms and our family tree made out by an eminent genealogist framed and hung up in his library and he would not have done anything that would not have chimed in with that coat of arms and a conquering ancestor for the world  at the end of a week i got an answer to my letter it was what i wanted i wrote again and sent a parcel in three weeks time the storm burst  one day i saw uncle abimelech striding up the lane he had a big newspaper clutched in his hand i turned to murray who was poring over a book of anatomy in the corner  murray uncle abimelech is coming there is going to be a battle royal between us allow me to remind you of your promise  to lie low and say nothing thats the cue isnt it sis  unless uncle abimelech appeals to you in that case you are to back me up  then uncle abimelech stalked in he was purple with rage old roger de melville himself never could have looked fiercer i did feel a quake or two but i faced uncle abimelech undauntedly no use in having your name on the roll of battle abbey if you cant stand your ground  prudence what does this mean thundered uncle abimelech as he flung the newspaper down on the table murray got up and peered over then he whistled he started to say something but remembered just in time and stopped but he did give me a black look murray has a sneaking pride of name too although he wont own up to it and laughs at uncle abimelech  i looked at the paper and began to laugh we did look so funny murray and i in that advertisement it took up the whole page at the top were our photos half lifesize and underneath our names and addresses printed out in full below was the letter i had written to the alloway anodyne liniment folks it was a florid testimonial to the virtues of their liniment i said that it had cured murrays sprain after all other remedies had failed and that when i had been left a partial wreck from a very bad attack of rheumatic fever the only thing that restored my joints and muscles to working order was alloways anodyne liniment and so on  it was all true enough although i dare say old aunt sarahfromthehollows rubbing had as much to do with the cures as the liniment but that is neither here nor there  what does this mean prudence said uncle abimelech again he was quivering with wrath but i was as cool as a cucumber and murray stood like a graven image  why that uncle abimelech i said calmly well it just means one of my ways of making money that liniment company pays for those testimonials and photos you know they gave me fifty dollars for the privilege of publishing them fifty dollars will pay for books and tuition for murray and me at kentville academy next winter and mrs tredgold is kind enough to say she will board me for what help i can give her around the house and wait for murrays until he can earn it by teaching  i rattled all this off glibly before uncle abimelech could get in a word  its disgraceful he stormed disgraceful think of sir roger de melvilleand a patent medicine advertisement murray melville what were you about sir to let your sister disgrace herself and her family name by such an outrageous transaction  i quaked a bit if murray should fail me but murray was trueblue  i gave prue a free hand sir its an honest business transaction enoughand the family name alone wont send us to college you know sir  uncle abimelech glared at us  this must be put an end to he said this advertisement must not appear again i wont have it  but ive signed a contract that it is to run for six months i said sturdily and ive others in view you remember the herb cure you recommended one spring and that it did me so much good im negotiating with the makers of that and  the girls mad said uncle abimelech stark staring mad  oh no im not uncle abimelech im merely a pretty good businesswoman you wont help murray to go to college so i must this is the only way i have and im going to see it through  after uncle abimelech had gone still in a towering rage murray remonstrated but i reminded him of his promise and he had to succumb  next day uncle abimelech returneda subdued and chastened uncle abimelech  see here prue he said sternly this thing must be stopped i say it must i am not going to have the name of melville dragged all over the country in a patent medicine advertisement youve played your game and won ittake what comfort you can out of the confession if you will agree to cancel this notorious contract of yours ill settle it with the companyand ill put murray through collegeand you too if you want to go something will have to be done with you thats certain is this satisfactory  perfectly i said promptly if you will add thereto your promise that you will forget and forgive uncle abimelech there are to be no hard feelings  uncle abimelech shrugged his shoulders  in for a penny in for a pound he said very well prue we wipe off all scores and begin afresh but there must be no more such doings youve worked your little scheme throughtrust a foster for that but in future youve got to remember that in law youre a melville whatever you are in fact  i nodded dutifully ill remember uncle abimelech i promised  after everything had been arranged and uncle abimelech had gone i looked at murray well i said  murray twinkled youve accomplished the impossible sis but as uncle abimelech intimateddont you try it again     a sandshore wooing                                          fir cottage plover sands                                                       july sixth  we arrived here late last night and all day aunt martha has kept her room to rest so i had to keep mine also although i felt as fresh as a morning lark and just in the mood for enjoyment  my name is marguerite forresteran absurdly long name for so small a girl aunt martha always calls me marguerite with an accent of strong disapproval she does not like my name but she gives me the full benefit of it connie shelmardine used to call me rita connie was my roommate last year at the seminary we correspond occasionally but aunt martha frowns on it  i have always lived with aunt marthamy parents died when i was a baby aunt martha says i am to be her heiress if i please herwhich meansbut oh you do not know what pleasing aunt martha means  aunt is a determined and inveterate manhater she has no particular love for women indeed and trusts nobody but mrs saxby her maid i rather like mrs saxby she is not quite so far gone in petrifaction as aunt although she gets a little stonier every year i expect the process will soon begin on me but it hasnt yet my flesh and blood are still unreasonably warm and pulsing and rebellious  aunt martha would be in danger of taking a fit if she ever saw me talking to a man she watches me jealously firmly determined to guard me from any possible attack of a roaring and ravening lion in the disguise of nineteenthcentury masculine attire so i have to walk demurely and assume a virtue if i have it not while i pine after the untested fleshpots of egypt in secret  we have come down to spend a few weeks at fir cottage our good landlady is a capacious kindlysouled creature and i think she has rather a liking for me i have been chattering to her all day for there are times when i absolutely must talk to someone or go mad                                                         july tenth   this sort of life is decidedly dull the program of every day is the same i go to the sandshore with aunt martha and mrs saxby in the morning read to aunt in the afternoons and mope around by my disconsolate self in the evenings mrs blake has lent me for shore use a very fine spyglass which she owns she says her man brought it home from furrin parts before he died while aunt and mrs saxby meander up and down the shore leaving me free to a certain extent i amuse myself by examining distant seas and coasts through it thus getting a few peeps into a forbidden world we see few people although there is a large summer hotel about a mile up the beach our shore haunts do not seem to be popular with its guests they prefer the rocks this suits aunt martha admirably i may also add that it doesnt suit her niecebut that is a matter of small importance  the first morning i noticed a white object on the rocks about half a mile away and turned my glass on it thereapparently within a stones throw of mewas a young man he was lounging on a rock looking dreamily out to sea there was something about his face that reminded me of someone i know but i cannot remember whom  every morning he has reappeared on the same spot he seems to be a solitary individual given to prowling by himself i wonder what aunt would say if she knew what i am so earnestly watching through my glass at times                                                      july eleventh  i shall have to cease looking at the unknown i am afraid  this morning i turned my glass as usual on his pet haunt i nearly fell over in my astonishment for he was also looking through a spyglass straight at me too it seemed how foolish i felt and yet my curiosity was so strong that a few minutes afterward i peeped back again just to see what he was doing then he coolly laid down his glass rose lifted his cap and bowed politely to meor at least in my direction i dropped my glass and smiled in a mixture of dismay and amusement then i remembered that he was probably watching me again and might imagine my smile was meant for him i banished it immediately shut my glass up and did not touch it again soon after we came home                                                       july twelfth  something has happened at last today i went to the shore as usual fully resolved not even to glance in the forbidden direction but in the end i had to take a peep and saw him on the rocks with his glass levelled at me when he saw that i was looking he laid down the glass held up his hands and began to spell out something in the deafmute alphabet now i know that same alphabet connie taught it to me last year so that we might hold communication across the schoolroom i gave one frantic glance at aunt marthas rigid back and then watched him while he deftly spelled i am francis shelmardine are you not miss forrester my sisters friend  francis shelmardine now i knew whom he resembled and have i not heard endless dissertations from connie on this wonderful brother of hers francis the clever the handsome the charming until he has become the only hero of dreams i have ever had it was too wonderful i could only stare dazedly back through my glass  may we know each other he went on may i come over and introduce myself right hand yes left no  i gasped suppose he were to come what would happen i waved my left hand sorrowfully he looked quite crestfallen and disappointed as he spelled out why not would your friends disapprove  i signalled yes  are you displeased at my boldness was his next question  where had all aunt marthas precepts flown to then i blush to record that i lifted my left hand shyly and had just time to catch his pleased expression when aunt martha came up and said it was time to go home so i picked myself meekly up shook the sand from my dress and followed my good aunt dutifully home                                                    july thirteenth  when we went to the shore this morning i had to wait in spasms of remorse and anxiety until aunt got tired of reading and set off along the shore with mrs saxby then i reached for my glass  mr shelmardine and i had quite a conversation under the circumstances there could be no useless circumlocution in our exchange of ideas it was religiously boiled down and ran something like this  you are not displeased with me  nobut i should be  why  it is wrong to deceive aunt  i am quite respectable  that is not the question  cannot her prejudices be overcome  absolutely no  mrs allardyce who is staying at the hotel knows her well shall i bring her over to vouch for my character  it would not do a bit of good  then it is hopeless  yes  would you object to knowing me on your own account  no  do you ever come to the shore alone  no aunt would not permit me  must she know  yes i would not come without her permission  you will not refuse to chat with me thus now and then  i dont know perhaps not  i had to go home then as we went mrs saxby complimented me on my good colour aunt martha looked her disapproval if i were really ill aunt would spend her last cent in my behalf but she would be just as well pleased to see me properly pale and subdued at all times and not looking as if i were too well contented in this vale of tears                                                   july seventeenth  i have talked a good deal with mr shelmardine these past four days he is to be at the beach for some weeks longer this morning he signalled across from the rocks i mean to see you at last tomorrow i will walk over and pass you  you must not aunt will suspect  no danger dont be alarmed i will do nothing rash  i suppose he will he seems to be very determined of course i cannot prevent him from promenading on our beach all day if he chooses but then if he did aunt would speedily leave him in sole possession of it  i wonder what i had better wear tomorrow                                                    july nineteenth  yesterday morning aunt martha was serene and unsuspicious it is dreadful of me to be deceiving her and i do feel guilty i sat down on the sand and pretended to read the memoirs of a missionaryaunt likes cheerful books like thatin an agony of anticipation presently aunt said majestically marguerite there is a man coming this way we will move further down  and we moved poor aunt  mr shelmardine came bravely on i felt my heart beating to my very finger tips he halted by the fragment of an old stranded boat aunt had turned her back on him  i ventured on a look he lifted his hat with a twinkle in his eye just then aunt said icily we will go home marguerite that creature evidently intends to persist in his intrusion  home we came accordingly  this morning he signalled across letter from connie message for you i mean to deliver it personally do you ever go to church  now i do go regularly to church at home but aunt martha and mrs saxby are both such rigid church people that they would not darken the doors of the methodist church at plover sands for any consideration needless to say i am not allowed to go either but it was impossible to make this long explanation so i merely replied not here  will you not go tomorrow morning  aunt will not let me  coax her  coaxing never has any effect on her  would she relent if mrs allardyce were to call for you  now i have been cautiously sounding aunt about mrs allardyce and i have discovered that she disapproves of her so i said it would be useless i will ask aunt if i may go but i feel almost sure that she will not consent  this evening when aunt was in an unusually genial mood i plucked up heart of grace and asked her  marguerite she said impressively you know that i do not attend church here  but aunt i persisted quakingly couldnt i go alone it is not very farand i will be very careful  aunt merely gave me a look that said about forty distinct and separate things and i was turning away in despair when mrs saxbybless her heartsaid i really think it would be no harm to let the child go  as aunt attaches great importance to mrs saxbys opinion she looked at me relentingly and said well i will think it over and let you know in the morning marguerite  now everything depends on the sort of humour aunt is in in the morning                                                     july twentieth  this morning was perfect and after breakfast aunt said condescendingly i think you may attend church if you wish marguerite remember that i expect you to conduct yourself with becoming prudence and modesty  i flew upstairs and pulled my prettiest dress out of my trunk it is a delicate shimmering grey stuff with pearly tints about it every time i get anything new aunt martha and i have a battle royal over it i verily believe that aunt would like me to dress in the fashions in vogue in her youth there is always a certain flavour of oldfashionedness about my gowns and hats connie used to say that it was delicious and gave me a piquant uniquenessa certain unlikeness to other people that possessed a positive charm that is only connies view of it however  but i had had my own way about this dress and it is really very becoming i wore a little silverygrey chip hat trimmed with pale pink flowers and i pinned at my belt the sweetest cluster of oldfashioned blush rosebuds from the garden then i borrowed a hymn book from mrs blake and ran down to undergo aunt marthas scrutiny  dear me child she said discontentedly you have gotten yourself up very frivolously it seems to me  why aunty i protested im all in greyevery bit  aunt martha sniffed you dont know how much aunt can express in a sniff but i tripped to church like a bird  the first person i saw there was mr shelmardine he was sitting right across from me and a smile glimmered in his eyes i did not look at him again through the service i was subdued enough to have satisfied even aunt martha  when church came out he waited for me at the entrance to his pew i pretended not to see him until he said good morning in a voice vibrating and deep which sounded as though it might become infinitely tender if its owner chose when we went down the steps he took my hymnal and we walked up the long bowery country road  thank you so much for coming today he saidas if i went to oblige him  i had a hard time to get aunt marthas consent i declared frankly i wouldnt have succeeded if mrs saxby hadnt taken my part  heaven bless mrs saxby he remarked fervently but is there any known way of overcoming your aunts scruples if so i am ready to risk it  there is none aunt martha is very good and kind to me but she will never stop trying to bring me up the process will be going on when i am fifty and she hates men i dont know what she would do if she saw me now  mr shelmardine frowned and switched the unoffending daisies viciously with his cane  then there is no hope of my seeing you openly and aboveboard  not at present i said faintly  after a brief silence we began to talk of other things he told me how he happened to see me first  i was curious to know who the people were who were always in the same place at the same time so one day i took my telescope i could see you plainly you were reading and had your hat off when i went back to the hotel i asked mrs allardyce if she knew who the boarders at fir cottage were and she told me i had heard connie speak of you and i determined to make your acquaintance  when we reached the lane i held out my hand for the hymnal  you mustnt come any further mr shelmardine i said hurriedly auntaunt might see you  he took my hand and held it looking at me seriously  suppose i were to walk up to the cottage tomorrow and ask for you  i gasped he looked so capable of doing anything he took it into his head to do  oh you wouldnt i said piteously aunt martha wouldyou are not in earnest  i suppose not he said regretfully of course i would not do anything that would cause you unpleasantness but this must notshall not be our last meeting  aunt will not let me come to church again i said  does she ever take a nap in the afternoon he queried  i wriggled my parasol about in the dust uneasily  sometimes  i shall be at the old boat tomorrow afternoon at twothirty he said  i pulled my hand away  i couldntyou know i couldnt i criedand then i blushed to my ears  are you sure you couldnt bending a little nearer  quite sure i murmured  he surrendered my hymnal at last  will you give me a rose  i unpinned the whole cluster and handed it to him he lifted it until it touched his lips as for me i scuttled up the lane in the most undignified fashion at the turn i looked back he was still standing there with his hat off                                                 july twentyfourth  on monday afternoon i slipped away to the shore while aunt martha and mrs saxby were taking their regular nap and i was supposed to be reading sermons in my room  mr shelmardine was leaning against the old boat but he came swiftly across the sand to meet me  this is very kind of you he said  i ought not to have come i said repentantly but it is so lonely thereand one cant be interested in sermons and memoirs all the time  mr shelmardine laughed  mr and mrs allardyce are on the other side of the boat will you come and meet them  how nice of him to bring them i knew i should like mrs allardyce just because aunt martha didnt we had a delightful stroll i never thought of the time until mr shelmardine said it was four oclock  oh is it so late as that i cried i must go at once  im sorry we have kept you so long remarked mr shelmardine in a tone of concern if she should be awake what will the consequences be  too terrible to think of i answered seriously im sorry mr shelmardine but you mustnt come any further  we will be here tomorrow afternoon he said  mr shelmardine i protested i wish you wouldnt put such ideas into my head they wont come outno not if i read a whole volume of sermons right through  we looked at each other for a second then he began to smile and we both went off into a peal of laughter  at least let me know if miss fiske rampages he called after me as i fled  but aunt martha was not awakeand i have been to the shore three afternoons since then i was there today and im going tomorrow for a boat sail with mr shelmardine and the allardyces but i am afraid the former will do something rash soon this afternoon he said i dont think i can stand this much longer  stand what i asked  you know very well he answered recklessly meeting you in this clandestine manner and thereby causing that poor little conscience of yours such misery if your aunt were not sounreasonable i should never have stooped to it  it is all my fault i said contritely  well i hardly meant that he said grimly but hadnt i better go frankly to your aunt and lay the whole case before her  you would never see me again if you did that i said hastilyand then wished i hadnt  that is the worst threat you could make he said                                                  july twentyfifth  it is all over and i am the most miserable girl in the world of course this means that aunt martha has discovered everything and the deserved punishment of my sins has overtaken me  i slipped away again this afternoon and went for that boat sail we had a lovely time but were rather late getting in and i hurried home with many misgivings aunt martha met me at the door  my dress was draggled my hat had slipped back and the kinks and curls of my obstreperous hair were something awful i know i looked very disreputable and also no doubt very guilty and consciencestricken aunt gave me an unutterable look and then followed me up to my room in grim silence  marguerite what does this mean  i have lots of faults but untruthfulness isnt one of them i confessed everythingat least almost everything i didnt tell about the telescopes and deafmute alphabet and aunt was too horrorstricken to think of asking how i first made mr shelmardines acquaintance she listened in stony silence i had expected a terrible scolding but i suppose my crimes simply seemed to her too enormous for words  when i had sobbed out my last word she rose swept me one glance of withering contempt and left the room presently mrs saxby came up looking concerned  my dear child what have you been doing your aunt says that we are to go home on the afternoon train tomorrow she is terribly upset  i just curled up on the bed and cried while mrs saxby packed my trunk i will have no chance to explain matters to mr shelmardine and i will never see him again for aunt is quite capable of whisking me off to africa he will just think me a featherbrained flirt oh i am so unhappy                                                  july twentysixth  i am the happiest girl in the world that is quite a different strain from yesterday we leave fir cottage in an hour but that doesnt matter now  i did not sleep a wink last night and crawled miserably down to breakfast aunt took not the slightest notice of me but to my surprise she told mrs saxby that she intended taking a farewell walk to the shore i knew i would be taken too to be kept out of mischief and my heart gave a great bound of hope perhaps i would have a chance to send word to francis since aunt did not know of the part my spyglass had played in my bad behaviour  i meekly followed my grim guardians to the shore and sat dejectedly on my rug while they paced the sand francis was on the rocks as soon as aunt martha and mrs saxby were at a safe distance i began my message all discovered aunt is very angry we go home today  then i snatched my glass his face expressed the direst consternation and dismay he signalled i must see you before you go  impossible aunt will never forgive me goodbye  i saw a look of desperate determination cross his face if forty aunt marthas had swooped down upon me i could not have torn my eyes from that glass  i love you you know it do you care for me i must have my answer now  what a situation no time or chance for any maidenly hesitation or softening aureole of words aunt and mrs saxby had almost reached the point where they invariably turned i had barely time to spell out a plain blunt yes and read his answer  i shall go home at once get mother and connie follow you and demand possession of my property i shall win the day have no fear till then goodbye my darling  marguerite said mrs saxby at my elbow it is time to go  i got up obediently aunt martha was as grim and uncompromising as ever and mrs saxby looked like a chief mourner but do you suppose i cared i dropped behind them just once before we left the shore i knew he was watching me and i waved my hand  i suppose i am really engaged to francis shelmardine but was there ever such a funny wooing and what will aunt martha say     after many days   the square bare front room of the baxter station hotelso called because there was no other house in the place to dispute the titlewas filled with men some of them were putting up at the hotel while they worked at the new branch line and some of them had dropped in to exchange news and banter while waiting for the mail train  gabe foley the proprietor was playing at checkers with one of the railroad men but was not too deeply absorbed in the game to take in all that was said around him the air was dim with tobacco smoke and the brilliant scarlet geraniums which mrs foley kept in the bay window looked oddly out of place gabe knew all those present except one mana stranger who had landed at baxter station from the afternoon freight foleys hotel did not boast of a register and the stranger did not volunteer any information regarding his name or business he had put in the afternoon and early evening strolling about the village and talking to the men on the branch line now he had come in and ensconced himself in the corner behind the stove where he preserved a complete silence  he had a rather rough face and was flashily dressed altogether gabe hardly liked his looks put as long as a man paid his bill and did not stir up a row gabe foley did not interfere with him  three or four farmers from out greenvale way were drawn up by the stove discussing the cheese factory sales and various greenvale happenings the stranger appeared to be listening to them intently although he took no part in their conversation  presently he brought his tilted chair down with a sharp thud gabe foley had paused in his manipulation of a king to hurl a question at the greenvale men  is it true that old man strong is to be turned out next week  true enough answered william jeffers joe moore is going to foreclose stephen strong has got three years behind with the interest and moore is out of patience it seems hard on old stephen but moore aint the man to hesitate for that hell have his own out of it  what will the strongs do asked gabe  thats the question everyone in greenvale is asking lizzie strong has always been a delicate little girl but maybe shell manage to scare up a living old stephen is to be the most pitied i dont see anything for him but the poorhouse  how did stephen strong come to get into such a tight place the stranger asked suddenly when i was in these parts a good many years ago he was considered a welltodo man  well so he was replied william jeffers but he began to get in debt when his wife took sick he spent no end of money on doctors and medicines for her and then he seemed to have a streak of bad luck besidescrops failed and cows died and all that sort of thing hes been going behind ever since he kind of lost heart when his wife died and now moore is going to foreclose its my opinion poor old stephen wont live any time if hes turned out of his home  do you know what the mortgage comes to  near three thousand counting overdue interest  well im sorry for old stephen said gabe returning to his game if anybody deserves a peaceful old age he does hes helped more people than you could count and he was the best christian in greenvale or out of it  he was too good said a greenvale man crustily he just let himself be imposed upon all his life theres dozens of people owes him and hes never asked for a cent from them and hes always had some shiftless critter or other hanging round and devouring his substance  dye mind that ben butler who used to be in greenvale twenty years ago asked a third man if ever there was an imp of satan twas himold ezra butlers son from the valley old stephen kept him for three or four years and was as good to him as if hed been his own son  most people out our way do mind ben butler returned william jeffers grimly even if he aint been heard tell of for twenty years he wasnt the kind you could forget in a hurry whered he go out to the kootenay wasnt it  somewhere there he was a reglar young villainup to every kind of mischief old stephen caught him stealing his oats one time and stead of giving him a taste of jail for it as he ought to have done he just took him right into his family and kept him there for three years i used to tell him hed be sorry for it but he always persisted that ben wasnt bad at heart and would come out all right some day no matter what the young varmint did old stephen would make excuses for himhis ma was dead or he hadnt had no bringingup i was thankful when he did finally clear out without doing some penitentiary work  if poor old stephen hadnt been so openhanded to every unfortunate critter he came across said gabe hed have had more for himself today  the whistle of the mail train cut short the discussion of stephen strongs case in a minute the room was vacant except for the stranger when left to himself he also rose and walked out turning away from the station he struck briskly into the greenvale road  about three miles from the station he halted before a house built close to the road it was oldfashioned but large and comfortablelooking with big barns in the rear and an orchard on the left slope the house itself was in the shadow of the firs but the yard lay out in the moonlight and the strange visitor did not elect to cross it instead he turned aside into the shadow of the trees around the garden and leaning against the old rail fence gave himself up to contemplation of some kind  there was a light in the kitchen the windowblind was not down and he had a fairly good view of the room the only visible occupant was a greyhaired old man sitting by the table reading from a large open volume before him the stranger whistled softly  thats old stephenreading the bible same as ever by all thats holy he hasnt changed much except that hes got mighty grey he must be close on to seventy its a shame to turn an old man like him out of house and home but joe moore always was a genuine skinflint  he drew himself softly up and sat on the fence he saw old stephen strong close his book place his spectacles on it and kneel down by his chair the old man remained on his knees for some time and then taking up his candle left the kitchen the man on the fence still sat there truth to tell he was chuckling to himself as he recalled all the mischief he had done in the old daysthe doubtful jokes tricks and escapades he had gone through with  he could not help remembering at the same time how patient old stephen strong had always been with him he recalled the time he had been caught stealing the oats how frightened and sullen he had been and how gently the old man had talked to him and pointed out the sin of which he had been guilty  he had never stolen again but in other respects he had not mended his ways much behind old stephens back he laughed at him and his preaching but stephen strong had never lost faith in him he had always asserted mildly that ben would come out all right by and by ben butler remembered this too as he sat on the fence  he had always liked old stephen he told himself he was sorry he had fallen on such evil times  preaching and praying dont seem to have brought him out clear after all he said with a chuckle that quickly died away somehow even in his worst days ben butler had never felt easy when he mocked old stephen three thousand dollars i could do it but i reckon id be a blamed fool i aint agoing to do it three thousand aint picked up every day even in the kootenayspecially by chaps like me  he patted his pocket knowingly fifteen years previously he had gone to the kootenay district with visions of making a fortune that were quickly dispelled by reality he had squandered his wages as soon as paid and it was only of late years that he had pulled up a bit as he expressed it and saved his three thousand dollars  he had brought the money home with him having some vague notion of buying a farm and settling down to do the respectable but he had already given up the idea this country was too blamed quiet for him he said he would go back to the kootenay and he knew what he would do with his money jake perkins and wade brown two pals of his were running a flourishing grocery and saloon combined they would be glad of another partner with some cash it would suit him to a t  ill clear out tomorrow he mused as he walked back as long as i stay here old stephen will haunt me sure as fate wonder what he was praying for tonight he always used to say the lord would provide but he dont appear to have done it well i aint his deputy  the next afternoon ben butler went over to greenvale and called at stephen strongs he found only the old man at home old stephen did not recognize him at first but made him heartily welcome when he did  ben i do declare ben butler how are you how are you sit down benhere take this chair where on earth did you come from  baxter just nowkootenay on the large scale answered ben thought id come over and see you again didnt expect youd remember me at all  remember you why of course i do i havent ever forgot you ben manys the time ive wondered where you was and how you was getting on and you tell me youve been in the kootenay well well you have seen a good bit more of the world than i ever have youve changed a lot ben you aint a boy no longer dye mind all the pranks you used to play  ben laughed sheepishly  i reckon i do but it aint myself i come here to talk aboutnot much to say if i did its just been up and down with me how are you yourself sir they were telling me over at baxter that you were kind of in trouble  the old mans face clouded over all the sparkle went out of his kind blue eyes  yes ben yes he said with a heavy sigh ive kind of gone downhill thats a fact the old farm has to go benim sorry for thatid have liked to have ended my days here but its not to be i dont want to complain the lord does all things well i havent a doubt but that it all fits into his wise purposesnot a doubt ben although it may be kind of hard to see it  ben was always skittish of pious talk he veered around adroitly  i dunno as the lord has had much to do with this sir seems to me as if twas the other one as was running it with joe moore for deputy the main thing as i look at it is to get a cinch on him how much does the mortgage amount to sir  about three thousand dollars interest and all  old stephens voice trembled the future looked very dark to him in his old age  ben put his hand inside his coat and brought out a brandnew plump pocketbook he opened it laid it on his knee and counted out a number of crisp notes  here sir he said pushing them along the table i reckon thatll keep you out of joe moores clutches theres three thousand there if i aint made a mistake thatll set you clear wont it  ben old stephens voice trembled with amazement ben i cant take it it wouldnt be fairor right i could never pay you back  ben slipped the rubber band around his wallet and replaced it airily  i dont want it paid back sir its a little gift so to speak just to let you know i aint ungrateful for all you did for me if it hadnt been for you i might have been in the penitentiary by now as for the money it may seem a pile to you but we dont think anything more of a thousand or so in the kootenay than you greenvale folks do of a fivernot a bit more we do things on a big scale out there  but ben are you sure you can afford itthat you wont miss it  pop sure dont you worry im all right  bless youbless you the tears were running down old stephens face as he gathered up the money with a shaking hand i always knew you would do well benalways said it i knew youd a good heart i just cant realize this yetit seems too good to be true the old place savedi can die in peace of course ill pay you back some of it anyhow if im spared a while longer bless you ben  ben would not stay long after that he said he had to leave on the 430 train he was relieved when he got away from the old mans thanks and questions ben did not find it easy to answer some of the latter when he was out of sight of the house he sat on a fence and counted up his remaining funds  just enough to take me back to the kootenayand then begin over again i spose but twas worth the money to see the old fellows face hed thank the lord and me he said how jake and waded roar to hear them two names in partnership but im going to pull up a bit after this see if i dont just to justify the old mans faith in me twould be too bad to disappoint him if hes believed for so long that i was going to turn out all right yet  when the 430 train went out ben butler stood on the rear platform gabe foley watched him abstractedly as he receded  blamed if i know who that fellow was he remarked to a crony he never told his name but seems to me ive seen him before he has a kind of hangdog look i think but he paid up square and it is none of my business     an unconventional confidence   the girl in blackandyellow ran frantically down the grey road under the pines there was nobody to see her but she would have run if all halifax had been looking on for had she not on the loveliest new hata creation in yellow chiffon with big black chouxand a dress to match and was there not a shower coming straight from the hills across the harbour  down at the end of the long resinous avenue the girl saw the shore road with the pavilion shutting out the view of the harbours mouth below the pavilion cleanshaven georges island guarded the town like a sturdy bulldog and beyond it were the wooded hills already lost in a mist of rain  oh i shall be too late moaned the girl but she held her hat steady with one hand and ran on if she could only reach the pavilion in time it was a neckandneck race between the rain and the girl but the girl won just as she flew out upon the shore road a tall young man came pelting down the latter and they both dashed up the steps of the pavilion together as the rain swooped down upon them and blotted georges island and the smoky town and the purple banks of the eastern passage from view  the pavilion was small at the best of times and just now the rain was beating into it on two sides leaving only one dry corner into this the girl moved she was flushed and triumphant the young man thought that in all his life he had never seen anyone so pretty  im so glad i didnt get my hat wet said the girl breathlessly as she straightened it with a careful hand and wondered if she looked very blown and blowsy  it would have been a pity admitted the young man it is a very pretty hat  pretty the girl looked the scorn her voice expressed anyone can have a pretty hat our cook has one this is a creation  of course said the young man humbly i ought to have known but i am very stupid  well i suppose a mere man couldnt be expected to understand exactly said the girl graciously  she smiled at him in a friendly fashion and he smiled back the girl thought that she had never seen such lovely brown eyes before he could not be a haligonian she was sure she knew all the nice young men with brown eyes in halifax  please sit down she said plaintively im tired  the young man smiled again at the idea of his sitting down because the girl was tired but he sat down and so did she on the only dry seat to be found  goodness knows how long this rain will last said the girl making herself comfortable and picturesque but i shall stay here until it clears up if it rains for a week i will not have my hat spoiled i suppose i shouldnt have put it on beatrix said it was going to rain beatrix is such a horribly good prophet i detest people who are good prophets dont you  i think that they are responsible for all the evils that they predict said the young man solemnly  that is just what i told beatrix and i was determined to put on this hat and come out to the park today i simply had to be alone and i knew id be alone out here everybody else would be at the football game by the way why arent you there  i wasnt even aware that there was a football game on hand said the young man as if he knew he ought to be ashamed of his ignorance and was  dear me said the girl pityingly where can you have been not to have heard of it its between the dalhousie team and the wanderers almost everybody here is on the wanderers side because they are haligonians but i am not i like the college boys best beatrix says that it is just because of my innate contrariness last year i simply screamed myself hoarse with enthusiasm the dalhousie team won the trophy  if you are so interested in the game it is a wonder you didnt go to see it yourself said the young man boldly  well i just couldnt said the girl with a sigh if anybody had ever told me that there would be a football game in halifax and that i would elect to prowl about by myself in the park instead of going to it id have laughed them to scorn even beatrix would never have dared to prophesy that but you see it has happened i was too crumpled up in my mind to care about football today i had to come here and have it out with myself that is why i put on my hat i thought perhaps i might get through with my mental gymnastics in time to go to the game afterwards but i didnt it is just maddening too i got this hat and dress on purpose to wear to it theyre black and yellow you seethe dalhousie colours it was my own idea i was sure it would make a sensation but i couldnt go to the game and take any interest in it feeling as i do could i now  the young man said of course she couldnt it was utterly out of the question  the girl smiled without a smile she was charming with a smile she was adorable  i like to have my opinions bolstered up do you know i want to tell you something may i  you may ill never tell anyone as long as i live said the young man solemnly  i dont know you and you dont know me that is why i want to tell you about it i must tell somebody and if i told anybody i knew theyd tell it all over halifax it is dreadful to be talking to you like this beatrix would have three fits one after the other if she saw me but beatrix is a slave to conventionality i glory in discarding it at times you dont mind do you  not at all said the young man sincerely  the girl sighed  i have reached that point where i must have a confidant or go crazy once i could tell things to beatrix that was before she got engaged now she tells everything to him there is no earthly way of preventing her ive tried them all so nowadays when i get into trouble i tell it out loud to myself in the glass its a relief you know but that is no good now i want to tell it to somebody who can say things back will you promise to say things back  the young man assured her that he would when the proper time came  very well but please dont look at me while im telling you ill be sure to blush in places when beatrix wants to be particularly aggravating she says i have lost the art of blushing but that is only her way of putting it you know sometimes i blush dreadfully  the young man dragged his eyes from the face under the blackandyellow hat and fastened them on a crooked pine tree that hung out over the bank  well began the girl the root of the whole trouble is simply this there is a young man in england i always think of him as the creature he is the son of a man who was fathers especial crony in boyhood before father emigrated to canada worse than that he comes of a family which has contracted a vile habit of marrying into our family it has come down through the ages so long that it has become chronic father left most of his musty traditions in england but he brought this pet one with him he and this friend agreed that the latters son should marry one of fathers daughters it ought to have been beatrixshe is the oldest but beatrix had a pug nose so father settled on me from my earliest recollection i have been given to understand that just as soon as i grew up there would be a readymade husband imported from england for me i was doomed to it from my cradle now said the girl with a tragic gesture i ask you could anything be more hopelessly appallingly stupid and devoid of romance than that  the young man shook his head but did not look at her  its pretty bad he admitted  you see said the girl pathetically the shadow of it has been over my whole life of course when i was a very little girl i didnt mind it so much it was such a long way off and lots of things might happen the creature might run away with some other girlor i might have the smallpoxor beatrixs nose might be straight when she grew up and if beatrixs nose were straight shed be a great deal prettier than i am but nothing did happenand her nose is puggier than ever then when i grew up things were horrid i never could have a single little bit of fun and beatrix had such a good time she had scores of lovers in spite of her nose to be sure shes engaged nowand hes a horrid faddy little creature but he is her own choice she wasnt told that there was a man in england whom she must marry by and by when he got sufficiently reconciled to the idea to come and ask her oh it makes me furious  isis thereanyone else asked the young man hesitatingly  oh dear no how could there be why you know i couldnt have the tiniest flirtation with another man when i was as good as engaged to the creature that is one of my grievances just think how much fun ive missed i used to rage to beatrix about it but she would tell me that i ought to be thankful to have the chance of making such a good matchthe creature is rich you know and clever as if i cared how clever or rich he is beatrix made me so cross that i gave up saying anything and sulked by myself so they think im quite reconciled to it but im not  he might be very nice after all suggested the young man  nice that isnt the point oh dont you see but no youre a manyou cant understand you must just take my word for it the whole thing makes me furious but i havent told you the worst the creature is on his way out to canada now he may arrive here at any minute and they are all so aggravatingly delighted over it  what do you suppose he feels like asked the young man reflectively  well said the girl frankly ive been too much taken up with my own feelings to worry about his but i daresay they are pretty much like mine he must loathe and detest the very thought of me  oh i dont think he does said the young man gravely  dont you well what do you suppose he does think of it all you ought to understand the mans part of it better than i can  theres as much difference in men as in women said the young man in an impersonal tone i may be right or wrong you see but i imagine he would feel something like this from boyhood he has understood that away out in canada there is a little girl growing up who is some day to be his wife she becomes his boyish ideal of all that is good and true he pictures her as beautiful and winsome and sweet she is his hearts lady and the thought of her abides with him as a safeguard and an inspiration for her sake he resolves to make the most of himself and live a clean loyal life when she comes to him she must find his heart fit to receive her there is never a time in all his life when the dream of her does not gleam before him as of a star to which he may aspire with all reverence and love  the young man stopped abruptly and looked at the girl she bent forward with shining eyes and touched his hand  you are splendid she said softly if he thought sobut noi am sure he doesnt hes just coming out here like a martyr going to the stake he knows he will be expected to propose to me when he gets here and he knows that i know it too and he knows and i know that i will be expected to say my very prettiest yes  but are you going to say it asked the young man anxiously  the girl leaned forward no that is my secret i am going to say a most emphatic no  but wont your family make an awful row  of course but i rather enjoy a row now and then it stirs up ones grey matter so nicely i came out here this afternoon and thought the whole affair over from beginning to end and i have determined to say no  oh i wouldnt make it so irreconcilable as that said the young man lightly id leave a loophole of escape you see if you were to like him a little better than you expect it would be awkward to have committed yourself by a rash vow to saying no wouldnt it  i suppose it would said the girl thoughtfully but then you know i wont change my mind  its just as well to be on the safe side said the young man  the girl got up the rain was over and the sun was coming out through the mists  perhaps you are right she said so ill just resolve that i will say no if i dont want to say yes that really amounts to the same thing you know thank you so much for letting me tell you all about it it must have bored you terribly but it has done me so much good i feel quite calm and rational now and can go home and behave myself goodbye  goodbye said the young man gravely he stood on the pavilion and watched the girl out of sight beyond the pines  when the girl got home she was told that the dalhousie team had won the game eight to four the girl dragged her hat off and waved it joyously  what a shame i wasnt there theyd have gone mad over my dress  but the next item of information crushed her the creature had arrived he had called that afternoon and was coming to dinner that night  how fortunate said the girl as she went to her room that i relieved my mind to that young man out in the park today if i had come back with all that pentup feeling seething within me and heard this news right on top of it all i might have flown into a thousand pieces what lovely brown eyes he had i do dote on brown eyes the creature will be sure to have fishy blue ones                                       when the girl went down to meet the creature she found herself confronted by the young man for the first last and only time in her life the girl had not a word to say but her family thought her confusion very natural and pretty they really had not expected her to behave so well as for the young man his manner was flawless  toward the end of the dinner when the girl was beginning to recover herself he turned to her  you know i promised never to tell he said  be sure you dont then said the girl meekly  but arent you glad you left the loophole he persisted  the girl smiled down into her lap  perhaps she said     aunt cyrillas christmas basket   when lucy rose met aunt cyrilla coming downstairs somewhat flushed and breathless from her ascent to the garret with a big flatcovered basket hanging over her plump arm she gave a little sigh of despair lucy rose had done her brave best for some yearsin fact ever since she had put up her hair and lengthened her skirtsto break aunt cyrilla of the habit of carrying that basket with her every time she went to pembroke but aunt cyrilla still insisted on taking it and only laughed at what she called lucy roses finicky notions lucy rose had a horrible haunting idea that it was extremely provincial for her aunt always to take the big basket packed full of country good things whenever she went to visit edward and geraldine geraldine was so stylish and might think it queer and then aunt cyrilla always would carry it on her arm and give cookies and apples and molasses taffy out of it to every child she encountered and just as often as not to older folks too lucy rose when she went to town with aunt cyrilla felt chagrined over thisall of which goes to prove that lucy was as yet very young and had a great deal to learn in this world  that troublesome worry over what geraldine would think nerved her to make a protest in this instance  now aunt crilla she pleaded youre surely not going to take that funny old basket to pembroke this timechristmas day and all  deed and deed i am returned aunt cyrilla briskly as she put it on the table and proceeded to dust it out i never went to see edward and geraldine since they were married that i didnt take a basket of good things along with me for them and im not going to stop now as for its being christmas all the more reason edward is always real glad to get some of the old farmhouse goodies he says they beat city cooking all hollow and so they do  but its so countrified moaned lucy rose  well i am countrified said aunt cyrilla firmly and so are you and whats more i dont see that its anything to be ashamed of youve got some real silly pride about you lucy rose youll grow out of it in time but just now it is giving you a lot of trouble  the basket is a lot of trouble said lucy rose crossly youre always mislaying it or afraid you will and it does look so funny to be walking through the streets with that big bulgy basket hanging on your arm  im not a mite worried about its looks returned aunt cyrilla calmly as for its being a trouble why maybe it is but i have that and other people have the pleasure of it edward and geraldine dont need iti know thatbut there may be those that will and if it hurts your feelings to walk longside of a countrified old lady with a countrified basket why you can just fall behind as it were  aunt cyrilla nodded and smiled goodhumouredly and lucy rose though she privately held to her own opinion had to smile too  now let me see said aunt cyrilla reflectively tapping the snowy kitchen table with the point of her plump dimpled forefinger what shall i take that big fruit cake for one thingedward does like my fruit cake and that cold boiled tongue for another those three mince pies too theyd spoil before we got back or your uncled make himself sick eating themmince pie is his besetting sin and that little stone bottle full of creamgeraldine may carry any amount of style but ive yet to see her look down on real good country cream lucy rose and another bottle of my raspberry vinegar that plate of jelly cookies and doughnuts will please the children and fill up the chinks and you can bring me that box of icecream candy out of the pantry and that bag of striped candy sticks your uncle brought home from the corner last night and apples of coursethree or four dozen of those good eatersand a little pot of my greengage preservesedwardll like that and some sandwiches and pound cake for a snack for ourselves now i guess that will do for eatables the presents for the children can go in on top theres a doll for daisy and the little boat your uncle made for ray and a tatted lace handkerchief apiece for the twins and the crochet hood for the baby now is that all  theres a cold roast chicken in the pantry said lucy rose wickedly and the pig uncle leo killed is hanging up in the porch couldnt you put them in too  aunt cyrilla smiled broadly well i guess well leave the pig alone but since you have reminded me of it the chicken may as well go in i can make room  lucy rose in spite of her prejudices helped with the packing and not having been trained under aunt cyrillas eye for nothing did it very well too with much clever economy of space but when aunt cyrilla had put in as a finishing touch a big bouquet of pink and white everlastings and tied the bulging covers down with a firm hand lucy rose stood over the basket and whispered vindictively  some day im going to burn this basketwhen i get courage enough then therell be an end of lugging it everywhere we go like alike an old marketwoman  uncle leopold came in just then shaking his head dubiously he was not going to spend christmas with edward and geraldine and perhaps the prospect of having to cook and eat his christmas dinner all alone made him pessimistic  i mistrust you folks wont get to pembroke tomorrow he said sagely its going to storm  aunt cyrilla did not worry over this she believed matters of this kind were foreordained and she slept calmly but lucy rose got up three times in the night to see if it were storming and when she did sleep had horrible nightmares of struggling through blinding snowstorms dragging aunt cyrillas christmas basket along with her  it was not snowing in the early morning and uncle leopold drove aunt cyrilla and lucy rose and the basket to the station four miles off when they reached there the air was thick with flying flakes the stationmaster sold them their tickets with a grim face  if theres any more snow comes the trains might as well keep christmas too he said theres been so much snow already that traffic is blocked half the time and now there aint no place to shovel the snow off onto  aunt cyrilla said that if the train were to get to pembroke in time for christmas it would get there and she opened her basket and gave the stationmaster and three small boys an apple apiece  thats the beginning groaned lucy rose to herself  when their train came along aunt cyrilla established herself in one seat and her basket in another and looked beamingly around her at her fellow travellers  these were few in numbera delicate little woman at the end of the car with a baby and four other children a young girl across the aisle with a pale pretty face a sunburned lad three seats ahead in a khaki uniform a very handsome imposing old lady in a sealskin coat ahead of him and a thin young man with spectacles opposite  a minister reflected aunt cyrilla beginning to classify who takes better care of other folks souls than of his own body and that woman in the sealskin is discontented and cross at somethinggot up too early to catch the train maybe and that young chap must be one of the boys not long out of the hospital that womans children look as if they hadnt enjoyed a square meal since they were born and if that girl across from me has a mother id like to know what the woman means letting her daughter go from home in this weather in clothes like that  lucy rose merely wondered uncomfortably what the others thought of aunt cyrillas basket  they expected to reach pembroke that night but as the day wore on the storm grew worse twice the train had to stop while the train hands dug it out the third time it could not go on it was dusk when the conductor came through the train replying brusquely to the questions of the anxious passengers  a nice lookout for christmasno impossible to go on or backtrack blocked for mileswhats that madamno no station nearwoods for miles were here for the night these storms of late have played the mischief with everything  oh dear groaned lucy rose  aunt cyrilla looked at her basket complacently at any rate we wont starve she said  the pale pretty girl seemed indifferent the sealskin lady looked crosser than ever the khaki boy said just my luck and two of the children began to cry aunt cyrilla took some apples and striped candy sticks from her basket and carried them to them she lifted the oldest into her ample lap and soon had them all around her laughing and contented  the rest of the travellers straggled over to the corner and drifted into conversation the khaki boy said it was hard lines not to get home for christmas after all  i was invalided from south africa three months ago and ive been in the hospital at netley ever since reached halifax three days ago and telegraphed the old folks id eat my christmas dinner with them and to have an extrabig turkey because i didnt have any last year theyll be badly disappointed  he looked disappointed too one khaki sleeve hung empty by his side aunt cyrilla passed him an apple  we were all going down to grandpas for christmas said the little mothers oldest boy dolefully weve never been there before and its just too bad  he looked as if he wanted to cry but thought better of it and bit off a mouthful of candy  will there be any santa claus on the train demanded his small sister tearfully jack says there wont  i guess hell find you out said aunt cyrilla reassuringly  the pale pretty girl came up and took the baby from the tired mother what a dear little fellow she said softly  are you going home for christmas too asked aunt cyrilla  the girl shook her head i havent any home im just a shop girl out of work at present and im going to pembroke to look for some  aunt cyrilla went to her basket and took out her box of cream candy i guess we might as well enjoy ourselves lets eat it all up and have a good time maybe well get down to pembroke in the morning  the little group grew cheerful as they nibbled and even the pale girl brightened up the little mother told aunt cyrilla her story aside she had been long estranged from her family who had disapproved of her marriage her husband had died the previous summer leaving her in poor circumstances  father wrote to me last week and asked me to let bygones be bygones and come home for christmas i was so glad and the childrens hearts were set on it it seems too bad that we are not to get there i have to be back at work the morning after christmas  the khaki boy came up again and shared the candy he told amusing stories of campaigning in south africa the minister came too and listened and even the sealskin lady turned her head over her shoulder  by and by the children fell asleep one on aunt cyrillas lap and one on lucy roses and two on the seat aunt cyrilla and the pale girl helped the mother make up beds for them the minister gave his overcoat and the sealskin lady came forward with a shawl  this will do for the baby she said  we must get up some santa claus for these youngsters said the khaki boy lets hang their stockings on the wall and fill em up as best we can ive nothing about me but some hard cash and a jackknife ill give each of em a quarter and the boy can have the knife  ive nothing but money either said the sealskin lady regretfully  aunt cyrilla glanced at the little mother she had fallen asleep with her head against the seatback  ive got a basket over there said aunt cyrilla firmly and ive some presents in it that i was taking to my nephews children im going to give em to these as for the money i think the mother is the one for it to go to shes been telling me her story and a pitiful one it is lets make up a little purse among us for a christmas present  the idea met with favour the khaki boy passed his cap and everybody contributed the sealskin lady put in a crumpled note when aunt cyrilla straightened it out she saw that it was for twenty dollars  meanwhile lucy rose had brought the basket she smiled at aunt cyrilla as she lugged it down the aisle and aunt cyrilla smiled back lucy rose had never touched that basket of her own accord before  rays boat went to jacky and daisys doll to his oldest sister the twins lace handkerchiefs to the two smaller girls and the hood to the baby then the stockings were filled up with doughnuts and jelly cookies and the money was put in an envelope and pinned to the little mothers jacket  that baby is such a dear little fellow said the sealskin lady gently he looks something like my little son he died eighteen christmases ago  aunt cyrilla put her hand over the ladys kid glove so did mine she said then the two women smiled tenderly at each other afterwards they rested from their labours and all had what aunt cyrilla called a snack of sandwiches and pound cake the khaki boy said he hadnt tasted anything half so good since he left home  they didnt give us pound cake in south africa he said  when morning came the storm was still raging the children wakened and went wild with delight over their stockings the little mother found her envelope and tried to utter thanks and broke down and nobody knew what to say or do when the conductor fortunately came in and made a diversion by telling them they might as well resign themselves to spending christmas on the train  this is serious said the khaki boy when you consider that weve no provisions dont mind for myself used to half rations or no rations at all but these kiddies will have tremendous appetites  then aunt cyrilla rose to the occasion  ive got some emergency rations here she announced theres plenty for all and well have our christmas dinner although a cold one breakfast first thing theres a sandwich apiece left and we must fill up on what is left of the cookies and doughnuts and save the rest for a real good spread at dinner time the only thing is i havent any bread  ive a box of soda crackers said the little mother eagerly  nobody in that car will ever forget that christmas to begin with after breakfast they had a concert the khaki boy gave two recitations sang three songs and gave a whistling solo lucy rose gave three recitations and the minister a comic reading the pale shop girl sang two songs it was agreed that the khaki boys whistling solo was the best number and aunt cyrilla gave him the bouquet of everlastings as a reward of merit  then the conductor came in with the cheerful news that the storm was almost over and he thought the track would be cleared in a few hours  if we can get to the next station well be all right he said the branch joins the main line there and the tracks will be clear  at noon they had dinner the train hands were invited in to share it the minister carved the chicken with the brakemans jackknife and the khaki boy cut up the tongue and the mince pies while the sealskin lady mixed the raspberry vinegar with its due proportion of water bits of paper served as plates the train furnished a couple of glasses a tin pint cup was discovered and given to the children aunt cyrilla and lucy rose and the sealskin lady drank turn about from the latters graduated medicine glass the shop girl and the little mother shared one of the empty bottles and the khaki boy the minister and the train men drank out of the other bottle  everybody declared they had never enjoyed a meal more in their lives certainly it was a merry one and aunt cyrillas cooking was never more appreciated indeed the bones of the chicken and the pot of preserves were all that was left they could not eat the preserves because they had no spoons so aunt cyrilla gave them to the little mother  when all was over a hearty vote of thanks was passed to aunt cyrilla and her basket the sealskin lady wanted to know how she made her pound cake and the khaki boy asked for her receipt for jelly cookies and when two hours later the conductor came in and said the snowploughs had got along and theyd soon be starting they all wondered if it could really be less than twentyfour hours since they met  i feel as if id been campaigning with you all my life said the khaki boy  at the next station they all parted the little mother and the children had to take the next train back home the minister stayed there and the khaki boy and the sealskin lady changed trains the sealskin lady shook aunt cyrillas hand she no longer looked discontented or cross  this has been the pleasantest christmas i have ever spent she said heartily i shall never forget that wonderful basket of yours the little shop girl is going home with me ive promised her a place in my husbands store  when aunt cyrilla and lucy rose reached pembroke there was nobody to meet them because everyone had given up expecting them it was not far from the station to edwards house and aunt cyrilla elected to walk  ill carry the basket said lucy rose  aunt cyrilla relinquished it with a smile lucy rose smiled too  its a blessed old basket said the latter and i love it please forget all the silly things i ever said about it aunt crilla     davenports story   it was a rainy afternoon and we had been passing the time by telling ghost stories that is a very good sort of thing for a rainy afternoon and it is a much better time than after night if you tell ghost stories after dark they are apt to make you nervous whether you own up to it or not and you sneak home and dodge upstairs in mortal terror and undress with your back to the wall so that you cant fancy there is anything behind you  we had each told a story and had had the usual assortment of mysterious noises and death warnings and sheeted spectres and so on down through the whole catalogue of horrorsenough to satisfy any reasonable ghosttaster but jack as usual was dissatisfied he said our stories were all secondhand stuff there wasnt a man in the crowd who had ever seen or heard a ghost all our socalled authentic stories had been told us by persons who had the story from other persons who saw the ghosts  one doesnt get any information from that said jack i never expect to get so far along as to see a real ghost myself but i would like to see and talk to one who had  some persons appear to have the knack of getting their wishes granted jack is one of that ilk just as he made the remark davenport sauntered in and finding out what was going on volunteered to tell a ghost story himselfsomething that had happened to his grandmother or maybe it was his greataunt i forget which it was a very good ghost story as ghost stories go and davenport told it well even jack admitted that but he said  its only secondhand too did you ever have a ghostly experience yourself old man  davenport put his finger tips critically together  would you believe me if i said i had he asked  no said jack unblushingly  then there would be no use in my saying it  but you dont mean that you ever really had of course  i dont know something queer happened once ive never been able to explain itfrom a practical point of view that is want to hear about it  of course we did this was exciting nobody would ever have suspected davenport of seeing ghosts  its conventional enough he began ghosts dont seem to have much originality but its firsthand jack if thats what you want i dont suppose any of you have ever heard me speak of my brother charles he was my senior by two years and was a quiet reserved sort of fellownot at all demonstrative but with very strong and deep affections  when he left college he became engaged to dorothy chester she was very beautiful and my brother idolized her she died a short time before the date set for their marriage and charles never recovered from the blow  i married dorothys sister virginia virginia did not in the least resemble her sister but our eldest daughter was strikingly like her dead aunt we called her dorothy and charles was devoted to her dolly as we called her was always uncle charleys girl  when dolly was twelve years old charles went to new orleans on business and while there took yellow fever and died he was buried there and dolly half broke her childish heart over his death  one day five years later when dolly was seventeen i was writing letters in my library that very morning my wife and dolly had gone to new york en route for europe dolly was going to school in paris for a year business prevented my accompanying them even as far as new york but gilbert chester my wifes brother was going with them they were to sail on the aragon the next morning  i had written steadily for about an hour at last growing tired i threw down my pen and leaning back in my chair was on the point of lighting a cigar when an unaccountable impulse made me turn round i dropped my cigar and sprang to my feet in amazement there was only one door in the room and i had all along been facing it i could have sworn nobody had entered yet there standing between me and the bookcase was a manand that man was my brother charles  there was no mistaking him i saw him as plainly as i see you he was a tall rather stout man with curly hair and a fair closeclipped beard he wore the same lightgrey suit which he had worn when bidding us goodbye on the morning of his departure for new orleans he had no hat on but wore spectacles and was standing in his old favourite attitude with his hands behind him  i want you to understand that at this precise moment although i was surprised beyond measure i was not in the least frightened because i did not for a moment suppose that what i saw waswell a ghost or apparition of any sort the thought that flashed across my bewildered brain was simply that there had been some absurd mistake somewhere and that my brother had never died at all but was here alive and well i took a hasty step towards him  good heavens old fellow i exclaimed where on earth have you come from why we all thought you were dead  i was quite close to him when i stopped abruptly somehow i couldnt move another step he made no motion but his eyes looked straight into mine  do not let dolly sail on the aragon tomorrow he said in slow clear tones that i heard distinctly  and then he was goneyes jack i know it is a very conventional way of ending up a ghost story but i have to tell you just what occurred or at least what i thought occurred one moment he was there and the next moment he wasnt he did not pass me or go out of the door  for a few moments i felt dazed i was wide awake and in my right and proper senses so far as i could judge and yet the whole thing seemed incredible scared no i wasnt conscious of being scared i was simply bewildered  in my mental confusion one thought stood out sharplydolly was in danger of some kind and if the warning was really from a supernatural source it must not be disregarded i rushed to the station and having first wired to my wife not to sail on the aragon i found that i could connect with the fivefifteen train for new york i took it with the comfortable consciousness that my friends would certainly think i had gone out of my mind  i arrived in new york at eight oclock the next morning and at once drove to the hotel where my wife daughter and brotherinlaw were staying i found them greatly mystified by my telegram i suppose my explanation was a very lame one i know i felt decidedly like a fool gilbert laughed at me and said i had dreamed the whole thing virginia was perplexed but dolly accepted the warning unhesitatingly  of course it was uncle charley she said confidently we will not sail on the aragon now  gilbert had to give in to this decision with a very bad grace and the aragon sailed that day minus three of her intended passengers  well youve all heard of the historic collision between the aragon and the astarte in a fog and the fearful loss of life it involved gilbert didnt laugh when the news came i assure you virginia and dolly sailed a month later on the marseilles and reached the other side in safety thats all the story boysthe only experience of the kind i ever had concluded davenport  we had many questions to ask and several theories to advance jack said davenport had dreamed it and that the collision of the aragon and the astarte was simply a striking coincidence but davenport merely smiled at all our suggestions and as it cleared up just about three we told no more ghost stories     emilys husband   emily fair got out of hiram jamesons waggon at the gate she took her satchel and parasol and in her clear musical tones thanked him for bringing her home emily had a very distinctive voice it was very sweet always and very cold generally sometimes it softened to tenderness with those she loved but in it there was always an undertone of inflexibility and reserve nobody had ever heard emily fairs voice tremble  you are more than welcome mrs fair said hiram jameson with a glance of bold admiration emily met it with an unflinching indifference she disliked hiram jameson she had been furious under all her external composure because he had been at the station when she left the train  jameson perceived her scorn but chose to disregard it  proud as lucifer he thought as he drove away well shes none the worse of that i dont like your weak womentheyre always sly if stephen fair dont get better shell be free and then  he did not round out the thought but he gloated over the memory of emily standing by the gate in the harsh crude light of the autumn sunset with her tawny brown hair curling about her pale oval face and the scornful glint in her large darkgrey eyes  emily stood at the gate for some time after jamesons waggon had disappeared when the brief burst of sunset splendour had faded out she turned and went into the garden where late asters and chrysanthemums still bloomed she gathered some of the more perfect ones here and there she loved flowers but tonight the asters seemed to hurt her for she presently dropped those she had gathered and deliberately set her foot on them  a sudden gust of wind came over the brown sodden fields and the ragged maples around the garden writhed and wailed the air was raw and chill the rain that had threatened all day was very near emily shivered and went into the house  amelia phillips was bending over the fire she came forward and took emilys parcels and wraps with a certain gentleness that sat oddly on her grim personality  are you tired im glad youre back did you walk from the station  no hiram jameson was there and offered to drive me home id rather have walked its going to be a storm i think where is john  he went to the village after supper answered amelia lighting a lamp we needed some things from the store  the light flared up as she spoke and brought out her strong almost harsh features and deepset black eyes amelia phillips looked like an overdone sketch in charcoal  has anything happened in woodford while ive been away asked emily indifferently plainly she did not expect an affirmative answer woodford life was not eventful  amelia glanced at her sharply so she had not heard amelia had expected that hiram jameson would have told her she wished that he had for she never felt sure of emily the older sister knew that beneath that surface reserve was a passionate nature brooking no restraint when once it overleaped the bounds of her puritan selfcontrol amelia phillips with all her naturally keen insight and her acquired knowledge of emilys character had never been able to fathom the latters attitude of mind towards her husband from the time that emily had come back to her girlhoods home five years before stephen fairs name had never crossed her lips  i suppose you havent heard that stephen is very ill said amelia slowly  not a feature of emilys face changed only in her voice when she spoke was a curious jarring as if a false note had been struck in a silver melody  what is the matter with him  typhoid answered amelia briefly she felt relieved that emily had taken it so calmly amelia hated stephen fair with all the intensity of her nature because she believed that he had treated emily ill but she had always been distrustful that emily in her heart of hearts loved her husband still that in amelia phillips opinion would have betrayed a weakness not to be tolerated  emily looked at the lamp unwinkingly  that wick needs trimming she said then with a sudden recurrence of the untuneful note  is he dangerously ill  we havent heard for three days the doctors were not anxious about him monday though they said it was a pretty severe case  a faint wraithlike change of expression drifted over emilys beautiful face and was gone in a moment what was itrelief regret it would have been impossible to say when she next spoke her vibrant voice was as perfectly melodious as usual  i think i will go to bed amelia john will not be back until late i suppose and i am very tired there comes the rain i suppose it will spoil all the flowers they will be beaten to pieces  in the dark hall emily paused for a moment and opened the front door to be cut in the face with a whiplike dash of rain she peered out into the thickly gathering gloom beyond in the garden she saw the asters tossed about phantomlike the wind around the manycornered old farmhouse was full of wails and sobs  the clock in the sittingroom struck eight emily shivered and shut the door she remembered that she had been married at eight oclock that very morning seven years ago she thought she could see herself coming down the stairs in her white dress with her bouquet of asters for a moment she was glad that those mocking flowers in the garden would be all beaten to death before morning by the lash of wind and rain  then she recovered her mental poise and put the hateful memories away from her as she went steadily up the narrow stairs and along the hall with its curious slant as the house had settled to her own room under the northwestern eaves  when she had put out her light and gone to bed she found that she could not sleep she pretended to believe that it was the noise of the storm that kept her awake not even to herself would emily confess that she was waiting and listening nervously for johns return home that would have been to admit a weakness and emily fair like amelia despised weakness  every few minutes a gust of wind smote the house with a roar as of a wild beast and bombarded emilys window with a volley of rattling drops in the silences that came between the gusts she heard the soft steady pouring of the rain on the garden paths below mingled with a faint murmur that came up from the creek beyond the barns where the pine boughs were thrashing in the storm emily suddenly thought of a weird story she had once read years before and long forgottena story of a soul that went out in a night of storm and blackness and lost its way between earth and heaven she shuddered and drew the counterpane over her face  of all things i hate a fall storm most she muttered it frightens me  somewhat to her surprisefor even her thoughts were generally well under the control of her unbending willshe could not help thinking of stephenthinking of him not tenderly or remorsefully but impersonally as of a man who counted for nothing in her life it was so strange to think of stephen being ill she had never known him to have a days sickness in his life before she looked back over her life much as if she were glancing with a chill interest at a series of pictures which in no way concerned her scene after scene face after face flashed out on the background of the darkness  emilys mother had died at her birth but amelia phillips twenty years older than the baby sister had filled the vacant place so well and with such intuitive tenderness that emily had never been conscious of missing a mother john phillips too the grave silent elder brother loved and petted the child woodford people were fond of saying that john and amelia spoiled emily shamefully  emily phillips had never been like the other woodford girls and had no friends of her own age among them her uncommon beauty won her many lovers but she had never cared for any of them until stephen fair fifteen years her senior had come awooing to the old gray willowgirdled phillips homestead  amelia and john phillips never liked him there was an ancient feud between the families that had died out among the younger generation but was still potent with the older  from the first emily had loved stephen indeed deep down in her strange wayward heart she had cared for him long before the memorable day when he had first looked at her with seeing eyes and realized that the quiet unthoughtof child who had been growing up at the old phillips place had blossomed out into a woman of strange seraphlike beauty and deep grey eyes whose expression was nevermore to go out of stephen fairs remembrance from then till the day of his death  john and amelia phillips put their own unjustifiable dislike of stephen aside when they found that emilys heart was set on him the two were married after a brief courtship and emily went out from her girlhoods home to the fair homestead two miles away  stephens mother lived with them janet fair had never liked emily she had not been willing for stephen to marry her but apart from this the woman had a natural ineradicable love of making mischief and took a keen pleasure in it she loved her son and she had loved her husband but nevertheless when thomas fair had been alive she had fomented continual strife and discontent between him and stephen now it became her pleasure to make what trouble she could between stephen and his wife  she had the advantage of emily in that she was always sweetspoken and on the surface sweettempered emily hurt and galled in a score of petty ways so subtle that they were beyond a mans courser comprehension astonished her husband by her fierce outbursts of anger that seemed to him for the most part without reason or excuse he tried his best to preserve the peace between his wife and mother and when he failed not understanding all that emily really endured at the elder womans merciless hands he grew to think her capricious and easily irritateda spoiled child whose whims must not be taken too seriously  to a certain extent he was right emily had been spoiled the unbroken indulgence which her brother and sister had always accorded her had fitted her but poorly to cope with the trials of her new life true mrs fair was an unpleasant woman to live with but if emily had chosen to be more patient under petty insults and less resentful of her husbands wellmeant though clumsy efforts for harmony the older woman could have effected real little mischief but this emily refused to be and the breach between husband and wife widened insidiously  the final rupture came two years after their marriage emily in rebellious anger told her husband that she would no longer live in the same house with his mother  you must choose between us she said her splendid voice vibrating with all the unleashed emotion of her being yet with no faltering in it if she stays i go  stephen fair harassed and bewildered was angry with the relentless anger of a patient man roused at last  go then he said sternly ill never turn my mother from my door for any womans whim  the stormy red went out of emilys face leaving it like a marble wash  you mean that she said calmly think well if i go ill never return  i do mean it said stephen leave my house if you willif you hold your marriage vow so lightly when your senses return you are welcome to come back to me i will never ask you to  without another word emily turned away that night she went back to john and amelia they on their part welcomed her back gladly believing her to be a wronged and illused woman they hated stephen fair with a new and personal rancour the one thing they could hardly have forgiven emily would have been the fact of her relenting towards him  but she did not relent in her soul she knew that with all her just grievances she had been in the wrong and for that she could not forgive him  two years after she had left stephen mrs fair died and his widowed sisterinlaw went to keep house for him if he thought of emily he made no sign stephen fair never broke a word once passed  since their separation no greeting or look had ever passed between husband and wife when they met as they occasionally did neither impassive face changed emily fair had buried her love deeply in her pride and anger she would not let herself remember even where she had dug its grave  and now stephen was ill the strange woman felt a certain pride in her own inflexibility because the fact did not affect her she told herself that she could not have felt more unconcerned had he been the merest stranger nevertheless she waited and watched for john phillips homecoming  at ten oclock she heard his voice in the kitchen she leaned out of the bed and pulled open her door she heard voices below but could not distinguish the words so she rose and went noiselessly out into the hall knelt down by the stair railing and listened the door of the kitchen was open below her and a narrow shaft of light struck on her white intent face she looked like a woman waiting for the decree of doom  at first john and amelia talked of trivial matters then the latter said abruptly  did you hear how stephen fair was  hes dying was the brief response  emily heard amelias startled exclamation she gripped the square rails with her hands until the sharp edges dinted deep into her fingers johns voice came up to her again harsh and expressionless  he took a bad turn the day before yesterday and has been getting worse ever since the doctors dont expect him to live till morning  amelia began to talk rapidly in low tones emily heard nothing further she got up and went blindly back into her room with such agony tearing at her heartstrings that she dully wondered why she could not shriek aloud  stephenher husbanddying in the burning anguish of that moment her own soul was as an open book before her the love she had buried rose from the deeps of her being in an awful accusing resurrection  out of her stupor and pain a purpose formed itself clearly she must go to stephenshe must beg and win his forgiveness before it was too late she dared not go down to john and ask him to take her to her husband he might refuse the phillipses had been known to do even harder things than that at the best there would be a storm of protest and objection on her brothers and sisters part and emily felt that she could not encounter that in her present mood it would drive her mad  she lit a lamp and dressed herself noiselessly but with feverish haste then she listened the house was very still amelia and john had gone to bed she wrapped herself in a heavy woollen shawl hanging in the hall and crept downstairs with numbed fingers she fumbled at the key of the hall door turned it and slipped out into the night  the storm seemed to reach out and clutch her and swallow her up she went through the garden where the flowers already were crushed to earth she crossed the long field beyond where the rain cut her face like a whip and the wind almost twisted her in its grasp like a broken reed somehow or other more by blind instinct than anything else she found the path that led through commons and woods and waste valleys to her lost home  in after years that frenzied walk through the storm and blackness seemed as an unbroken nightmare to emily fairs recollection often she fell once as she did so a jagged dead limb of fir struck her forehead and cut in it a gash that marked her for life as she struggled to her feet and found her way again the blood trickled down over her face  oh god dont let him die before i get to himdontdontdont she prayed desperately with more of defiance than entreaty in her voice then realizing this she cried out in horror surely some fearsome punishment would come upon her for her wickednessshe would find her husband lying dead  when emily opened the kitchen door of the fair homestead almira sentner cried out in her alarm who or what was this creature with the white face and wild eyes with her torn and dripping garments and dishevelled windwrithen hair and the big drops of blood slowly trickling from her brow  the next moment she recognized emily and her face hardened this woman stephens sisterinlaw had always hated emily fair  what do you want here she said harshly  where is my husband asked emily  you cant see him said mrs sentner defiantly the doctors wont allow anyone in the room but those hes used to strangers excite him  the insolence and cruelty of her speech fell on unheeding ears emily understanding only that her husband yet lived turned to the hall door  stand back she said in a voice that was little more than a thrilling whisper but which yet had in it something that cowed almira sentners malice sullenly she stood aside and emily went unhindered up the stairs to the room where the sick man lay  the two doctors in attendance were there together with the trained nurse from the city emily pushed them aside and fell on her knees by the bed one of the doctors made a hasty motion as if to draw her back but the other checked him  it doesnt matter now he said significantly  stephen fair turned his languid unshorn head on the pillow his dull fevered eyes met emilys he had not recognized anyone all day but he knew his wife  emily he whispered  emily drew his head close to her face and kissed his lips passionately  stephen ive come back to you forgive meforgive mesay that you forgive me  its all right my girl he said feebly  she buried her face in the pillow beside his with a sob  in the wan grey light of the autumn dawn the old doctor came to the bedside and lifted emily to her feet she had not stirred the whole night now she raised her white face with dumb pleading in her eyes the doctor glanced at the sleeping form on the bed  your husband will live mrs fair he said gently i think your coming saved him his joy turned the ebbing tide in favour of life  thank god said emily  and for the first time in her life her beautiful voice trembled     min   the morning sun hung a red lustreless ball in the dull grey sky a light snow had fallen in the night and the landscape crossed by spiderlike trails of fences was as white and lifeless as if wrapped in a shroud  a young man was driving down the road to rykmans corner the youthful face visible above the greatcoat was thoughtful and refined the eyes deep blue and peculiarly beautiful the mouth firm yet sensitive it was not a handsome face but there was a strangely subtle charm about it  the chill breathlessness of the air seemed prophetic of more snow the reverend allan telford looked across the bare wastes and cold white hills and shivered as if the icy lifelessness about him were slowly and relentlessly creeping into his own heart and life  he felt utterly discouraged in his soul he was asking bitterly what good had come of all his prayerful labours among the people of this pinched narrow world as rugged and unbeautiful in form and life as the barren hills that shut them in  he had been two years among them and he counted it two years of failure he had been too outspoken for them they resented sullenly his direct and incisive tirades against their pet sins they viewed his small innovations on their traditional ways of worship with disfavour and distrust and shut him out of their lives with an everincreasing coldness he had meant well and worked hard and he felt his failure keenly  his thoughts reverted to a letter received the preceding day from a former classmate stating that the pastorate of a certain desirable town church had become vacant and hinting that a call was to be moderated for him unless he signified his unwillingness to accept  two years before allan telford fresh from college and full of vigorous enthusiasm and high ideas would have said  no that is not for me my work must lie among the poor and lowly of earth as did my masters shall i shrink from it because to worldly eyes the way looks dreary and uninviting  now looking back on his two years ministry he said wearily  i can remain here no longer if i do i fear i shall sink down into something almost as pitiful as one of these canting gossiping people myself i can do them no goodthey do not like or trust me i will accept this call and go back to my own world  perhaps the keynote of his failure was sounded in his last words my own world he had never felt or tried to feel that this narrow sphere was his own world it was some lower level to which he had come with good tidings and honest intentions but unconsciously he had held himself above it and his people felt and resented this they expressed it by saying he was stuckup  rykmans corner came into view as he drove over the brow of a long hill he hated the place knowing it well for what it wasa festering hotbed of gossip and malice the habitat of all the slanderous rumours and innuendoes that permeated the social tissue of the community the newest scandal the worstflavoured joke the latest details of the most recent quarrel were always to be had at rykmans store  as the minister drove down the hill a man came out of a small house at the foot and waited on the road had it been possible telford would have pretended not to see him but it was not possible for isaac galletly meant to be seen and hailed the minister cheerfully  good mornin mr telford ye wont mind giving me a lift down to the corner i dessay  telford checked his horse reluctantly and galletly crawled into the cutter he was that most despicable of created beings a male gossip and he spent most of his time travelling from house to house in the village smoking his pipe in neighbourly kitchens and fanning into an active blaze all the smouldering feuds of the place he had been nicknamed the morning chronicle by a sarcastic schoolteacher who had sojourned a winter at the corner the name was an apt one and clung telford had heard it  i suppose he is starting out on his rounds now he thought  galletly plunged undauntedly into the conversational gap  quite a fall of snow last night reckon well have more fore long that was a grand sermon ye gave us last sunday mr telford reckon it went home to some folks judgin from all ive heard it was needed and thats a fact live peaceably with all menthats what i lay out to do there aint a house in the district but what i can drop into and welcome taint everybody in rykmans corner can say the same  galletly squinted out of the corner of his eye to see if the minister would open on the trail of this hint telfords passive face was discouraging but galletly was not to be baffled  i spose ye havent heard about the row down at palmers last night  no  the monosyllable was curt telford was vainly seeking to nip galletlys gossip in the bud the name of palmer conveyed no especial meaning to his ear he knew where the palmer homestead was and that the plaintivefaced fairhaired woman whose name was mrs fuller and who came to church occasionally lived there his knowledge went no further he had called three times and found nobody at homeat least to all appearances now he was fated to have the whole budget of some vulgar quarrel forced on him by galletly  no everyones talkin of it the long and short of it is that min palmer has had a regular upanddown row with rose fuller and turned her and her little gal out of doors i believe the two women had an awful time mins a tartar when her tempers upand thats pretty often nobody knows how rose managed to put up with her so long but she has had to go at last goodness knows what the poor critterll do she hasnt a cent nor a relationshe was just an orphan girl that palmer brought up she is at rawlingses now maybe when min cools off shell let her go back but its doubtful min hates her like pisen  to telford this was all very unintelligible but he understood that mrs fuller was in trouble of some kind and that it was his duty to help her if possible although he had an odd and unaccountable aversion to the woman for which he had often reproached himself  who is this woman you call min palmer he said coldly what are the family circumstances i ought to know perhaps if i am to be of any servicebut i have no wish to hear idle gossip  his concluding sentence was quite unheeded by galletly  min palmers the worst woman in rykmans corneror out of it she always was an odd one i mind her when she was a girla saucy blackeyed baggage she was handsome some folks called her i never cd see it her people were a queer crowd and min was never brung up rightjest let run wild all her life well rod palmer took to dancin attendance on her rod was a worthless scamp old palmer was well off and rod was his only child but this rose lived there and kept house for them after mis palmer died she was a quiet wellbehaved little creetur folks said the old man wanted rod to marry herdunno if twas so or not in the end howsomever he had to marry min her brother got after him with a horsewhip ye understand old palmer was furious but he had to give in and rod brought her home she was a bit sobered down by her trouble and lived quiet and sullenlike at first her and rod fought like cat and dog rose married osh fuller a worthless drunken fellow he died in a year or so and left rose and her baby without a roof over their heads then old palmer went and brought her home he set great store by rose and he cdnt bear min min had to be civil to rose as long as old palmer lived finlly rod up and died and twasnt long before his father went too then the queer part came in everyone expected that hed purvide well for rose and mind come in second best but no will was to be found i dont say but what it was all right mind you i may have my own secret opinion of course old palmer had a regular mania as ye might say for makin wills hed have a lawyer out from town every year and have a new will made and the old one burnt lawyer bell was there and made one bout eight months fore he died it was sposed hed destroyed it and then died fore hed time to make another he went off awful sudden anyway everything went to mins childto min as ye might say shes been boss rose still stayed on there and min let her which was more than folks expected of her but shes turned her out at last mins in one of her tantrums now and taint safe to cross her path  what is mrs fuller to do asked telford anxiously  thats the question shes sicklycant work muchand then she has her leetle gal min was always jealous of that child its a real purty smart leetle creetur and old palmer made a lot of it mins own is an awfullooking thinga cripple from the time twas born theres no doubt twas a jedgement on her as for rose no doubt the god of the widow and fatherless will purvide for her  in spite of his disgust telford could not repress a smile at the tone halfwhine halfsnuffle with which galletly ended up  i think i had better call and see this mrs palmer he said slowly  twould be no airthly use mr telford mind slam the door in your face if she did nothing worse she hates ministers and everything thats good she hasnt darkened a church door for years she never had any religious tendency to begin with and when there was such a scandal about her old mr dinwoodie our pastor thena godly man mr telfordhe didnt hold no truck with evildoershe went right to her to reprove and rebuke her for her sins min she flew at him she vowed then shed never go to church again and she never has people hereabouts has talked to her and tried to do her good but it aint no use why ive heard that woman say there was no god its a fact mr telfordi have some of our ministers has tried to visit her they didnt try it more than once the last onehe was about your hefthe got a scare i tell you min just caught him by the shoulder and shook him like a rat didnt see it myself but mrs rawlings did ye ought to hear her describin of it  galletly chuckled over the recollection his wicked little eyes glistening with delight telford was thankful when they reached the store he felt that he could not endure this mans society any longer  nevertheless he felt strangely interested this min palmer must at least be different from the rest of the cornerites if only in the greater force of her wickedness he almost felt as if her sins on the grand scale were less blameworthy than the petty vices of her censorious neighbours  galletly eagerly joined the group of loungers on the dirty wet platform and telford passed into the store a couple of slatternly women were talking to mrs rykman about the palmer row telford made his small purchases hastily as he turned from the counter he came face to face with a woman who had paused in the doorway to survey the scene with an air of sullen scorn by some subtle intuition telford knew that this was min palmer  the young mans first feeling was one of admiration for the woman before him who in spite of her grotesque attire and defiant unwomanly air was strikingly beautiful she was tall and not even the mans ragged overcoat which she wore could conceal the grace of her figure her abundant black hair was twisted into a sagging knot at her neck and from beneath the old fur cap looked out a pair of large and brilliant black eyes heavily lashed and full of a smouldering fire her skin was tanned and coarsened but the warm crimson blood glowed in her cheeks with a dusky richness and her face was a perfect oval with features chiselled in almost classic regularity of outline  telford had a curious experience at that moment he seemed to see looking out from behind this external mask of degraded beauty the semblance of what this woman might have been under more favouring circumstance of birth and environment wherein her rich passionate nature potent for either good or evil might have been trained and swayed aright until it had developed grandly out into the glorious womanhood the creator must have planned for her he knew as if by revelation that this woman had nothing in common with the narrow selfrighteous souls of rykmans corner warped and perverted though her nature might be she was yet far nobler than those who sat in judgement upon her  min made some scanty purchases and left the store quickly brushing unheedingly past the minister as she did so he saw her step on a rough woodsleigh and drive down the river road the platform loungers had been silent during her call but now the talk bubbled forth anew telford was sick at heart as he drove swiftly away he felt for min palmer a pity he could not understand or analyze the attempt to measure the gulf between what she was and what she might have been hurt him like the stab of a knife  he made several calls at various houses along the river during the forenoon after dinner he suddenly turned his horse towards the palmer place isaac galletly comfortably curled up in a neighbours chimney corner saw him drive past  ef the minister aint goin to palmers after all he chuckled hes a set one when he does take a notion well i warned him what to expect if min claws his eyes out hell only have himself to blame  telford was not without his own misgivings as he drove into the palmer yard he tied his horse to the fence and looked doubtfully about him untrodden snowdrifts were heaped about the front door so he turned towards the kitchen and walked slowly past the bare lilac trees along the fence there was no sign of life about the place it was beginning to snow again softly and thickly and the hills and river were hidden behind a misty white veil  he lifted his hand to knock but before he could do so the door was flung open and min herself confronted him on the threshold  she did not now have on the mans overcoat which she had worn at the store and her neat closefitting homespun dress revealed to perfection the full magnificent curves of her figure her splendid hair was braided about her head in a glossy coronet and her dark eyes were ablaze with illsuppressed anger again telford was overcome by a sense of her wonderful loveliness not all the years of bondage to illtemper and misguided will had been able to blot out the beauty of that proud dark face  she lifted one large but shapely brown hand and pointed to the gate  go she said threateningly  mrs palmer began telford but she silenced him with an imperious gesture  i dont want any of your kind here i hate all you ministers did you come here to lecture me i suppose some of the corner saints set you on me youll never cross my threshold  telford returned her defiant gaze unflinchingly his darkblue eyes magnetic in their power and sweetness looked gravely questioningly into mins stormy orbs slowly the fire and anger faded out of her face and her head drooped  i aint fit for you to talk to anyway she said with a sort of sullen humility maybe you mean well but you cant do me any good im past that now the corner saints say im possessed of the devil perhaps i amif there is one  i do mean well said telford slowly i did not come here to reprove you i came to help you if i couldif you needed help mrs palmer  dont call me that she interrupted passionately she flung out her hands as if pushing some loathly invisible thing from her i hate the nameas i hated all who ever bore it i never had anything but wrong and dogusage from them all call me minthats the only name that belongs to me now gowhy dont you go dont stand there looking at me like that im not going to change my mind i dont want any praying and whining round me ive been well sickened of that go  telford threw back his head and looked once more into her eyes a long look passed between them then he silently lifted his cap and with no word of farewell he turned and went down to the gate a bitter sense of defeat and disappointment filled his heart as he drove away  min stood in the doorway and watched the sleigh out of sight down the river road then she gave a long shivering sigh that was almost a moan  if i had met that man long ago she said slowly as if groping vaguely in some hitherto unsounded depth of consciousness i would never have become what i am i felt that as i looked at himit all came over me with an awful sickening feelingjust as if we were standing alone somewhere out of the world where there was no need of words to say things he doesnt despise mehe wouldnt sneer at me bad as i am like those creatures up there he could have helped me if we had met in time but its too late now  she locked her hands over her eyes and groaned swaying her body to and fro as one in mortal agony presently she looked out again with hard dry eyes  what a fool i am she said bitterly how the corner saints would stare if they saw me i suppose some of them do with a glance at the windows of a neighbouring house yes theres mrs rawlings staring out and rose peeking over her shoulder  her face hardened the old sway of evil passion reasserted itself  she shall never come back herenever oh she was a sweetspoken cat of a thingbut she had claws ive been blamed for all the trouble but if ever i had a chance id tell that minister how she used to twit and taunt me in that sugary way of hershow she schemed and plotted against me as long as she could more fool i to care what he thinks either i wish i were dead if twasnt for the child id go and drown myself at that black springhole down thereid be well out of the way                                       it was a dull grey afternoon a week afterwards when allan telford again walked up the river road to the palmer place the wind was bitter and he walked with bent head to avoid its fury his face was pale and worn and he looked years older  he paused at the rough gate and leaned over it while he scanned the house and its surroundings eagerly as he looked the kitchen door opened and min clad in the old overcoat came out and walked swiftly across the yard  telfords eyes followed her with pitiful absorption he saw her lead a horse from the stable and harness it into a woodsleigh loaded with bags of grain once she paused to fling her arms about the animals neck laying her face against it with a caressing motion  the pale minister groaned aloud he longed to snatch her forever from that hard unwomanly toil and fold her safely away from jeers and scorn in the shelter of his love he knew it was madnesshe had told himself so every hour in which mins dark rebellious face had haunted himyet none the less was he under its control  min led the horse across the yard and left it standing before the kitchen door she had not seen the bowed figure at the gate when she reappeared he saw her dark eyes and the rosered lustre of her face gleam out from under the old crimson shawl wrapped about her head  as she caught the horse by the bridle the kitchen door swung heavily to with a sharp sudden bang the horse a great powerful nervous brute started wildly and then reared in terror  the ice underfoot was glib and treacherous min lost her foothold and fell directly under the horses hoofs as they came heavily down the animal freed from her detaining hand sprang forward dragging the laden sleigh over the prostrate woman  it had all passed in a moment the moveless figure lay where it had fallen one outstretched hand still grasping the whip telford sprang over the gate and rushed up the slope like a madman he flung himself on his knees beside her  min min he called wildly  there was no answer he lifted her in his arms and staggered into the house with his burden his heart stilling with a horrible fear as he laid her gently down on the old lounge in one corner of the kitchen  the room was a large one and everything was neat and clean the fire burned brightly and a few green plants were in blossom by the south window beside them sat a child of about seven years who turned a startled face at telfords reckless entrance  the boy had mins dark eyes and perfectly chiselled features refined by suffering into cameolike delicacy and the silken hair fell in soft waving masses about the spiritual little face by his side nestled a tiny dog with satin ears and paws fringed as with ravelled silk  telford paid heed to nothing not even the frightened child he was as one distraught  min he wailed again striving tremblingly to feel her pulse while cold drops came out on his forehead  mins face was as pallid as marble save for one heavy bruise across the cheek and a cruel cut at the edge of the dark hair from which the blood trickled down on the pillow  she opened her eyes wonderingly at his call looking up with a dazed appealing expression of pain and dread a low moan broke from her white lips telford sprang to his feet in a tumult of quivering joy  min dear he said gently you have been hurtnot seriously i hope i must leave you for a minute while i run for helpi will not be long  come back said min in a low but distinct tone  he paused impatiently  it is of no use to get help min went on calmly im dyingi know it oh my god  she pressed her hand to her side and writhed telford turned desperately to the door min raised her arm  come here she said resolutely  he obeyed mutely she looked up at him with bright unquailing eyes  dont you go one stepdont leave me here to die alone im past helpand ive something to say to you i must say it and i havent much time  telford hardly heeded her in his misery  min let me go for helplet me do something he implored you must not dieyou must not  min had fallen back gasping on the bloodstained pillow  he knelt beside her and put his arm about the poor crushed body  i must hurry she said faintly i cant die with it on my mind roseits all hersall there was a willhe made itold granther palmer he always hated me i found it before he diedand read it he left everything to hernot a cent to me nor his sons childwe were to starvebeg i was like a madwoman when he diedi hid the will i meantto burn itbut i never could its tortured menight and dayive had no peace youll find it in a boxin my room tell hertell rosehow wicked ive been and my boywhat will become of him rose hates himshell turn him outor illtreat him  telford lifted his white drawn face  i will take your child min he shall be to me as my own son  an expression of unspeakable relief came into the dying womans face  it is goodof you i can diein peacenow im glad to dieto get clear of it all im tiredof living so perhapsill have a chancesomewhere else ive neverhad anyhere  the dark eyes droopedclosed telford moaned shudderingly  once again min opened her eyes and looked straight into his  if i had met youlong agoyou would haveloved meand i would have beena good woman it is well for usfor youthat i amdying your path will be clearyou will be good and successfulbut you will alwaysremember me  telford bent and pressed his lips to mins painblanched mouth  do you thinkwe willever meet again she said faintly out thereits so darkgod can neverforgive meive been sowicked  min the allloving father is more merciful than man he will forgive you if you ask him and you will wait for me till i come i will stay here and do my dutyi will try hard  his voice broke mins great black eyes beamed out on him with passionate tenderness the strong deep erring nature yielded at last an exceeding bitter cry rose to her lips  oh godforgive meforgive me  and with the cry the soul of poor suffering sinning sinnedagainst min palmer fledwho shall say whither who shall say that her remorseful cry was not heard even at that late hour by a judge more merciful than her fellow creatures  telford still knelt on the bare floor holding in his arms the dead form of the woman he lovedhis all his in death as she could never have been in life death had bridged the gulf between them  the room was very silent to mins face had returned something of its girlhoods innocence the hard unlovely lines were all smoothed out the little cripple crept timidly up to telford with the silky head of the dog pressed against his cheek telford gathered the distorted little body to his side and looked earnestly into the small facemins face purified and spiritualized he would have it near him always he bent and reverently kissed the cold face the closed eyelids and the bloodstained brow of the dead woman then he stood up  come with me dear he said gently to the child                                       the day after the funeral allan telford sat in the study of his little manse among the encircling wintry hills close to the window sat mins child his small beautiful face pressed against the panes and the brighteyed dog beside him  telford was writing in his journal  i shall stay hereclose to her grave i shall see it every time i look from my study windowevery time i stand in my pulpitevery time i go in and out among my people i begin to see wherein i have failed i shall begin again patiently and humbly i wrote today to decline the c church call my heart and my work are here  he closed the book and bowed his head on it outside the snow fell softly he knew that it was wrapping that newmade grave on the cold firsentinelled hillside with a stainless shroud of infinite purity and peace     miss cordelias accommodation   poor little creatures said miss cordelia compassionately  she meant the factory children in her car ride from the school where she taught to the bridge that spanned the river between pottstown the sooty little manufacturing village on one side and point pleasant which was merely a hamlet on the other she had seen dozens of them playing and quarrelling on the streets or peering wistfully out of dingy tenement windows  tomorrow is saturday she reflected and theyve no better place to play in than the back streets and yards its a shame theres work for our philanthropists here but they dont seem to see it well im so sorry for them it hurts me to look at them but i cant do anything  miss cordelia sighed and then brightened up because she realized that she was turning her back upon pottstown for two blissful days and going to point pleasant which had just one straggling elmshaded street hedging on oldfashioned gardens and cosy little houses and trailing off into the real country in a halfhours walk  miss cordelia lived alone in a tiny house at point pleasant it was so tiny that you would have wondered how anyone could live in it  but its plenty big for a little old maid like me miss cordelia would have told you and its my ownim queen there theres solid comfort in having one spot for your own self to be sure if i had less land and more house it would be better  miss cordelia always laughed here it was one of her jokes there was a fouracre field behind the house both had been left to her by an uncle the field was of no use to miss cordelia she didnt keep a cow and she hadnt time to make a garden but she liked her field when people asked her why she didnt sell it she said  im fond of it i like to walk around in it when the grass grows long and it may come in handy some time mother used to say if you kept anything seven years it would come to use ive had my field a good bit longer than that but maybe the time will come yet meanwhile i rejoice in the fact that i am a landed proprietor to the extent of four acres  miss cordelia had thought of converting her field into a playground for the factory children and asking detachments of them over on saturday afternoon but she knew that her point pleasant neighbours would object to this so that project was dropped  when miss cordelia pushed open her little gate hung crookedly in a very compact and prim spruce hedge she stopped in amazement and said well for pitys sake  cynthia ann flemming who lived on the other side of the spruce hedge now came hurrying over  good evening cordelia i have a letter that was left with me for you  butthathorse said miss cordelia with a long breath between every word where did he come from tied at my front doorand hes eaten the tops off every one of my geraniums wheres his owner or rider or something  the horse in question was a mildeyed rather goodlooking quadruped tied by a halter to the elm at miss cordelias door and contentedly munching a mouthful of geranium stalks cynthia ann came through the hedge with the letter  maybe this will explain she said same boy brought it as brought the horsea little freckly chap mostly all grin and shirtsleeves said he was told to take the letter and horse to miss cordelia herry elm street point pleasant and he couldnt wait so he tied the creature in there and left the letter with me he came half an hour ago well he has played havoc with your geraniums and no mistake  miss cordelia opened and read her letter when she finished it she looked at the curious cynthia ann solemnly  well if that isnt john drew all over i suspected he was at the bottom of it as soon as i laid my eyes on that animal john drew is a cousin of mine hes been living out at poplar valley and he writes me that he has gone out west and wants me to take old nap i suppose that is the horse he says that nap is getting old and not much use for work and he couldnt bear the thought of shooting him or selling him to someone who might illtreat him so he wants me to take him and be kind to him for old times sake john and i were just like brother and sister when we were children if this isnt like him nothing ever was he was always doing odd things and thinking they were all right and now hes off west and here is the horse if it were a cat or a dogbut a horse  your fouracre field will come in handy now said cynthia ann jestingly  so it will miss cordelia spoke absently the very thing yes ill put him in there  but you dont really mean that youre going to keep the horse are you protested cynthia ann why he is no good to youand think of the expense of feeding him  ill keep him for a while said miss cordelia briskly as you say there is the fouracre field it will keep him in eating for a while i always knew that field had a mission poor john drew id like to oblige him for old times sake as he says although this is as crazy as anything he ever did but i have a plan meanwhile i cant feed nap on geraniums  miss cordelia always adapted herself quickly and calmly to new circumstances it is never any use to get in a stew about things she was wont to say so now she untied nap gingerly with many rueful glances at her geraniums and led him away to the field behind the house where she tied him safely to a post with such an abundance of knots that there was small fear of his getting away  when the mystified cynthia ann had returned home miss cordelia set about getting her tea and thinking over the plan that had come to her concerning her white elephant  i can keep him for the summer she said ill have to dispose of him in the fall for ive no place to keep him in and anyway i couldnt afford to feed him ill see if i can borrow mr griggss express wagon for saturday afternoons and if i can those poor factory children in my grade shall have a weekly treat or my name is not cordelia herry im not so sure but that john drew has done a good thing after all poor john he always did take things so for granted                                       all the point pleasant people soon knew about miss cordelias questionable windfall and she was overwhelmed with advice and suggestions she listened to all tranquilly and then placidly followed her own way mr griggs was very obliging in regard to his old express wagon and the next saturday point pleasant was treated to a mild sensationnothing less than miss cordelia rattling through the village enthroned on the high seat of mr griggss yellow express wagon drawn by old nap who after a week of browsing idleness in the fouracre field was quite frisky and went at a decided amble down elm street and across the bridge the long wagon had been filled up with board seats and when miss cordelia came back over the bridge the boards were crowded with factory childrenpalefaced little creatures whose eyes were aglow with pleasure at this unexpected outing  miss cordelia drove straight out to the big pineclad hills of deepdale six miles from pottstown then she tied nap in a convenient lane and turned the children loose to revel in the woods and fields how they did enjoy themselves and how miss cordelia enjoyed seeing them enjoy themselves  when dinner time came she gathered them all around her and went to the wagon in it she had a basket of bread and butter  i cant afford anything more she told cynthia ann but they must have something to stay their little stomachs and i can get some water at a farmhouse  miss cordelia had had her eye on a certain farmhouse all the morning she did not know anything about the people who lived there but she liked the looks of the place it was a big white greenshuttered house throned in widespreading orchards with a green sweep of velvety lawn in front  to this miss cordelia took her way surrounded by her small passengers and they all trooped into the great farmhouse yard just as a big man stepped out of a nearby barn as he approached miss cordelia thought she had never seen anybody so much like an incarnate smile before smiles of all kinds seemed literally to riot over his ruddy face and in and out of his eyes and around the corners of his mouth  well well well he said when he came near enough to be heard is this a runaway school maam  im the runaway schoolmaam responded miss cordelia with a twinkle and these are a lot of factory children ive brought out for a saturday treat i thought i might get some water from your well and maybe you will lend us a tin dipper or two  water tut tut said the big man with three distinct smiles on his face milks the thing maammilk ill tell my housekeeper to bring some out and all of you come over to the lawn and make yourselves at home bless you maam im fond of children my name is smiles maamabraham smiles  it suits you said miss cordelia emphatically before she thought and then blushed rosyred over her bluntness  mr smiles laughed yes i guess i always have an everlasting grin on had to live up to my name you see in spite of my naturally cantankerous disposition but come this way maam i can see the hunger sticking out of those youngsters eyes well have a sort of impromptu picnic here and now ill tell my housekeeper to send out some jam too  while the children devoured their lunch miss cordelia found herself telling mr smiles all about old nap and her little project  im going to bring out a load every fine saturday all summer she said its all i can do they enjoy it so the little creatures its terrible to think how cramped their lives are they just exist in soot some of them here never saw green fields before today  mr smiles listened and beamed and twinkled until miss cordelia felt almost as dazzled as if she were looking at the sun  look here maam i like this plan of yours and i want to have a hand in helping it along bring your loads of children out here every saturday right here to beechwood farm and turn them loose in my beech woods and upland pastures ill put up some swings for them and have some games and ill provide the refreshments also trouble maam no trouble and i aint on speaking terms itll be a pleasure maam im fond of children even if i am a grumpy crossgrained old bachelor if you can give up your own holiday to give them a good time surely i can do something too  when miss cordelia and her brood of tired happy little lads and lasses ambled back to town in the golden dusk she felt that the expedition had been an emphatic success even old nap seemed to jog along eyedeep in satisfaction probably he was ruminating on the glorious afternoon he had spent in mr smiless clover pasture  every fine saturday that summer miss cordelia took some of the factory children to the country the point pleasant people nicknamed her equipage miss cordelias accommodation and it became a mild standing joke  as for mr smiles he proved a valuable assistant like miss cordelia he gave his saturdays over to the children and high weekly revel was held at beechwood farm  but when the big bronze and golden leaves began to fall in the beech woods miss cordelia sorrowfully realized that the summer was over and that the weekly outings which she had enjoyed as much as the children must soon be discontinued  i feel so sorry she told mr smiles but it cant be helped it will soon be too cold for our jaunts and of course i cant keep nap through the winter i hate to part with him ive grown so fond of him but i must  she looked regretfully at nap who was nibbling mr smiless clover aftermath he was sleek and glossy it had been the golden summer of naps life  mr smiles coughed in an embarrassed fashion miss cordelia looked at him and was amazed to see that not a smile was on or about his face he looked absurdly serious  i want to buy nap he said in a sepulchral tone but that is not the only thing i want i want you too maam im tired of being a cross old bachelor i think id like to be a cross old husband for a change do you think you could put up with me in that capacity miss cordelia my dear  miss cordelia gave a half gasp and then she had to laugh oh mr smiles ill agree to anything if youll only smile again it seems unnatural to see you look so solemn  the smiles at once broke loose and revelled over her wooers face  then you will come he said eagerly  half an hour later they had their plans made at new years miss cordelia was to leave her school and sooty pottstown and come to be mistress of beechwood farm  and look here said mr smiles every fine saturday you shall have a big roomy sleigh and nap and drive into town for some children and bring them out here for their weekly treat as usual the house is large enough to hold them goodness knows and if it isnt there are the barns for the overflow this is going to be our particular pet charity all our lives maami mean cordelia my dear  blessings on old nap said miss cordelia with a happy light in her eyes  he shall live in clover for the rest of his days added mr smiles smilingly     neds stroke of business   jump in ned i can give you a lift if youre going my way mr rogers reined up his prancing grey horse and ned allen sprang lightly into the comfortable cutter the next minute they were flying down the long glistening road rosywhite in the sunset splendour the first snow of the season had come and the sleighing was as ned said dandy  going over to windsor i suppose said mr rogers with a glance at the skates that were hanging over neds shoulder  yes sir all the carleton boys are going over tonight the moon is out and the ice is good we have to go in a body or the windsor fellows wont leave us alone theres safety in numbers  pretty hard lines when boys have to go six miles for a skate commented mr rogers  well its that or nothing laughed ned there isnt a saucerful of ice any nearer except that small pond in old dutchers field behind his barn and you know old dutcher wont allow a boy to set foot there he says they would knock down his fences climbing over them and like as not set fire to his barn  old dutcher was always a crank said mr rogers and doubtless will be to the end by the way i heard a rumour to the effect that you are soon going to take a course at the business college in trenton i hope its true  neds frank face clouded over im afraid not sir the truth is i guess mother cant afford it of course aunt ella has very kindly offered to board me free for the term but fees books and so on would require at least fifty dollars i dont expect to go  thats a pity cant you earn the necessary money yourself  ned shook his head not much chance for that in carleton mr rogers ive cudgelled my brains for the past month trying to think of some way but in vain well here is the crossroad so i must get off thank you for the drive sir  keep on thinking ned advised mr rogers as the lad jumped out perhaps youll hit on some plan yet to earn that money and if you dowell it will prove that you have good stuff in you  i think it would laughed ned to himself as he trudged away a quiet little farming village in winter isnt exactly a promising field for financial operations  at winterby corners ned found a crowd of boys waiting for him and soon paired off with his chum jim slocum jim as usual was grumbling because they had to go all the way to windsor to skate  like as not well get into a free fight with the windsorites when we get there and be chevied off the ice he complained  the rivalry which existed between the carleton and the windsor boys was bitter and of long standing  we ought to be able to hold our own tonight said ned therell be thirty of us there  if we could only get old dutcher to let us skate on his pond said jim it wouldnt hurt his old pond and the ice is always splendid on it id give a lot if we could only go there  ned was silent a sudden idea had come to him he wondered if it were feasible anyhow ill try it he said to himself ill interview old dutcher tomorrow  the skating that night was not particularly successful the small pond at windsor was crowded the windsor boys being out in force and although no positive disturbance arose they contrived to make matters unpleasant for the carletonites who tramped moodily homeward in no very good humour most of them declaring that skating or no skating they would not go to windsor again  the next day ned allen went down to see mr dutcher or old dutcher as he was universally called in carleton ned did not exactly look forward to the interview with pleasure old dutcher was a crankthere was no getting around that fact he had good days occasionally when for him he was fairly affable but they were few and far between and ned had no reason to hope that this would be one old dutcher was unmarried and his widowed sister kept house for him this poor lady had a decidedly lonely life of it for old dutcher studiously discouraged visitors his passion for solitude was surpassed only by his eagerness to make and save money although he was welltodo he would wrangle over a cent and was the terror of all who had ever had dealings with him  fortunately for ned and his project this did turn out to be one of old dutchers good days he had just concluded an advantageous bargain with a windsor cattledealer and hence he received ned with what for old dutcher might be called absolute cordiality besides although old dutcher disliked all boys on principle he disliked ned less than the rest because the boy had always treated him respectfully and had never played any tricks on him on halloween or april fools day  ive come down to see you on a little matter of business mr dutcher said ned boldly and promptly it never did to beat about the bush with old dutcher you had to come straight to the point i want to know if you will rent your pond behind the barn to me for a skatingrink  old dutchers aspect was certainly not encouraging no i wont you ought to know that i never allow anyone to skate there i aint going to have a parcel of whooping yelling youngsters tearing over my fences disturbing my sleep at nights and like as not setting fire to my barns no sir i aint going to rent that pond for no skatingrink  ned smothered a smile just wait a moment mr dutcher he said respectfully i want you to hear my proposition before you refuse definitely first ill give you ten dollars for the rent of the pond then ill see that there will be no running over your fields and climbing your fences no lighting of fire or matches about it and no whooping and yelling at nights my rink will be open only from two to six in the afternoon and from seven to ten in the evening during that time i shall always be at the pond to keep everything in order the skaters will come and go by the lane leading from the barn to the road i think that if you agree to my proposition mr dutcher you will not regret it  whats to prevent my running such a rink myself asked old dutcher gruffly  it wouldnt pay you mr dutcher answered ned promptly the carleton boys wouldnt patronize a rink run by you  old dutchers eyes twinkled it did not displease him to know that the carleton boys hated him in fact it seemed as if he rather liked it  besides went on ned you couldnt afford the time you couldnt be on the pond for eight hours a day and until ten oclock at night i can as ive nothing else to do just now if i had i wouldnt have to be trying to make money by a skatingrink  old dutcher scowled ten dollars was ten dollars and as ned had said he knew very well that he could not run a rink by himself well he said half reluctantly i suppose ill let you go ahead only remember ill hold you responsible if anything happens  ned went home in high spirits by the next day he had placards out in conspicuous placeson the schoolhouse at the forge at mr rogerss store and at winterby cornersannouncing that he had rented mr dutchers pond for a skatingrink and that tickets for the same at twentyfive cents a week for each skater could be had upon application to him  ned was not long left in doubt as to the success of his enterprise it was popular from the start there were about fifty boys in carleton and winterby and they all patronized the rink freely at first ned had some trouble with two or three rowdies who tried to evade his rules he was backed up however by old dutchers reputation and by the public opinion of the other boys as well as by his own undoubted muscle and soon had everything going smoothly the rink flourished amain and everybody even old dutcher was highly pleased  at the end of the season ned paid old dutcher his ten dollars and had plenty left to pay for books and tuition at the business college in trenton on the eve of his departure mr rogers who had kept a keen eye on neds enterprise again picked him up on the road  so you found a way after all ned he said genially i had an idea you would my bookkeeper will be leaving me about the time you will be through at the college i will be wanting in his place a young man with a good nose for business and i rather think that you will be that young man what do you say  thank you sir stammered ned scarcely believing his ears a position in mr rogerss store meant good salary and promotion he had never dared to hope for such good fortune if youthink i can give satisfaction  you manipulated old dutcher and youve earned enough in a very slowgoing place to put you through your businesscollege term so i am sure you are the man im looking for i believe in helping those who have gumption enough to help themselves so well call it a bargain ned     our runaway kite   of course there was nobody for us to play with on the big half moon but then as claude says you cant have everything we just had to make the most of each other and we did  the big half moon is miles from anywhere except the little half moon but nobody lives there so that doesnt count  we live on the big half moon we are father and claude and i and aunt esther and mimi and dick it used to be only father and claude and i it is all on account of the kite that there are more of us this is what i want to tell you about  father is the keeper of the big half moon lighthouse he has always been the keeper ever since i can remember although that isnt very long i am only eleven years old claude is twelve  in winter when the harbour is frozen over there isnt any need of a light on the big half moon and we all move over to the mainland and claude and mimi and dick and i go to school but as soon as spring comes back we sail to our own dear island so glad that we dont know what to do with ourselves  the funny part used to be that people always pitied us when the time came for us to return they said we must be so lonesome over there with no other children near us and not even a woman to look after us  why claude and i were never lonesome there was always so much to do and claude is splendid at making believe he makes the very best pirate chief i ever saw dick is pretty good but he can never roar out his orders in the bloodcurdling tones that claude can  of course claude and i would have liked to have someone to play with us because it is hard to run pirate caves and things like that with only two but we used to quarrel a good deal with the mainland children in winter so perhaps it was just as well that there were none of them on the big half moon claude and i never quarrelled we used to argue sometimes and get excited but that was as far as it ever went when i saw claude getting too excited i gave in to him he is a boy you know and they have to be humoured they are not like girls  as for having a woman to look after us i thought that just too silly and so did claude what did we need with a woman when we had father he could cook all we wanted to eat and make molasses taffy that was just like a dream he kept our clothes all mended and everything about the lighthouse was neat as wax of course i helped him lots i like pottering round  he used to hear our lessons and tell us splendid stories and saw that we always said our prayers claude and i wouldnt have done anything to make him feel bad for the world father is just lovely  to be sure he didnt seem to have any relations except us this used to puzzle claude and me everybody on the mainland had relations why hadnt we was it because we lived on an island we thought it would be so jolly to have an uncle and aunt and some cousins once we asked father about it but he looked so sorrowful all of a sudden that we wished we hadnt he said it was all his fault i didnt see how that could be but i never said anything more about it to father still i did wish we had some relations  it is always lovely out here on the big half moon in summer when it is fine the harbour is blue and calm with little winds and ripples purring over it and the mainland shores look like long blue lands where fairies dwell away out over the bar where the big ships go it is always hazy and pearltinted like the inside of the mussel shells claude says he is going to sail out there when he grows up i would like to too but claude says i cant because im a girl it is dreadfully inconvenient to be a girl at times  when it storms it is grand to see the great waves come crashing up against the big half moon as if they meant to swallow it right down you cant see the little half moon at all then it is hidden by the mist and spume  we had our pirate cave away up among the rocks where we kept an old pistol with the lock broken a rusty cutlass a pair of knee boots and claudes jute beard and wig down on the shore around one of the horns of the half moon was the mermaids pool where we sailed our toy boats and watched for sea kelpies we never saw any dick says there is no such thing as a kelpy but then dick has no imagination it is no argument against a thing that youve never seen it i have never seen the pyramids either but i know that there are pyramids  every summer we had some hobby the last summer before dick and mimi came we were crazy about kites a winter boy on the mainland showed claude how to make them and when we went back to the big half moon we made kites galore even pirating wasnt such good fun claude would go around to the other side of the big half moon and we would play shipwrecked mariners signalling to each other with kites oh it was very exciting  we had one kite that was a dandy it was as big as we could make it and covered with lovely red paper we had pasted gold tinsel stars all over it and written our names out in full on itclaude martin leete and philippa brewster leete big half moon lighthouse that kite had the most magnificent tail too  it used to scare the gulls nearly to death when we sent up our kites they didnt know what to make of them and the big half moon is such a place for gullsthere are hundreds of them here  one day there was a grand wind for kiteflying and claude and i were having a splendid time we used our smaller kites for signalling and when we got tired of that claude sent me to the house for the big one im sure i dont know how it happened but when i was coming back over the rocks i tripped and fell and my elbow went clear through that lovely kite you would never have believed that one small elbow could make such a big hole claude said it was just like a girl to fall and stick her elbow through a kite but i dont see why it should be any more like a girl than a boy do you  we had to hurry to fix the kite if we wanted to send it up before the wind fell so we rushed into the lighthouse to get some paper we knew there was no more red paper and the looks of the kite were spoiled anyhow so we just took the first thing that came handyan old letter that was lying on the bookcase in the sittingroom i suppose we shouldnt have taken it although as matters turned out it was the best thing we could have done but father was away to the mainland to buy things and we never thought it could make any difference about an old yellow letter it was one father had taken from a drawer in the bookcase which he had cleaned out the night before we patched the kite up with the letter a sheet on each side and dried it by the fire then we started out and up went the kite like a bird the wind was glorious and it soared and strained like something alive all at oncesnap and there was claude standing with a bit of cord in his hand looking as foolish as a flatfish and our kite sailing along at a fearful rate of speed over to the mainland  i might have said to claude so like a boy but i didnt instead i sympathized with him and pointed out that it really didnt matter because i had spoiled it by jabbing my elbow through it by this time the kite was out of sight and we never expected to see or hear of it again                                       a month later a letter came to the big half moon for father jake wiggins brought it over in his sloop father went off by himself to read it and such a queerlooking face as he had when he came back his eyes looked as if he had been crying but that couldnt be i suppose because claude says men never cry anyhow his face was all glad and soft and smiley  do you two young pirates and freebooters want to know what has become of your kite he said  then he sat down beside us on the rocks at the mermaids pool and told us the whole story and read his letter to us it was the most amazing thing  it seems father had had relations after alla brother and a sister in particular but when he was a young man he quarrelled with his brother who didnt treat him very wellbut hes been dead for years so i wont say a word against himand had gone away from home he never went back and he never even let them know he was living  father says that this was very wrong of him and i suppose it was since he says so but i dont see how father could do anything wrong  anyway he had a sister esther whom he loved very much but he felt bitter against her too because he thought she took his brothers part too much so though a letter of hers asking him to go back did reach him he never answered it and he never heard anything more years afterward he felt sorry and went back but his brother was dead and his sister had gone away and he couldnt find out a single thing about her  so much for that and now about the kite the letter father had just received was from his sister our aunt esther and the mother of dick and mimi she was living at a place hundreds of miles inland her husband was dead and as we found out later although she did not say a word about it in the letter she was very poor one day when dick and mimi were out in the woods looking for botany specimens they saw something funny in the top of a tree dick climbed up and got it it was a big red kite with a patch on each side and names written on it they carried it home to their mother dick has since told us that she turned as pale as the dead when she saw our names on it you see philippa was her mothers name and claude was her fathers and when she read the letter that was pasted over the hole in the kite she knew who we must be for it was the very letter she had written to her brother so long ago so she sat right down and wrote again and this was the letter jake wiggins brought to the big half moon it was a beautiful letter i loved aunt esther before i ever saw her just from that letter  next day father got jake to take his place for a few days and he left claude and me over on the mainland while he went to see aunt esther when he came back he brought aunt esther and dick and mimi with him and they have been here ever since  you dont know how splendid it is aunt esther is such a dear and dick and mimi are too jolly for words they love the big half moon as well as claude and i do and dick makes a perfectly elegant shipwrecked mariner  but the best of it all is that we have relations now     the bride roses   miss corona awoke that june morning with a sigh the cause of which she was at first too sleepy to understand then it all came over her with a little sickening rush she had fallen asleep with tearwet lashes the night before on account of it  this was juliet gordons wedding day and she miss corona could not go to the wedding and was not even invited all because of the quarrel a generation old and so chronic and bitter and terrible that it always presented itself to miss coronas mental vision as spelled with a capital well might miss corona hate it it had shut her up into a lonely life for long years juliet gordon and juliets father meredith gordon were the only relations miss corona had in the world and the old family feud divided them by a gulf which now seemed impassable  miss corona turned over on her pillows lifted one corner of the white windowblind and peeped out below her a river of early sunshine was flowing through the garden and the faraway slopes were translucent green in their splendour of young day with gauzy uncertain mists lingering spiritlike in their intervales a bird his sleek plumage iridescent in the sunlight was perched on the big chestnut bough that ran squarely across the window singing as if his heart would burst with melody and the joy of his tiny life no bride could have wished anything fairer for her day of days and miss corona dropped back on her pillows with another gentle sigh  im so glad that the dear child has a fine day to be married she said  juliet gordon was always dear child to miss corona although the two had never spoken to each other in their lives  miss corona was a brisk and early riser as a rule with a genuine horror of lazy people who lay late abed or took overlong to get their eyes well opened but this morning she made no hurry about rising even though scurrying footsteps banging doors and overloud tinkling of dishes in the room below betokened that charlotta was already up and about and charlotta as poor miss corona knew only too well was fatally sure to do something unfortunate if she were not under some careful overseeing eye to be sure charlottas intentions were always good  but miss corona was not thinking about charlotta this morning and she felt so strong a distaste for her lonely purposeless life that she was in no haste to go forth to meet another day of it  miss corona felt just the least little bit tired of living although she feared it was very wicked of her to feel so she lay there listlessly for half an hour longer looking through a mist of tears at the portrait of her stern old father hanging on the wall at the foot of the bed and thinking over the quarrel  it had happened thirty years ago when miss corona had been a girl of twenty living alone with her father at the old gordon homestead on the hill with the big black spruce grove behind it on the north and farreaching slopes of green fields before it on the south down in the little northern valley below the spruce grove lived her uncle alexis gordon his son meredith had seemed to corona as her own brother the mothers of both were dead neither had any other brother or sister the two children had grown up together playmates and devoted friends there had never been any sentiment or lovemaking between them to mar a perfect comradeship they were only the best of friends whatever plans the fathers might have cherished for the union of their estates and children putting the property consideration first as the gordons were always prone to do  but if roderick and alexis gordon had any such plans all went by the board when they quarreled corona shivered yet over the bitterness of that time the gordons never did anything halfheartedly the strife between the two brothers was determined and irreconcilable  coronas father forbade her to speak to her uncle and cousin or to hold any communication with them corona wept and obeyed him she had always obeyed her father it had never entered into her mind to do anything else meredith had resented her attitude hotly and from that day they had never spoken or met while the years came and went each making a little wider and more hopeless the gulf of coldness and anger and distrust  ten years later roderick gordon died and in five months alexis gordon followed him to the grave the two brothers who had hated each other so unyieldingly in life slept very peaceably side by side in the old gordon plot of the country graveyard but their rancour still served to embitter the lives of their descendants  corona with a halfguilty sense of disloyalty to her father hoped that she and meredith might now be friends again he was married and had one little daughter in her new and intolerable loneliness coronas heart yearned after her own people but she was too timid to make any advances and meredith never made any corona believed that he hated her and let slip her last fluttering hope that the old breach would ever be healed  oh dear oh dear she sobbed softly into her pillows it seemed a terrible thing to her that one of her race and kin was to be married and she could not be present at the ceremony she who had never seen a gordon bride  when miss corona went downstairs at last she found charlotta sobbing in the kitchen porch the small handmaiden was doubled up on the floor with her face muffled in her gingham apron and her long braids of red hair hanging with limp straightness down her back when charlotta was in good spirits they always hung perkily over each shoulder tied up with enormous bows of skyblue ribbon  what have you done this time asked miss corona without the slightest intention of being humorous or sarcastic  iveive bruk your green and yaller bowl sniffed charlotta didnt mean to miss crona it jest slipped out so fashion fore i cd grab holt on it and its bruk into forty millyun pieces aint i the onluckiest girl  you certainly are sighed miss corona at any other time she would have been filled with dismay over the untoward fate of her green and yellow bowl which had belonged to her greatgrandmother and had stood on the hall table to hold flowers as long as she could remember but just now her heart was so sore over the quarrel that there was no room for other regrets well well crying wont mend it i suppose it is a judgment on me for staying abed so late go and sweep up the pieces and do try and be a little more careful charlotte  yesm said charlotta meekly she dared not resent being called charlotte just then and ill tell you what ill do maam to make up ill go and weed the garden yesm ill do it beautiful  and pull up more flowers than weeds miss corona reflected mournfully but it did not matter nothing mattered she saw charlotta sally forth into the garden with a determined doordie expression surmounting her freckles without feeling interest enough to go and make sure that she did not root out all the late asters in her tardy and wilfully postponed warfare on weeds  this mood lasted until the afternoon then miss corona whose heart and thoughts were still down in the festive house in the valley roused herself enough to go out and see what charlotta was doing after finding out she wandered idly about the rambling oldfashioned place which was full of nooks and surprises at every turn you might stumble on some clump or tangle of sweetness showering elusive fragrance on the air that you would never have suspected nothing in the garden was planted quite where it should be yet withal it was the most delightful spot imaginable  miss corona pushed her way into the cherrytree copse and followed a tiny overgrown path to a sunshiny corner beyond she had not been there since last summer the little path was getting almost impassable when she emerged from the cherry trees somewhat rumpled and pulled about in hair and attire but attended as if by a benediction by the aromatic breath of the mint she had trodden on she gave a little cry and stood quite still gazing at the rosebush that grew in the corner it was so large and woody that it seemed more like a tree than a bush and it was snowed over with a splendour of large pure white roses  dear life whispered miss corona tremulously as she tiptoed towards it the bride roses have bloomed again how very strange why there has not been a rose on that tree for twenty years  the rosebush had been planted there by coronas greatgrandmother the lady of the green and yellow bowl it was a new variety brought out from scotland by mary gordon and it bore large white roses which three generations of gordon brides had worn on their wedding day it had come to be a family tradition among the gordons that no luck would attend the bride who did not carry a white rose from mary gordons rosetree  long years ago the tree had given up blooming nor could all the pruning and care given it coax a single blossom from it miss corona tinctured with the superstition apt to wait on a lonely womanhood believed in her heart that the rosebush had a secret sympathy with the fortunes of the gordon women she the last of them on the old homestead would never need the bride roses wherefore then should the old tree bloom and now after all these years it had flung all its longhoarded sweetness into blossom again miss corona thrilled at the thought the rosebush had bloomed again for a gordon bride but miss corona was sure there was another meaning in it too she believed it foretokened some change in her own life some rejuvenescence of love and beauty like to that of the ancient rosetree she bent over its foam of loveliness almost reverently  they have bloomed for juliets wedding she murmured a gordon bride must wear the bride roses indeed she must and thiswhy it is almost a miracle  she ran lightfootedly as a girl to the house for scissors and a basket she would send juliet gordon the bride roses her cheeks were pink from excitement as she snipped them off how lovely they were how very large and fragrant it was as if all the grace and perfume and beauty and glory of those twenty lost summers were found here at once in them when miss corona had them ready she went to the door and called charlotte charlotte  now charlotta having atoned to her conscience for the destruction of the green and yellow bowl by faithfully weeding the garden a task which she hated above all else was singing a hymn among the sweet peas and her red braids were over her shoulders this ought to have warned miss corona but miss corona was thinking of other things and kept on calling patiently while charlotta weeded away for dear life and seemed smitten with treble deafness  after a time miss corona remembered and sighed she did hate to call the child that foolish name with its foreign sound just as if plain charlotte were not good enough for her and much more suitable to smith too ordinarily miss corona would not have given in but the case was urgent she could not stand upon her dignity just now  charlotta she called entreatingly  instantly charlotta flew to the garden gate and raced up to the door  yesm she said meekly you want me miss crona  take this box down to miss juliet gordon and ask that it be given to her at once said miss corona dont loiter charlotta dont stop to pick gum in the grove or eat sours in the dike or poke sticks through the bridge or  but charlotta had gone                                       down in the valley the other gordon house was in a hum of excitement upstairs juliet had gone to her invalid mothers room to show herself in her wedding dress to the pale little lady lying on the sofa she was a tall stately young girl with the dark grey gordon eyes and the pure creaminess of colouring flawless as a lily petal her face was a very sweet one and the simple white dress she wore became her dainty flowerlike beauty as nothing elaborate could have done  im not going to put on my veil until the last moment she said laughingly i would feel married right away if i did and oh mother dear isnt it too bad my roses havent come father is back from the station and they were not there i am so disappointed romney ordered pure white roses because i said a gordon bride must carry nothing else come inas a knock sounded at the door  laura burton juliets cousin and bridesmaid entered with a box  juliet dear the funniest little redheaded girl with the most enormous freckles has just brought this for you i havent an idea where she came from she looked like a messenger from pixyland  juliet opened the box and gave a cry  oh mother looklook what perfect roses who could have sent them oh heres a note fromfromwhy mother its from cousin corona      my dear child ran the letter in miss coronas fine     oldfashioned script i am sending you the gordon bride roses     the rosetree has bloomed for the first time in twenty years my     dear and it must surely be in honour of your wedding day i     hope you will wear them for although i have never known you i     love you very much i was once a dear friend of your fathers     tell him to let you wear the roses i send for old times sake i     wish you every happiness my dear                                    your affectionate cousin                                             corona gordon  oh how sweet and lovely of her said juliet gently as she laid the letter down and to think she was not even invited i wanted to send her an invitation but father said it would be better not toshe was so hard and bitter against us that she would probably regard it as an insult  he must have been mistaken about her attitude said mrs gordon it certainly is a great pity she was not invited but it is too late now an invitation sent two hours before the ceremony would be an insult indeed  not if the bride herself took it exclaimed juliet impulsively ill go myself to cousin corona and ask her to come to my wedding  go yourself child you cant do such a thing in that dress  go i must momsie why its only a three minutes walk ill go up the hill by the old fieldpath and no one will see me oh dont say a wordthere im gone  that child sighed the mother protestingly as she heard juliets flying feet on the stairs what a thing for a bride to do  juliet with her white silken skirts caught up above grasses and dust ran lightfootedly through the green lowland fields and up the hill treading for the first time the faint old fieldpath between the two homes so long disused that it was now barely visible in its fringing grasses and stardust of buttercups where it ran into the spruce grove was a tiny gate which miss corona had always kept in good repair albeit it was never used juliet pushed up the rusty hasp and ran through  miss corona was sitting alone in her shadowy parlour hanging over a few of the bride roses with falling tears when something tall and beautiful and white came in like a blessing and knelt by her chair  cousin corona said a somewhat breathless bride i have come to thank you for your roses and ask you to forgive us all for the old quarrel  dear child said miss corona out of her amazement there is nothing to forgive ive loved you all and longed for you dear child you have brought me great happiness  and you must come to my wedding cried juliet oh you mustor i shall think you have not really forgiven us you would never refuse the request of a bride cousin corona we are queens on our wedding day you know  oh its not that dear childbut im not dressedi  ill help you dress and i wont go back without you the guests and the minister must wait if necessaryyes even romney must wait oh i want you to meet romney come dear  and miss corona went charlotta and the bride got her into her grey silk and did her hair and in a very short time she and juliet were hurrying down the old fieldpath in the hollow meredith gordon met them  cousin meredith said miss corona tremulously  dear corona  he took both her hands in his and kissed her heartily forgive me for misunderstanding you so long i thought you hated us all  turning to juliet he said with a fatherly smile  what a terrible girl it is for having its own way who ever heard of a gordon bride doing such an unconventional thing there scamper off to the house before your guests come laura has made your roses up into what she calls a dream of a bouquet ill take cousin corona up more leisurely  oh i knew that something beautiful was going to happen when the old rosetree bloomed murmured miss corona happily     the josephs christmas   the month before christmas was always the most exciting and mysterious time in the joseph household such scheming and planning such putting of curly heads together in corners such counting of small hoards such hiding and smuggling of things out of sight as went on among the little josephs  there were a good many of them and very few of the pennies hence the reason for so much contriving and consulting from fourteenyearold mollie down to fouryearold lennie there were eight small josephs in all in the little log house on the prairie so that when each little joseph wanted to give a christmas box to each of the other little josephs and something to father and mother joseph besides it is no wonder that they had to cudgel their small brains for ways and means thereof  father and mother were always discreetly blind and silent through december no questions were asked no matter what queer things were done many secret trips to the little store at the railway station two miles away were ignored and no little joseph was called to account because he or she looked terribly guilty when somebody suddenly came into the room the air was simply charged with secrets  sister mollie was the grand repository of these all the little josephs came to her for advice and assistance it was mollie who for troubled small brothers and sisters did such sums in division as this how can i get a tencent present for emmy and a fifteencent one for jimmy out of eighteen cents or how can seven sticks of candy be divided among eight people so that each shall have one it was mollie who advised regarding the purchase of ribbon and crepe paper it was mollie who put the finishing touches to most of the little gifts in short all through december mollie was weighed down under an avalanche of responsibility it speaks volumes for her sagacity and skill that she never got things mixed up or made any such terrible mistake as letting one little joseph find out what another was going to give him dead secrecy was the keystone of all plans and confidences  during this particular december the planning and contriving had been more difficult and the results less satisfactory than usual the josephs were poor at any time but this winter they were poorer than ever the crops had failed in the summer and as a consequence the family were as jimmy said on short commons but they made the brave best of their small resources and on christmas eve every little joseph went to bed with a clear conscience for was there not on the corner table in the kitchen a small mountain of tinysometimes very tinygifts labelled with the names of recipients and givers and worth their weight in gold if love and good wishes count for anything  it was beginning to snow when the small small josephs went to bed and when the big small josephs climbed the stairs it was snowing thickly mr and mrs joseph sat before the fire and listened to the wind howling about the house  im glad im not driving over the prairie tonight said mr joseph its quite a storm i hope it will be fine tomorrow for the childrens sake theyve set their hearts on having a sleigh ride and it will be too bad if they cant have it when its about all the christmas theyll have this year mary this is the first christmas since we came west that we couldnt afford some little extras for them even if twas only a box of nuts and candy  mrs joseph sighed over jimmys worn jacket which she was mending then she smiled  never mind john things will be better next christmas well hope the children will not mind bless their hearts look at all the little knickknacks theyve made for each other last week when i was over at taunton mr fisher had his store all gayified up as jim says with christmas presents i did feel that id ask nothing better than to go in and buy all the lovely things i wanted just for once and give them to the children tomorrow morning theyve never had anything really nice for christmas but there weve all got each other and good health and spirits and a christmas wouldnt be much without those if we had all the presents in the world  mr joseph nodded  thats so i dont want to grumble but i tell you i did want to get maggie a real live doll as she calls it she never has had anything but homemade dolls and that small heart of hers is set on a real one there was one at fishers store todaya big beauty with real hair and eyes that opened and shut just fancy maggies face if she saw such a christmas box as that tomorrow morning  dont lets fancy it laughed mrs joseph it is only aggravating talking of candy reminds me that i made a big plateful of taffy for the children today its all the christmassy i could give them ill get it out and put it on the table along with the childrens presents that cant be someone at the door  it is though said mr joseph as he strode to the door and flung it open  two snowedup figures were standing on the porch as they stepped in the josephs recognized one of them as mr ralston a wealthy merchant in a small town fifteen miles away  late hour for callers isnt it said mr ralston the fact is our horse has about given out and the storm is so bad that we cant proceed this is my wife and we are on our way to spend christmas with my brothers family at lindsay can you take us in for the night mr joseph  certainly and welcome exclaimed mr joseph heartily if you dont mind a shakedown by the kitchen fire for the night my mrs ralston as his wife helped her off with her things but you are snowed up ill see to putting your horse away mr ralston this way if you please  when the two men came stamping into the house again mrs ralston and mrs joseph were sitting at the fire the former with a steaming hot cup of tea in her hand mr ralston put the big basket he was carrying down on a bench in the corner  thought id better bring our christmas flummery in he said you see mrs joseph my brother has a big family so we are taking them a lot of santa claus stuff mrs ralston packed this basket and goodness knows what she put in it but she half cleaned out my store the eyes of the lindsay youngsters will dance tomorrowthat is if we ever get there  mrs joseph gave a little sigh in spite of herself and looked wistfully at the heap of gifts on the corner table how meagre and small they did look to be sure beside that bulgy basket with its cover suggestively tied down  mrs ralston looked too  santa claus seems to have visited you already she said with a smile  the josephs laughed  our santa claus is somewhat out of pocket this year said mr joseph frankly those are the little things the small folks here have made for each other theyve been a month at it and im always kind of relieved when christmas is over and there are no more mysterious doings were in such cramped quarters here that you cant move without stepping on somebodys secret  a shakedown was spread in the kitchen for the unexpected guests and presently the ralstons found themselves alone mrs ralston went over to the christmas table and looked at the little gifts half tenderly and half pityingly  theyre not much like the contents of our basket are they she said as she touched the calendar jimmie had made for mollie out of cardboard and autumn leaves and grasses  just what i was thinking returned her husband and i was thinking of something else too ive a notion that id like to see some of the things in our basket right here on this table  id like to see them all said mrs ralston promptly lets just leave them here edward rogers family will have plenty of presents without them and for that matter we can send them ours when we go back home  just as you say agreed mr ralston i like the idea of giving the small folk of this household a rousing good christmas for once theyre poor i know and i dare say pretty well pinched this year like most of the farmers hereabout after the crop failure  mrs ralston untied the cover of the big basket then the two of them moving as stealthily as if engaged in a burglary transferred the contents to the table mr ralston got out a small pencil and a note book and by dint of comparing the names attached to the gifts on the table they managed to divide theirs up pretty evenly among the little josephs  when all was done mrs ralston said now im going to spread that tablecloth carelessly over the table we will be going before daylight probably and in the hurry of getting off i hope that mr and mrs joseph will not notice the difference till were gone  it fell out as mrs ralston had planned the dawn broke fine and clear over a vast white world mr and mrs joseph were early astir breakfast for the stormstayed travellers was cooked and eaten by lamplight then the horse and sleigh were brought to the door and mr ralston carried out his empty basket  i expect the trail will be heavy he said but i guess wed get to lindsay in time for dinner anyway much obliged for your kindness mr joseph when you and mrs joseph come to town we shall hope to have a chance to return it goodbye and a merry christmas to you all  when mrs joseph went back to the kitchen her eyes fell on the heapedup table in the corner  whyy she said and snatched off the cover  one look she gave and then this funny little mother began to cry but they were happy tears mr joseph came too and looked and whistled  there really seemed to be everything on that table that the hearts of children could desirethree pairs of skates a fur cap and collar a dainty workbasket half a dozen gleaming new books a writing desk a roll of stuff that looked like a new dress a pair of furtopped kid gloves just mollies size and a china cup and saucer all these were to be seen at the first glance and in one corner of the table was a big box filled with candies and nuts and raisins and in the other a doll with curling golden hair and brown eyes dressed in real clothes and with all her wardrobe in a trunk beside her pinned to her dress was a leaf from mr ralstons notebook with maggies name written on it  well this is christmas with a vengeance said mr joseph  the children will go wild with delight said his wife happily  they pretty nearly did when they all came scrambling down the stairs a little later such a christmas had never been known in the joseph household before maggie clasped her doll with shining eyes mollie looked at the workbasket that her housewifely little heart had always longed for studious jimmy beamed over the books and ted and hal whooped with delight over the skates and as for the big box of good things why everybody appreciated that that christmas was one to date from in that family  im glad to be able to say too that even in the heyday of their delight and surprise over their wonderful presents the little josephs did not forget to appreciate the gifts they had prepared for each other mollie thought her calendar just too pretty for anything and jimmy was sure the new red mittens which maggie had knitted for him with her own chubby wee fingers were the very nicest gayest mittens a boy had ever worn  mrs josephs taffy was eaten too not a scrap of it was left as ted said loyally it was just as good as the candy in the box and had more chew to it besides     the magical bond of the sea   a late september wind from the northwest was sweeping over the waters of racicot harbour it blew in strong with the tang of the salt seas past the grim lighthouse rock on the one hand and the sandbars on the other up the long narrow funnel of darkly blue water until it whistled among the masts of the boats at anchor and among the stovepipe chimneys of the fishing village it was a wind that sang and piped and keened of many thingsbut what it sang to each listener was only what was in that listeners heart and nora shelley standing at the door of her fathers bleached cottage on the grey sands heard a new strain in it the wind had sung often to her of the outer world she longed for but there had never been the note of fulfilment in it before  theres a new life beyond nora whistled the wind a good lifeand its yours for the taking you have but to put out your hand and all youve wished for will be in your grasp  nora leaned out from the door to meet the wind she loved that northwest gale it was a staunch old friend of hers very slim and straight was nora with a skin as white as the foam flakes crisping over the sands and eyes of the tremulous haunting blue that deepens on the water after a fair sunset but her hair was as black as midnight and her lips blossomed out with a ripe redness against the uncoloured purity of her face she was far and away the most beautiful of the harbour girls but hardly the most popular men and women alike thought her proud even her friends felt themselves called upon to make excuses for her unlikeness to themselves  nora had dosed the door behind her to shut in the voices she wanted to be alone with the wind while she made her decision before her the sandy shingle made firm by a straggling growth of some pale seaivy sloped down to the sapphire cup of the harbour around her were the small uncouth houses of the villageno smaller or more uncouth than the one which was her homewith children playing noisily on the paths between them the mackerel boats curtsied and nodded outside beyond them the sharp tip of sandy point was curdled white with seagulls down at the curve of the cove a group of men were laughing and talking loudly in front of french joes fishhouse this was the life that she had always known  across the harbour on a firfringed headland stood dalveigh john cameron childless millionaire had built a summer cottage on that point two years ago and given it the name of the old ancestral estate in scotland to the racicot fishing folk the house and grounds were as a dream of enchantment made real few of them had ever seen anything like it  nora shelley knew dalveigh well she had been the camerons guest many times that summer finding in the luxury and beauty of their surroundings something that entered with a strange aptness into her own nature it was as if it were hers by right of fitness and this was the life that might be hers did she so choose  in reality her choice was already made and she knew it but it pleased her to pretend for a little time that it was not and to dally tenderly withthe old loves and emotions that tugged at her heart and clamoured to be remembered  within in the lowceilinged living room with its worn uneven floor and its blackened walls hung with fish nets and oilskins four people were sitting john cameron and his wife were given the seats of honour in the middle of the room mrs cameron was a handsome welldressed woman with an expression that was discontented and at times petulant yet her face had a good deal of plain common sense in it and not even the most critical of the racicot folks could say that she put on airs her husband was a small whitehaired man with a fresh younglooking face he was popular in racicot for he mingled freely with the sailors and fishermen moreover dalveigh was an excellent market for fresh mackerel  nathan shelley in his favourite corner behind the stove sat lurching forward with his hands on his knees he had laid aside his pipe out of deference to mrs cameron and it was hard for him to think without it he wished his wife would go to work it seemed uncanny to see her idle she had sat idle only once that he rememberedthe day they had brought ned shelley in dank and dripping after the august storm ten years before mrs shelley sat by the crooked smallpaned window and looked out down the harbour the coat she had been patching for her husband when the camerons came still lay in her lap and she had folded her hands upon it she was a big woman slow of speech and manner with a placid handsome facea face that had not visibly stirred even when she had heard the camerons proposition  they wanted norathese rich people who had so much in life wanted the blossom of girlhood that had never bloomed for them john cameron pleaded his cause well  we will look on her as our own he said at last we have grown to love her this summer she is beautiful and clevershe has a right to more than racicot can give her you have other childrenwe are childless and we do not take her from you utterly you will see her every summer when we come to dalveigh  it wont be the same thing quite said nathan shelley drily shell belong to your life thennot ours and no matter how many young ones folks has they dont want to lose none of em but i dunno as we ought to let our feelings stand in noras light shes clever and shes been hankering for moren we can ever give her i was the same way once lord how i raged at racicot i broke away finallywent to a city and got work but it wasnt no use id left it too long the sea had got into my blood i toughed it out for two years and then i had to come back i didnt want to mark you but i had to come been here ever since but maybe twill be different with the girl shes younger than i was if the hankering for the sea and the life of the shore hasnt got into her too deep maybe shell be able to cut loose for good but you dont know how the sea calls to one of its own  cameron smiled he thought that this dry old salt was a bit of a poet in his own way very likely nora got her ability and originality from him there did not seem to be a great deal in the phlegmatic goodlooking mother  what say wife asked shelley at last  his wife had said in her slow way leave it to nora and to nora it was left  when she came in at last her face stung to radiant beauty by the northwest wind she found it hard to tell them after all she looked at her mother appealingly  is it go or stay girl demanded her father brusquely  i think ill go said nora slowly then catching sight of her mothers face she ran to her and flung her arms about her but ill never forget you mother she cried ill love you alwaysyou and father  her mother loosened the clinging arms and pushed her gently towards the camerons  go to them she said calmly you belong to them now  the news spread quickly over racicot before night everyone on the harbour shore knew that the camerons were going to adopt nora shelley and take her away with them there was much surprise and more envy the shore women tossed their heads  reckon nora is in great feather they said she always did think herself better than anyone else nate shelley and his wife spoiled her ridiculous wonder what rob fletcher thinks of it  nora asked her brother to tell the news to rob fletcher himself but merran andrews was before him she was at rob before he had fairly landed when the fishing boats came in at sunset  have you heard the news rob noras going away to be a fine lady the camerons have been daft about her all summer and now they are going to adopt her  merran wanted rob herself he was a big handsome fellow and welloffthe pick of the harbour men in every way he had slighted her for nora and it pleased her to stab him now though she meant to be nice to him later on  he turned white under his tan but he did not choose to make a book of his heart for merrans bold black eyes to read its a great thing for her he answered calmly she was meant for better things than can be found at racicot  she was always too good for common folks if that is what you mean said merran spitefully  nora and rob did not meet until the next evening when she rowed herself home from dalveigh he was at the shore to tie up her boat and help her out they walked up the sands together in the heart of the autumn sunset with the northwest wind whistling in their ears and the great star of the lighthouse gleaming wanly out against the golden sky nora felt uncomfortable and resented it rob fletcher was nothing to her he never had been anything but the good friend to whom she told her strange thoughts and longings why should her heart ache over him she wished he would talk but he strode along in silence with his fine head drooping a little  i suppose you have heard that i am going away rob she said at last  he nodded yes ive heard it from a hundred mouths more or less he answered not looking at her  its a splendid thing for me isnt it dared nora  well i dont know he said slowly looking at it from the outside it seems so but from the inside it maynt look the same do you think youll be able to cut twenty years of a life out of your heart without any pain  oh ill be homesick if that is what you mean said nora petulantly of course ill be that at first i expect itbut people get over that and it is not as if i were going away for good ill be back next summerevery summer  itll be different said rob stubbornly thinking as old nathan shelley had thought youll be a fine ladyoh all the better for that perhapsbut youll not be the same no no the new life will change you not all at once maybe but in the end youll be one of them not one of us but will you be happy thats the question im asking  in anyone else nora would have resented this but she never felt angry with rob  i think i shall be she said thoughtfully and anyway i must go it doesnt seem as if i could help myself if i wanted to somethingout beyond thereis calling me always has been calling me ever since i was a tiny girl and found out there was a big world far away from racicot and it always seemed to me that i would find a way to it some day that was why i kept going to school long after the other girls stopped mother thought id better stop home she said too much book learning would make me discontented and too different from the people i had to live along but father let me go he understood he said i was like him when he was young i learned everything and read everything i could it seems to me as if i had been walking along a narrow pathway all my life and now it seems as if a gate were opened before me and i can pass through into a wider world it isnt the luxury and the pleasure or the fine house and dresses that tempt me though the people here think soeven mother thinks so but it is not its just that something seems to be in my grasp that ive always longed for and i must gorob i must go  yes if you feel like that you must go he answered looking down at her troubled face gently and its best for you to go nora i believe that and im not so selfish as not to be able to hope that youll find all you long for but it will change you all the more if it is so nora nora whatever am i going to do without you  the sudden passion bursting out in his tone frightened her  dont rob dont and you wont miss me long theres many another  no there isnt dont fling me that dry bone of comfort theres no other and never has been any othernone but you nora and well you know it  im sorry she said faintly  you neednt be said rob grimly after all id rather love you than not hurt as it will i never had much hope of getting you to listen to me so theres no great disappointment there youre too good for meive always known that a girl that is fit to mate with the camerons is far above rob fletcher fisherman  i never had such a thought protested nora  i know it he said casing himself up in his quietness again but its soand now ive got to lose you but therell never be any other for me nora  he left her at her fathers door she watched his stalwart figure out of sight around the point and raged to find tears in her eyes and a bitter yearning in her heart for a moment she repentedshe would stayshe could not go then over the harbour flashed out the lights of dalveigh the life behind them glittered allured beckoned nay she must go onshe had made her choice there was no turning back now                                       nora shelley went away with the camerons and dalveigh was deserted winter came down on racicot harbour and the colony of fisher folk at its head gave themselves over to the idleness of the seasona time for lounging and gossipping and long hours of lazy contentment smoking in the neighbours chimney corners when tales were told of the sea and the fishing the harbour laid itself out to be sociable in winter there was no time for that in summer people had to work eighteen hours out of the twentyfour then in the winter there was spare time to laugh and quarrel woo and wed andwere a man so mindeddream as did rob fletcher in his loneliness  in a racicot winter much was made of small things the arrival of nora shelleys weekly letter to her father and mother was an event in the village the postmistress in the cove store spread the news that it had come and that night the shelley kitchen would be crowded isobel shelley noras younger sister read the letter aloud by virtue of having gone to school long enough to be able to pronounce the words and tell where the places named were situated  the camerons had spent the autumn in new york and had then gone south for the winter nora wrote freely of her new life in the beginning she admitted great homesickness but after the first few letters she made no further mention of that she wrote little of herself but she described fully the places she had visited the people she had met the wonderful things she had seen she sent affectionate messages to all her old friends and asked after all her old interests but the letters came to be more and more like those of a stranger and one apart from the racicot life and the father and mother felt it  shes changing muttered old nathan it had to be soits well for her that it is sobut it hurts she aint ours any more weve lost the girl wife lost her forever  rob fletcher always came and listened to the letters in silence while the others buzzed and commented rob so the harbour folk said was much changed he had grown unsociable and preferred to stay home and read books rather than go avisiting as did others the harbour folk shook their heads over this there was something wrong with a man who read books when there was a plenty of other amusements jacob radnor had read books all one winter and had drowned himself in the springjumped overboard from his dory at the herring nets and that was what came of books mark you  the camerons came later to dalveigh the next summer on account of john camerons health which was not good it was the first of august before a host of servants came to put dalveigh in habitable order and a week later the family came they brought a houseful of guests with them  at sunset on the day of her arrival nora shelley looked out cross the harbour to the fishing village she was tired after her journey and she had not meant to go over until the morning but now she knew she must go at once her mother was over there the old life called to her the northwest wind swept up the channel and whistled alluringly to her at the window of her luxurious room it brought to her the tang of the salt wastes and filled her heart with a great bittersweet yearning  she was more beautiful than ever in the year that had passed she had blossomed out to a gracious fulfilment of womanhood even the camerons had wondered at her swift adaptation to her new surroundings she seemed to have put racicot behind her as one puts by an old garment in everything she had held her own royally her adopted parents were proud of her beauty and her nameless untamed charm they had lavished every indulgence upon her in those few short months she had lived more keenly and fully than in all her life before the nora shelley who went away was not so it would seem the nora shelley who came back  but when she looked from her window to the waves and saw the star of the lighthouse and the blaze of the sunset in the window of the fishinghouses and heard the summons of the wind something broke loose in her soul and overwhelmed her like a wave of the sea she must go at onceat onceat once not a moment could she wait  she was dressed for dinner but with tingling fingers she threw off her costly gown and put on her dark travelling suit again she left her hair as it was and knotted a crimson scarf about her head she would slip away quietly to the boathouse get davy to launch the little sailboat for herand then for a fleet skim over the harbour before that glorious wind she hoped not to be seen but mrs cameron met her in the hall  nora she said in astonishment  oh i must go aunty i must go the girl cried feverishly she was afraid mrs cameron would try to prevent her going and all at once she knew that she could not bear that  must go where dinner is almost ready and  oh i dont want any dinner im going homei will sail over  my dear child dont be foolish its too late to go over the harbour tonight they wont be expecting you wait until the morning  nooh you dont understand i must goi must my mother is over there  something in the girls last sentence or the tone in which it was uttered brought a look of pain to mrs camerons face but she made no further attempt to dissuade her  well if you must but you cannot go aloneno nora i cannot allow it the wind is too high and it is too late for you to go over by yourself clark bryant will take you  nora would have protested but she knew it would be in vain she submitted somewhat sullenly and walked down to the shore in silence clark bryant strode beside her humouring her mood he was a tall stout man with an ugly clever sarcastic face he was as clever as he looked and was one of the younger millionaires whom john cameron drew around him in the development of his huge financial schemes bryant was in love with nora this was why the camerons had asked him to join their august house party at dalveigh and why he had accepted it had occurred to nora that this was the case but as yet she had never troubled to think the situation over seriously  she liked clark bryant well enough but just at the moment he was in the way she did not want to take him over to racicotjust why she could not have explained there was in her no snobbish shame of her humble home but he did not belong there he was an alien and she wished to go back to it for the first time alone  at the boathouse davy launched the small sailboat and nora took the tiller she knew every inch of the harbour as the sail filled before the wind and the boat sprang across the upcurling waves her brief sullenness fell away from her she no longer resented clark bryants presenceshe forgot it he was no more to her than the mast by which he stood the spell of the sea and the wind surged into her heart and filled it with wild happiness and measureless content over yonder where the lights gleamed on the darkening shore under the highsprung arch of pale golden sky was home how the wind whistled to welcome her back the lash of it against her facethe flick of salt spray on her lipsthe swing of the boat as it cut through the racing crestshow glorious it all was  clark bryant watched her understanding all at once that he was nothing to her that he had no part or lot in her heart he was as one forgotten and left behind and how lovely how desirable she was he had never seen her look so beautiful the shawl had slipped down to her shoulders and her head rose out of it like some magnificent flower out of a crimson calyx the masses of her black hair lifted from her face in the rush of the wind and swayed back again like rich shadows her lips were stung scarlet with the seas sharp caresses and her eyes large and splendid looked past him unseeing to the harbour lights of racicot  when they swung in by the wharf nora sprang from the boat before bryant had time to moor it pausing for an instant she called down to him carelessly dont wait for me i shall not go back tonight  then she caught her shawl around her head and almost ran up the wharf and along the shore no one was abroad for it was supper hour in racicot in the shelley kitchen the family was gathered around the table when the door was flung open and nora stood on the threshold for a moment they gazed at her as at an apparition they had not known the precise day of her coming and were not aware of the camerons arrival at dalveigh  its the girl herself its nora said old nathan rising from his bench  mother cried nora she ran across the room and buried her face in her mothers breast sobbing  when the news spread the racicot people crowded in to see nora until the house was full they spent a noisy merry wholehearted evening of the old sort the men smoked and most of the women knitted while they talked they were pleased to find that nora did not put on any airs old jonas myers bluntly told her that he didnt see as her year among rich folks had done her much good after all  youre just the same as when you went away he said they havent made a fine lady of you folks here thought youd be something wonderful  nora laughed she was glad that they did not find her changed old nathan chuckled in his dry way there was a difference in the girl and he saw it though the neighbours did not but it was not the difference he had feared his daughter was not utterly taken from him yet  nora sat by her mother and was happy but as the evening wore away she grew very quiet and watched the door with something piteous in her eyes old nathan noticed it and thought she was tired he gave the curious neighbours a goodnatured hint and they presently withdrew when they had all gone nora went out to the door alone  the wind had died down and the shore gemmed with its twinkling lights was very still for it was too late an hour for racicot folk to be abroad in the mackerel season the moon was rising and the harbour was a tossing expanse of silver waves the mellow light fell on a tall figure lurking at the angle of the road that led past the shelley cottage nora saw and recognized it she flew down the sandy slope with outstretched hands  robrob  nora he said huskily holding out his hand but she flung herself on his breast and clung to him half laughing half crying  oh rob ive been looking for you all the evening every time there was a step i said to myself that is rob now and when the door opened to let in another my heart died within me i dared not even ask after you for fear of what they might tell me why didnt you come  i didnt know that id be welcome he whispered holding her closer to him ive been hanging about thinking to get a glimpse of you unbeknown i thought maybe you wouldnt want to see me tonight  not want to see you oh rob this evening at dalveigh when i looked across to racicot it was you i thought of before alleven before mother  she drew back and looked at him with her soul in her eyes  what a splendid fellow you arehow handsome you are rob she cried all the reserve of womanhood fell away from her in the inrush of emotions for the moment she was a child again telling out her thoughts with all a childs frankness ive been in a dream this past yeara lovely dreama fair dream but only a dream after all and now ive wakened and you are part of the wakeningthe best part oh to think i never knew before  knew what my girl  he had her close against his heart now the breath of her lips mingled with his but he would not kiss her yet  that i loved you she whispered back oh rob you are all the world to me i belong to you and the sea but i never knew it until i crossed the harbour tonight then i knewit came to me all at once like a flood of understanding i knew i could never go away againthat i must stay here forever where i could hear that call of wind and waves the new life was goodgoodbut it could not go deep enough and when you did not come i knew what was in my heart for you as well                                       that night nora lay beside her sisters in the tiny room that looked out on the harbour the younger girls slept soundly but nora kept awake to listen to the laughter of the wind outside and con over what she and rob had said to each other there was no blot on her happiness save a sorry wonder what the camerons would say when they knew  they will think me ungrateful and fickle she sighed they dont know that i cant help it even if i would they will never understand  nor did they when nora told them that she was going back to racicot they laughed at her kindly at first treating it as the passing whim of a homesick girl later when they came to understand that she meant it they were grieved and angry there were scenes of pleading and tears and reproaches nora cried bitterly in mrs camerons arms but stood rockfirm she could never go back to themnever  they appealed to nathan shelley finally but he refused to say anything  it cant be altered he told them the sea has called her and shell listen to naught else im sorry enough for the girls own sake it would have been better for her if she could have cut loose from it all and lived your life i dare say but youve made a fair trial and its of no use i know whats in her heartit was in mine onceand ill say no word of rebuke to her shes free to go or stay as she choosesjust as free as she was last year  mrs cameron made one more appeal to nora she told the girl bitterly that she was ungrateful  im not that said nora with quivering lips i love you and im grateful to you but your life isnt for me after all i thought it wasi longed so for it and i loved it tooi love it yet but theres something stronger in me that holds me here  i dont think you realize what you are doing nora you have been a little homesick and you are glad to be back but after we have gone and you must settle into the old racicot life again you will not be contented you will find that your life with us will have unfitted you for this there will be no real place for you herenothing for you to do you will be as a stranger here  oh no i am going to marry rob fletcher said nora proudly  marry rob fletcher and you might have married clark bryant nora  nora shook her head that could never have been i thought it might oncebut i know better now you see i love rob  there did not seem to be anything more to say after that mrs cameron did not try to say anything she went away in sorrow  nora cried bitterly after she had gone but there were no tears in her eyes that night when she walked on the shore with rob fletcher the wind whistled around them and the stars came out in the great ebony dome of the sky over the harbour laughter and song of the fishing folk were behind them and the deep solemn call of the sea before over the harbour gleamed the score of lights at dalveigh rob looked from them to nora  do you think youll ever regret yon life my girl  never rob it seems to me now like a beautiful garment put on for a holiday and worn easily and pleasantly for a time but ive put it off now and put on workaday clothes again it is only a week since i left dalveigh but it seems long ago listen to the wind rob it is singing of the good days to be for you and me  he bent over and kissed her  my own dear lass he said softly     the martyrdom of estella   estella was waiting under the poplars at the gate for spencer morgan she was engaged to him and he always came to see her on saturday and wednesday evenings it was after sunset and the air was mellow and warmhued the willow trees along the walk and the tall birches in the background stood out darkly distinct against the lemontinted sky the breath of mint floated out from the garden and the dew was falling heavily  estella leaned against the gate listening for the sound of wheels and dreamily watching the light shining out from the window of vivienne lemars room the blind was up and she could see miss lemar writing at her table her profile was clear and distinct against the lamplight  estella reflected without the least envy that miss lemar was very beautiful she had never seen anyone who was really beautiful beforebeautiful with the loveliness of the heroines in the novels she sometimes read or the pictures she had seen  estella bowes was not pretty she was a nicelooking girl with clear eyes rosy cheeks and a pervading air of the content and happiness her life had always known she was an orphan and lived with her uncle and aunt in the summer they sometimes took a boarder for a month or two and this summer miss lemar had come she had been with them about a week she was an actress from the city and had around her all the glamour of a strange unknown life nothing was known about her the boweses liked her well enough as a boarder estella admired and held her in awe she wondered what spencer would think of this beautiful woman he had not yet seen her  it was quite dark when he came estella opened the gate for him but he got out of his buggy and walked up the lane beside her with his arm about her miss lemars light had removed to the parlour where she was singing accompanying herself on the cottage organ estella felt annoyed the parlour was considered her private domain on wednesday and saturday night but miss lemar did not know that  who is singing asked spencer what a voice she has  thats our new boarder miss lemar answered estella shes an actress and sings and does everything she is awfully pretty spencer  yes said the young man indifferently  he was not in the least interested in the boweses new boarder indeed he considered her advent a nuisance he pressed estella closer to him and when they reached the garden gate he kissed her estella always remembered that moment afterwards she was so supremely happy  spencer went off to put up his horse and estella waited for him on the porch steps wondering if any other girl in the world could be quite so happy as she was or love anyone as much as she loved spencer she did not see how it could be possible because there was only one spencer  when spencer came back she took him into the parlour half shyly half proudly he was a handsome fellow with a magnificent physique miss lemar stopped singing and turned around on the organ stool as they entered the little room was flooded with a mellow light from the pinkglobed lamp on the table and in the soft shadowy radiance she was as beautiful as a dream she wore a dress of crepe cut low in the neck estella had never seen anyone dressed so before to her it seemed immodest  she introduced spencer he bowed awkwardly and sat stiffly down by the window with his eyes riveted on miss lemars face estella catching a glimpse of herself in the oldfashioned mirror above the mantel suddenly felt a cold chill of dissatisfaction her figure had never seemed to her so stout and stiff her brown hair so dull and prim her complexion so muddy her features so commonplace she wished miss lemar would go out of the room  vivienne lemar watched the two faces before her a hard gleam half mockery half malice flashed into her eyes and a smile crept about her lips she looked straight in spencer morgans honest blue eyes and read there the young mans dazzled admiration there was contempt in the look she turned on estella  you were singing when we came in said spencer wont you go on please i am very fond of music  miss lemar turned again to the organ the gleaming curves of her neck and shoulders rose out of their filmy sheathings of lace spencer sitting where he could see her face with its roseleaf bloom and the ringlets of golden hair clustering about it gazed at her unheeding of aught else estella saw his look she suddenly began to hate the blackeyed witch at the organand to fear her as well why did spencer look at her like that she wished she had not brought him in at all she felt commonplace and angry and wanted to cry  vivienne lemar went on singing drifting from one sweet love song into another once she looked up at spencer morgan he rose quickly and went to her side looking down at her with a strange fire in his eyes  estella got up abruptly and left the room she was angry and jealous but she thought spencer would follow her when he did not she could not believe it she waited on the porch for him not knowing whether she were more angry or miserable she would not go back into the room vivienne lemar had stopped singing she could hear a low murmur of voices when she had waited there an hour she went in and upstairs to her room with ostentatious footsteps she was too angry to cry or to realize what had happened and still kept hoping all sorts of impossible things as she sat by her window  it was ten oclock when spencer went away and vivienne lemar passed up the hall to her room estella clenched her hands in an access of helpless rage she was very angry but under her fury was a horrible ache of pain it could not be only three hours since she had been so happy it must be more than that what had happened had she made a fool of herself ought she to have behaved in any other way perhaps spencer had come out to look for her after she had gone upstairs and not finding her had gone back to miss lemar to show her he was angry this poor hope was a small comfort she wished she had not acted as she had it looked spiteful and jealous and spencer did not like people who were spiteful and jealous she would show him she was sorry when he came back and it would be all right  she lay awake most of the night thinking out plausible reasons and excuses for spencers behaviour and trying to convince herself that she had exaggerated everything absurdly towards morning she fell asleep and awoke hardly remembering what had happened then it rolled back upon her crushingly  but she rose and dressed in better spirits it had been hardest to lie there and do nothing now the day was before her and something pleasant might happen spencer might come back in the evening she would be doubly nice to him to make up  mrs bowes looked sharply at her nieces dull eyes and pale cheeks at the breakfast table she had her own thoughts of things she was a large handsome woman with a rather harsh face  did you go upstairs last night and leave spencer morgan with miss lemar she asked bluntly  yes muttered estella  did you have a quarrel with him  no  what made you act so queer  i couldnt help it faltered the girl  the food she was eating seemed to choke her she wished she were a hundred miles away from everyone she ever knew  mrs bowes gave a grunt of dissatisfaction  well i think it is a pretty queer piece of business but if you are satisfied it isnt anyone elses concern i suppose he stayed with her till ten oclock and when he left she did everything but kiss himand she asked him to come back too i heard  aunt protested the girl  she felt as if her aunt were striking her blow after blow on a sensitive quivering spot it was bad enough to know it all but to hear it put into such cold brutal words was more than she could endure it seemed to make everything so horribly sure  i guess i had a right to listen hadnt i with such goings on in my own house youre a little fool estella bowes i dont believe that lemar girl is a bit better than she ought to be i wish id never taken her to board and if you say so ill send her packing right off and not give her a chance to make mischief atween folks  estellas suffering found vent in a burst of anger  you neednt do anything of the sort she cried  its all nonsense about spencerit was my faultand anyhow if he is so easily led away as that i am sure i dont want him i wish to goodness aunt youd leave me alone  oh very well returned mrs bowes in an offended tone it was for your own good i spoke you know best i suppose if you dont care i dont know that anyone else need  estella went about her work like one in a dream a great hatred had sprung up in her heart against vivienne lemar the simplehearted country girl felt almost murderous the whole day seemed like a nightmare to her when night came she dressed herself with feverish care for she could not quell the hope that spencer would surely come again but he did not and when she went up to bed it did not seem as if she could live through the night she lay staring wideeyed through the darkness until dawn she wished that she might cry but no tears came to her relief  next day she went to work with furious energy when her usual tasks were done she ransacked the house for other employment she was afraid if she stopped work for a moment she would go mad mrs bowes watched her with a grim pity  at night she walked to prayer meeting in the schoolhouse a mile away she always went and spencer was generally on hand to see her home he was not there tonight she wished she had not come it was dreadful to have to sit still and think she did not hear a word the minister said  she had to walk home with a crowd of girls and nerve herself to answer their merry sallies that no one might suspect she was tortured by the fear that everyone knew her shame and humiliation and was pitying her she got hysterically gay but underneath all she was constantly trying to assign a satisfactory reason for spencers nonappearance he was often kept away and of course he was a little cross at her yet as was natural if he had come before her then she could have gone down in the very dust at his feet and implored his forgiveness  when she reached home she went into the garden and sat down the calm of the night soothed her she felt happier and more hopeful she thought over all that had passed between her and spencer and all his loving assurances and the recollection comforted her she was almost happy when she went in  tomorrow is sunday she thought when she wakened in the morning her step was lighter and her face brighter mrs bowes seemed to be in a bad humour presently she said bluntly  do you know that spencer morgan was here last night  estella felt the cold tighten round her heart yet underneath it sprang up a wild sweet hope  spencer here i suppose he forgot it was prayer meeting night what did he say why didnt you tell him where i was  i dont know that he forgot it was prayer meeting night returned mrs bowes with measured emphasis tisnt likely his memory has failed so all at once he didnt ask where you was he took good care to go before you got home too miss lemar entertained him i guess she was quite capable of it  estella bent over her dishes in silence her face was deadly white  ill send her away said mrs bowes pityingly when shes gone spencer will soon come back to you  no you wont said estella fiercely if you do shell only go over to barstows and it would be worse than ever i dont careill show them both i dont care as for spencer coming back to me do you think i want her leavings hes welcome to go  hes only just fooled by her pretty face persisted mrs bowes in a clumsy effort at consolation shes just turning his head the hussy and he isnt really in his proper senses youll see hell be ashamed of himself when he comes to them again he knows very well in his heart that youre worth ten girls like her  estella faced around  aunt she said desperately you mean well i know but youre killing me i cant stand it for pitys sake dont say another word to me about this no matter what happens and dont keep looking at me as if i were a martyr she watches us and it would please her to think i cared i dontand i mean she shall see i dont i guess im well rid of a fellow as fickle as he is and ive sense enough to know it  she went upstairs then tearing off her turquoise engagement ring as she climbed the steps all sorts of wild ideas flashed through her head she would go down and confront vivienne lemarshe would rush off and find spencer and throw his ring at him no matter where he wasshe would go away where no one would ever see her again why couldnt she die was it possible people could suffer like this and yet go on living  i dont carei dont care she moaned telling the lie aloud to herself as if she hoped that by this means she would come to believe it  when twilight came she went out to the front steps and leaned her aching head against the honeysuckle trellis the sun had just set and the whole world swam in dusky golden light the wonderful beauty frightened her she felt like a blot on it  while she stood there a buggy came driving up the lane and wheeled about at the steps in it was spencer morgan  estella saw him and in spite of the maddening throb of hope that seemed suddenly to transfigure the world for her her pride rose in arms had spencer come the night before he would have found her loving and humble even now had she but been sure that he had come to see her she would have unbent but was it the other the torturing doubt stung her to the quick  she waited stubbornly resolved that she would not speak first it was not in her place spencer morgan flicked his horse sharply with his whip he dared not look at estella but he felt her uncompromising attitude he was miserably ashamed of himself and he felt angry at estella for his shame  do you care to come for a drive he asked awkwardly with a covert glance at the parlour windows  estella caught the glance and her jealous perception instantly divined its true significance her heart died within her she did not care what she said  oh she cried with a toss of her head its not me you wantits miss lemar isnt it shes away at the shore youll find her there i dare say  still in spite of all she perversely hoped if he would only make any sign the least in the world that he was sorrythat he still loved hershe could forgive him everything when he drove away without another word she could not believe it again surely he would not gosurely he knew she did not mean ithe would turn back before he got to the gate  but he did not she saw him disappear around the turn of the road she could not see if he took the shore lane further on but she was sure he would she was furious at herself for acting as she had done it was all her fault again oh if he would only give her another chance  she was in her room when she heard the buggy drive up again she knew it was spencer and that he had brought vivienne lemar home acting on a sudden wild impulse the girl stepped out on the landing and confronted her rival as she came up the stairs  the latter paused at sight of the white face and anguished eyes there was a little mocking smile on her lovely face  miss lemar said estella in a quivering voice what do you mean by all this you know im engaged to spencer morgan  miss lemar laughed softly  really if you are engaged to the young man my dear miss bowes i would advise you to look after him more sharply he seems very willing to flirt i should say  she passed on to her room with a malicious smile estella shrank back against the wall humiliated and baffled when she found herself alone she crawled back to her room and threw herself face downward on the bed praying that she might die  but she had to live through the horrible month that followeda month so full of agony that she seemed to draw every breath in pain spencer never sought her again he went everywhere with miss lemar his infatuation was the talk of the settlement estella knew that her story was in everyones mouth and her pride smarted but she carried a brave front outwardly no one should say she cared  she believed that the actress was merely deluding spencer for her own amusement and would never dream of marrying him but one day the idea occurred to her that she might estella had always told herself that even if spencer wanted to come back to her she would never take him back but now by the halfsick horror that came over her she knew how strong the hope had really been and despised herself more than ever  one evening she was alone in the parlour she had lit the lamp and was listlessly arranging the little room she looked old and worn her colour was gone and her eyes were dull as she worked the door opened and vivienne lemar walked or rather reeled into the room  estella dropped the book she held and gazed at her as one in a dream the actresss face was flushed and her hair was wildly disordered her eyes glittered with an unearthly light she was talking incoherently the air was heavy with the fumes of brandy  estella laughed hysterically vivienne lemar was grossly intoxicated this woman whom spencer morgan worshipped for whom he had forsaken her was reeling about the room laughing idiotically talking wildly in a thick voice if he could but see her now  estella turned white with the passion of the wild idea that had come to her spencer morgan should see this woman in her true colours  she lost no time swiftly she left the room and locked the door behind her on the maudlin babbling creature inside then she flung a shawl over her head and ran from the house it was not far to the morgan homestead she ran all the way hardly knowing what she was doing mrs morgan answered her knock she gazed in bewilderment at estellas wild face  i want spencer said the girl through her white lips  the elder woman stepped back in dumb amazement she knew and rued her sons folly what could estella want with him  the young man appeared in the doorway estella caught him by the arm and pulled him outside  miss lemar wants you at once she said hoarsely at onceyou are to come at once  has anything happened to her cried spencer savagely is she illis shewhat is the matter  no she is not ill but she wants you come at once  he started off bareheaded estella followed him up the road breathlessly surely it was the strangest walk ever a girl had she told herself with mirthless laughter she pushed the key into his hand at the porch  shes in the parlour she said wildly go in and look at her spencer  spencer snatched the key and fitted it into the door he was full of fear had estella gone out of her mind had she done anything to vivienne had she  as he entered the actress reeled to her feet and came to meet him he stood and gazed at her stupidly this could not be vivienne this creature reeking with brandy uttering such foolish words what fiend was this in her likeness  he grew sick at heart and brain she had her arms about him he tried to push her away but she clung closer and her senseless laughter echoed through the room he flung her from him with an effort and rushed out through the hall and down the road like a madman estella watching him felt that she was avenged she was glad with a joy more pitiful than grief  vivienne lemar left the cottage the next day mrs bowes suspecting some mystery questioned estella sharply but could find out nothing the girl kept her own counsel stubbornly the interest and curiosity of the village centred around spencer morgan and his case was well discussed gossip said that the actress had jilted him and that he was breaking his heart about it then came the rumour that he was going west  estella heard it apathetically life seemed ended for her there was nothing to look forward to she could not even look back all the past was embittered she had never met spencer since the night she went after him she sometimes wondered what he must think of her for what she had done did he think her unwomanly and revengeful she did not care it was rather a relief to hear that he was going away she would not be tortured by the fear of meeting him then she was sure he would never come back to her if he did she would never forgive him  one evening in early harvest estella was lingering by the lane gate at twilight she had worked slavishly all day and was very tired but she was loath to go into the house where her trouble always seemed to weigh on her more heavily the dusk sweet night seemed to soothe her as it always did  she leaned her head against the poplar by the gate how long spencer morgan had been standing by her she did not know but when she looked up he was there in the dim light she could see how haggard and holloweyed he had grown he had changed almost as much as herself  the girls first proud impulse was to turn coldly away and leave him but some strange tumult in her heart kept her still what had he come to say  there was a moments fateful silence then spencer spoke in a muffled voice  i couldnt go away without seeing you once more estella to say goodbye perhaps you wont speak to me you must hate me i deserve it  he paused but she said no word she could not after a space he went wistfully on  i know you can never forgive meno girl could ive behaved like a fool there isnt any excuse to be made for me i dont think i could have been in my right senses estella it all seems like some bad dream now when i saw her that night i came to my right mind and ive been the most miserable man alive ever since not for herbut because id lost you i cant bear to live here any longer so i am going away will you say goodbye estella  still she did not speak there were a hundred things she wanted to say but she could not say them did he mean that he loved her still if she were sure of that she could forgive him anything but her doubt rendered her mute  the young man turned away despairingly from her rigid attitude so be ithe had brought his fate on himself  he had gone but a few steps when estella suddenly found her voice with a gasp  spencer he came swiftly back oh spencerdoyoudo you love me still  he caught her hands in his  love youoh estella yes yes i always have that other wasnt loveit was just madness when it passed i hated life because id lost you i know you cant forgive me but oh  he broke down estella flung her arms around his neck and put her face up to his she felt as if her heart must break with its great happiness he understood her mute pardon in their kiss the past was put aside estellas martyrdom was ended     the old chest at wyther grange   when i was a child i always thought a visit to wyther grange was a great treat it was a big quiet oldfashioned house where grandmother laurance and mrs delisle my aunt winnifred lived i was a favourite with them yet i could never overcome a certain awe of them both grandmother was a tall dignified old lady with keen black eyes that seemed veritably to bore through one she always wore stifflyrustling gowns of rich silk made in the fashion of her youth i suppose she must have changed her dress occasionally but the impression on my mind was always the same as she went trailing about the house with a big bunch of keys at her beltkeys that opened a score of wonderful old chests and boxes and drawers it was one of my dearest delights to attend grandmother in her peregrinations and watch the unfolding and examining of all those old treasures and heirlooms of bygone laurances  of aunt winnifred i was less in awe possibly because she dressed in a modern way and so looked to my small eyes more human and natural as winnifred laurance she had been the beauty of the family and was a handsome woman still with brilliant dark eyes and cameolike features she always looked very sad spoke in a low sweet voice and was my childish ideal of all that was highbred and graceful  i had many beloved haunts at the grange but i liked the garret best it was a roomy old place big enough to have comfortably housed a family in itself and was filled with castoff furniture and old trunks and boxes of discarded finery i was never tired of playing there dressing up in the oldfashioned gowns and hats and practising oldtime dance steps before the high cracked mirror that hung at one end that old garret was a veritable fairyland to me  there was one old chest which i could not explore and like all forbidden things it possessed a great attraction for me it stood away back in a dusty cobwebbed corner a strong high wooden box painted blue from some words which i had heard grandmother let fall i was sure it had a history it was the one thing she never explored in her periodical overhaulings when i grew tired of playing i liked to creep up on it and sit there picturing out my own fancies concerning itof which my favourite one was that some day i should solve the riddle and open the chest to find it full of gold and jewels with which i might restore the fortune of the laurances and all the traditionary splendours of the old grange  i was sitting there one day when aunt winnifred and grandmother laurance came up the narrow dark staircase the latter jingling her keys and peering into the dusty corners as she came along the room when they came to the old chest grandmother rapped the top smartly with her keys  i wonder what is in this old chest she said i believe it really should be opened the moths may have got into it through that crack in the lid  why dont you open it mother said mrs delisle i am sure that key of roberts would fit the lock  no said grandmother in the tone that nobody not even aunt winnifred ever dreamed of disputing i will not open that chest without elizas permission she confided it to my care when she went away and i promised that it should never be opened until she came for it  poor eliza said mrs delisle thoughtfully i wonder what she is like now very much changed like all the rest of us i suppose it is almost thirty years since she was here how pretty she was  i never approved of her said grandmother brusquely she was a sentimental fanciful creature she might have married well but she preferred to waste her life pining over the memory of a man who was not worthy to untie the shoelace of a laurance  mrs delisle sighed softly and made no reply people said that she had had her own romance in her youth and that her mother had sternly repressed it i had heard that her marriage with mr delisle was loveless on her part and proved very unhappy but he had been dead many years and aunt winnifred never spoke of him  i have made up my mind what to do said grandmother decidedly i will write to eliza and ask her if i may open the chest to see if the moths have got into it if she refuses well and good i have no doubt that she will refuse she will cling to her old sentimental ideas as long as the breath is in her body  i rather avoided the old chest after this it took on a new significance in my eyes and seemed to me like the tomb of somethingpossibly some dead and buried romance of the past  later on a letter came to grandmother she passed it over the table to mrs delisle  that is from eliza she said i would know her writing anywherenone of your modern sprawly untidy hands but a fine ladylike script as regular as copperplate read the letter winnifred i havent my glasses and i dare say elizas rhapsodies would tire me very much you need not read them aloudi can imagine them all let me know what she says about the chest  aunt winnifred opened and read the letter and laid it down with a brief sigh  this is all she says about the chest if it were not for one thing that is in it i would ask you to open the chest and burn all its contents but i cannot bear that anyone but myself should see or touch that one thing so please leave the chest as it is dear aunt it is no matter if the moths do get in that is all continued mrs delisle and i must confess that i am disappointed i have always had an almost childish curiosity about that old chest but i seem fated not to have it gratified that one thing must be her wedding dress i have always thought that she locked it away there  her answer is just what i expected of her said grandmother impatiently evidently the years have not made her more sensible well i wash my hands of her belongings moths or no moths  it was not until ten years afterwards that i heard anything more of the old chest grandmother laurance had died but aunt winnifred still lived at the grange she was very lonely and the winter after grandmothers death she sent me an invitation to make her a long visit  when i revisited the garret and saw the old blue chest in the same dusty corner my childish curiosity revived and i begged aunt winnifred to tell me its history  i am glad you have reminded me of it said mrs delisle i have intended to open the chest ever since mothers death but i kept putting it off you know amy poor eliza laurance died five years ago but even then mother would not have the chest opened there is no reason why it should not be examined now if you like we will go and open it at once and afterwards i will tell you the story  we went eagerly up the garret stairs aunt knelt down before the old chest and selected a key from the bunch at her belt  would it not be too provoking amy if this key should not fit after all well i do not believe you would be any more disappointed than i  she turned the key and lifted the heavy lid i bent forward eagerly a layer of tissue paper revealed itself with a fine tracing of sifted dust in its crinkles  lift it up child said my aunt gently there are no ghosts for you at least in this old chest  i lifted the paper up and saw that the chest was divided into two compartments lying on the top of one was a small square inlaid box this mrs delisle took up and carried to the window lifting up the cover she laid it in my lap  there amy look through it and let us see what old treasures have lain hidden there these forty years  the first thing i took out was a small square case covered with dark purple velvet the tiny clasp was almost rusted away and yielded easily i gave a little cry of admiration aunt winnifred bent over my shoulder  that is elizas portrait at the age of twenty and that is willis starrs was she not lovely amy  lovely indeed was the face looking out at me from its border of tarnished gilt it was the face of a young girl in shape a perfect oval with delicate features and large darkblue eyes her hair caught high on the crown and falling on her neck in the long curls of a bygone fashion was a warm auburn and the curves of her bare neck and shoulders were exquisite  the other picture is that of the man to whom she was betrothed tell me amy do you think him handsome  i looked at the other portrait critically it was that of a young man of about twentyfive he was undeniably handsome but there was something i did not like in his face and i said so  aunt winnifred made no replyshe was taking out the remaining contents of the box there was a white silk fan with delicately carved ivory sticks a packet of old letters and a folded paper containing some dried and crumpled flowers aunt laid the box aside and unpacked the chest in silence first came a ball dress of paleyellow satin brocade made with the trained skirt baby waist and full puffed sleeves of a former generation beneath it was a case containing a necklace of small but perfect pearls and a pair of tiny satin slippers the rest of the compartment was filled with household linen fine and costly but yellowed with agedamask table linen and webs of the uncut fabric  in the second compartment lay a dress aunt winnifred lifted it out reverently it was a gown of rich silk that had once been white but now like the linen it was yellow with age it was simply made and trimmed with cobwebby old lace wrapped around it was a long white bridal veil redolent with some strange oldtime perfume that had kept its sweetness all through the years  well amy this is all said aunt winnifred with a quiver in her voice and now for the story where shall i begin  at the very beginning aunty you see i know nothing at all except her name tell me who she was and why she put her wedding dress away here  poor eliza said aunt dreamily it is a sorrowful story amy and it seems so long ago now i must be an old woman forty years agoand i was only twenty then eliza laurance was my cousin the only daughter of uncle henry laurance my fatheryour grandfather amy you dont remember himhad two brothers each of whom had an only daughter both these girls were called eliza after your greatgrandmother i never saw uncle georges eliza but once he was a rich man and his daughter was much sought after but she was no beauty i promise you that and proud and vain to the last degree her home was in a distant city and she never came to wyther grange  the other eliza laurance was a poor mans daughter she and i were of the same age and did not look unlike each other although i was not so pretty by half you can see by the portrait how beautiful she was and it does her scant justice for half her charm lay in her arch expression and her vivacious ways she had her little faults of course and was rather over much given to romance and sentiment this did not seem much of a defect to me then amy for i was young and romantic too mother never cared much for eliza i think but everyone else liked her one winter eliza came to wyther grange for a long visit the grange was a very lively place then amy eliza kept the old house ringing with merriment we went out a great deal and she was always the belle of any festivity we attended yet she wore her honours easily all the flattery and homage she received did not turn her head  that winter we first met willis starr he was a newcomer and nobody knew much about him but one or two of the best families took him up and his own fascinations did the rest he became what you would call the rage he was considered very handsome his manners were polished and easy and people said he was rich  i dont think amy that i ever trusted willis starr but like all the rest i was blinded by his charm mother was almost the only one who did not worship at his shrine and very often she dropped hints about penniless adventurers that made eliza very indignant  from the first he had paid eliza marked attention and seemed utterly bewitched by her well his was an easy winning eliza loved him with her whole impulsive girlish heart and made no attempt to hide it  i shall never forget the night they were first engaged it was elizas birthday and we were invited to a ball that evening this yellow gown is the very one she wore i suppose that is why she put it away herethe gown she wore on the happiest night of her life i had never seen her look more beautifulher neck and arms were bare and she wore this string of pearls and carried a bouquet of her favourite white roses  when we reached home after the dance eliza had her happy secret to tell us she was engaged to willis starr and they were to be married in early spring  willis starr certainly seemed to be an ideal lover and eliza was so perfectly happy that she seemed to grow more beautiful and radiant every day  well amy the wedding day was set eliza was to be married from the grange as her own mother was dead and i was to be bridesmaid we made her wedding dress together she and i girls were not above making their own gowns then and not a stitch was set in elizas save those put there by loving fingers and blessed by loving wishes it was i who draped the veil over her sunny curlssee how yellow and creased it is now but it was as white as snow that day  a week before the wedding willis starr was spending the evening at the grange we were all chattering gaily about the coming event and in speaking of the invited guests eliza said something about the other eliza laurance the great heiress looking archly at willis over her shoulder as she spoke it was some merry badinage about the cousin whose namesake she was but whom she so little resembled  we all laughed but i shall never forget the look that came over willis starrs face it passed quickly but the chill fear that it gave me remained a few minutes later i left the room on some trifling errand and as i returned through the dim hall i was met by willis starr he laid his hand on my arm and bent his evil facefor it was evil then amyclose to mine  tell me he said in a low but rude tone is there another eliza laurance who is an heiress  certainly there is i said sharply she is our cousin and the daughter of our uncle george our eliza is not an heiress you surely did not suppose she was  willis stepped aside with a mocking smile  i didwhat wonder i had heard much about the great heiress eliza laurance and the great beauty eliza laurance i supposed they were one and the same you have all been careful not to undeceive me  you forget yourself mr starr when you speak so to me i retorted coldly you have deceived yourself we have never dreamed of allowing anyone to think that eliza was an heiress she is sweet and lovely enough to be loved for her own sake  i went back to the parlour full of dismay willis starr remained gloomy and taciturn all the rest of the evening but nobody seemed to notice it but myself  the next day we were all so busy that i almost forgot the incident of the previous evening we girls were up in the sewing room putting the last touches to the wedding gown eliza tried it and her veil on and was standing so in all her silken splendour when a letter was brought in i guessed by her blush who was the writer i laughed and ran downstairs leaving her to read it  when i returned she was still standing just where i had left her in the middle of the room holding the letter in her hand her face was as white as her veil and her wideopen eyes had a dazed agonized look as of someone who had been stricken a mortal blow all the soft happiness and sweetness had gone out of them they were the eyes of an old woman amy  eliza what is the matter i said has anything happened to willis  she made no answer but walked to the fireplace dropped the letter in a bed of writhing blue flame and watched it burn to white ashes then she turned to me  help me take off this gown winnie she said dully i shall never wear it again there will be no wedding willis is gone  gone i echoed stupidly  yes i am not the heiress winnie it was the fortune not the girl he loved he says he is too poor for us to dream of marrying when i have nothing oh such a cruel heartless letter why did he not kill me it would have been so much more merciful i loved him soi trusted him so oh winnie winnie what am i to do  there was something terrible in the contrast between her passionate words and her calm face and lifeless voice i wanted to call mother but she would not let me she went away to her own room trailing along the dark hall in her dress and veil and locked herself in  well i told it all to the others in some fashion you can imagine their anger and dismay your father amyhe was a hotblooded impetuous young fellow thenwent at once to seek willis starr but he was gone no one knew where and the whole country rang with the gossip and scandal of the affair eliza knew nothing of this for she was ill and unconscious for many a day in a novel or story she would have died i suppose and that would have been the end of it but this was in real life and eliza did not die although many times we thought she would  when she did recover how frightfully changed she was it almost broke my heart to see her her very nature seemed to have changed tooall her joyousness and lightheartedness were dead from that time she was a faded dispirited creature no more like the eliza we had known than the merest stranger and then after a while came other newswillis starr was married to the other eliza laurance the true heiress he had made no second mistake we tried to keep it from eliza but she found it out at last that was the day she came up here alone and packed this old chest nobody ever knew just what she put into it but you and i see now amyher ball dress her wedding gown her love letters and more than all else her youth and happinessthis old chest was the tomb of it all eliza laurance was really buried here  she went home soon after before she went she exacted a promise from mother that the old chest should be left at the grange unopened until she came for it herself but she never came back and i do not think she ever intended to and i never saw her again  that is the story of the old chest it was all over so long agothe heartbreak and the miserybut it all seems to come back to me now poor eliza  my own eyes were full of tears as aunt winnifred went down the stairs leaving me sitting dreamily there in the sunset light with the old yellowed bridal veil across my lap and the portrait of eliza laurance in my hand around me were the relics of her pitiful storythe old oftrepeated story of a faithless love and a womans broken heartthe gown she had worn the slippers in which she had danced lightheartedly at her betrothal ball her fan her pearls her glovesand it somehow seemed to me as if i were living in those old years myself as if the love and happiness the betrayal and pain were part of my own life presently aunt winnifred came back through the twilight shadows  let us put all these things back in their grave amy she said they are of no use to anyone now the linen might be bleached and used i dare saybut it would seem like a sacrilege it was mothers wedding present to eliza and the pearlswould you care to have them amy  oh no no i said with a little shiver i would never wear them aunt winnifred i should feel like a ghost if i did put everything back just as we found itonly her portrait i would like to keep that  reverently we put gowns and letters and trinkets back into the old blue chest aunt winnifred closed the lid and turned the key softly she bowed her head over it for a minute and then we went together in silence down the shadowy garret stairs of wyther grange     the osbornes christmas   cousin myra had come to spend christmas at the firs and all the junior osbornes were ready to stand on their heads with delight darbywhose real name was charlesdid it because he was only eight and at eight you have no dignity to keep up the others being older couldnt  but the fact of christmas itself awoke no great enthusiasm in the hearts of the junior osbornes frank voiced their opinion of it the day after cousin myra had arrived he was sitting on the table with his hands in his pockets and a cynical sneer on his face at least frank flattered himself that it was cynical he knew that uncle edgar was said to wear a cynical sneer and frank admired uncle edgar very much and imitated him in every possible way but to you and me it would have looked just as it did to cousin myraa very discontented and unbecoming scowl  im awfully glad to see you cousin myra explained frank carefully and your being here may make some things worth while but christmas is just a borea regular bore  that was what uncle edgar called things that didnt interest him so that frank felt pretty sure of his word nevertheless he wondered uncomfortably what made cousin myra smile so queerly  why how dreadful she said brightly i thought all boys and girls looked upon christmas as the very best time in the year  we dont said frank gloomily its just the same old thing year in and year out we know just exactly what is going to happen we even know pretty well what presents we are going to get and christmas day itself is always the same well get up in the morning and our stockings will be full of things and half of them we dont want then theres dinner its always so poky and all the uncles and aunts come to dinnerjust the same old crowd every year and they say just the same things aunt desda always says why frankie how you have grown she knows i hate to be called frankie and after dinner theyll sit round and talk the rest of the day and thats all yes i call christmas a nuisance  there isnt a single bit of fun in it said ida discontentedly  not a bit said the twins both together as they always said things  theres lots of candy said darby stoutly he rather liked christmas although he was ashamed to say so before frank  cousin myra smothered another of those queer smiles  youve had too much christmas you osbornes she said seriously it has palled on your taste as all good things will if you overdo them did you ever try giving christmas to somebody else  the osbornes looked at cousin myra doubtfully they didnt understand  we always send presents to all our cousins said frank hesitatingly thats a bore too theyve all got so many things already its no end of bother to think of something new  that isnt what i mean said cousin myra how much christmas do you suppose those little rolands down there in the hollow have or sammy abbott with his lame back or french joes family over the hill if you have too much christmas why dont you give some to them  the osbornes looked at each other this was a new idea  how could we do it asked ida  whereupon they had a consultation cousin myra explained her plan and the osbornes grew enthusiastic over it even frank forgot that he was supposed to be wearing a cynical sneer  i move we do it osbornes said he  if father and mother are willing said ida  wont it be jolly exclaimed the twins  well rather said darby scornfully he did not mean to be scornful he had heard frank saying the same words in the same tone and thought it signified approval  cousin myra had a talk with father and mother osborne that night and found them heartily in sympathy with her plans  for the next week the osbornes were agog with excitement and interest at first cousin myra made the suggestions but their enthusiasm soon outstripped her and they thought out things for themselves never did a week pass so quickly and the osbornes had never had such fun either  christmas morning there was not a single present given or received at the firs except those which cousin myra and mr and mrs osborne gave to each other the junior osbornes had asked that the money which their parents had planned to spend in presents for them be given to them the previous week and given it was without a word  the uncles and aunts arrived in due time but not with them was the junior osbornes concern they were the guests of mr and mrs osborne the junior osbornes were having a christmas dinner party of their own in the small dining room a table was spread and loaded with good things ida and the twins cooked that dinner all by themselves to be sure cousin myra had helped some and frank and darby had stoned all the raisins and helped pull the homemade candy and all together they had decorated the small dining room royally with christmas greens  then their guests came first all the little rolands from the hollow arrivedseven in all with very red shining faces and not a word to say for themselves so shy were they then came a troop from french joesfour blackeyed lads who never knew what shyness meant frank drove down to the village in the cutter and brought lame sammy back with him and soon after the last guest arrivedlittle tillie mather who was miss rankins orphan sylum girl from over the road everybody knew that miss rankin never kept christmas she did not believe in it she said but she did not prevent tillie from going to the osbornes dinner party  just at first the guests were a little stiff and unsocial but they soon got acquainted and so jolly was cousin myrawho had her dinner with the children in preference to the grownupsand so friendly the junior osbornes that all stiffness vanished what a merry dinner it was what peals of laughter went up reaching to the big dining room across the hall where the grownups sat in rather solemn state and how those guests did eat and frankly enjoy the good things before them how nicely they all behaved even to the french joes myra had secretly been a little dubious about those four mischievouslooking lads but their manners were quite flawless mrs french joe had been drilling them for three daysever since they had been invited to de chrismus dinner at de beeg house  after the merry dinner was over the junior osbornes brought in a christmas tree loaded with presents they had bought them with the money that mr and mrs osborne had meant for their own presents and a splendid assortment they were all the frenchjoe boys got a pair of skates apiece and sammy a set of beautiful books and tillie was made supremely happy with a big wax doll every little roland got just what his or her small heart had been longing for besides there were nuts and candies galore  then frank hitched up his pony again but this time into a great pung sleigh and the junior osbornes took their guests for a sleighdrive chaperoned by cousin myra it was just dusk when they got back having driven the rolands and the french joes and sammy and tillie to their respective homes  this has been the jolliest christmas i ever spent said frank emphatically  i thought we were just going to give the others a good time but it was they who gave it to us said ida  werent the french joes jolly giggled the twins such cute speeches as they would make  me and teddy roland are going to be chums after this announced darby hes an inch taller than me but im wider  that night frank and ida and cousin myra had a little talk after the smaller osbornes had been haled off to bed  were not going to stop with christmas cousin myra said frank at the end of it were just going to keep on through the year weve never had such a delightful old christmas before  youve learned the secret of happiness said cousin myra gently  and the osbornes understood what she meant     the romance of aunt beatrice   margaret always maintains that it was a direct inspiration of providence that took her across the street to see aunt beatrice that night and aunt beatrice believes that it was too but the truth of the matter is that margaret was feeling very unhappy and went over to talk to aunt beatrice as the only alternative to a fit of crying margarets unhappiness has nothing further to do with this story so it may be dismissed with the remark that it did not amount to much in spite of margarets tragical attitude and was dissipated at once and forever by the arrival of a certain missent letter the next day  aunt beatrice was alone her brother and his wife had gone to the at home which mrs cunningham was giving that night in honour of the honourable john reynolds mp the children were upstairs in bed and aunt beatrice was darning their stockings a big basketful of which loomed up aggressively on the table beside her or to speak more correctly she had been darning them just when margaret was sliding across the icy street aunt beatrice was bent forward in her chair her hands over her face while soft shrinking little sobs shook her from head to foot  when margarets imperative knock came at the front door aunt beatrice started guiltily and wished earnestly that she had waited until she went to bed before crying if cry she must she knew margarets knock and she did not want her gay young niece of all people in the world to suspect the fact or the cause of her tears  i hope she wont notice my eyes she thought as she hastily plumped a big ugly darkgreen shade with an almondeyed oriental leering from it over the lamp before going out to let margaret in  margaret did not notice at first she was too deeply absorbed in her own troubles to think that anyone else in the world could be miserable too she curled up in the deep easychair by the fire and clasped her hands behind her curly head with a sigh of physical comfort and mental unhappiness while aunt beatrice warily sitting with her back to the light took up her work again  you didnt go to mrs cunninghams at home auntie said margaret lazily feeling that she must make some conversation to justify her appearance you were invited werent you  aunt beatrice nodded the hole she was darning in the knee of willie haydens stocking must be done very carefully mrs george hayden was particular about such matters perhaps this was why aunt beatrice did not speak  why didnt you go asked margaret absently wondering why there had been no letter for her that morningand this was the third day too could gilbert be ill or was he flirting with some other girl and forgetting her margaret swallowed a big lump in her throat and resolved that she would go home next weekno she wouldnt eitherif he was as hateful and fickle as thatwhat was aunt beatrice saying  well imim not used to going to parties now my dear and the truth is i have no dress fit to wear at least bella said so because the party was to be a very fashionable affair she said my old grey silk wouldnt do at all of course she knows she had to have a new dress for it and we couldnt both have that george couldnt afford it these hard times and as bella said it would be very foolish of me to get an expensive dress that would be no use to me afterward but it doesnt matter and of course somebody had to stay with the children  of course assented margaret dreamily mrs cunninghams at home was of no particular interest the guests were all middleaged people whom the mp had known in his boyhood and margaret in her presumptuous youth thought it would be a very prosy affair although it had made quite a sensation in quiet little murraybridge where people still called an at home a party plain and simple  i saw mr reynolds in church sunday afternoon she went on he is very finelooking i think did you ever meet him  i used to know him very well long ago answered aunt beatrice bowing still lower over her work he used to live down in wentworth you know and he visited his married sister here very often he was only a boy at that time thenhe went out to british columbia andandwe never heard much more about him  hes very rich and owns dozens of mines and railroads and things like that said margaret and hes a member of the dominion parliament too they say hes one of the foremost men in the house and came very near getting a portfolio in the new cabinet i like men like that they are so interesting wouldnt it be awfully nice and complimentary to have one of them in love with you is he married  ii dont know said aunt beatrice faintly i have never heard that he was  there youve run the needle into your finger said margaret sympathetically  its of no consequence said aunt beatrice hastily  she wiped away the drop of blood and went on with her work margaret watched her dreamily what lovely hair aunt beatrice had it was so thick and glossy with warm bronze tones where the lamplight fell on it under that hideous weird old shade but aunt beatrice wore it in such an unbecoming way margaret idly wondered if she would comb her hair straight back and prim when she was thirtyfive she thought it very probable if that letter did not come tomorrow  from aunt beatrices hair margarets eyes fell to aunt beatrices face she gave a little jump had aunt beatrice been crying margaret sat bolt upright  aunt beatrice did you want to go to that party she demanded explosively now tell me the truth  i did said aunt beatrice weakly margarets sudden attack fairly startled the truth out of her it is very silly of me i know but i did want to go i didnt care about a new dress id have been quite willing to wear my grey silk and i could have fixed the sleeves what difference would it have made nobody would ever have noticed me but bella thought it wouldnt do  she paused long enough to give a little sob which she could not repress margaret made use of the opportunity to exclaim violently its a shame  i suppose you dont understand why i wanted to go to this particular party so much went on aunt beatrice shyly ill tell you whyif you wont laugh at me i wanted to see john reynoldsnot to talk to himoh i dare say he wouldnt remember mebut just to see him long agofifteen years agowe were engaged andandi loved him so much then margaret  you poor dear said margaret sympathetically she reached over and patted her aunts hand she thought that this little bit of romance long hidden and unsuspected blossoming out under her eyes was charming in her interest she quite forgot her own pet grievance  yesand then we quarrelled it was a dreadful quarrel and it was about such a trifle we parted in anger and he went away he never came back it was all my fault well it is all over long ago and everybody has forgotten ii dont mind it now but i just wanted to see him once more and then come quietly away  aunt beatrice you are going to that party yet said margaret decisively  oh it is impossible my dear  no it isnt nothing is impossible when i make up my mind you must go ill drag you there by main force if it comes to that oh i have such a jolly plan auntie you know my black and yellow dinner dressno you dont either for ive never worn it here the folks at home all said it was too severe for meand so it is nothing suits me but the fluffy chuffy things with a tilt to them gileri meanwell yes gilbert always declared that dress made me look like a cross between an unwilling nun and a ballet girl so i took a dislike to it but its as lovely as a dream oh when you see it your eyes will stick out you must wear it tonight its just your style and im sure it will fit you for our figures are so much alike  but it is too late  tisnt its not more than half an hour since uncle george and aunt bella went ill have you ready in a twinkling  but the fireand the children  ill stay here and look after both i wont burn the house down and if the twins wake up ill give themwhat is it you give themsoothing syrup so go at once and get you ready while i fly over for the dress ill fix your hair up when i get back  margaret was gone before aunt beatrice could speak again her nieces excitement seized hold of her too she flung the stockings into the basket and the basket into the closet  i will goand i wont do another bit of darning tonight i hate iti hate iti hate it oh how much good it does me to say it  when margaret came flying up the stairs aunt beatrice was ready save for hair and dress margaret cast the gown on the bed revealing all its beauty of jetted lace and soft yellow silk with a dextrous sweep of her arm aunt beatrice gave a little cry of admiration  isnt it lovely demanded margaret and ive brought you my opera cape and my fascinator and my black satin slippers with the cunningest gold buckles and some sweet pale yellow roses that uncle ned gave me yesterday oh aunt beatrice what magnificent arms and shoulders you have theyre like marble mine are so scrawny im just ashamed to have people know they belong to me  margarets nimble fingers were keeping time with her tongue aunt beatrices hair went up as if by magic into soft puffs and waves and twists and a golden rose was dropped among the bronze masses then the lovely dress was put on and pinned and looped and pulled until it fell into its simple classical lines around the tall curving figure margaret stepped back and clapped her hands admiringly  oh auntie youre beautiful now ill pop down for the cloak and fascinator i left them hanging by the fire  when margaret had gone aunt beatrice caught up the lamp and tiptoed shamefacedly across the hall to the icycold spare room in the long mirror she saw herself reflected from top to toeor was it herself could it bethat gracious woman with the sweet eyes and flushed cheeks with rounded arms gleaming through their black laces and the cluster of roses nestling against the warm white flesh of the shoulder  i do look nice she said aloud with a little curtsey to the radiant reflection it is all the dress i know i feel like a queen in itno like a girl againand thats better  margaret went to mrs cunninghams door with her  how i wish i could go in and see the sensation youll make aunt beatrice she whispered  you dear silly child its just the purple and fine linen laughed aunt beatrice but she did not altogether think so and she rang the doorbell unquailingly in the hall mrs cunningham herself came beamingly to greet her  my dear beatrice im so glad bella said you could not come because you had a headache  my headache got quite better after they left and so i thought i would get ready and come even if it were rather late said beatrice glibly wondering if sapphira had ever worn a blackandyellow dress and if so might not her historic falsehood be traced to its influence  when they came downstairs together beatrice statuesque and erect in her trailing draperies and mrs cunningham secretly wondering where on earth beatrice hayden had got such a magnificent dress and what she had done to herself to make her look as she dida man came through the hall at the foot of the stairs they met he put out his hand  beatrice it must be beatrice how little you have changed  mrs cunningham was not particularly noted in murraybridge for her tact but she had a sudden visitation of the saving grace at that moment and left the two alone  beatrice put her hand into the mps  i am glad to see you she said simply looking up at him  she could not say that he had not changed for there was little in this tall broadshouldered man of the world with grey glints in his hair to suggest the slim boyish young lover whose image she had carried in her heart all the long years  but the voice though deeper and mellower was the same and the thin clever mouth that went up at one corner and down at the other in a humorous twist and one little curl of reddish hair fell over his forehead away from its orderly fellows just as it used to when she had loved to poke her fingers through it and more than all the deepset grey eyes looking down into her blue ones were unchanged beatrice felt her heart beating to her fingertips  i thought you were not coming he said i expected to meet you here and i was horribly disappointed i thought the bitterness of that foolish old quarrel must be strong enough to sway you yet  didnt bella tell you i had a headache faltered beatrice  bella oh your brothers wife i wasnt talking to her ive been sulking in corners ever since i concluded you were not coming how beautiful you are beatrice youll let an old friend say that much wont you  beatrice laughed softly she had forgotten for years that she was beautiful but the sweet old knowledge had come back to her again she could not help knowing that he spoke the simple truth but she said mirthfully  youve learned to flatter since the old days havent you dont you remember you used to tell me i was too thin to be pretty but i suppose a bit of blarney is a necessary ingredient in the composition of an mp  he was still holding her hand with a glance of dissatisfaction at the open parlour door he drew her away to the little room at the end of the hall which mrs cunningham for reasons known only to herself called her library  come in here with me he said masterfully i want to have a long talk with you before the other people get hold of you  when beatrice got home from the party ten minutes before her brother and his wife margaret was sitting turk fashion in the big armchair with her eyes very wide open and owlish  you dear girlie were you asleep asked aunt beatrice indulgently  margaret nodded yes and ive let the fire go out i hope youre not cold i must run before aunt bella gets here or shell scold had a nice time  delightful you were a dear to lend me this dress it was so funny to see bella staring at it  when margaret had put on her hat and jacket she went as far as the street door and then tiptoed back to the sittingroom aunt beatrice was leaning back in the armchair with a drooping rose held softly against her lips gazing dreamily into the dull red embers  auntie said margaret contritely i cant go home without confessing although i know it is a heinous offence to interrupt the kind of musing that goes with dying embers and faded roses in the small hours but it would weigh on my conscience all night if i didnt i was asleep but i wakened up just before you came in and went to the window i didnt mean to spy upon anyonebut that street was bright as day and if you will let an mp kiss you on the doorstep in glaring moonlight you must expect to be seen  i wouldnt have cared if there had been a dozen onlookers said aunt beatrice frankly and i dont believe he would either  margaret threw up her hands well my conscience is clear at least and remember aunt beatrice im to be bridesmaidi insist upon that and oh wont you ask me to visit you when you go down to ottawa next winter im told its such a jolly place when the house is in session and youll need somebody to help you entertain you know the wife of a cabinet minister has to do lots of that but i forgothe isnt a cabinet minister yet but he will be of course promise that youll have me aunt beatrice promise quick i hear uncle george and aunt bella coming  aunt beatrice promised margaret flew to the door  youd better keep that dress she called back softly as she opened it     the running away of chester   chester did the chores with unusual vim that night his lips were set and there was an air of resolution as plainly visible on his small freckled face as if it had been stamped there mrs elwell saw him flying around and her grim features took on a still grimmer expression  ches is mighty lively tonight she muttered i spose hes in a gog to be off on some foolishness with henry wilson well he wont and he neednt think it  lige barton the hired man also thought this was chesters purpose but he took a more lenient view of it than did mrs elwell  the little chap is going through things with a rush this evening he reflected guess hes laying out for a bit of fun with the wilson boy  but chester was not planning anything connected with henry wilson who lived on the other side of the pond and was the only chum he possessed after the chores were done he lingered a little while around the barns getting his courage keyed up to the necessary pitch  chester stephens was an orphan without kith or kin in the world unless his fathers stepsister mrs harriet elwell could be called so his parents had died in his babyhood and mrs elwell had taken him to bring up she was a harsh woman with a violent temper and she had scolded and worried the boy all his short life upton people said it was a shame but nobody felt called upon to interfere mrs elwell was not a person one would care to make an enemy of  she eyed chester sourly when he went in expecting some request to be allowed to go with henry and prepared to refuse it sharply  aunt harriet said chester suddenly can i go to school this year it begins tomorrow  no said mrs elwell when she had recovered from her surprise at this unexpected question youve had schoolin in plentymoren i ever had and all youre goin to get  but aunt harriet persisted chester his face flushed with earnestness im nearly thirteen and i can barely read and write a little the other boys are ever so far ahead of me i dont know anything  you know enough to be disrespectful exclaimed mrs elwell i suppose you want to go to school to idle away your time as you do at homelazy goodfornothing that you are chester thought of the drudgery that had been his portion all his life he resented being called lazy when he was willing enough to work but he made one more appeal  if youll let me go to school this year ill work twice as hard out of school to make up for itindeed i will do let me go aunt harriet i havent been to school a day for over a year  lets hear no more of this nonsense said mrs elwell taking a bottle from the shelf above her with the air of one who closes a discussion here run down to the bridge and get me this bottle full of vinegar at jacobs store be smart too dye hear i aint going to have you idling around the bridge neither if you aint back in twenty minutes it wont be well for you  chester did his errand at the bridge with a heart full of bitter disappointment and anger  i wont stand it any longer he muttered ill run awayi dont care where so long as its away from her i wish i could get out west on the harvest excursions  on his return home as he crossed the yard in the dusk he stumbled over a stick of wood and fell the bottle of vinegar slipped from his hand and was broken on the doorstep mrs elwell saw the accident from the window she rushed out and jerked the unlucky lad to his feet  take that you sulky little cub she exclaimed cuffing his ears soundly ill teach you to break and spill things youre sent for you did it on purpose get off to bed with you this instant  chester crept off to his garret chamber with a very sullen face he was too used to being sent to bed without any supper to care much for that although he was hungry but his whole being was in a tumult of rebellion over the injustice that was meted out to him  i wont stand it he muttered over and over again ill run away i wont stay here  to talk of running away was one thing to do it without a cent in your pocket or a place to run to was another but chester had a great deal of determination in his makeup when it was fairly roused and his hard upbringing had made him older and shrewder than his years he lay awake late that night thinking out ways and means but could arrive at no satisfactory conclusion  the next day mrs elwell said ches abner stearns wants you to go up there for a fortnight while tom bixby is away and drive the milk wagon of mornings and do the chores for mrs stearns you might as well put in the time fore harvest that way as any other so hustle offand mind you behave yourself  chester heard the news gladly he had not yet devised any feasible plan for running away and he always liked to work at the stearns place to be sure mrs elwell received all the money he earned but mrs stearns was kind to him and though he had to work hard and constantly he was well fed and well treated by all  the following fortnight was a comparatively happy one for the lad but he did not forget his purpose of shaking the dust of upton from his feet as soon as possible and he cudgelled his brains trying to find a way  on the evening when he left the stearns homestead mr stearns paid him for his fortnights work much to the boys surprise for mrs elwell had always insisted that all such money should be paid directly to her chester found himself the possessor of four dollarsan amount of riches that almost took away his breath he had never in his whole life owned more than ten cents at a time as he tramped along the road home he kept his hand in his pocket holding fast to the money as if he feared it would otherwise dissolve into thin air  his mind was firmly made up he would run away once and for all this money was rightly his he had earned every cent of it it would surely last him until he found employment elsewhere at any rate he would go and even if he starved he would never come back to aunt harriets  when he reached home he found mrs elwell in an unusual state of worry lige had given warningand this on the verge of harvest  did stearns say anything about coming down tomorrow to pay me for your work she asked  no maam he didnt say a word about it said chester boldly  well i hope he will take yourself off to bed ches im sick of seeing you standing there on one foot or tother like a gander  chester had been shifting about uneasily he realized that if his project did not miscarry he would not see his aunt again and his heart softened to her harsh as she was she was the only protector he had ever known and the boy had a vague wish to carry away with him some kindly word or look from her such however was not forthcoming and chester obeyed her command and took himself off to the garret here he sat down and reflected on his plans  he must go that very night when mr stearns failed to appear on the morrow mrs elwell was quite likely to march up and demand the amount of chesters wages it would all come out then and he would lose his moneybesides no doubt getting severely punished into the bargain  his preparations did not take long he had nothing to carry with him the only decent suit of clothes he possessed was his wellworn sunday one this he put on carefully stowing away in his pocket the precious four dollars  he had to wait until he thought his aunt was asleep and it was about eleven when he crept downstairs his heart quaking within him and got out by the porch window when he found himself alone in the clear moonlight of the august night a sense of elation filled his cramped little heart he was free and he would never come back herenever  wisht i could have seen henry to say goodby to him though he muttered with a wistful glance at the big house across the pond where the unconscious henry was sleeping soundly with never a thought of moonlight flittings for anyone in his curly head  chester meant to walk to roxbury station ten miles away nobody knew him there and he could catch the morning train late as it was he kept to fields and woodroads lest he might be seen and recognized it was three oclock when he reached roxbury and he knew the train did not pass through until six with the serenity of a philosopher who is starting out to win his way in the world and means to make the best of things chester curled himself up in the hollow space of a big lumber pile behind the station and so tired was he that he fell soundly asleep in a few minutes                                       chester was awakened by the shriek of the express at the last crossing before the station in a panic of haste he scrambled out of his lumber and dashed into the station house where a sleepy illnatured agent stood behind the ticket window he looked sharply enough at the freckled squarejawed boy who asked for a secondclass ticket to belltown chesters heart quaked within him at the momentary thought that the ticket agent recognized him he had an agonized vision of being collared without ceremony and haled straightway back to aunt harriet when the ticket and his change were pushed out to him he snatched them and fairly ran  bolted as if the police were after him reflected the agent who did not sell many tickets and so had time to take a personal interest in the purchasers thereof ive seen that youngster before though i cant recollect where hes got a most fearful determined look  chester drew an audible sigh of relief when the train left the station he was fairly off now and felt that he could defy even curious railway officials  it was not his first train ride for mrs elwell had once taken him to belltown to get an aching tooth extracted but it was certainly his first under such exhilarating circumstances and he meant to enjoy it to be sure he was very hungry but that he reflected was only what he would probably be many times before he made his fortune and it was just as well to get used to it meanwhile it behooved him to keep his eyes open on the road from roxbury to belltown there was not much to be seen that morning that chester did not see  the train reached belltown about noon he did not mean to stop long thereit was too near upton from the conductor on the train he found that a boat left belltown for montrose at two in the afternoon montrose was a hundred miles from upton and chester thought he would be safe there to montrose accordingly he decided to go but the first thing was to get some dinner he went into a grocery store and bought some crackers and a bit of cheese he had somewhere picked up the idea that crackers and cheese were about as economical food as you could find for adventurous youths starting out on small capital  he found his way to the only public square belltown boasted and munched his food hungrily on a bench under the trees he would go to montrose and there find something to do later on he would gradually work his way out west where there was more room for an ambitious small boy to expand and grow chester dreamed some dazzling dreams as he sat there on the bench under the belltown chestnuts passersby if they noticed him at all saw merely a rather small poorly clad boy with a great many freckles a square jaw and shrewd levelgazing grey eyes but this same lad was mapping out a very brilliant future for himself as people passed him heedlessly by he would get out west somehow or other some time or other and make a fortune then perhaps he would go back to upton for a visit and shine in his splendour before all his old neighbours it all seemed very easy and alluring sitting there in the quiet little belltown square chester you see possessed imagination that together with the crackers and cheese so cheered him up that he felt ready for anything he was aroused from a dream of passing aunt harriet by in lofty scorn and a glittering carriage by the shrill whistle of the boat chester pocketed his remaining crackers and cheese and his visions also and was once more his alert wideawake self he had inquired the way to the wharf from the grocer so he found no difficulty in reaching it when the boat steamed down the muddy little river chester was on board of her  he was glad to be out of belltown for he was anything but sure that he would not encounter some upton people as long as he was in it they often went to belltown on business but never to montrose  there were not many passengers on the boat and chester scrutinized them all so sharply in turn that he could have sworn to each and every one of them for years afterwards had it been necessary the one he liked best was a middleaged lady who sat just before him on the opposite side of the deck she was plump and motherly looking with a fresh rosy face and beaming blue eyes  if i was looking for anyone to adopt me id pick her said chester to himself the more he looked at her the better he liked her he labelled her in his mind as the nice rosy lady  the nice rosy lady noticed chester staring at her after awhile she smiled promptly at hima smile that seemed fairly to irradiate her round faceand then began fumbling in an oldfashioned reticule she carried and from which she presently extracted a chubby little paper bag  if you like candy little boy she said to chester here is some of my sugar taffy for you  chester did not exactly like being called a little boy but her voice and smile were irresistible and won his heart straightway he took the candy with a shy thank you maam and sat holding it in his hand  eat it commanded the rosy lady authoritatively that is what taffy is for you know  so chester ate it it was the most delicious thing he had ever tasted in his life and filled a void which even the crackers and cheese had left vacant the rosy lady watched every mouthful he ate as if she enjoyed it more than he did when he had finished the taffy she smiled one of her sociable smiles again and said well what do you think of it  its the nicest taffy i ever ate answered chester enthusiastically as if he were a connoisseur in all kinds of taffies the rosy lady nodded well pleased  that is just what everyone says about my sugar taffy nobody up our way can match it though goodness knows they try hard enough my greatgrandmother invented the recipe herself and it has been in our family ever since im real glad you liked it  she smiled at him again as if his appreciation of her taffy was a bond of good fellowship between them she did not know it but nevertheless she was filling the heart of a desperate small boy who had run away from home with hope and encouragement and selfreliance if there were such kind folks as this in the world why he would get along all right the rosy ladys smiles and taffythe smiles much more than the taffywent far to thaw out of him a certain hardness and resentfulness against people in general that aunt harriets harsh treatment had instilled into him chester instantly made a resolve that when he grew stout and rosy and prosperous he would dispense smiles and taffy and good cheer generally to all forlorn small boys on boats and trains  it was almost dark when they reached montrose chester lost sight of the rosy lady when they left the boat and it gave him a lonesome feeling but he could not indulge in that for long at a time here he was at his destinationat dark in a strange city a hundred miles from home  the first thing is to find somewhere to sleep he said to himself resolutely declining to feel frightened although the temptation was very strong  montrose was not really a very big place it was only a bustling little town of some twenty thousand inhabitants but to chesters eyes it was a vast metropolis he had never been in any place bigger than belltown and in belltown you could see one end of it at least no matter where you were montrose seemed endless to chester as he stood at the head of water street and gazed in bewilderment along one of its main business avenuesa big glittering whirling place where one small boy could so easily be swallowed up that he would never be heard of again  chester after paying his fare to montrose and buying his cheese and crackers had just sixty cents left this must last him until he found work so that the luxury of lodgings was out of the question even if he had known where to look for them to be sure there were benches in a public square right in front of him but chester was afraid that if he curled up on one of them for the night a policeman might question him and he did not believe he could give a very satisfactory account of himself in his perplexity he thought of his cosy lumber pile at roxbury station and remembered that when he had left the boat he had noticed a large vacant lot near the wharf which was filled with piles of lumber back to this he went and soon succeeded in finding a place to stow himself his last waking thought was that he must be up and doing bright and early the next morning and that it must surely be longer than twentyfour hours since he had crept downstairs and out of aunt harriets porch window at upton                                       montrose seemed less alarming by daylight which was not so bewildering as the blinking electric lights chester was up betimes ate the last of his cheese and crackers and started out at once to look for work he determined to be thorough and he went straight into every place of business he came to from a blacksmiths forge to a department store and boldly asked the first person he met if they wanted a boy there there was however one class of places chester shunned determinedly he never went into a liquor saloon the last winter he had been allowed to go to school in upton his teacher had been a pale patient little woman who hated the liquor traffic with all her heart she herself had suffered bitterly through it and she instilled into her pupils a thorough aversion to it chester would have chosen death by starvation before he would have sought for employment in a liquor saloon but there certainly did not seem room for him anywhere else nobody wanted a boy the answer to his question was invariably no as the day wore on chesters hopes and courage went down to zero but he still tramped doggedly about he would be thorough at least surely somewhere in this big place where everyone seemed so busy there must be something for him to do  once there seemed a chance of success he had gone into a big provision store and asked the clerk behind the counter if they wanted a boy  well we do said the clerk looking him over critically but i hardly think youll fill the bill however come in and see the boss  he took chester into a dark grimy little inner office where a fat stubby man was sitting before a desk with his feet upon it  hey what he said when the clerk explained looking for the place why sonny youre not half big enough  oh im a great deal bigger than i look cried chester breathlessly that is siri mean im ever so much stronger than i look ill work hard sir ever so hardand ill grow  the fat stubby man roared with laughter what was grim earnest to poor chester was a joke to him  no doubt you will my boy he said genially but im afraid youll hardly grow fast enough to suit us boys arent like pigweed you know no no our boy must be a big strapping fellow of eighteen or nineteen hell have a deal of heavy lifting to do  chester went out of the store with a queer choking in his throat for one horrible moment he thought he was going to cryhe chester stephens who had run away from home to do splendid things a nice ending that would be to his fine dreams he thrust his hands into his pockets and strode along the street biting his lips fiercely he would not cryno he would not and he would find work  chester did not cry but neither alas did he find work he parted with ten cents of his precious hoard for more crackers and he spend the night again in the lumber yard  perhaps ill have better luck tomorrow he thought hopefully  but it really seemed as if there were to be no luck for chester except bad luck day after day passed and although he tramped resolutely from street to street and visited every place that seemed to offer any chance he could get no employment in spite of his pluck his heart began to fail him  at the end of a week chester woke up among his lumber to a realization that he was at the end of his resources he had just five cents left out of the four dollars that were to have been the key to his fortune he sat gloomily on the wall of his sleeping apartment and munched the one solitary cracker he had left it must carry him through the day unless he got work the five cents must be kept for some dire emergency  he started uptown rather aimlessly in his weeks wanderings he had come to know the city very well and no longer felt confused with its size and bustle he envied every busy boy he saw back in upton he had sometimes resented the fact that he was kept working continually and was seldom allowed an hour off now he was burdened with spare time it certainly did not seem as if things were fairly divided he thought and then he thought no more just then for one of the queer spells in his head came on he had experienced them at intervals during the last three days something seemed to break loose in his head and spin wildly round and round while houses and people and trees danced and wobbled all about him chester vaguely wondered if this could be what aunt harriet had been wont to call a judgement but then he had done nothing very badnothing that would warrant a judgement he thought it was surely no harm to run away from a place where you were treated so bad and where they did not seem to want you chester felt bitter whenever he thought of aunt harriet  presently he found himself in the market square of montrose it was market day and the place was thronged with people from the surrounding country settlements chester had hoped that he might pick up a few cents holding a horse or cow for somebody or carrying a market basket but no such chance offered itself he climbed up on some bales of pressed hay in one corner and sat there moodily there was dejection in the very dangle of his legs over the bales chester you see was discovering what many a boy before him has discoveredthat it is a good deal easier to sit down and make a fortune in dreams than it is to go out into the world and make it  two men were talking to each other near him at first chester gave no heed to their conversation but presently a sentence made him prick up his ears  yes theres a pretty fair crop out at hopedale one man was saying but whether its going to be got in in good shape is another matter its terrible hard to get any help every spare manjack far and wide has gone west on them everlasting harvest excursions salome whitney at the mount hope farm is in a predicament shes got a hired man but he cant harvest grain all by himself she spent the whole of yesterday driving around trying to get a couple of men or boys to help him but i dunno if she got anyone or not  the men moved out of earshot at this juncture but chester got down from the bales with a determined look if workers were wanted in hopedale that was the place for him he had done a mans work at harvest time in upton the year before lige barton had said so himself hope and courage returned with a rush  he accosted the first man he met and asked if he could tell him the way to hopedale  reckon i can sonny i live in the next district want to go there if you wait till evening i can give you a lift part of the way its five miles out  thank you sir said chester firmly but i must go at once if youll kindly direct me its important  well its a straight road thats albemarle street down therefollow it till it takes you out to the country and then keep straight on till you come to a church painted yellow and white turn to your right and over the hill is hopedale but youd better wait for me you dont look fit to walk five miles  but chester was off walk five miles pooh he could walk twenty with hope to lure him on albemarle street finally frayed off into a real country road chester was glad to find himself out in the country once more with the great golden fields basking on either side and the wooded hills beyond purple with haze he had grown to hate the town with its cold unheeding faces it was good to breathe clear air again and feel the soft springy soil of the ferny roadside under his tired little feet  long before the five miles were covered chester began to wonder if he would hold out to the end of them he had to stop and rest frequently when those queer dizzy spells came on his feet seemed like lead but he kept doggedly on he would not give in now the white and yellow church was the most welcome sight that had ever met his eyes  over the hill he met a man and inquired the way to mount hope farm fortunately it was nearby at the gate chester had to stop again to recover from his dizziness  he liked the look of the place with its great comfortable barns and quaint roomy old farmhouse all set down in a trim quadrangle of beeches and orchards there was an appearance of peace and prosperity about it  if only miss salome whitney will hire me thought chester wistfully as he crept up the slope im afraid shell say im too small wisht i could stretch three inches all at once wisht i wasnt so dizzy wisht  what chesters third wish was will never be known for just as he reached the kitchen door the worst dizzy spell of all came on trees barns wellsweep all whirled around him with the speed of wind he reeled and fell a limp helpless little body on miss salome whitneys broad spotless sandstone doorstep                                       in the mount hope kitchen miss salome was at that moment deep in discussion with her help over the weighty question of how the damsons were to be preserved miss salome wanted them boiled clemantiny bosworth the help insisted that they ought to be baked clemantiny was always very positive she had bossed miss salome for years and both knew that in the end the damsons would be baked but the argument had to be carried out for dignitys sake  theyre so sour when theyre baked protested miss salome  well you dont want damsons sweet do you retorted clemantiny scornfully thats the beauty of damsonstheir tartness and they keep ever so much better baked salomeyou know they do my grandmother always baked hers and they would keep for three years  miss salome knew that when clemantiny dragged her grandmother into the question it was time to surrender beyond that dignity degenerated into stubbornness it would be useless to say that she did not want to keep her damsons for three years and that she was content to eat them up and trust to providence for the next years supply  well well bake them then she said placidly i dont suppose it makes much difference one way or another only i insistwhat was that noise clemantiny it sounded like something falling against the porch door  its that worthless dog of martins i suppose said clemantiny grasping a broom handle with a grimness that boded ill for the dog mussing up my clean doorstep with his dirty paws again ill fix him  clemantiny swept out through the porch and jerked open the door there was a moments silence then miss salome heard her say for the lands sake salome whitney come here  what miss salome saw when she hurried out was a whitefaced boy stretched on the doorstep at clemantinys feet  is he dead she gasped  dead no sniffed clemantiny hes fainted thats what he is where on earth did he come from he aint a hopedale boy  he must be carried right in exclaimed miss salome in distress why he may die there he must be very ill  looks more to me as if he had fainted from sheer starvation returned clemantiny brusquely as she picked him up in her lean muscular arms why hes skin and bone he aint hardly heavier than a baby well this is a mysterious piece of work wherell i put him  lay him on the sofa said miss salome as soon as she had recovered from the horror into which clemantinys starvation dictum had thrown her a child starving to death on her doorstep what do you do for people in a faint clemantiny  wet their faceand hist up their feetand loosen their collar said clemantiny in a succession of jerks doing each thing as she mentioned it and hold ammonia to their nose run for the ammonia salome look will you skin and bone  but miss salome had gone for the ammonia there was a look on the boys thin pallid face that tugged painfully at her heartstrings  when chester came back to consciousness with the pungency of the ammonia reeking through his head he found himself lying on very soft pillows in a very big white sunny kitchen where everything was scoured to a brightness that dazzled you bending over him was a tall gaunt woman with a thin determined face and snapping black eyes and standing beside her with a steaming bowl in her hand was the nice rosy lady who had given him the taffy on the boat  when he opened his eyes miss salome knew him  why its the little boy i saw on the boat she exclaimed  well youve come to said clemantiny eyeing chester severely and now perhaps youll explain what you mean by fainting away on doorsteps and scaring people out of their senses  chester thought that this must be the mistress of mount hope farm and hastened to propitiate her  im sorry he faltered feebly i didnt mean toi  youre not to do any talking until youve had something to eat snapped clemantiny inconsistently here open your mouth and take this broth pretty doings i say  clemantiny spoke as sharply as aunt harriet had ever done but somehow or other chester did not feel afraid of her and her black eyes she sat down by his side and fed him from the bowl of hot broth with a deft gentleness oddly in contrast with her grim expression  chester thought he had never in all his life tasted anything so good as that broth the boy was really almost starved he drank every drop of it clemantiny gave a grunt of satisfaction as she handed the empty bowl and spoon to the silent smiling miss salome  now who are you and what do you want she said  chester had been expecting this question and while coming along the hopedale road he had thought out an answer to it he began now speaking the words slowly and gaspingly as if reciting a hastily learned lesson  my name is chester benson i belong to upton up the country my folks are dead and i came to montrose to look for work ive been there a week and couldnt get anything to do i heard a man say that you wanted men to help in the harvest so i came out to see if youd hire me  in spite of his weakness chesters face turned very red before he got to the end of his speech he was new to deception to be sure there was not strictly speaking an untrue word in it as for his name it was chester benson stephens but for all that chester could not have felt or looked more guilty if he had been telling an outandout falsehood at every breath  humph said clemantiny in a dissatisfied tone what on earth do you suppose a midget like you can do in the harvest field and we dont want any more help anyway weve got enough  chester grew sick with disappointment but at this moment miss salome spoke up  no we havent clemantiny we want another hand and ill hire you chesterthats your name isnt it ill give you good wages too  now salome protested clemantiny  but miss salome only said ive made up my mind clemantiny  clemantiny knew that when miss salome did make up her mind and announced it in that very quiet very unmistakable tone she was mistress of the situation and intended to remain so  oh very well she retorted youll please yourself salome of course i think it would be wiser to wait until you found out a little more about him  and have him starving on peoples doorsteps in the meantime questioned miss salome severely  well returned clemantiny with the air of one who washes her hands of a doubtful proposition dont blame me if you repent of it  by this time chester had grasped the wonderful fact that his troubles were endedfor a while at least he raised himself up on one arm and looked gratefully at miss salome  thank you he said ill work hard im used to doing a lot  there there said miss salome patting his shoulder gently lie down and rest dinner will be ready soon and i guess youll be ready for it  to clemantiny she added in a low gentle tone theres a look on his face that reminded me of johnny it came out so strong when he sat up just now that it made me feel like crying dont you notice it clemantiny  cant say that i do replied that energetic person who was flying about the kitchen with a speed that made chesters head dizzy trying to follow her with his eyes all i can see is freckles and bonesbut if youre satisfied i am for laws sake dont fluster me salome theres a hundred and one things to be done out of hand this frolic has clean dundered the whole forenoons work  after dinner chester decided that it was time to make himself useful  cant i go right to work now he asked  we dont begin harvest till tomorrow said miss salome youd better rest this afternoon  oh im all right now insisted chester i feel fine please give me something to do  you can go out and cut me some wood for my afternoons baking said clemantiny and see you cut it short enough any other boy thats tried always gets it about two inches too long  when he had gone out she said scornfully to miss salome well what do you expect that size to accomplish in a harvest field salome whitney  not very much perhaps said miss salome mildly but what could i do you wouldnt have me turn the child adrift on the world again would you clemantiny  clemantiny did not choose to answer this appeal she rattled her dishes noisily into the dishpan  well where are you going to put him to sleep she demanded the hands youve got will fill the kitchen chamber theres only the spare room left youll hardly put him there i suppose your philanthropy will hardly lead you as far as that  when clemantiny employed big words and sarcasm at the same time the effect was tremendous but miss salome didnt wilt  what makes you so prejudiced against him she asked curiously  im not prejudiced against him but that story about himself didnt ring true i worked in upton years ago and there werent any bensons there then theres more behind that he hasnt told id find out what it was before i took him into my house thats all but im not prejudiced  well well said miss salome soothingly we must do the best we can for him its a sort of duty and as for a room for himwhy ill put him in johnnys  clemantiny opened her mouth and shut it again she understood that it would be a waste of breath to say anything more if miss salome had made up her mind to put this freckled determinedlooking waif dropped on her doorstep from heaven knew where into johnnys room that was an end of the matter  but ill not be surprised at anything after this she muttered as she carried her dishes into the pantry first a skinny little urchin goes and faints on her doorstep then she hires him and puts him in johnnys room johnnys room salome whitney what do you mean  perhaps miss salome hardly knew what she meant but somehow her heart went out warmly to this boy in spite of clemantinys sniffs she held to the opinion that he looked like johnny johnny was a little nephew of hers she had taken him to bring up when his parents died and she had loved him very dearly he had died four years ago and since that time the little front room over the front porch had never been occupied it was just as johnny had left it beyond keeping it scrupulously clean miss salome never allowed it to be disturbed and now a somewhat ragged lad from nowhere was to be put into it no wonder clemantiny shook her head when miss salome went up to air it                                       even clemantiny had to admit that chester was willing to work he split wood until she called him to stop then he carried in the woodbox full and piled it so neatly that even the grim handmaiden was pleased after that she sent him to the garden to pick the early beans in the evening he milked three cows and did all the chores falling into the ways of the place with a deft adaptability that went far to soften clemantinys heart  hes been taught to work somewheres she admitted grudgingly and hes real polite and respectful but he looks too cute by half and his name isnt benson any more than mine when i called him chester benson out there in the cowyard he stared at me fer half a minute sif id called him nebuchadnezzar  when bedtime came miss salome took chester up to a room whose whiteness and daintiness quite took away the breath of a lad who had been used to sleeping in garrets or hired mens kitchen chambers all his life later on miss salome came in to see if he was comfortable and stood with her candle in her hand looking down very kindly at the thin shrewd little face on the pillow  i hope youll sleep real well here chester she said i had a little boy once who used to sleep here youyou look like him good night  she bent over him and kissed his forehead chester had never been kissed by anyone before so far as he could remember something came up in his throat that felt about as big as a pumpkin at the same moment he wished he could have told miss salome the whole truth about himself i might tell her in the morning he thought as he watched her figure passing out of the little porch chamber  but on second thought he decided that this would never do he felt sure she would disapprove of his running away and would probably insist upon his going straight back to upton or at least informing aunt harriet of his whereabouts no he could not tell her  clemantiny was an early riser but when she came into the kitchen the next morning the fire was already made and chester was out in the yard with three of the five cows milked  humph said clemantiny amiably new brooms sweep clean  but she gave him cream with his porridge that morning generally all miss salomes hired hands got from clemantiny was skim milk  miss salomes regular hired man lived in a little house down in the hollow he soon turned up and the other two men she had hired for harvest also arrived martin the man looked chester over quizzically  what do you think you can do sonny  anything said chester sturdily im used to work  hes right whispered clemantiny aside hes smart as a steel trap but just you keep an eye on him all the same martin  chester soon proved his mettle in the harvest field in the brisk three weeks that followed even clemantiny had to admit that he earned every cent of his wages his active feet were untiring and his wiry arms could pitch and stock with the best when the days work was ended he brought in wood and water for clemantiny helped milk the cows gathered the eggs and made on his own responsibility a round of barns and outhouses to make sure that everything was snug and tight for the night  frecklesandbones has been well trained somewhere said clemantiny again  it was hardly fair to put the bones in now for chester was growing plump and hearty he had never been so happy in his life upton drudgery and that dreadful week in montrose seemed like a bad dream here in the golden meadows of mount hope farm he worked with a right good will the men liked him and he soon became a favourite with them even clemantiny relented somewhat to be sure she continued very grim and still threw her words at him as if they were so many missiles warranted to strike home but chester soon learned that clemantinys bark was worse than her bite she was really very good to him and fed him lavishly but she declared that this was only to put some flesh on him  it offends me to see bones sticking through anybodys skin like that we arent used to such objects at mount hope farm thank goodness yes you may smile salome i like him well enough and ill admit that he knows how to make himself useful but i dont trust him any more than ever i did hes mighty close about his past life you cant get any more out of him than juice out of a post ive tried and i know  but it was miss salome who had won chesters whole heart he had never loved anybody in his hard little life before he loved her with an almost doglike devotion he forgot that he was working to earn moneyand make his fortune he worked to please miss salome she was good and kind and gentle to him and his starved heart thawed and expanded in the sunshine of her atmosphere she went to the little porch room every night to kiss him good night chester would have been bitterly disappointed if she had failed to go  she was greatly shocked to find out that he had never said his prayers before going to bed she insisted on teaching him the simple little one she had used herself when a child when chester found that it would please her he said it every night there was nothing he would not have done for miss salome  she talked a good deal to him about johnny and she gave him the jackknife that johnny had owned  it belonged to a good manly little boy once she said and now i hope it belongs to another such  i aint very good said chester repentantly but ill try to be miss salomehonest i will  one day he heard miss salome speaking of someone who had run away from home a wicked ungrateful boy she called him chester blushed until his freckles were drowned out in a sea of red and clemantiny saw it of course when did anything ever escape those merciless black eyes of clemantinys  do you think its always wrong for a fellow to run away miss salome he faltered  it cant ever be right said miss salome decidedly  but if he wasnt treated welland was jawed atand not let go to school pleaded chester  clemantiny gave miss salome a look as of one who would say youre batblind if you cant read between the lines of that but miss salome was placidly unconscious she was not really thinking of the subject at all and did not guess that chester meant anything more than generalities  not even then she said firmly nothing can justify a boy for running awayespecially as jarvis colemen didnever even left a word behind him to say where hed gone his aunt thought hed fallen into the river  dont suppose she would have grieved much if he had said clemantiny sarcastically all the while watching chester until he felt as if she were boring into his very soul and reading all his past life  when the harvest season drew to a close dismay crept into the soul of our hero where would he go now he hated to think of leaving mount hope farm and miss salome he would have been content to stay there and work as hard as he had ever worked at upton merely for the roof over his head and the food he ate the making of a fortune seemed a small thing compared to the privilege of being near miss salome  but i suppose i must just up and go he muttered dolefully  one day miss salome had a conference with clemantiny at the end of it the latter said do as you please in the tone she might have used to a spoiled child but if youd take my advicewhich you wont and never doyoud write to somebody in upton and make inquiries about him first what he says is all very well and he sticks to it marvellous and theres no tripping him up but theres something behind salome whitneymark my words theres something behind  he looks so like johnny said miss salome wistfully  and i suppose you think that covers a multitude of sins said clemantiny contemptuously                                       on the day when the last load of rustling golden sheaves was carried into the big barn and stowed away in the dusty loft miss salome called chester into the kitchen chesters heart sank as he obeyed the summons  his time was up and now he was to be paid his wages and sent away to be sure martin had told him that morning that a man in east hopedale wanted a boy for a spell and that he martin would see that he got the place if he wanted it but that did not reconcile him to leaving mount hope farm  miss salome was sitting in her favourite sunny corner of the kitchen and clemantiny was flying around with double briskness the latters thin lips were tightly set and disapproval was writ large in every flutter of her calico skirts  chester said miss salome kindly your time is up today  chester nodded for a moment he felt as he had felt when he left the provision store in montrose but he would not let clemantiny see him cry somehow he would not have minded miss salome  what are you thinking of doing now miss salome went on  theres a man at east hopedale wants a boy said chester and martin says he thinks ill suit  that is jonas smallman said miss salome thoughtfully he has the name of being a hard master it isnt right of me to say so perhaps i really dont know much about him but wouldnt you rather stay here with me for the winter chester  maam miss salome stammered chester he heard clemantiny give a snort behind him and mutter clean infatuatedclean infatuated without in the least knowing what she meant  we really need a chore boy all the year round said miss salome martin has all he can do with the heavy work and there are the apples to be picked if you care to stay you shall have your board and clothes for doing the odd jobs and you can go to school all winter in the spring we will see what need be done then  if he would care to stay chester could have laughed aloud his eyes were shining with joy as he replied oh miss salome ill be so glad to stay iididnt want to go away ill try to do everything you want me to do ill work ever so hard  humph  this of course was from clemantiny as she set a pan of apples on the stove with an emphatic thud nobody ever doubted your willingness to work pity everything else about you isnt as satisfactory  clemantiny said miss salome rebukingly she put her arms about chester and drew him to her then it is all settled chester you are my boy now and of course i shall expect you to be a good boy  if ever a boy was determined to be good that boy was chester that day was the beginning of a new life for him he began to go to the hopedale school the next week miss salome gave him all johnnys old school books and took an eager interest in his studies  chester ought to have been very happy and at first he was but as the bright mellow days of autumn passed by a shadow came over his happiness he could not help thinking that he had really deceived miss salome and was deceiving her stillmiss salome who had such confidence in him he was not what he pretended to be and as for his running away he felt sure that miss salome would view that with horror as the time passed by and he learned more and more what a high standard of honour and truth she had he felt more and more ashamed of himself when she looked at him with her clear trustful blue eyes chester felt as guilty as if he had systematically deceived her with intent to do harm he began to wish that he had the courage to tell her the whole truth about himself  moreover he began to think that perhaps he had not done right after all in running away from aunt harriet in miss salomes code nothing could be right that was underhanded and chester was very swiftly coming to look at things through miss salomes eyes he felt sure that johnny would never have acted as he had and if chester now had one dear ambition on earth it was to be as good and manly a fellow as johnny must have been but he could never be that as long as he kept the truth about himself from miss salome  that boy has got something on his mind said the terrible clemantiny who chester felt convinced could see through a stone wall  nonsense what could he have on his mind said miss salome but she said it a little anxiously she too had noticed chesters absent ways and abstracted face  goodness me i dont know i dont suppose he has robbed a bank or murdered anybody but he is worrying over something as plain as plain  he is getting on very well at school said miss salome his teacher says so and he is very eager to learn i dont know what can be troubling him  she was fated not to know for a fortnight longer during that time chester fought out his struggle with himself and conquered he must tell miss salome he decided with a long sigh he knew that it would mean going back to upton and aunt harriet and the old hard life but he would not sail under false colours any longer                                       chester went into the kitchen one afternoon when he came home from school with his lips set and his jaws even squarer than usual miss salome was making some of her famous taffy and clemantiny was spinning yarn on the big wheel  miss salome said chester desperately if youre not too busy there is something id like to tell you  what is it asked miss salome goodhumouredly turning to him with her spoon poised in midair over her granite saucepan  its about myself iioh miss salome i didnt tell you the truth about myself ive got to tell it now my name isnt bensonexactlyand i ran away from home  dear me said miss salome mildly she dropped her spoon handle and all into the taffy and never noticed it dear me chester  i knew it said clemantiny triumphantly i knew itand i always said it run away did you  yesm my name is chester benson stephens and i lived at upton with aunt harriet elwell but she aint any relation to me really shes only fathers stepsister sheshewasnt kind to me and she wouldnt let me go to schoolso i ran away  but dear me chester didnt you know that was very wrong said miss salome in bewilderment  nomi didnt know it then ive been thinking lately that maybe it was imim real sorry  what did you say your real name was demanded clemantiny  stephens maam  and your mothers name before she was married  mary morrow said chester wondering what upon earth clemantiny meant  clemantiny turned to miss salome with an air of surrendering a dearly cherished opinion  well maam i guess you must be right about his looking like johnny i must say i never could see the resemblance but it may well be there for hethat very fellow thereand johnny are first cousins their mothers were sisters  clemantiny exclaimed miss salome  you may well say clemantiny such a coincidence it doesnt make you and him any relation of coursethe cousinship is on the mothers side but its there mary morrow was born and brought up in hopedale she went to upton when i did and married oliver stephens there why i knew his father as well as i know you  this is wonderful said miss salome then she added sorrowfully but it doesnt make your running away right chester  tell us all about it demanded clemantiny sitting down on the woodbox sit down boy sit downdont stand there looking as if you were on trial for your life tell us all about it  thus adjured chester sat down and told them all about ithis moonlight flitting and his adventures in montrose miss salome exclaimed with horror over the fact of his sleeping in a pile of lumber for seven nights but clemantiny listened in silence never taking her eyes from the boys pale face when chester finished she nodded  weve got it all now theres nothing more behind salome it would have been better for you to have told as straight a story at first young man  chester knew that but having no reply to make made none miss salome looked at him wistfully  but with it all you didnt do right to run away chester she said firmly i dare say your aunt was severe with youbut two wrongs never make a right you know  nom said chester  you must go back to your aunt continued miss salome sadly  chester nodded he knew this but he could not trust himself to speak then did clemantiny arise in her righteous indignation  well i never heard of such nonsense salome whitney what on earth do you want to send him back for i knew harriet elwell years ago and if shes still what she was then it aint much wonder chester ran away from her id say run too go back indeed you keep him right here as you should and let harriet elwell look somewhere else for somebody to scold  clemantiny expostulated miss salome  oh i must and will speak my mind salome theres no one else to take chesters part it seems you have as much claim on him as harriet elwell has she aint any real relation to him any more than you are  miss salome looked troubled perhaps there was something in clemantinys argument and she hated to think of seeing chester go he looked more like johnny than ever as he stood there with his flushed face and wistful eyes  chester she said gravely i leave it to you to decide if you think you ought to go back to your aunt well and good if not you shall stay here  this was the hardest yet chester wished she had not left the decision to him it was like cutting off his own hand but he spoke up manfully  ii think i ought to go back miss salome and i want to pay back the money too  i think so too chester although im sorry as sorry can be ill go back to upton with you well start tomorrow if when we get there your aunt is willing to let you stay with me you can come back  theres a big chance of that said clemantiny sourly a womans likely to give up a boy like chestera good steady worker and as respectful and obliging as there is between this and sunsetvery likely isnt she well this taffy is all burnt to the saucepan and clean ruinedbut whats the odds all i hope salome whitney is that the next time you adopt a boy and let him twine himself round a persons heart youll make sure first that you are going to stick to it i dont like having my affections torn up by the roots  clemantiny seized the saucepan and disappeared with it into the pantry amid a whirl of pungent smoke  mount hope farm was a strangely dismal place that night miss salome sighed heavily and often as she made her preparations for the morrows journey  clemantiny stalked about with her grim face grimmer than ever as for chester when he went to bed that night in the little porch chamber he cried heartily into his pillows he didnt care for pride any longer he just cried and didnt even pretend he wasnt crying when miss salome came in to sit by him a little while and talk to him that talk comforted chester he realized that come what might he would always have a good friend in miss salomeaye and in clemantiny too  chester never knew it but after he had fallen asleep with the tears still glistening on his brown cheeks clemantiny tiptoed silently in with a candle in her hand and bent over him with an expression of almost maternal tenderness on her face it was late and an aroma of boiling sugar hung about her she had sat up long after miss salome was abed to boil another saucepan of taffy for chester to eat on his journey  poor dear child she said softly touching one of his crisp curls its a shame in salome to insist on his going back she doesnt know what shes sending him to or she wouldnt he didnt say much against his aunt and salome thinks she was only just a little bit cranky but i could guess  early in the morning miss salome and chester started they were to drive to montrose leave their team there and take the boat for belltown chester bade farewell to the porch chamber and the long white kitchen and the friendly barns with a full heart when he climbed into the wagon clemantiny put a big bagful of taffy into his hands  goodby chester she said and remember youve always got a friend in me anyhow  then clemantiny went back into the kitchen and criedgood roughspoken tenderhearted clemantiny sat down and cried  it was an ideal day for travellingcrisp clear and sunnybut neither chester nor miss salome was in a mood for enjoyment  back over chesters runaway route they went and reached belltown on the boat that evening  they stayed in belltown overnight and in the morning took the train to roxbury station here miss salome hired a team from the storekeeper and drove out to upton  chester felt his heart sink as they drove into the elwell yard how well he knew it  miss salome tied her hired nag to the gatepost and took chester by the hand they went to the door and knocked it was opened with a jerk and mrs elwell stood before them she had probably seen them from the window for she uttered no word of surprise at seeing chester again indeed she said nothing at all but only stood rigidly before them  dear me what a disagreeablelooking woman thought miss salome but she said courteously are you mrs elwell  i am said that lady forbiddingly  ive brought your nephew home continued miss salome laying her hand encouragingly on chesters shrinking shoulder i have had him hired for some time on my farm at hopedale but i didnt know until yesterday that he had run away from you when he told me about it i thought he ought to come straight back and return your four dollars and so did he so i have brought him  you might have saved yourself the trouble then cried mrs elwell shrilly her black eyes flashed with anger im done with him and dont want the money run away when there was work to do and thinks he can come back now that its all done and loaf all winter does he he shall never enter my house again  that he shall not cried miss salome at last finding her tongue her gentle nature was grievously stirred by the heartlessness shown in the face and voice of mrs elwell that he shall not she cried again but he shall not want for a home as long as i have one to give him come chester well go home  i wish you well of him mrs elwell said sarcastically  miss salome already repented her angry retort she was afraid she had been undignified but she wished for a moment that clemantiny was there wicked as she feared it was miss salome thought she could have enjoyed a tilt between her ancient handmaid and mrs elwell  i beg your pardon mrs elwell if i have used any intemperate expressions she said with great dignity you provoked me more than was becoming by your remarks i wish you good morning  mrs elwell slammed the door shut  with her cheeks even more than usually rosy miss salome led chester down to the gate untied her horse and drove out of the yard not until they reached the main road did she trust herself to speak to the dazed lad beside her  what a disagreeable women she ejaculated at last i dont wonder you ran away chesteri dont indeed though mind you i dont think it was right for all that but im gladder than words can say that she wouldnt take you back you are mine now and you will stay mine i want you to call me aunt salome after this get up horse if we can catch that train at roxbury well be home by night yet  chester was too happy to speak he had never felt so glad and grateful in his life before  they got home that night just as the sun was setting redly behind the great maples on the western hill as they drove into the yard clemantinys face appeared gazing at them over the high board fence of the cowyard chester waved his hand at her gleefully  lawful heart said clemantiny she set down her pail and came out to the lane on a run she caught chester as he sprang from the wagon and gave him a hearty hug  im glad clean down to my boot soles to see you back again she said  hes back for good said miss salome chester youd better go in and study up your lessons for tomorrow     the strike at putney   the church at putney was one that gladdened the hearts of all the ministers in the presbytery whenever they thought about it it was such a satisfactory church while other churches here and there were continually giving trouble in one way or another the putneyites were never guilty of brewing up internal or presbyterial strife  the exeter church people were always quarrelling among themselves and carrying their quarrels to the courts of the church the very name of exeter gave the members of presbytery the cold creeps but the putney church people never quarrelled  danbridge church was in a chronic state of ministerlessness no minister ever stayed in danbridge longer than he could help the people were too critical and they were also noted heresy hunters good ministers fought shy of danbridge and poor ones met with a chill welcome the harassed presbytery worn out with supplying were disposed to think that the millennium would come if ever the danbridgians got a minister whom they liked at putney they had had the same minister for fifteen years and hoped and expected to have him for fifteen more they looked with horrorstricken eyes on the danbridge theological coquetries  bloom valley church was over head and heels in debt and had no visible prospect of ever getting out the moderator said under his breath that they did overmuch praying and too little hoeing he did not believe in faith without works tarrytown road kept its head above water but never had a cent to spare for missions or the schemes of the church  in bright and shining contradistinction to these the putney church had always paid its way and gave liberally to all departments of church work if other springs of supply ran dry the putneyites enthusiastically got up a tea or a social and so raised the money naturally the heft of this work fell on the women but they did not mindin very truth they enjoyed it the putney women had the reputation of being great church workers and they plumed themselves on it putting on airs at conventions among the less energetic women of the other churches  they were especially strong on societies there was the church aid society the girls flower band and the sewing circle there was a mission band and a helping hand among the children and finally there was the womens foreign mission auxiliary out of which the whole trouble grew which convulsed the church at putney for a brief time and furnished a standing joke in presbyterial circles for years afterwards to this day ministers and elders tell the story of the putney church strike with sparkling eyes and subdued chuckles it never grows old or stale but the putney elders are an exception they never laugh at it they never refer to it it is not in the wicked unregenerate heart of man to make a jest of his own bitter defeat  it was in june that the secretary of the putney wfm auxiliary wrote to a noted returned missionary who was touring the country asking her to give an address on mission work before their society mrs cotterell wrote back saying that her brief time was so taken up already that she found it hard to make any further engagements but she could not refuse the putney people who were so well and favourably known in mission circles for their perennial interest and liberality so although she could not come on the date requested she would if acceptable come the following sunday  this suited the putney auxiliary very well on the sunday referred to there was to be no evening service in the church owing to mr sinclairs absence they therefore appointed the missionary meeting for that night and made arrangements to hold it in the church itself as the classroom was too small for the expected audience  then the thunderbolt descended on the wfma of putney from a clear sky the elders of the church rose up to a man and declared that no woman should occupy the pulpit of the putney church it was in direct contravention to the teachings of st paul  to make matters worse mr sinclair declared himself on the elders side he said that he could not conscientiously give his consent to a woman occupying his pulpit even when that woman was mrs cotterell and her subject foreign missions  the members of the auxiliary were aghast they called a meeting extraordinary in the classroom and discarding all forms and ceremonies in their wrath talked their indignation out  out of doors the world basked in june sunshine and preened itself in blossom the birds sang and chirped in the lichened maples that cupped the little church in and peace was over all the putney valley inside the classroom disgusted women buzzed like angry bees  what on earth are we to do sighed the secretary plaintively mary kilburn was always plaintive she sat on the steps of the platform being too wrought up in her mind to sit in her chair at the desk and her thin faded little face was twisted with anxiety all the arrangements are made and mrs cotterell is coming on the tenth how can we tell her that the men wont let her speak  there was never anything like this in putney church before groaned mrs elder knox it was andrew mckittrick put them up to it i always said that man would make trouble here yet ever since he moved to putney from danbridge ive talked and argued with thomas until im dumb but he is as set as a rock  i dont see what business the men have to interfere with us anyhow said her daughter lucy who was sitting on one of the windowsills we dont meddle with them im sure as if mrs cotterell would contaminate the pulpit  one would think we were still in the dark ages said frances spenslow sharply frances was the putney schoolteacher her father was one of the recalcitrant elders and frances felt it bitterlyall the more that she had tried to argue with him and had been sat upon as a child who couldnt understand  im more surprised at mr sinclair than at the elders said mrs abner keech fanning herself vigorously elders are subject to queer spells periodically they think they assert their authority that way but mr sinclair has always seemed so liberal and broadminded  you never can tell what crotchet an old bachelor will take into his head said alethea craig bitingly  the others nodded agreement mr sinclairs inveterate celibacy was a standing grievance with the putney women  if he had a wife who could be our president this would never have happened i warrant you said mrs king sagely  but what are we going to do ladies said mrs robbins briskly mrs robbins was the president she was a big bustling woman with clear blue eyes and crisp incisive ways hitherto she had held her peace they must talk themselves out before they can get down to business she had reflected sagely but she thought the time had now come to speak  you know she went on we can talk and rage against the men all day if we like they are not trying to prevent us but that will do no good heres mrs cotterell invited and all the neighbouring auxiliaries notifiedand the men wont let us have the church the point is how are we going to get out of the scrape  a helpless silence descended upon the classroom the eyes of every woman present turned to myra wilson everyone could talk but when it came to action they had a fashion of turning to myra  she had a reputation for cleverness and originality she never talked much so far today she had not said a word she was sitting on the sill of the window across from lucy knox she swung her hat on her knee and loose moist rings of dark hair curled around her dark alert face there was a sparkle in her grey eyes that boded ill to the men who were peaceably pursuing their avocations rashly indifferent to what the women might be saying in the mapleshaded classroom  have you any suggestion to make miss wilson said mrs robbins with a return to her official voice and manner  myra put her long slender index finger to her chin  i think she said decidedly that we must strike                                       when elder knox went in to tea that evening he glanced somewhat apprehensively at his wife they had had an altercation before she went to the meeting and he supposed she had talked herself into another rage while there but mrs knox was placid and smiling she had made his favourite soda biscuits for him and inquired amiably after his progress in hoeing turnips in the southeast meadow  she made however no reference to the auxiliary meeting and when the biscuits and the maple syrup and two cups of matchless tea had nerved the elder up his curiosity got the better of his prudencefor even elders are human and curiosity knows no genderand he asked what they had done at the meeting  we poor men have been shaking in our shoes he said facetiously  were you mrs knoxs voice was calm and faintly amused well you didnt need to we talked the matter over very quietly and came to the conclusion that the session knew best and that women hadnt any right to interfere in church business at all  lucy knox turned her head away to hide a smile the elder beamed he was a peaceloving man and disliked ructions of any sort and domestic ones in particular since the decision of the session mrs knox had made his life a burden to him he did not understand her sudden change of base but he accepted it very thankfully  thats rightthats right he said heartily im glad to hear you coming out so sensible maria i was afraid youd work yourselves up at that meeting and let myra wilson or alethea craig put you up to some foolishness or other well i guess ill jog down to the corner this evening and order that barrel of pastry flour you want  oh you neednt said mrs knox indifferently we wont be needing it now  not needing it but i thought you said you had to have some to bake for the social week after next  there isnt going to be any social  not any social  elder knox stared perplexedly at his wife a month previously the putney church had been recarpeted and they still owed fifty dollars for it this the women declared they would speedily pay off by a big cake and icecream social in the hall mrs knox had been one of the foremost promoters of the enterprise  not any social repeated the elder again then how is the money for the carpet to be got and why isnt there going to be a social  the men can get the money somehow i suppose said mrs knox as for the social why of course if women arent good enough to speak in church they are not good enough to work for it either lucy dear will you pass me the cookies  lucy dear passed the cookies and then rose abruptly and left the table her fathers face was too much for her  what confounded nonsense is this demanded the elder explosively  mrs knox opened her mellow brown eyes widely as if in amazement at her husbands tone  i dont understand you she said our position is perfectly logical  she had borrowed that phrase from myra wilson and it floored the elder he got up seized his hat and strode from the room  that night at jacob wherrisons store at the corner the putney men talked over the new development the social was certainly offfor a time anyway  best let em alone i say said wherrison theyre mad at us now and doing this to pay us out but theyll cool down later on and well have the social all right  but if they dont said andrew mckittrick gloomily who is going to pay for that carpet  this was an unpleasant question the others shirked it  i was always opposed to this action of the session said alec craig it wouldnt have hurt to have let the woman speak tisnt as if it was a regular sermon  the session knew best said andrew sharply and the ministeryoure not going to set your opinion up against his are you craig  didnt know they taught such reverence for ministers in danbridge retorted craig with a laugh  best let em alone as wherrison says said abner keech  dont see what else we can do said john wilson shortly                                       on sunday morning the men were conscious of a bare deserted appearance in the church mr sinclair perceived it himself after some inward wondering he concluded that it was because there were no flowers anywhere the table before the pulpit was bare on the organ a vase held a sorry faded bouquet left over from the previous week the floor was unswept dust lay thickly on the pulpit bible the choir chairs and the pew backs  this church looks disgraceful said john robbins in an angry undertone to his daughter polly who was president of the flower band what in the name of common sense is the good of your flower banders if you cant keep the place looking decent  there is no flower band now father whispered polly in turn weve disbanded women havent any business to meddle in church matters you know the session said so  it was well for polly that she was too big to have her ears boxed even so it might not have saved her if they had been anywhere else than in church  meanwhile the men who were sitting in the choirthree basses and two tenorswere beginning to dimly suspect that there was something amiss here too where were the sopranos and the altos myra wilson and alethea craig and several other members of the choir were sitting down in their pews with perfectly unconscious faces myra was looking out of the window into the tangled sunlight and shadow of the great maples alethea craig was reading her bible  presently frances spenslow came in frances was organist but today instead of walking up to the platform she slipped demurely into her fathers pew at one side of the pulpit eben craig who was the putney singing master and felt himself responsible for the choir fidgeted uneasily he tried to catch francess eye but she was absorbed in reading the mission report she had found in the rack and eben was finally forced to tiptoe down to the spenslow pew and whisper miss spenslow the minister is waiting for the doxology arent you going to take the organ  frances looked up calmly her clear placid voice was audible not only to those in the nearby pews but to the minister  no mr craig you know if a woman isnt fit to speak in the church she cant be fit to sing in it either  eben craig looked exceedingly foolish he tiptoed gingerly back to his place the minister with an unusual flush on his thin ascetic face rose suddenly and gave out the opening hymn  nobody who heard the singing in putney church that day ever forgot it untrained basses and tenors unrelieved by a single female voice are not inspiring  there were no announcements of society meetings for the forthcoming week on the way home from church that day irate husbands and fathers scolded argued or pleaded according to their several dispositions one and all met with the same calm statement that if a noble selfsacrificing woman like mrs cotterell were not good enough to speak in the putney church ordinary everyday women could not be fit to take any part whatever in its work  sunday school that afternoon was a harrowing failure out of all the corps of teachers only one was a man and he alone was at his post in the christian endeavour meeting on tuesday night the feminine element sat dumb and unresponsive the putney women never did things by halves  the men held out for two weeks at the end of that time they happened to meet at the manse and talked the matter over with the harassed minister elder knox said gloomily its this way nothing can move them women i know for ive tried my authority has been set at naught in my own household and im laughed at if i show my face in any of the other settlements  the sunday school superintendent said the sunday school was going to wrack and ruin also the christian endeavour the condition of the church for dust was something scandalous and strangers were making a mockery of the singing and the carpet had to be paid for he supposed they would have to let the women have their own way  the next sunday evening after service mr sinclair arose hesitatingly his face was flushed and alethea craig always declared that he looked just plain everyday cross he announced briefly that the session after due deliberation had concluded that mrs cotterell might occupy the pulpit on the evening appointed for her address  the women all over the church smiled broadly frances spenslow got up and went to the organ stool the singing in the last hymn was good and hearty going down the steps after dismissal mrs elder knox caught the secretary of the church aid by the arm  i guess she whispered anxiously youd better call a special meeting of the aids at my house tomorrow afternoon if were to get that social over before haying begins weve got to do some smart scurrying  the strike in the putney church was over     the unhappiness of miss farquhar   frances farquhar was a beauty and was sometimes called a society butterfly by people who didnt know very much about it her father was wealthy and her mother came of an extremely blueblooded family frances had been out for three years and was a social favourite consequently it may be wondered why she was unhappy  in plain english frances farquhar had been jiltedjust a commonplace everyday jilting she had been engaged to paul holcomb he was a very handsome fellow somewhat too evidently aware of the fact and frances was very deeply in love with himor thought herself so which at the time comes to pretty much the same thing everybody in her set knew of her engagement and all her girl friends envied her for holcomb was a matrimonial catch  then the crash came nobody outside the family knew exactly what did happen but everybody knew that the holcombfarquhar match was off and everybody had a different story to account for it  the simple truth was that holcomb was fickle and had fallen in love with another girl there was nothing of the man about him and it did not matter to his sublimely selfish caddishness whether he broke frances farquhars heart or not he got his freedom and he married maud carroll in six months time  the farquhars especially ned who was francess older brother and seldom concerned himself about her except when the family honour was involved were furious at the whole affair mr farquhar stormed and ned swore and della lamented her vanished role of bridemaid as for mrs farquhar she cried and said it would ruin francess future prospects  the girl herself took no part in the family indignation meetings but she believed that her heart was broken her love and her pride had suffered equally and the effect seemed disastrous  after a while the farquhars calmed down and devoted themselves to the task of cheering frances up this they did not accomplish she got through the rest of the season somehow and showed a proud front to the world not even flinching when holcomb himself crossed her path to be sure she was pale and thin and had about as much animation as a mask but the same might be said of a score of other girls who were not suspected of having broken hearts  when the summer came frances asserted herself the farquhars went to green harbour every summer but this time frances said she would not go and stuck to it the whole family took turns coaxing her and had nothing to show for their pains  im going up to windy meadows to stay with aunt eleanor while you are at the harbour she declared she has invited me often enough  ned whistled jolly time youll have of it sis windy meadows is about as festive as a funeral and aunt eleanor isnt lively to put it in the mildest possible way  i dont care if she isnt i want to get somewhere where people wont look at me and talk aboutthat said frances looking ready to cry  ned went out and swore at holcomb again and then advised his mother to humour frances accordingly frances went to windy meadows  windy meadows was as ned had said the reverse of lively it was a pretty country place with a sort of fagend by way of a little fishing village huddled on a windswept bit of beach locally known as the cove aunt eleanor was one of those delightful people so few and far between in this world who have perfectly mastered the art of minding their own business exclusively she left frances in peace  she knew that her niece had had some love trouble or other and hadnt gotten over it rightly  its always best to let those things take their course said this philosophical lady to her help and confidant margaret ann peabody shell get over it in timethough she doesnt think so now bless you  for the first fortnight frances revelled in a luxury of unhindered sorrow she could cry all nightand all day too if she wishedwithout having to stop because people might notice that her eyes were red she could mope in her room all she liked and there were no men who demanded civility  when the fortnight was over aunt eleanor took crafty counsel with herself the lettingalone policy was all very well but it would not do to have the girl die on her hands frances was getting paler and thinner every dayand she was spoiling her eyelashes by crying  i wish said aunt eleanor one morning at breakfast while frances pretended to eat that i could go and take corona sherwood out for a drive today i promised her last week that i would but ive never had time yet and today is baking and churning day its a shame poor corona  who is she asked frances trying to realize that there was actually someone in the world besides herself who was to be pitied  she is our ministers sister she has been ill with rheumatic fever she is better now but doesnt seem to get strong very fast she ought to go out more but she isnt able to walk i really must try and get around tomorrow she keeps house for her brother at the manse he isnt married you know  frances didnt know nor did she in the least degree care but even the luxury of unlimited grief palls and frances was beginning to feel this vaguely she offered to go and take miss sherwood out driving  ive never seen her she said but i suppose that doesnt matter i can drive grey tom in the phaeton if you like  it was just what aunt eleanor intended and she saw frances drive off that afternoon with a great deal of satisfaction  give my love to corona she told her and say for me that she isnt to go messing about among those shore people until shes perfectly well the manse is the fourth house after you turn the third corner  frances kept count of the corners and the houses and found the manse corona sherwood herself came to the door frances had been expecting an elderly personage with spectacles and grey crimps she was surprised to find that the ministers sister was a girl of about her own age and possessed of a distinct worldly prettiness corona was dark with a different darkness from that of frances who had ivory outlines and blueblack hair while corona was dusky and piquant  her eyes brightened with delight when frances told her errand  how good of you and miss eleanor i am not strong enough to walk far yetor do anything useful in fact and elliott so seldom has time to take me out  where shall we go asked frances when they started i dont know much about this locality  can we drive to the cove first i want to see poor little jacky hart he has been so sick  aunt eleanor positively forbade that said frances dubiously will it be safe to disobey her  corona laughed  miss eleanor blames my poor shore people for making me sick at first but it was really not that at all and i want to see jacky hart so much he has been ill for some time with some disease of the spine and he is worse lately im sure miss eleanor wont mind my calling just to see him  frances turned grey tom down the shore road that ran to the cove and past it to silvery windswept sands rimming sea expanses crystal clear jacky harts home proved to be a tiny little place overflowing with children mrs hart was a pale tiredlooking woman with the patient farseeing eyes so often found among the women who watch sea and shore every day and night of their lives for those who sometimes never return  she spoke of jacky with the apathy of hopelessness the doctor said he would not last much longer she told all her troubles unreservedly to corona in her monotonous voice her man was drinking again and the mackerel catch was poor  when mrs hart asked corona to go in and see jacky frances went too the sick boy a child with a delicate wasted face and large bright eyes lay in a tiny bedroom off the kitchen the air was hot and heavy mrs hart stood at the foot of the bed with her tragic face  we have to set up nights with him now she said its awful hard on me and my man the neighbours are kind enough and come sometimes but most of them have enough to do his medicine has to be given every half hour ive been up for three nights running now jabez was off to the tavern for two im just about played out  she suddenly broke down and began to cry or rather whimper in a heartbroken way  corona looked troubled i wish i could come tonight mrs hart but im afraid im really not strong enough yet  i dont know much about sickness spoke up frances firmly but if to sit by the child and give him his medicine regularly is all that is necessary i am sure i can do that ill come and sit up with jacky tonight if you care to have me  afterwards when she and corona were driving away she wondered a good deal at herself but corona was so evidently pleased with her offer and took it all so much as a matter of course that frances had not the courage to display her wonder they had their drive through the great green bowl of the country valley brimming over with sunshine and afterwards corona made frances go home with her to tea  rev elliott sherwood had got back from his pastoral visitations and was training his sweet peas in the way they should go against the garden fence he was in his shirt sleeves and wore a big straw hat and seemed in nowise disconcerted thereby corona introduced him and he took grey tom away and put him in the barn then he went back to his sweet peas he had had his tea he said so that frances did not see him again until she went home she thought he was a very indifferent young man and not half so nice as his sister  but she went and sat up with jacky hart that night getting to the cove at dark when the sea was a shimmer of fairy tints and the boats were coming in from the fishing grounds jacky greeted her with a wonderful smile and later on she found herself watching alone by his bed the tiny lamp on the table burned dim and outside on the rocks there was loud laughing and talking until a late hour  afterwards a silence fell through which the lap of the waves on the sands and the faroff moan of the atlantic surges came sonorously jacky was restless and wakeful but did not suffer and liked to talk frances listened to him with a newborn power of sympathy which she thought she must have caught from corona he told her all the tragedy of his short life and how bad he felt about dads taking to drink and mammys having to work so hard  the pitiful little sentences made francess heart ache the maternal instinct of the true woman awoke in her she took a sudden liking to the child he was a spiritual little creature and his sufferings had made him old and wise once in the night he told frances that he thought the angels must look like her  you are so sweet pretty he said gravely i never saw anyone so pretty not even miss crona you look like a picture i once saw on mr sherwoods table when i was up at the manse one day fore i got so bad i couldnt walk it was a woman with a lil baby in her arms and a kind of rim round her head i would like something most awful much  what is it dear said frances gently if i can get or do it for you i will  you could he said wistfully but maybe you wont want to but i do wish youd come here just once every day and sit here five minutes and let me look at youjust that will it be too much trouble  frances stooped and kissed him i will come every day jacky she said and a look of ineffable content came over the thin little face he put up his hand and touched her cheek  i knew you were goodas good as miss crona and she is an angel i love you  when morning came frances went home it was raining and the sea was hidden in mist as she walked along the wet road elliott sherwood came splashing along in a little twowheeled gig and picked her up he wore a raincoat and a small cap and did not look at all like a ministeror at least like francess conception of one  not that she knew much about ministers her own minister at homethat is to say the minister of the fashionable uptown church which she attendedwas a portly dignified old man with silvery hair and goldrimmed glasses who preached scholarly cultured sermons and was as far removed from francess personal life as a star in the milky way  but a minister who wore rubber coats and little caps and drove about in a twowheeled gig very much mudbespattered and who talked about the shore people as if they were household intimates of his was absolutely new to frances  she could not help seeing however that the crisp brown hair under the edges of the unclericallooking cap curled around a remarkably wellshaped forehead beneath which flashed out a pair of very fine darkgrey eyes he had likewise a good mouth which was resolute and looked as if it might be stubborn on occasion and although he was not exactly handsome frances decided that she liked his face  he tucked the wet slippery rubber apron of his conveyance about her and then proceeded to ask questions jacky harts case had to be reported on and then mr sherwood took out a notebook and looked over its entries intently  do you want any more work of that sort to do he asked her abruptly  frances felt faintly amused he talked to her as he might have done to corona and seemed utterly oblivious of the fact that her profile was classic and her eyes delicious his indifference piqued frances a little in spite of her murdered heart well if there was anything she could do she might as well do it she told him briefly and he with equal brevity gave her directions for finding some old lady who lived on the elm creek road and to whom corona had read tracts  tracts are a mild dissipation of aunt clorindas he said she fairly revels in them she is half blind and has missed corona very much  there were other matters alsoa dozen or so of factory girls who needed to be looked after and a family of ragged children to be clothed frances in some dismay found herself pledged to help in all directions and then ways and means had to be discussed the long wet road sprinkled with houses from whose windows people were peering to see what girl the minister was driving seemed very short frances did not know it but elliott sherwood drove a full mile out of his way that morning to take her home and risked being late for a very important appointmentfrom which it may be inferred that he was not quite so blind to the beautiful as he had seemed  frances went through the rain that afternoon and read tracts to aunt clorinda she was so dreadfully tired that night that she forgot to cry and slept well and soundly  in the morning she went to church for the first time since coming to windy meadows it did not seem civil not to go to hear a man preach when she had gone slumming with his sister and expected to assist him with his difficulties over factory girls she was surprised at elliott sherwoods sermon and mentally wondered why such a man had been allowed to remain for four years in a little country pulpit later on aunt eleanor told her it was for his health  he was not strong when he left college so he came here but he is as well as ever now and i expect he will soon be gobbled up by some of your city churches he preached in castle street church last winter and i believe they were delighted with him  this was all of a month later during that time frances thought that she must have been recreated so far was her old self left behind she seldom had an idle moment when she had she spent it with corona the two girls had become close friends loving each other with the intensity of exceptional and somewhat exclusive natures  corona grew strong slowly and could do little for her brothers people but frances was an excellent proxy and elliott sherwood kept her employed incidentally frances had come to know the young minister with his lofty ideals and earnest efforts very well he had got into a ridiculous habit of going to herher frances farquharfor advice in many perplexities  frances had nursed jacky hart and talked temperance to his father and read tracts to aunt clorinda and started a reading circle among the factory girls and fitted out all the little jarboes with dresses and coaxed the shore children to go to school and patched up a feud between two longshore families and done a hundred other things of a similar nature  aunt eleanor said nothing as was her wise wont but she talked it over with margaret ann peabody and agreed with that model domestic when she said workll keep folks out of trouble and help em out of it when they are in just as long as that girl brooded over her own worries and didnt think of anyone but herself she was miserable but as soon as she found other folks were unhappy too and tried to help em out a bit she helped herself most of all shes getting fat and rosy and it is plain to be seen that the minister thinks there isnt the like of her on this planet  one night frances told corona all about holcomb elliott sherwood was away and frances had gone up to stay all night with corona at the manse they were sitting in the moonlit gloom of coronas room and frances felt confidential she had expected to feel badly and cry a little while she told it but she did not and before she was half through it did not seem as if it were worth telling after all corona was deeply sympathetic she did not say a great deal but what she did say put frances on better terms with herself  oh i shall get over it the latter declared finally once i thought i never wouldbut the truth is im getting over it now im very gladbut im horribly ashamed too to find myself so fickle  i dont think you are fickle frances said corona gravely because i dont think you ever really loved that man at all you only imagined you did and he was not worthy of you you are so good dear those shore people just worship you elliott says you can do anything you like with them  frances laughed and said she was not at all good yet she was pleased later on when she was brushing her hair before the mirror and smiling absently at her reflection corona said frances what is it like to be as pretty as you are  nonsense said frances by way of answer  it is not nonsense at all you must know you are very lovely frances elliott says you are the most beautiful girl he has ever seen  for a girl who has told herself a dozen times that she would never care again for masculine admiration frances experienced a very odd thrill of delight on hearing that the minister of windy meadows thought her beautiful she knew he admired her intellect and had immense respect for what he called her genius for influencing people but she had really believed all along that if elliott sherwood had been asked he could not have told whether she was a whit better looking than kitty martin of the cove who taught a class in sunday school and had round rosy cheeks and a snub nose  the summer went very quickly one day jacky hart dieddrifted out with the ebb tide holding francess hand she had loved the patient sweetsouled little creature and missed him greatly  when the time to go home came frances felt dull she hated to leave windy meadows and corona and her dear shore people and aunt eleanor andandwell margaret ann peabody  elliott sherwood came up the night before she went away when margaret ann showed him reverentially in frances was sitting in a halo of sunset light and the pale golden chrysanthemums in her hair shone like stars in the blueblack coils  elliott sherwood had been absent from windy meadows for several days there was a subdued jubilance in his manner  you think i have come to say goodbye but i havent he told her i shall see you again very soon i hope i have just received a call to castle street church and it is my intention to accept so corona and i will be in town this winter  frances tried to tell him how glad she was but only stammered elliott sherwood came close up to her as she stood by the window in the fading light and said  but on second thoughts i shall not record what he saidor what she said either some things should be left to the imagination     why mr cropper changed his mind   well miss maxwell how did you get along today asked mr baxter affably when the new teacher came to the table  she was a slight dark girl rather plainlooking but with a smart energetic way mr baxter approved of her he liked her style as he would have said  the summer term had just opened in the maitland district esther maxwell was a stranger but she was a capable girl and had no doubt of her own ability to get and keep the school in good working order she smiled brightly at mr baxter  very well for a beginning the children seem bright and teachable and not hard to control  mr baxter nodded there are no bad children in the school except the cropper boysand they can be good enough if they like reckon they werent there today  no  well miss maxwell i think it only fair to tell you that you may have trouble with those boys when they do come forewarned is forearmed you know mr cropper was opposed to our hiring you not of course that he had any personal objection to you but he is set against female teachers and when a cropper is set there is nothing on earth can change him he says female teachers cant keep order hes started in with a spite at you on general principles and the boys know it they know hell back them up in secret no matter what they do just to prove his opinions cropper is sly and slippery and it is hard to corner him  are the boys big queried esther anxiously  yes thirteen and fourteen and big for their age you cant whip emthat is the trouble a man might but theyd twist you around their fingers youll have your hands full im afraid but maybe theyll behave all right after all  mr baxter privately had no hope that they would but esther hoped for the best she could not believe that mr cropper would carry his prejudices into a personal application this conviction was strengthened when he overtook her walking from school the next day and drove her home he was a big handsome man with a very suave polite manner he asked interestedly about her school and her work hoped she was getting on well and said he had two young rascals of his own to send soon esther felt relieved she thought that mr baxter had exaggerated matters a little  that plum tree of mrs charleys is loaded with fruit again this year remarked mr baxter at the tea table that evening i came past it today on my way cross lots home from the woods there will be bushels of plums on it  i dont suppose poor mrs charley will get one of them any more than she ever has said mrs baxter indignantly its a burning shame thats what it is i just wish she could catch the croppers once  you havent any proof that it is really them mary objected her husband and you shouldnt make reckless accusations before folks  i know very well it is them retorted mrs baxter and so do you adoniram and mrs charley knows it too although she cant prove itmores the pity i dont say isaac cropper steals those plums with his own hands but he knows who doesand the plums go into mehitable croppers preserving kettle theres nothing surer  you see miss maxwell its this way explained mr baxter turning to esther mrs charley croppers husband was isaacs brother they never got on well together and when charley died there was a tremendous fuss about the property isaac acted mean and scandalous clear through and public opinion has been down on him ever since but mrs charley is a pretty smart woman and he didnt get the better of her in everything there was a strip of disputed land between the two farms and she secured it theres a big plum tree growing on it close to the line fence its the finest one in maitland but mrs charley never gets a plum from it  but what becomes of them asked esther  they disappear said mr baxter with a significant nod when the plums are anything like ripe mrs charley discovers some day that there isnt one left on the tree she has never been able to get a scrap of proof as to who took them or shed make it hot for them but nobody in maitland has any doubt in his own mind that isaac cropper knows where those plums go  i dont think mr cropper would steal protested esther  well he doesnt consider it stealing you know he claims the land and says the plums are his i dont doubt that he is quite clear in his own mind that they are and he does hate mrs charley id give considerable to see the old sinner fairly caught but he is too deep  i think mr baxter is too hard on mr cropper said esther to herself later on he has probably some private prejudice against him                                       but a month later she had changed her opinion during that time the cropper boys had come to school  at first esther had been inclined to like them they were handsome lads with the same smooth way that characterized their father and seemed bright and intelligent for a few days all went well and esther felt decidedly relieved  but before long a subtle spirit of insubordination began to make itself felt in the school esther found herself powerless to cope with it the croppers never openly defied her but they did precisely as they pleased the other pupils thought themselves at liberty to follow this example and in a months time poor esther had completely lost control of her little kingdom some complaints were heard among the ratepayers and even mr baxter looked dubious she knew that unless she could regain her authority she would be requested to hand in her resignation but she was baffled by the elusive system of defiance which the cropper boys had organized  one day she resolved to go to mr cropper himself and appeal to his sense of justice if he had any it had been an especially hard day in school when she had been absent at the noon hour all the desks in the schoolroom had been piled in a pyramid on the floor books and slates interchanged and various other pranks played when questioned every pupil denied having done or helped to do it alfred and bob cropper looked her squarely in the eyes and declared their innocence in their usual gentlemanly fashion yet esther felt sure that they were the guilty ones she also knew what exaggerated accounts of the affair would be taken home to maitland tea tables and she felt like sitting down to cry but she did not instead she set her mouth firmly helped the children restore the room to order and after school went up to isaac croppers house  that gentleman himself came in from the harvest field looking as courtly as usual even in his rough working clothes he shook hands heartily told her he was glad to see her and began talking about the weather esther was not to be turned from her object thus although she felt her courage ebbing away from her as it always did in the presence of the cropper imperviousness  i have come up to see you about alfred and robert mr cropper she said they are not behaving well in school  indeed mr croppers voice expressed bland surprise that is strange as a rule i do not think alfred and robert have been troublesome to their teachers what have they been doing now  they refuse to obey my orders said esther faintly  ah well miss maxwell perhaps you will pardon my saying that a teacher should be able to enforce her orders my boys are highspirited fellows and need a strong firm hand to restrain them i have always said i considered it advisable to employ a male teacher in maitland school we should have better order not that i disapprove of you personallyfar from it i should be glad to see you succeed but i have heard many complaints regarding the order in school at present  i had no trouble until your boys came retorted esther losing her temper a little and i believe that if you were willing to cooperate with me that i could govern them  well you see said mr cropper easily when i send my boys to school i naturally expect that the teacher will be capable of doing the work she has been hired to do  then you refuse to help me said esther in a trembling voice  why my dear young lady what can i do boys soon know when they can disobey a teacher with impunity no doubt you will be able to secure a school easier to control and will do good work but here as i have already said we need a firm hand at the helm but you are not going yet miss maxwell you need some refreshment after your long walk mrs cropper will bring you in something  no thank you said poor esther she felt that she must get away at once or she would burst into heartsick tears under those steely bland blue eyes when she got home she shut herself up in her room and cried there was nothing for her to do but resign she thought dismally  on the following saturday esther went for an afternoon walk carrying her kodak with her it was a brilliantly fine autumn day and woods and fields were basking in a mellow haze esther went across lots to mrs charley croppers house intending to make a call but the house was locked up and evidently deserted so she rambled past it to the back fields passing through a grove of maples she came out among leafy young saplings on the other side just beyond her with its laden boughs hanging over the line fence was the famous plum tree esther looked at it for a moment then an odd smile gleamed over her face and she lifted her kodak  monday evening esther called on mr cropper again after the preliminary remarks in which he indulged she said with seeming irrelevance that saturday had been a fine day  there was an excellent light for snapshots she went on coolly i went out with my kodak and was lucky enough to get a good negative i have brought you up a proof i thought you would be interested in it  she rose and placed the proof on the table before mr cropper the plum tree came out clearly bob and alf cropper were up among the boughs picking the plums on the ground beneath them stood their father with a basket of fruit in his hand  mr cropper looked at the proof and from it to esther his eyes had lost their unconcerned glitter but his voice was defiant  the plums are mine by right he said  perhaps said esther calmly but there are some who do not think so mrs charley for instanceshe would like to see this proof i think  dont show it to her cried mr cropper hastily i tell you miss maxwell the plums are mine but i am tired of fighting over them and i had decided before this that id let her have them after this its only a trifle anyhow and about that little matter we were discussing the other night miss maxwell i have been thinking it over and i admit i was somewhat unreasonable ill talk to alfred and robert and see what i can do  very well said esther quietly the matter of the plums isnt my business and i dont wish to be involved in your family feuds especially as you say that you mean to allow mrs charley to enjoy her own in future as for the school we will hope that matters will improve  youll leave the proof with me wont you said mr cropper eagerly  oh certainly said esther smiling i have the negative still you know  from that time out the cropper boys were models of good behaviour and the other turbulent spirits having lost their leaders were soon quelled complaint died away and at the end of the term esther was reengaged  you seem to have won old cropper over to your side entirely mr baxter told her that night he said at the meeting today that you were the best teacher we had ever had and moved to raise your salary i never knew isaac cropper to change his opinions so handsomely  esther smiled she knew it had taken a powerful lever to change mr croppers opinion but she kept her own counsel
