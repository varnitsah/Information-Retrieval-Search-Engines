50688888	westminster sermons   with a preface  by charles kingsley  london macmillan and co 1881  the right of translation is reserved     preface   i venture to preface these sermonswhich were preached either at westminster abbey or at one of the chapels royalby a paper read at sion college in 1871 and for this reason  even when they deal with what is usually and rightly called vital and experimental religion they are comments on and developments of the idea which pervades that paper namelythat facts whether of physical nature or of the human heart and reason do not contradict but coincide with the doctrines and formulas of the church of england as by law established        natural theology i said is a subject which seems to me more and more important and one which is just now somewhat forgotten  i therefore desire to say a few words on it  i do not pretend to teach but only to suggest to point out certain problems of natural theology the further solution of which ought i think to be soon attempted  i wish to speak be it remembered not on natural religion but on natural theology  by the first i understand what can be learned from the physical universe of mans duty to god and to his neighbour by the latter i understand what can be learned concerning god himself  of natural religion i shall say nothing  i do not even affirm that a natural religion is possible but i do very earnestly believe that a natural theology is possible and i earnestly believe also that it is most important that natural theology should in every age keep pace with doctrinal or ecclesiastical theology  bishop butler certainly held this belief  his analogy of religion natural and revealed to the constitution and course of naturea book for which i entertain the most profound respectis based on a belief that the god of nature and the god of grace are one and that therefore the god who satisfies our conscience ought more or less to satisfy our reason also  to teach that was butlers mission and he fulfilled it well  but it is a mission which has to be refulfilled again and again as human thought changes and human science develops for if in any age or country the god who seems to be revealed by nature seems also different from the god who is revealed by the then popular religion then that god and the religion which tells of that god will gradually cease to be believed in  for the demands of reasonas none knew better than good bishop butlermust be and ought to be satisfied  and therefore when a popular war arises between the reason of any generation and its theology then it behoves the ministers of religion to inquire with all humility and godly fear on which side lies the fault whether the theology which they expound is all that it should be or whether the reason of those who impugn it is all that it should be  for me asi trustan orthodox priest of the church of england i believe the theology of the national church of england as by law established to be eminently rational as well as scriptural  it is not therefore surprising to me that the clergy of the church of england since the foundation of the royal society in the seventeenth century have done more for sound physical science than the clergy of any other denomination or that the three greatest natural theologians with which i at least am acquaintedberkeley butler and paleyshould have belonged to our church  i am not unaware of what the germans of the eighteenth century have done  i consider goethes claims to have advanced natural theology very much overrated but i do recommend to young clergymen herders outlines of the philosophy of the history of man as a bookin spite of certain defectsfull of sound and precious wisdom  meanwhile it seems to me that english natural theology in the eighteenth century stood more secure than that of any other nation on the foundation which berkeley butler and paley had laid and that if our orthodox thinkers for the last hundred years had followed steadily in their steps we should not be deploring now a wide and as some think increasing divorce between science and christianity  but it was not so to be  the impulse given by wesley and whitfield turnedand not before it was neededthe earnest minds of england almost exclusively to questions of personal religion and that impulse under many unexpected forms has continued ever since  i only state the fact i do not deplore it god forbid  wisdom is justified of all her children and as according to the wise american it takes all sorts to make a world so it takes all sorts to make a living church  but that the religious temper of england for the last two or three generations has been unfavourable to a sound and scientific development of natural theology there can be no doubt  we have only if we need proof to look at the hymnsmany of them very pure pious and beautifulwhich are used at this day in churches and chapels by persons of every shade of opinion  how often is the tone in which they speak of the natural world one of dissatisfaction distrust almost contempt  change and decay in all around i see is their key note rather than o all ye works of the lord bless him praise him and magnify him for ever  there lingers about them a savour of the old monastic theory that this earth is the devils planet fallen accursed goblinhaunted needing to be exorcised at every turn before it is useful or even safe for man  an age which has adopted as its most popular hymn a paraphrase of the mediaeval monks hic breve vivitur and in which stalwart publicschool boys are bidden in their chapelworship to tell the almighty god of truth that they lie awake weeping at night for joy at the thought that they will die and see jerusalem the golden is doubtless a pious and devout age but notat least as yetan age in which natural theology is likely to attain a high a healthy or a scriptural development  not a scriptural development  let me press on you my clerical brethren most earnestly this one point  it is time that we should make up our minds what tone scripture does take toward nature natural science natural theology  most of you i doubt not have made up your minds already and in consequence have no fear of natural science no fear for natural theology  but i cannot deny that i find still lingering here and there certain of the old views of nature of which i used to hear but too much some fiveandthirty years agoand that from better men than i shall ever hope to bewho used to consider natural theology as useless fallacious impossible on the ground that this earth did not reveal the will and character of god because it was cursed and fallen and that its facts in consequence were not to be respected or relied on  this i was told was the doctrine of scripture and was therefore true  but when longing to reconcile my conscience and my reason on a question so awful to a young student of natural science i went to my bible what did i find  no word of all this  muchthank god i may say one continuous undercurrentof the very opposite of all this  i pray you bear with me even though i may seem impertinent  but what do we find in the bible with the exception of that first curse  that remember cannot mean any alteration in the laws of nature by which mans labour should only produce for him henceforth thorns and thistles  for in the first place any such curse is formally abrogated in the eighth chapter and 21st verse of the very same documenti will not again curse the earth any more for mans sake  while the earth remaineth seedtime and harvest cold and heat summer and winter day and night shall not cease  and next the fact is not so for if you root up the thorns and thistles and keep your land clean then assuredly you will grow fruittrees and not thorns wheat and not thistles according to those laws of nature which are the voice of god expressed in facts  and yet the words are true  there is a curse upon the earth though not one which by altering the laws of nature has made natural facts untrustworthy  there is a curse on the earth such a curse as is expressed i believe in the old hebrew text where the word admahcorrectly translated in our version the groundsignifies as i am told not this planet but simply the soil from whence we get our food such a curse as certainly is expressed by the septuagint and the vulgate versions cursed is the earthgreek text in opere tuo in thy works  mans work is too often the curse of the very planet which he misuses  none should know that better than the botanist who sees whole regions desolate and given up to sterility and literal thorns and thistles on account of mans sin and folly ignorance and greedy waste  well said that veteran botanist the venerable elias fries of lund  a broad band of waste land follows gradually in the steps of cultivation  if it expands its centre and its cradle dies and on the outer borders only do we find green shoots  but it is not impossible only difficult for man without renouncing the advantage of culture itself one day to make reparation for the injury which he has inflicted he is appointed lord of creation  true it is that thorns and thistles illfavoured and poisonous plants well named by botanists rubbish plants mark the track which man has proudly traversed through the earth before him lay original nature in her wild but sublime beauty  behind him he leaves a desert a deformed and ruined land for childish desire of destruction or thoughtless squandering of vegetable treasures has destroyed the character of nature and terrified man himself flies from the arena of his actions leaving the impoverished earth to barbarous races or to animals so long as yet another spot in virgin beauty smiles before him  here again in selfish pursuit of profit and consciously or unconsciously following the abominable principle of the great moral vileness which one man has expressedapres nous le delugehe begins anew the work of destruction  thus did cultivation driven out leave the east and perhaps the deserts long ago robbed of their coverings like the wild hordes of old over beautiful greece thus rolls this conquest with fearful rapidity from east to west through america and the planter now often leaves the already exhausted land and the eastern climate become infertile through the demolition of the forests to introduce a similar revolution into the far west  as we proceed we find nothing in the general tone of scripture which can hinder our natural theology being at once scriptural and scientific  if it is to be scientific it must begin by approaching nature at once with a cheerful and reverent spirit as a noble healthy and trustworthy thing and what is that save the spirit of those who wrote the 104th 147th and 148th psalms the spirit too of him who wrote that song of the three children which is as it were the flower and crown of the old testament the summing up of all that is most true and eternal in the old jewish faith and which as long as it is sung in our churches is the charter and titledeed of all christian students of those works of the lord which it calls on to bless him praise him and magnify him for ever  what next will be demanded of us by physical science  belief certainly just now in the permanence of natural laws  that is taken for granted i hold throughout the bible  i cannot see how our lords parables drawn from the birds and the flowers the seasons and the weather have any logical weight or can be considered as aught but capricious and fanciful illustrationswhich god forbidunless we look at them as instances of laws of the natural world which find their analogues in the laws of the spiritual world the kingdom of god  i cannot conceive a mans writing that 104th psalm who had not the most deep the most earnest sense of the permanence of natural law  but more the fact is expressly asserted again and again  they continue this day according to thine ordinance for all things serve thee  thou hast made them fast for ever and ever  thou hast given them a law which shall not be broken  let us pass on  there is no more to be said about this matter  but next it will be demanded of us that natural theology shall set forth a god whose character is consistent with all the facts of nature and not only with those which are pleasant and beautiful  that challenge was accepted and i think victoriously by bishop butler as far as the christian religion is concerned  as far as the scripture is concerned we may answer thus  it is said to usi know that it is saidyou tell us of a god of love a god of flowers and sunshine of singing birds and little children  but there are more facts in nature than these  there is premature death pestilence famine  and if you answerman has control over these they are caused by mans ignorance and sin and by his breaking of natural lawswhat will you make of those destructive powers over which he has no control of the hurricane and the earthquake of poisons vegetable and mineral of those parasitic entozoa whose awful abundance and awful destructiveness in man and beast science is just revealinga new page of danger and loathsomeness  how does that suit your conception of a god of love  we can answerwhether or not it suits our conception of a god of love it suits scriptures conception of him  for nothing is more clearnay is it not urged again and again as a blot on scripturethat it reveals a god not merely of love but of sternness a god in whose eyes physical pain is not the worst of evils nor animal lifetoo often miscalled human lifethe most precious of objects a god who destroys when it seems fit to him and that wholesale and seemingly without either pity or discrimination man woman and child visiting the sins of the fathers on the children making the land empty and bare and destroying from off it man and beast  this is the god of the old testament  and if any sayas is too often rashly saidthis is not the god of the new i answer but have you read your new testament  have you read the latter chapters of st matthew  have you read the opening of the epistle to the romans  have you read the book of revelation  if so will you say that the god of the new testament is compared with the god of the old less awful less destructive and therefore less like the beinggranting always that there is such a beingwho presides over nature and her destructive powers  it is an awful problem  but the writers of the bible have faced it valiantly  physical science is facing it valiantly now  therefore natural theology may face it likewise  remember carlyles great words about poor francesca in the inferno infinite pity yet also infinite rigour of law  it is so nature is made  it is so dante discerned that she was made  there are two other points on which i must beg leave to say a few words physical science will demand of our natural theologians that they should be aware of their importance and letas mr matthew arnold would saytheir thoughts play freely round them  i mean questions of embryology and questions of race  on the first there may be much to be said which is for the present best left unsaid even here  i only ask you to recollect how often in scripture those two plain old wordsbeget and bring forthoccur and in what important passages  and i ask you to remember that marvellous essay on natural theologyif i may so call it in all reverencenamely the 119th psalm and judge for yourself whether he who wrote that did not consider the study of embryology as important as significant as worthy of his deepest attention as an owen a huxley or a darwin  nay i will go further still and say that in those great wordsthine eyes did see my substance yet being imperfect and in thy book all my members were written which in continuance were fashioned when as yet there was none of themin those words i say the psalmist has anticipated that realistic view of embryological questions to which our most modern philosophers are it seems to me slowly half unconsciously but still inevitably returning  next as to race  some persons now have a nervous fear of that word and of allowing any importance to difference of races  some dislike it because they think that it endangers the modern notions of democratic equality  others because they fear that it may be proved that the negro is not a man and a brother  i think the fears of both parties groundless  as for the negro i not only believe him to be of the same race as myself but thatif mr darwins theories are truescience has proved that he must be such  i should have thought as a humble student of such questions that the one fact of the unique distribution of the hair in all races of human beings was full moral proof that they had all had one common ancestor  but this is not matter of natural theology  what is matter thereof is this  physical science is proving more and more the immense importance of race the importance of hereditary powers hereditary organs hereditary habits in all organized beings from the lowest plant to the highest animal  she is proving more and more the omnipresent action of the differences between races how the more favoured raceshe cannot avoid using the epithetexterminates the less favoured or at least expels it and forces it under penalty of death to adapt itself to new circumstances and in a word that competition between every race and every individual of that race and reward according to deserts is as far as we can see an universal law of living things  and she saysfor the facts of history prove itthat as it is among the races of plants and animals so it has been unto this day among the races of men  the natural theology of the future must take count of these tremendous and even painful facts  she may take count of them  for scripture has taken count of them already  it talks continuallyit has been blamed for talking so muchof races of families of their wars their struggles their exterminations of races favoured of races rejected of remnants being saved to continue the race of hereditary tendencies hereditary excellencies hereditary guilt  its sense of the reality and importance of descent is so intense that it speaks of a whole tribe or a whole family by the name of its common ancestor and the whole nation of the jews is israel to the end  and if i be told this is true of the old testament but not of the new i must answerwhat  does not st paul hold the identity of the whole jewish race with israel their forefather as strongly as any prophet of the old testament  and what is the central historic fact save one of the new testament but the conquest of jerusalem the dispersion all but destruction of a race not by miracle but by invasion because found wanting when weighed in the stern balances of natural and social law  think over this  i only suggest the thought but i do not suggest it in haste  think over it by the light which our lords parables his analogies between the physical and social constitution of the world afford and consider whether those awful wordsfulfilled then and fulfilled so often sincethe kingdom of god shall be taken from you and given to a nation bringing forth the fruits thereof may not be the supreme instance the most complex development of a law which runs through all created things down to the moss which struggles for existence on the rock  do i say that this is all  that man is merely a part of nature the puppet of circumstances and hereditary tendencies  that brute competition is the one law of his life  that he is doomed for ever to be the slave of his own needs enforced by an internecine struggle for existence  god forbid  i believe not only in nature but in grace  i believe that this is mans fate only as long as he sows to the flesh and of the flesh reaps corruption  i believe that if he will     strive upward working out the beast    and let the ape and tiger die  if he will be even as wise as the social animals as the ant and the bee who have risen if not to the virtue of allembracing charity at least to the virtues of selfsacrifice and patriotism then he will rise towards a higher sphere towards that kingdom of god of which it is writtenhe that dwelleth in love dwelleth in god and god in him  whether that be matter of natural theology i cannot tell as yet  but as for all the former questions and all that st paul means when he talks of the law and how the works of the flesh bring men under the law stern and terrible and destructive though holy and just and goodthey are matter of natural theology and i believe that here as elsewhere scripture and science will be ultimately found to coincide  but here we have to face an objection which you will often hear now from scientific men and still oftener from nonscientific men who will sayit matters not to us whether scripture contradicts or does not contradict a scientific natural theology for we hold such a science to be impossible and naught  the old jews put a god into nature and therefore of course they could see as you see what they had already put there  but we see no god in nature  we do not deny the existence of a god  we merely say that scientific research does not reveal him to us we see no marks of design in physical phenomena  what used to be considered as marks of design can be better explained by considering them as the results of evolution according to necessary laws and you and scripture make a mere assumption when you ascribe them to the operation of a mind like the human mind  now on this point i believe we may answer fearlesslyif you cannot see it we cannot help you  if the heavens do not declare to you the glory of god nor the firmament show you his handywork then our poor arguments will not show them  the eye can only see that which it brings with it the power of seeing  we can only reassert that we see design everywhere and that the vast majority of the human race in every age and clime has seen it  analogy from experience sound inductionas we holdfrom the works not only of men but of animals has made it an all but selfevident truth to us that wherever there is arrangement there must be an arranger wherever there is adaptation of means to an end there must be an adapter wherever an organization there must be an organizer  the existence of a designing god is no more demonstrable from nature than the existence of other human beings independent of ourselves or indeed than the existence of our own bodies  but like the belief in them the belief in him has become an article of our common sense  and that this designing mind is in some respects similar to the human mind is proved to usas sir john herschel well puts itby the mere fact that we can discover and comprehend the processes of nature  but here again if we be contradicted we can only reassert  if the old words he that made the eye shall he not see he that planted the ear shall he not hear do not at once commend themselves to the intellect of any person we shall never convince that person by any arguments drawn from the absurdity of conceiving the invention of optics by a blind man or of music by a deaf one  so we will assert our own oldfashioned notion boldly and more we will say in spite of ridiculethat if such a god exists final causes must exist also  that the whole universe must be one chain of final causes that if there be a supreme reason he must have reason and that a good reason for every physical phenomenon  we will tell the modern scientific manyou are nervously afraid of the mention of final causes  you quote against them bacons saying that they are barren virgins that no physical fact was ever discovered or explained by them  you are right as far as regards yourselves  you have no business with final causes because final causes are moral causes and you are physical students only  we the natural theologians have business with them  your duty is to find out the how of things ours to find out the why  if you rejoin that we shall never find out the why unless we first learn something of the how we shall not deny that  it may be most useful i had almost said necessary that the clergy should have some scientific training  it may be most usefuli sometimes dream of a day when it will be considered necessarythat every candidate for ordination should be required to have passed creditably in at least one branch of physical science if it be only to teach him the method of sound scientific thought  but our having learnt the how will not make it needless much less impossible for us to study the why  it will merely make more clear to us the things of which we have to study the why and enable us to keep the how and the why more religiously apart from each other  but if it be saidafter all there is no why  the doctrine of evolution by doing away with the theory of creation does away with that of final causeslet us answer boldlynot in the least  we might accept all that mr darwin all that professor huxley all that other most able men have so learnedly and so acutely written on physical science and yet preserve our natural theology on exactly the same basis as that on which butler and paley left it  that we should have to develop it i do not deny  that we should have to relinquish it i do  let me press this thought earnestly on you  i know that many wiser and better men than i have fears on this point  i cannot share in them  all it seems to me that the new doctrines of evolution demand is thiswe all agreefor the fact is patentthat our own bodies and indeed the body of every living creature are evolved from a seemingly simple germ by natural laws without visible action of any designing will or mind into the full organization of a human or other creature  yet we do not say on that accountgod did not create me i only grew  we hold in this case to our old idea and sayif there be evolution there must be an evolver  now the new physical theories only ask us it seems to me to extend this conception to the whole universe to believe that not individuals merely but whole varieties and races the total organized life on this planet and it may be the total organization of the universe have been evolved just as our bodies are by natural laws acting through circumstance  this may be true or may be false  but all its truth can do to the natural theologian will be to make him believe that the creator bears the same relation to the whole universe as that creator undeniably bears to every individual human body  i entreat you to weigh these words which have not been written in haste and i entreat you also if you wish to see how little the new theory that species may have been gradually created by variation natural selection and so forth interferes with the old theory of design contrivance and adaptation nay with the fullest admission of benevolent final causesi entreat you i say to study darwins fertilization of orchidsa book which whether his main theory be true or not will still remain a most valuable addition to natural theology  for suppose that all the species of orchids and not only they but their congenersthe gingers the arrowroots the bananasare all the descendants of one original form which was most probably nearly allied to the snowdrop and the iris  what then  would that be one whit more wonderful more unworthy of the wisdom and power of god than if they were as most believe created each and all at once with their minute and often imaginary shades of difference  what would the natural theologian have to say were the first theory true save that gods works are even more wonderful that he always believed them to be  as for the theory being impossible we must leave the discussion of that to physical students  it is not for us clergymen to limit the power of god  is anything too hard for the lord asked the prophet of old and we have a right to ask it as long as time shall last  if it be said that natural selection is too simple a cause to produce such fantastic variety that again is a question to be settled exclusively by physical students  all we have to say on the matter isthat we always knew that god works by very simple or seemingly simple means that the whole universe as far as we could discern it was one concatenation of the most simple means that it was wonderful yea miraculous in our eyes that a child should resemble its parents that the raindrops should make the grass grow that the grass should become flesh and the flesh sustenance for the thinking brain of man  ought god to seem less or more august in our eyes when we are told that his means are even more simple than we supposed  we held him to be almighty and allwise  are we to reverence him less or more if we hear that his might is greater his wisdom deeper than we ever dreamed  we believed that his care was over all his works that his providence watched perpetually over the whole universe  we were taughtsome of us at leastby holy scripture to believe that the whole history of the universe was made up of special providences  if then that should be true which mr darwin eloquently writesit may be metaphorically said that natural selection is daily and hourly scrutinizing throughout the world every variation even the slightest rejecting that which is bad preserving and adding up that which is good silently and incessantly working whenever and wherever opportunity offers at the improvement of every organic beingif that i say were proven to be true ought gods care and gods providence to seem less or more magnificent in our eyes  of old it was said by him without whom nothing is made my father worketh hitherto and i work  shall we quarrel with science if she should show how those words are true  what in one word should we have to say but thiswe knew of old that god was so wise that he could make all things but behold he is so much wiser than even that that he can make all things make themselves  but it may be saidthese notions are contrary to scripture  i must beg very humbly but very firmly to demur to that opinion  scripture says that god created  but it nowhere defines that term  the means the how of creation is nowhere specified  scripture again says that organized beings were produced each according to their kind  but it nowhere defines that term  what a kind includes whether it includes or not the capacity of varyingwhich is just the question in pointis nowhere specified  and i think it a most important rule in scriptural exegesis to be most cautious as to limiting the meaning of any term which scripture itself has not limited lest we find ourselves putting into the teaching of scripture our own human theories or prejudices  and consideris not man a kind  and has not mankind varied physically intellectually spiritually  is not the bible from beginning to end a history of the variations of mankind for worse or for better from their original type  let us rather look with calmness and even with hope and goodwill on these new theories for correct or incorrect they surely mark a tendency towards a more not a less scriptural view of nature are they not attempts whether successful or unsuccessful to escape from that shallow mechanical notion of the universe and its creator which was too much in vogue in the eighteenth century among divines as well as philosophers the theory which goethe to do him justiceand after him mr thomas carlylehave treated with such noble scorn the theory i mean that god has wound up the universe like a clock and left it to tick by itself till it runs down never troubling himself with it save possiblyfor even that was only half believedby rare miraculous interferences with the laws which he himself had made  out of that chilling dream of a dead universe ungoverned by an absent god the human mind in germany especially tried during the early part of this century to escape by strange roads roads by which there was no escape because they were not laid down on the firm ground of scientific facts  then in despair men turned to the facts which they had neglected and saidwe are weary of philosophy we will study you and you alone  as for god who can find him  and they have worked at the facts like gallant and honest men and their work like all good work has produced in the last fifty years results more enormous than they even dreamed  but what are they finding more and more below their facts below all phenomena which the scalpel and the microscope can show  a something nameless invisible imponderable yet seemingly omnipresent and omnipotent retreating before them deeper and deeper the deeper they delve namely the life which shapes and makes that which the old schoolmen called forma formativa which they call vital force and what notmetaphors all or rather counters to mark an unknown quantity as if they should call it x or y  one saysit is all vibrations but his reason unsatisfied asksand what makes the vibrations vibrate  anotherit is all physiological units but his reason askswhat is the physis the nature and innate tendency of the units  a thirdit may be all caused by infinitely numerous gemmules but his reason asks himwhat puts infinite order into these gemmules instead of infinite anarchy  i mention these theories not to laugh at them  i have all due respect for those who have put them forth  nor would it interfere with my theological creed if any or all of them were proven to be true tomorrow  i mention them only to show that beneath all these theories true or false still lies that unknown x  scientific men are becoming more and more aware of it i had almost said ready to worship it  more and more the noblestminded of them are engrossed by the mystery of that unknown and truly miraculous element in nature which is always escaping them though they cannot escape it  how should they escape it  was it not written of oldwhither shall i go from thy presence or whither shall i flee from thy spirit  ah that we clergymen would summon up courage to tell them that  courage to tell them what need not hamper for a moment the freedom of their investigations what will add to them a sanctioni may say a sanctitythat the unknown x which lies below all phenomena which is for ever at work on all phenomena on the whole and on every part of the whole down to the colouring of every leaf and the curdling of every cell of protoplasm is none other than that which the old hebrews calledby a metaphor no doubt for how can man speak of the unseen save in metaphors drawn from the seenbut by the only metaphor adequate to express the perpetual and omnipresent miracle the breath of god the spirit who is the lord and the giver of life  in the rest let us too think and let us too observe  for if we are ignorant not merely of the results of experimental science but of the methods thereof then we and the men of science shall have no common ground whereon to stretch out kindly hands to each other  but let us have patience and faith and not suppose in haste that when those hands are stretched out it will be needful for us to leave our standingground or to cast ourselves down from the pinnacle of the temple to earn popularity above all from earnest students who are too highminded to care for popularity themselves  true if we have an intelligent belief in those creeds and those scriptures which are committed to our keeping then our philosophy cannot be that which is just now in vogue  but all we have to do i believe is to wait  nominalism and that sensationalism which has sprung from nominalism are running fast to seed comtism seems to me its supreme effort after which the whirligig of time may bring round its revenges and realism and we who hold the realist creeds may have our turn  only wait  when a grave able and authoritative philosopher explains a mothers love of her newborn babe as professor bain has done in a really eloquent passage of his book on the emotions and the will 0a then the end of that philosophy is very near and an older simpler more human and as i hold more philosophic explanation of that natural phenomenon and of all others may get a hearing  only wait and fret not yourselves else shall you be moved to do evil remember the saying of the wise mango not after the world  she turns on her axis and if thou stand still long enough she will turn round to thee     sermon i  the mystery of the cross  a good friday sermon   philippians ii 58     let this mind be in you which was also in christ jesus who being in    the form of god thought it not robbery to be equal with god but made    himself of no reputation and took upon him the form of a slave and    was made in the likeness of men and being found in fashion as a man    he humbled himself and became obedient unto death even the death of    the cross  the second lesson for this mornings service and the chapter which follows it describe the passion of our lord jesus christ both god and man  they give us the facts in language most awful from its perfect calmness most pathetic from its perfect simplicity  but the passage of st paul which i have chosen for my text gives us an explanation of those facts which is utterly amazing  that he who stooped to die upon the cross is very god of very god the creator and sustainer of the universe is a thought so overwhelming whenever we try to comprehend even a part of it in our small imaginations that it is no wonder if in all ages many a pious soul as it contemplated the cross of christ has been rapt itself into a passion of gratitude an ecstasy of wonder and of love which is beautiful honourable just and in the deepest sense most rational whenever it is spontaneous and natural  but there have been thousands as there may be many here today of colder temperament who would distrust in themselves even while they respected in others any violence of religious emotion yet they too have found and you too may find in contemplating the passion of christ a satisfaction deeper than that of any emotion a satisfaction not to the heart still less to the brain but to that far deeper and diviner faculty within us allour moral sense that godgiven instinct which makes us discern and sympathise with all that is beautiful and true and good  and so it has befallen for eighteen hundred years that thousands who have thought earnestly and carefully on god and on the character of god on man and on the universe and on their relation to him who made them both have found in the incarnation and the passion of the son of god the perfect satisfaction of their moral wants the surest key to the facts of the spiritual world the complete assurance that in spite of all seeming difficulties and contradictions the maker of the world was a righteous being who had founded the world in righteousness that the father of spirits was a perfect father who in his onlybegotten son had shewn forth his perfectness in such a shape and by such acts that men might not only adore it but sympathise with it not only thank him for it but copy it and become though at an infinite distance perfect as their father in heaven is perfect and full of grace and truth like that son who is the brightness of his fathers glory and the express image of his person  such a satisfaction have they found in looking upon the triumphal entry into jerusalem of him who knew that it would be followed by the revolt of the fickle mob and the desertion of his disciples and the cross of calvary and all the hideous circumstances of a roman malefactors death  but there have been those and there are still who have found no such satisfaction in the story which the gospel tells and still less in the explanation which the epistle gives who have as st paul says stumbled at the stumblingblock of the cross  it would be easy to ignore such persons were they scoffers or profligates but when they number among their ranks men of virtuous lives of earnest and most benevolent purposes of careful and learned thought and of a real reverence for god or for those theories of the universe which some of them are inclined to substitute for god they must at least be listened to patiently and answered charitably as men who however faulty their opinions may be prove by their virtue and their desire to do good that if they have lost sight of christ christ has not lost sight of them  to such men the idea of the incarnation and still more that of the passion is derogatory to the very notion of a god  that a god should suffer and that a god should die is shockingand to do them justice i believe they speak sincerelyto their notions of the absolute majesty the undisturbed serenity of the author of the universe of him in whom all things live and move and have their being who dwells in the light to which none may approach  and therefore they have in every age tried various expedients to escape from a doctrine which seemed repugnant to that most precious part of them their moral sense  in the earlier centuries of the church they tried to shew that st john and st paul spoke not of one who was very god of very god but of some highest and most primeval of all creatures emanation aeon or what not  in these later times when the belief in such beings and even their very names have become dim and dead men have tried to shew that the words of scripture apply to a mere man  they have seen in christand they have reverenced and loved him for what they have seen in himthe noblest and purest the wisest and the most loving of all human beings and have attributed such language as that in the text whichtranslate it as you willascribes absolute divinity and nothing less to our lord jesus christthey have attributed it i say to some fondness for oriental hyperbole and mystic theosophy in the minds of the apostles  others again have gone further and been i think more logically honest  they have perceived that our lord jesus christ himself as his words are reported attributed divinity to himself just as much as did his apostles  such a saying as that one before abraham was i am and others beside it could be escaped from only by one of two methods  to the first of them i shall not allude in this sacred place popular as a late work has made it in its native france and i fear in england likewise  the other alternative more reverent indeed but as i believe just as mistaken is to suppose that the words were never uttered at all that christit is not i who say itpossibly never existed at all that his whole story was gradually built up like certain fabulous legends of romish saints out of the moral consciousness of various devout persons during the first three centuries each of whom added to the portrait as it grew more and more lovely under the hands of succeeding generations some new touch of beauty some fresh trait half invented half traditional of purity love nobleness majesty till men at last became fascinated with the ideal to which they themselves had contributed and fell down and worshipped their own humanity and christened that the son of god  if i believed that theory or either of the others i need not say that i should not be preaching here  i will go further and say that if i believed either of those theories or any save that which stands out in the text sharpcut and colossal like some old egyptian memnon and like that statue with a smile of sweetness on its lips which tempers the royal majesty of its looksif i did not believe that i sayi should be inclined to confess with homer of old that man is the most miserable of all the beasts of the field  for consider but this one argument  it is no new one it has lain i believe unspoken and instinctive yet most potent and inspiring in many a mind in many an age  if there be a god must he not be the best of all beings  but if he who suffered on calvary were not god but a mere creature thenas i holdthere must have been a creature in the universe better than god himself  or if he who suffered on calvary had not the character which is attributed to himif christs love condescension selfsacrifice be a mere imagination built up by the fancy of man then has christendom for 1800 years been fancying for itself a better god than him who really exists  thousands of the best men and women in the world through all the ages of christendom have agreed with this argument under some shape or other thousands there have been and i trust there will be thousands hereafter who have felt as they looked upon the cross of the son of god not that it was derogatory to christ to believe that he had suffered but derogatory to him to believe that he had not suffered for only by suffering as far as we can conceive could he perfectly manifest his glory and his fathers glory and shew that it was full of grace  full of grace  think i beg you over that one word  we all agree that god is good all at least do so who worship him in spirit and in truth  we adore his majesty because it is the moral and spiritual majesty of perfect goodness  we give thanks to him for his great glory because it is the glory not merely of perfect power wisdom order justice but of perfect love of perfect magnanimity beneficence activity condescension pityin one word of perfect grace  but how much must that last word comprehend as long as there is misery and evil in this world or in any other corner of the whole universe grace to be perfect must shew itself by graciously forgiving penitents pity to be perfect must shew itself by helping the miserable beneficence to be perfect must shew itself by delivering the oppressed  the old prophets and psalmists saw as much as this and preached that this too was part of the essence and character of god  they saw that the lord was gracious and merciful slow to anger and of great kindness and repented him of the evil  they saw that the lord helped them to right who suffered wrong and fed the hungry that the lord loosed men out of prison the lord gave sight to the blind that the lord helped the fallen and defended the fatherless and widow  they saw too a further truth and a more awful one  they saw that the lord was actually and practically king of kings and lord of lords that as such he could come and did come at times rewarding the loyal putting down the rebellious and holding high assize from place to place that he might execute judgment and justice beholding all the wrong that was done on earth and coming as it were out of his place at each historic crisis each revolution in the fortunes of mankind to make inquisition for blood to trample his enemies beneath his feet and to inaugurate some progress toward that new heaven and new earth wherein dwelleth righteousness and righteousness alone  that vision in whatsoever metaphors it may be wrapped up is real and true and will be so as long as evil exists within this universe  were it not true there would be something wanting to the perfect justice and the perfect benevolence of god  but is this all  if this be all what have we christians learnt from the new testament which is not already taught us in the old  where is that new deeper higher revelation of the goodness of god which jesus of nazareth preached and which john and paul and all the apostles believed that they had found in jesus himself  they believed and all those who accepted their gospel believed that they had found for that word grace a deeper meaning than had ever been revealed to the prophets of old time that grace and goodness if they were perfect involved self sacrifice  and does not our own highest reason tell us that they were right  does not our own highest reason which is our moral sense tell us that perfect goodness requires not merely that we should pity our fellowcreatures not merely that we should help them not merely that we should right them magisterially and royally without danger or injury to ourselves but that we should toil for them suffer for them and if need be as the highest act of goodness die for them at last  is not this the very element of goodness which we all confess to be most noble beautiful pure heroical divine  divine even in sinful and fallen man who must forgive because he needs to be forgiven who must help others because he needs help himself who if he suffers for others deserves to suffer and probably will suffer in himself  but how much more heroical and how much more divine in a being who needs neither forgiveness nor help and who is as far from deserving as he is from needing to suffer  and shall this noblest form of goodness be possible to sinful man and yet impossible to a perfectly good god  shall we say that the martyr at the stake the patriot dying for his country the missionary spending his life for the good of heathens ay more shall we say that those women martyrs by the pang without the palm who in secret chambers in lowly cottages have sacrificed and do still sacrifice self and all the joys of life for the sake of simple duties little charities kindness unnoticed and unknown by all save godshall we say that all who have from the beginning of the world shewn forth the beauty of self sacrifice have had no divine prototype in heaventhat they have been exercising a higher grace a nobler form of holiness than he who made them and who as they believe and we ought to believe inspired them with that spirit of unselfishness which if it be not the spirit of god whose spirit can it be  shall we say this and so suppose them holier than their own maker  shall we say this and suppose that they when they attributed selfsacrifice to god made indeed a god in their own image but a god of greater love greater pity greater graciousness because of greater unselfishness than him who really exists  shall we say this the very words whereof confute themselves and shock alike our reason and our conscience  or shall we say with st john and with st paul that if men can be so good god must be infinitely better that if man can love so much god must love more if man by shaking off the selfishness which is his bane can do such deeds then god in whom is no selfishness at all may at least have done a deed as far above theirs as the heavens are above the earth  shall we not confess that mans selfsacrifice is but a poor and dim reflection of the selfsacrifice of god and say with st john herein is love not that we loved god but that he loved us and sent his son to be the propitiation for our sins and with st paul scarcely for a righteous man would one die but god commendeth his love to us in this that while we were yet sinners christ died for us  shall we not say this and find as thousands have found ere now in the cross of calvary the perfect satisfaction of our highest moral instincts the realization in act and fact of the highest idea which we can form of perfect condescension namely selfsacrifice exercised by a being of whom perfect condescension love and selfsacrifice were not required by aught in heaven or earth save by the necessity of his own perfect and inconceivable goodness  we reverence and rightly the majesty of god  how can that infinite majesty be proved more perfectly than by condescension equally infinite we adore and justly the serenity of god who has neither parts nor passions  how can that serenity be proved more perfectly than by passing still serene through all the storm and crowd of circumstance which disturb the weak serenity of man by passing through poverty helplessness temptation desertion shame torture death and passing through them all victorious and magnificent with a moral calm as undisturbed a moral purity as unspotted as it had been from all eternity as it will be to all eternity in that abysmal source of being which we call the bosom of the father  it is the moral majesty of god as shewn on calvary which i uphold  shew that calvary was not inconsistent with that shew that calvary was not inconsistent with the goodness of god but rather the perfection of that goodness shewn forth in time and space then all other arguments connected with gods majesty may go for nought provided that gods moral majesty be safe  provided god be proved to be morally infinitethat is in plain english infinitely good provided god be proved to be morally absolutethat is absolutely unable to have his goodness affected by any circumstance outside him even by the death upon the cross then let the rest go  all words about absoluteness and infinity and majesty beyond that are physicalmetaphors drawn from matter which have nothing to do with god who is a spirit  but gods infinite power too often means in the minds of men only some abstract notion of boundless bodily strength  gods omniscience too often means only some physical fancy of innumerable telescopic or microscopic eyes  gods infinite wisdom too often means only some abstract notion of boundless acuteness of brain  and lastlyi am sorry to have to say it but it must be saidgods infinite majesty too often means in the minds of some superstitious people mere pride and obstinacy and cruelty as of the blind will of some enormous animal which does what it chooses whether right or wrong  if the mystery of the cross contradict any of these carnal or material notions so much the more glory to the mystery of the cross  one spiritual infinite one spiritual absolute it does not contradict and that is the infinite and absolute goodness of god  let all the rest remain a mystery so long as the mystery of the cross gives us faith for all the rest  faith i say  the mystery of evil of sorrow of death the gospel does not pretend to solve but it tells us that the mystery is proved to be soluble  for god himself has taken on himself the task of solving it and has proved by his own act that if there be evil in the world it is none of his for he hates it and fights against it and has fought against it to the death  it simply sayshave faith in god  ask no more of himwhy hast thou made me thus  ask no morewhy do the wicked prosper on the earth  ask no morewhence pain and death war and famine earthquake and tempest and all the ills to which flesh is heir  all fruitless questionings all peevish repinings are precluded henceforth by the passion and death of christ  dost thou suffer  thou canst not suffer more than the son of god  dost thou sympathize with thy fellowmen  thou canst not sympathize more than the son of god  dost thou long to right them to deliver them even at the price of thine own blood  thou canst not long more ardently than the son of god who carried his longing into act and died for them and thee what if the end be not yet  what if evil still endure  what if the medicine have not yet conquered the disease  have patience have faith have hope as thou standest at the foot of christs cross and holdest fast to it the anchor of the soul and reason as well as of the heart for however ill the world may go or seem to go the cross is the everlasting token that god so loved the world that he spared not his onlybegotten son but freely gave him for it  whatsoever else is doubtful this at least is surethat good must conquer because god is good that evil must perish because god hates evil even to the death     sermon ii  the perfect love   1 john iv 10     herein is love not that we loved god but that he loved us and sent    his son to be the propitiation for our sins  this is passionweek the week in which according to ancient and most wholesome rule we are bidden to think of the passion of jesus christ our lord  to think of that however happy and comfortable however busy and eager however covetous and ambitious however giddy and frivolous however free or at least desirous to be free from suffering of any kind we are ourselves  to think of the sufferings of christ and learn how grand it is to suffer for the right  and why  passionweek gives but one answer but that answer is the one best worth listening to  it is grand and good to suffer for the right because god in christ has suffered for the right  let us consider this awhile  it is a first axiom in sound theology that there is nothing good in man which was not first in god  now we all i trust hold god to be supremely good  we ascribe to him in perfection every kind of goodness of which we can conceive in man  we say god is just god is truthful god is pure god is bountiful god is merciful and in one word god is love  god is love  but if we say that do we not say that god is good with a fresh form of goodness which is not justice nor truthfulness nor purity bounty nor mercy though without themnever forget thatit cannot exist  and is not that fresh goodness which we have not defined yet the very kind of goodness which we prize most in human beings  the very kind of goodness which makes us prize and admire love because without it there is no true love no love worth calling by that sacred and heavenly name  and what is that  whatsave selfsacrifice  for what is the love worth which does not shew itself in action and more which does not shew itself in passion in the true sense of that word which this week teaches us namely in suffering  not merely in acting for but in daring in struggling in grieving in agonizing and if need be in dying for the object of its love  every mother in this church will give but one answer to that question for mothers give it among the very animals and the deer who fights for her fawn the bird who toils for her nestlings the spider who will rather die than drop her bag of eggs know at least that love is not worth calling love unless it can dare and suffer for the thing it loves the most gracious of all virtues therefore is selfsacrifice and is there no like grace in god the fount of grace  has god whose name is love never dared never suffered even to the death in the mightiness of a perfect love  we christians say that he has  we say so because it has been revealed to us not by flesh and blood not by brain or nerves not by logic or emotions but by the spirit of god to whom our inmost spirits and highest reasons have made answera god who has suffered for man  that is so beautiful that it must be true  for otherwise we should be leftas i have argued at length elsewherein this strange paradoxthat man has fancied to himself for 1800 years a more beautiful god a nobler god a better god than the god who actually exists  it must be so if god is not capable of that highest virtue of selfsacrifice while man has been believing that he is and that upon the first good friday he sacrificed himself for man out of the intensity of a boundless love  a better god imagined by man than the actual god who made man  we have only to state that absurdity i trust to laugh it to scorn  let us confess then that the passion of christ and the mystery of good friday is as reasonable a belief to the truly wise as it is comfortable to the weary and the suffering let us agree that one of the wisest of englishmen of late gone to his rest spoke well when he said as long as women and sorrow exist on earth so long will the gospel of christianity find an echo in the human heart  let it find an echo in yours  but it will only find one in as far as you can enter into the mystery of passionweek in as far as you can learn from passionweek the truest and highest theology and see what god is like and therefore what you must try to be like likewise  let us think then awhile of the mystery of passionweek the mystery of the cross of christ  christ himself was looking on the coming cross during this passionweek ay and for many a week before  nay rather had he not looked on it from all eternity  for is he not the lamb slain from the foundation of the world  therefore we may well look on it with him  it may seem at first a painful bight  but shall it cast over our minds only gloom and darkness  or shall we not see on the cross the full revelation of light of the light which lightens every man that comes into the world and find that painful not because of its darkness but as the blaze of full sunshine is painful from unbearable intensity of warmth and light  let us see  on the cross of calvary then god the father shewed his own character and the character of his coequal and coeternal son and of the spirit which proceeds from both  for there he spared not his onlybegotten son but freely gave him for us  on the cross of calvary not by the will of man but by the determinate counsel and foreknowledge of god was offered before god the one and only full perfect and sufficient sacrifice oblation and satisfaction for the sin of the whole world  god himself did this  it was not done by any other being to alter his will it was done to fulfil his will  it was not done to satisfy gods anger it was done to satisfy gods love  therefore good friday was well and wisely called by our forefathers good friday because it shews as no other day can do that god is good that gods will to men in spite of all their sins is a good will that so boundless so utterly unselfish and condescending is the eternal love of god that when an insignificant race in a small and remote planet fell and went wrong and was in danger of ruin there was nothing that god would not dare god would not suffer for the sake of even such as us vile earth and miserable sinners  yes this is the good news of passionweek a gospel which men are too apt to forget even to try to forget as long as they are comfortable and prosperous lazy and selfish  the comfortable prosperous man shrinks from the thought of christ on his cross  it tells him that better men than he have had to suffer that the son of god himself had to suffer and he does not like suffering he prefers comfort  the lazy selfish man shrinks from the sight of christ on his cross for it rebukes his laziness and selfishness  christs cross says to himthou art ignoble and base as long as thou art lazy and selfish  rise up do something dare something suffer something if need be for the sake of thy fellow creatures  be of use  take trouble  face discomfort contradiction loss of worldly advantage if it must be for the sake of speaking truth and doing right  if thou wilt not do as much as that then the simplest soldier who goes to die in battle for his duty is a better man than thou a nobler man than thou more like christ and more like god  that is what christs cross preaches to the lazy selfish man and he feels in his heart that the sermon is true but he does not like it  he turns from it and says in his heartoh christs cross is a painful subject and passionweek and good friday a painful time  i will think of something more genial more peaceful more agreeable than sorrow and shame and agony and death good friday is too sad a day for me  yes so a man says too often as long as the fine weather lasts and all is smooth and bright  but when the tempest comes when poverty comes affliction anxiety shame sickness bereavement and still more when persecution comes on a man when he tries to speak truth and do right and finds as he will too often find that people instead of loving him and praising him for speaking truth and doing right hate him and persecute him for it then then indeed passionweek begins to mean something to a man and just because it is the saddest of all times it looks to him the brightest of all times  for in his misery and confusion he looks up to heaven and asksis there any one in heaven who understands all this  does god understand my trouble  does god feel for my trouble  does god care for my trouble  does god know what trouble means  or must i fight the battle of life alone without sympathy or help from god who made me and has put me here  then then does the cross of christ bring a message to that man such as no other thing or being on earth can bring  for it says to himgod does understand thee utterly  for christ understands thee  christ feels for thee  christ feels with thee  christ has suffered for thee and suffered with thee thou canst go through nothing which christ has not gone through  he the son of god endured poverty fear shame agony death for thee that he might be touched with the feeling of thine infirmity and help thee to endure and bring thee safe through all to victory and peace  but again passionweek and above all good friday is a good time because it teaches us above all days what it is to be good and what goodness means  therefore remember this all of you and take it home with you for the year to come  he who has learnt the lesson of passion week and practises it he and he only is a good man  nay more passionweek tells us i believe what is the law according to which the whole world of man and of things yea the whole universe sun moon and stars is made and that is the law of selfsacrifice that nothing lives merely for itself that each thing is ordained by god to help the things around it even at its own expense  that is a hard saying and yet it must be true  the soundest theology and the highest reason tell us that it must be so  for there cannot be two holy spirits now the spirit by which the lord jesus christ sacrificed himself upon the cross is the holy spirit  and the spirit by which the lord jesus christ made all worlds is the holy spirit  but the spirit by which he sacrificed himself on the cross is the spirit of selfsacrifice  and therefore the spirit by which he made the world is the spirit of self sacrifice likewise and selfsacrifice is the law and rule on which the universe is founded  at least that is the true catholic faith as far as my poor intellect can conceive it and in that faith i will live and die  there are those who nowadays will laugh at such a notion and sayselfsacrifice  it is not selfsacrifice which keeps the world going among men or animals or even the plants under our feet but selfishness  competition they say is the law of the universe everything has to take care of itself fight for itself compete freely and pitilessly with everything round it till the weak are killed off and only the strong survive and so out of the free play of the self interest of each you get the greatest possible happiness of the greatest possible number  do we indeed  i should have thought that unbridled selfishness and the internecine struggle of opposing interests had already reduced many nations and seemed likely to reduce all mankind if it went on to that state of the greatest possible misery of the greatest number from which our blessed lord as in this very week died to deliver us  at all events if that is to be the condition of man and of society then man is not made in the likeness of god and has no need to be led by the spirit of god  for what the likeness of god and the spirit of god are passionweek tells usnamely love which knows no selfinterest love which cares not for itself love which throws its own life away that it may save those who have hated it rebelled against it put it to a felons death  my good friends instead of believing the carnal and selfish philosophy which cries every man for himselfi will not finish the proverb in this holy place awfully and literally true as the latter half of it isinstead of believing that believe the message of passionweek which speaks rather thus telling us that not selfishness but unselfishness mutual help and usefulness is the law and will of god and that therefore the whole universe and all that god has made is very good and what does passionweek say to men     could we but crush that evercraving lust    for bliss which kills all bliss and lose our life    our barren unit life to find again    a thousand lives in those for whom we die    so were we men and women and should hold    our rightful place in gods great universe    wherein in heaven and earth by will or nature    nought lives for self  all all from crown to footstool    the lamb before the worlds foundation slain    the angels ministers to gods elect    the sun who only shines to light a world    the clouds whose glory is to die in showers    the fleeting streams who in their ocean graves    flee the decay of stagnant selfcontent    the oak ennobled by the shipwrights axe    the soil which yields its marrow to the flower    the flower which breeds a thousand velvet worms    born only to be prey to every bird    all spend themselves on others and shall man    whose twofold being is the mystic knot    which couples earth and heavendoubly bound    as being both worm and angel to that service    by which both worms and angels hold their lives    shall he whose very breath is debt on debt    refuse forsooth to see what god has made him    no let him shew himself the creatures lord    by freewill gift of that selfsacrifice    which they perforce by natures law must suffer    take up his cross and follow christ the lord  and thus passionweek tells all men in what true goodness lies  in self sacrifice  in it christ on his cross shewed men what was the likeness of god the goodness of god the glory of godto suffer for sinful man  on this day christ saiday and his cross says still and will say to all eternitywouldest thou be good  wouldest thou be like god  then work and dare and if need be suffer for thy fellowmen  on this day christ consecrated and as it were offered up to the father in his own body on the cross all loving actions unselfish actions merciful actions generous actions heroic actions which man has done or ever will do  from him from his spirit their strength came and therefore he is not ashamed to call them brethren  he is the king of the noble army of martyrs of all who suffer for love and truth and justice sake and to all such he saysthou hast put on my likeness and followed my footsteps thou hast suffered for my sake and i too have suffered for thy sake and enabled thee to suffer in like wise and in me thou too art a son of god in whom the father is well pleased  oh let us contemplate this week christ on his cross sacrificing himself for us and all mankind and may that sight help to cast out of us all laziness and selfishness and make us vow obedience to the spirit of self sacrifice the spirit of christ and of god which was given to us at our baptism  and let us give as we are most bound in all humility and contrition of heart thanks praise and adoration to that immortal lamb who abideth for ever in the midst of the throne of god the lamb slain before the foundation of the world by whom all things consist and who in this week died on the cross in mortal flesh and blood that he might make this a good week to all mankind and teach selfish man that only by being unselfish can he too be good and only by selfsacrifice become perfect even as the father in heaven is perfect     sermon iii  the spirit of whitsuntide   isaiah xi 2     the spirit of the lord shall rest upon him the spirit of wisdom and    understanding the spirit of counsel and might the spirit of    knowledge and of the fear of the lord  this is isaiahs description of the spirit of whitsuntide the royal spirit which was to descend and did descend without measure on the ideal and perfect king even on jesus christ our lord the onlybegotten son of god  that spirit is the spirit of god and therefore the spirit of christ  let us consider a while what that spirit is  he is the spirit of love  for god is love and he is the spirit of god of that there can be no doubt  he is the spirit of boundless love and charity which is the spirit of the father and the spirit of the son likewise  for when by that spirit of love the father sent the son into the world that the world through him might be saved then the son by the same spirit of love came into the world and humbled himself and took on him the form of a slave and was obedient unto death even the death of the cross  the spirit of god then is the spirit of love  but the text describes this spirit in different words  according to isaiah the spirit of the lord is the spirit of wisdom and understanding the spirit of counsel and might the spirit of knowledge and of the fear of the lordin one word that i may put it as simply as i canthe spirit of wisdom  now is the spirit of wisdom the same as the spirit of love  sound theology which is the highest reason tells us that it must be so for consider  if the spirit of love is the spirit of god and the spirit of wisdom is the spirit of god then they must be the same spirit  for if they be two different spirits then there must be two holy spirits for any and every spirit of god must be holywhat else can he be  unholy  i leave you to answer that  but two holy spirits there cannot be for holiness which is wisdom justice and love is one and indivisible and as the athanasian creed tells us and as our highest reason ought to tell us there is but one holy spirit who must be at once a spirit of wisdom and a spirit of love  to suppose anything else to suppose that gods wisdom and gods love or that gods justice and gods love are different from each other or limit each other or oppose each other or are anything but one and the same eternally is to divide gods substance to deny that god is one which is forbidden us rightly and according to the highest reason by the athanasian creed  but more experience will shew us that the spirit of love is the same as the spirit of wisdom that if any man wishes to be truly wise and prudent his best wayi may say his only wayis to be loving and charitable  the experience of the apostles proves it  they were i presume the most perfectly loving and charitable of men they sacrificed all for the sake of doing good they counted not their own lives dear to them they enduredwhat did they not endurefor the one object of doing good to men andwhat is harder still harder for any human being because it requires not merely enthusiasm but charity they made themselves st paul at least all things to all men if by any means they might save some  but were they wise in so doing  we may judge of a mans wisdom my friends by his success  we english are very apt to do so  we like practical men  we sayi will tell you what a man is by what he can do  now judged by that rule surely the apostles method of winning men by love proved itself a wise method  what did the apostles do  they had the most enormous practical success that men ever had  they twelve poor men set out to convert mankind by loving them and they succeeded  remember moreover that the text speaks of this spirit of the lord being given to one who was to be a king a ruler a guide and a judge of men who was to exercise influence over men for their good  this prophecy was fulfilled first in the king of kings our lord jesus christ but it was fulfilled also in his apostles who were in their own way and measure kings of men exercising a vast influence over them  and how  by the royal spirit of love  in the apostles the spirit of love and charity proved himself to be also the spirit of wisdom and understanding  he gave them such a converting subduing alluring power over mens hearts as no men have had before or since  and he will prove himself to have the same power in us  our own experience will be the same as the apostles experience  i say this deliberately  the older we grow the more we understand our own lives and histories the more we shall see that the spirit of wisdom is the spirit of love that the true way to gain influence over our fellowmen is to have charity towards them  that is a hard lesson to learn and those who learn it at all generally learn it late almostgod forgive ustoo late  our reason if we would let the spirit of god enlighten it would teach us this beforehand  but we do not usually listen to our reason or to gods spirit speaking to it  and therefore we have to learn the lesson by experience often by very sad and shameful experience  and even that very experience we cannot understand unless the spirit of god interpret it to us and blessed are they who having been chastised hearken to his interpretation  our reason i say should teach us that the spirit of wisdom is none other than the spirit of love  for considerhow does the text describe this spirit  as the spirit of wisdom and understanding that is as the knowledge of human nature the understanding of men and their ways  if we do not understand our fellowcreatures we shall never love them  but it is equally true that if we do not love them we shall never understand them  want of charity want of sympathy want of goodfeeling and fellowfeelingwhat does it what can it breed but endless mistakes and ignorances both of mens characters and mens circumstances  be sure that no one knows so little of his fellowmen as the cynical misanthropic man who walks in darkness because he hates his brother  be sure that the truly wise and understanding man is he who by sympathy puts himself in his neighbours place feels with them and for them sees with their eyes hears with their ears and therefore understands them makes allowances for them and is merciful to them even as his father in heaven is merciful  and next this royal spirit is described as the spirit of counsel and might that is the spirit of prudence and practical power the spirit which sees how to deal with human beings and has the practical power of making them obey  now that power again can only be got by loving human beings  there is nothing so blind as hardness nothing so weak as violence  i of course can only speak from my own experience and my experience is this that whensoever in my past life i have been angry and scornful i have said or done an unwise thing i have more or less injured my own cause weakened my own influence on my fellowmen repelled them instead of attracting them made them rebel against me rather than obey me  by patience courtesy and gentleness we not only make ourselves stronger we not only attract our fellowmen and make them help us and follow us willingly and joyfully but we make ourselves wiser we give ourselves time and light to see what we ought to do and how to do it  and next this spirit is also the spirit of knowledge and of the fear of the lord  ay they indeed both begin in love and end in love  if you wish for knowledge you must begin by loving knowledge for its own sake  and the more knowledge you gain the more you will long to know and more and yet more for ever  you cannot succeed in a study unless you love that study  men of science must begin with an interest in a love for an enthusiasm in the very deepest sense of the word for the phaenomena which they study  but the more they learn of them the more their love increases as they see more and more of their wonder of their beauty of the unspeakable wisdom and power of god shewn forth in every blade of grass which grows in the sunshine and the rain  and if this be true of things earthly and temporary how much more of things heavenly and eternal  we must begin by loving whatsoever things are true whatsoever things are just whatsoever things are pure honest and of good report  we must begin i say by loving them with a sort of childs love without understanding them by that simple instinct and longing after what is good and beautiful and true which is indeed the inspiration of the spirit of god  but as we go on as st paul bids us to meditate on them and if there be any virtue and if there be any praise to think on such things and feed our minds daily with purifying elevating sobering humanizing enlightening thoughts then we shall get to love goodness with a reasonable and manly love to see the beauty of holiness the strength of selfsacrifice the glory of justice the divineness of love and in a wordto love god for his own sake and to give him thanks for his great glory which is that he is a good god  this thoughtremember it i praybrings me to the last point  this spirit is also the spirit of the fear of the lord  and that too my friends must be a spirit of love not only to god but to our fellowcreatures  for if we but consider that god the father loves all that his mercy is over all his works and that he hateth nothing that he has made then how dare we hate anything that he has made as long as we have any rational fear of him awe and respect for him true faith in his infinite majesty and power  if we but consider that god the son actually came down on earth to die and to die too on the cross for all mankind then how dare we hate a human being for whom he died at least if we have true honour gratitude loyalty reverence and godly fear in our hearts toward him our risen lord  oh let us open our eyes this whitsuntide to the experience of our past lives  let us see nowwhat we shall certainly see at the day of judgmentthat whenever we have failed to be loving we have also failed to be wise that whenever we have been blind to our neighbours interests we have also been blind to our own whenever we have hurt others we have hurt ourselves still more  let us at this blessed whitsuntide ask forgiveness of god for all acts of malice and uncharitableness blindness and hardness of heart and pray for the spirit of true charity which alone is true wisdom  and let us come to holy communion in charity with each other and with all determined henceforth to feel for each other and with each other to put ourselves in our neighbours places to see with their eyes and feel with their hearts as far as god shall give us that great grace determined to make allowances for their mistakes and failings to give and forgive live and let live even as god gives and forgives lives and lets live for ever that so we may be indeed the children of our father in heaven whose name is love  then we shall indeed discern the lords bodythat it is a body of union sympathy mutual trust help affection  then we shall with all contrition and humility but still in spirit and in truth claim and obtain our share in the body and the blood in the spirit and in the mind of him who sacrificed himself for a rebellious world     sermon iv  prayer   psalm lxv 2     thou that hearest prayer unto thee shall all flesh come  next friday the 20th of december 1871 will be marked in most churches of this province of canterbury by a special ceremony  prayers will be offered to god for the increase of missionary labourers in the church of england  to many personsi hope i may say to all in this congregationthis ceremony will seem eminently rational  we shall not ask god to suspend the laws of nature nor alter the courses of the seasons for any wants real or fancied of our own  we shall ask him to make us and our countrymen wiser and better in order that we may make other human beings wiser and better and an eminently rational request i assert that to be  for no one will deny that it is good for heathens and savages even if there were no life after death to be wiser and better than they are  it is good i presume that they should give up cannibalism slavetrading witchcraft childmurder and a host of other abominations and that they should be made to give them up not from mere fear of european cannon but of their own wills and consciences seeing that such habits are wrong and ruinous and loathing them accordingly in a word that instead of living as they do and finding in a hundred ways that the wages of sin are death they should be convertedthat is change their waysand live  now that this is the will of godassuming that there is a god and a good godis plain at least to our reason and to our common sense and it is equally plain to our reason and to our common sense that as god has not taught these poor wretches to improve themselves or sent superior beings to improve them from some other world he therefore means their improvement to be brought about as moral improvements are usually brought about by the influence of their fellowmen and specially by us who have put ourselves in contact with them in our worldwide search for wealth and who are certain as we know by sad experience to make the heathen worse if we do not make them better  and as we find from experience that our missionaries wherever they are brought in contact with these savages do make them wiser and happier we ask god to inspire more persons with the desire of improving the heathen and to teach them how to improve them  i say how to improve them  all sneers whether at the failure of missionary labours or at the small results in return for the vast sums spent on missionsall such sneers i say instead of deterring us from praying to god on this matter ought to make us pray the more earnestly in proportion as they are deserved  for they ought to remind us that we possibly may not have gone to work as yet altogether in the right way that there may be mistakes and deficiencies in our method of dealing with the heathen  and if so it seems all the more reason for asking god to set us and others right in case we should be wrong and to make us and others strong in case we should be weak  we thus commit the matter to god  we do not ask god to raise up such missionary labourers as we think fit but such as he thinks fit  we do not pray him to alter his will concerning the heathen but to enable us to do what we know already to be his will  and this course seems to me eminently rational provided always of course that it is rational to believe that there is a god who answers prayer and that if we ask anything according to his will he hears us  now the older i grow and the more i see of the chances and changes of this mortal life and of the needs and longings of the human heart the more important seems this question and all words concerning it whether in the bible or out of the bible  is there anywhere in the universe any being who can hear our prayers  is prayer a superfluous folly or the highest prudence  i sayis there a being who can even hear our prayers  i do not say a being who will always answer them and give us all we ask but one who will at least hear who will listen consider whether what we ask is fit to be granted or not and grant or refuse accordingly  you saywhat is the need of asking such a question  of course we believe that  of course we pray else why are we in church today  well my friends god grant that you may all believe it in spirit and in truth  but you must remember that if so you are in the minority that the majority of civilized men like the majority of mere savages do not pray whatever the women may do and that prayer among thinking and civilized white men has been becoming for the last 100 years at least more and more unfashionable and is likely to judge from the signs of the times to become more unfashionable still after which reign of degrading ungodliness i presumefrom the experience of all historythat our children or grandchildren will see a revulsion to some degrading superstition and the latter end be worse than the beginning  but it is notorious that men are doubting more and more of the efficacy of prayer that philosophers socalled for true philosophers they are noteven though they may be true able and worthy students of merely physical scienceare getting a hearing more and more readily when they tell men they need not pray  they say and here they say rightlythe world is ruled by laws  but some say further and there they say wronglyfor that reason prayer is of no use the laws will not be altered to please you  you yourself are but tiny parts of a great machine which will grind on in spite of you though it grind you to powder and there is no use in asking the machine to stop  so they say prayer is an impertinence  i would that they stopped there  for then we who deny that the world is a machine or anything like a machine might argue fairly with them on the common ground of a common belief in god  but some go further still and saya god  we do not deny that there may be a god but we do not deny that there may not be one  this we sayif he exists we know nothing of him and what is more you know nothing of him  no man can know aught of him  no man can know whether there be a god or not  a living god an acting god a god of providence a god who hears prayer a god such as your bible tells you of is an inconceivable being and what you cannot conceive that you must not believe and therefore prayer is not merely an impertinence it is a mistake for it is speaking to a being who only exists in your own imagination  i need not say my friends that all this to my mind is only a train of sophistry and false reasoning whichso i at least holdhas been answered and refuted again and again  and i trust in god and in christ sufficiently to believe that he will raise up sound divines and true philosophers in his church who will refute it once more  but meanwhile i can only appeal to your common sense to the true and higher reason which lies in mens hearts not in their heads and askand is it come to this  is this the last outcome of civilization the last discovery of the human intellect the last good news for man  that the soundest thinkersthey who have the truest and clearest notion of the universe are the savage who knows nothing but what his five senses teach him and the ungodly who makes boast of his own desire and speaks good of the covetous whom god abhorreth while he says tush god hath forgotten  he hideth away his face and god will never see it  true these socalled philosophers would say that the savage makes a mistake in his sensuality and the worldling in his covetousness and his tyranny that from an imperfect conception of their own true selfinterest they carry their philosophy to conclusions which the philosopher in his study must regret  but as to their philosophy being correct there can be no question that if providence and prayer and the living god be phantoms of mans imagination then the cynical worldling at one end of the social scale and the brutal savage at the other are wiser than apostles and prophets and sages and divines  these men talk of facts the facts of human nature  why do they ask us to ignore the most striking fact of human nature that man even if he were a mere animal is alone of all animalsa praying animal  is that strange instinct of worship which rises in the heart of man as soon as he begins to think to become a civilized being and not a savage to be disregarded as a childish dream when he rises to a higher civilization still  is the experience of men heathen as well as christian for all these ages to go for nought  has it mattered nought whether men cried to baal or to god for with both alike there has been neither sound nor voice nor any that answered  has every utterance that has ever gone up from suffering and doubting humanity gone up in vain  have the prayers of saints the hymns of psalmists the agonies of martyrs the aspirations of poets the thoughts of sages the cries of the oppressed the pleadings of the mother for her child the maiden praying in her chamber for her lover upon the distant battlefield the soldier answering her prayer from afar off with sleep quiet i am in gods handsthose very utterances of humanity which seemed to us most noble most pure most beautiful most divine been all in vainimpertinences the babblings of fair dreams poured forth into nowhere to no thing and in vain  has every suffering searching soul which ever gazed up into the darkness of the unknown in hopes of catching even a glimpse of a divine eye beholding all and ordering all and pitying all gazed up in vain  for at the ground of the universe is not a divine eye but only a blank bottomless eyesocket 39 and man has no father in heaven and christ revealed him not because he was not there to reveal and there was no hope no remedy no deliverance for the miserable among the sons of men  oh my friends those who believe or fancy that they believe such things must be able to do so only through some peculiar conformation either of brain or heart  only want of imagination to conceive the consequences of such doctrines can enable them if they have any love and pity for their fellowmen to preach those doctrines without pity and horror  they know not they know not of what they rob a mankind already but too miserable by its own folly and its own sin a mankind which if it have not hope in god and in christ is trulyas homer said of oldmore miserable than the beasts of the field  if their unconscious conceit did not make them unintentionally cruel they would surely be silent for pitys sake they would let men go on in the pleasant delusion that there is a living god and a word of god who has revealed him to men and would hide from their fellowcreatures the dreadful secret which they think they have discoveredthat there is none that heareth prayer and therefore to him need no flesh come  men take up with such notions i believe most generally in days of comfort ease safety  they find the world so well ordered outwardly that it seems able enough to go on its way without a god  they have themselves so few sorrows struggles doubts that they never feel that sense of helplessness of danger of ignorance which has made the hearts of men in every age yearn for an unseen helper an unseen deliverer an unseen teacher  and so it isand shameful it is that so it should bethat the more god gives to men the less they thank him the less they fancy that they need him but take his bounties as they take the air they breathe unconsciously and as a matter of course  and therefore adversity is wholesome danger is wholesome so wholesome that in all ages as far as i can find the godliest the most moral the most manful and therefore the really happiest and most successful nations or communities of men have been those who were in perpetual danger difficulty struggle and who have thereby had their faith in god called out who have learned in the depth to cry out of the depth to god to lift up their eyes unto the lord and know that their help comes from him  i know a village down in the far west where the 121st psalm which i just quoted was a favourite and more than a favourite  whenever it was given out in churchand the congregation used often to ask for itall joined in singing it young and old men and maidens with an earnestness a fervour a passion such as i never heard elsewhere such as shewed how intensely they felt that the psalm was true and true for them  of all congregational singing i ever heard never have i heard any so touching as those voices when they joined in the old words they loved so well     sheltered beneath the almighty wings    thou shall securely rest    where neither sun nor moon shall thee    by day or night molest    at home abroad in peace in war    thy god shall thee defend    conduct thee through lifes pilgrimage    safe to thy journeys end  do you fancy these people were specially comfortable prosperous folk who had no sorrows and lived safe from all danger and therefore knew that god protected them from all ill  nothing less my friends nothing less  there was hardly a man who joined in that psalm but knew that he carried his life in his hand from year to year that any day might see him a corpsedrowned at sea  hardly a woman who sang that psalm but had lost a husband a father a brother a kinsmandrowned at sea  and yet they believed that god preserved them  they were fishers and sailors earning an uncertain livelihood on a wild and rocky coast  a sudden shift of wind might make as i knew it once to make 60 widows and orphans in a single night  the fishery for the year might fail and all the expense of boats and nets be thrown away  or in default of work at home the young men would go out on voyages to foreign parts and often never came back again dying far from home of fever of wreck of some of the hundred accidents which befal seafaring men  and yet they believed that god preserved them  surely their faith was tried if ever faith was tried  but as surely their faith failed not forif i may so saythey dared not let it fail  if they ceased to trust god what had they to trust in  not in their own skill in seamanship though it was great they knew how weak it was on which to lean  not in the socalled laws of nature the treacherous sea the wild wind the uncertain shoals of fish the chances and changes of a long foreign voyage  without trust in god their lives must have been lives of doubt and of terror for ever anxious about the morrow or else of blind recklessness saying let us eat and drink for tomorrow we die  because they kept their faith in god their lives were for the most part lives of hardy and hopeful enterprise cheerful always in bad luck as in good thankful when their labours were blest with success and when calamity and failure came saying with noble resignationi have received good from the hand of the lord and shall i not receive evil though he slay me yet will i trust in him  it is a life like theirs mixed with danger and uncertainty which most calls out faith in god  it is the life of safety and comfort in which our wants are all supplied ready to our hand which calls it out least and therefore it is that life in cities just because it is most safe and most comfortable is so often alas most ungodly at least among the men  less common thank god is this ungodliness among the women  the nursing of the sick the cares of a family often too sorrows manifold and bitter put them continually in mind of human weakness and of their own weakness likewise  yes  it is sorrow my friends sorrow and failure which forces men to believe that there is one who heareth prayer forces them to lift up their eyes to one from whom cometh their help  before the terrible realities of danger death bereavement disappointment shame ruinand most of all before deserved shame deserved ruinall the arguments of the conceited sophist melt away like the maxims of the comfortable worldling and the man or woman who was but too ready a day before to say tush god will never see and will never hear begins to hope passionately that god does see that god does hear in the hour of darkness when there is no comfort in man nor help in man when he has no place to flee unto and no man careth for his soul then the most awful the most blessed of all questions is but is there no one higher than man to whom i can flee  no one higher than man who cares for my soul and for the souls of those who are dearer to me than my own soul no friend  no helper  no deliverer  no counsellor  even no judge  no punisher  no god even though he be a consuming fire  am i and my misery alone together in the universe  is my misery without any meaning and i without hope  if there be no god then all that is left for me is despair and death  but if there be then i can hope that there is a meaning in my misery that it comes to me not without cause even though that cause be my own fault  i can plead with god like poor job of old even though in wild words like job and askwhat is the meaning of this sorrow  what have i done  what should i do  i will say unto god do not condemn me shew me wherefore thou contendest with me  surely i would speak unto the almighty and desire to reason with god  i would speak unto the almighty and desire to reason with god  oh my friends a man i believe can gain courage and wisdom to say that only by the inspiration of the spirit of god  but when once he has said that from his heart he begins to be justified by faith  for he has had faith in god he has trusted god enough to speak to god who made him and so he has put himself so far at least into his just and right place as a spiritual and rational being made in the image of god  but more he has justified god  he has confessed that god is not a mere force or law of nature nor a mere tyrant and tormentor but a reasonable being who will hear reason and a just being who will do justice by the creatures whom he has made  and so the very act of prayer justifies god and honours god and gives glory to god for it confesses that god is what he is a good god to whom the humblest and the most fallen of his creatures dare speak out the depths of their abasement and acknowledge that his glory is thisthat in spite of all his majesty he is one who heareth prayer a being as magnificent in his justice as he is magnificent in his majesty and his might  all this is argued out as it never has been argued out before or since in the book of job and for seeing so much as this was job approved by god  but there is a further question to which the book of job gives no answer and to which indeed all the old testament gives but a partial answer  and that is thisthis just and magnificent god has he also human pity tenderness charity condescension love  in one word have we not only a god in heaven but a father in heaven  that question could only be answered by the coming of our lord jesus christ  truly he saidno one cometh to the father but by me  no man hath seen god at any time but the onlybegotten son who is in the bosom of the father he hath revealed him  he revealed him in part to abraham in part to moses to job to david to the prophets  but he revealed him perfectly when he saidi and the father are one  he that hath seen me hath seen the father  yes  now we can find boundless comfort in the words such as the father is such is the son and such is the holy ghostlove and condescension without bounds  now we know that there is a man in the midst of the throne of god who is the brightness of gods glory and the express image of his character a high priest who can be touched with the feeling of our infirmities seeing that he was tempted in all things like as we are yet without sin  to him we can cry with human passion and in human words because we know that his human heart will respond to our human hearts and that his human heart again will respond to his divine spirit and that his divine spirit is the same as the divine spirit of his father for their wills and minds are one and their will and their mind isboundless love to sinful man  yes we can look up by faith into the sacred face of christ and take refuge by faith within his sacred heart sayingif it be good for me he will give what i ask and if he gives it not it is because that too is good for me and for others beside me  in all the chances and changes of this mortal life we can say to him as he said in that supreme hourif it be possible let this cup pass from me nevertheless not my will but thine be done sure that he will present that prayer to his father and to our father and to his god and to our god and that whatsoever be the answer vouchsafed by him whose ways are not as our ways nor his thoughts as our thoughts the prayer will not have gone up to christ in vain  and in such a case as this of missions to the heathenif we believe that christ died for these poor heathen if we believe that christ loves these poor heathen infinitely more than we or than the most devoted missionary who ever lived or died for them shall we saythen we may leave them in christs hands to follow their own nature  if he is satisfied with their degradation so may we be  shall we not rather saytheir misery and degradation must pain his sacred heart far more than our sinful hearts and if he does not come down again on earth to help them himself it must be because he means to help them through us his disciples  let us ask him to teach us and others how to help them to enable us and others to help them  let us pray to him the one prayer which unless prayer be a dream is certain to be answered because it is certainly according to gods will the prayer to be taught and helped to do our duty by our fellowmen  and for the rest let us pray in the words of that most noble of all collects to pray which is to take refuge from our own ignorance in the boundless wisdom of gods lovethou who knowest our necessities before we ask and our ignorance in asking have compassion on our infirmities and those things which for our unworthiness we dare not and for our blindness we cannot ask condescend to give us for the worthiness of jesus christ our lord  amen     sermon v  the deaf and dumb   st mark vii 3237     and they bring unto jesus one that was deaf and had an impediment in    his speech and they beseech him to put his hand upon him  and he    took him aside from the multitude and put his fingers into his ears    and he spit and touched his tongue and looking up to heaven he    sighed and said ephphatha that is be opened  and straightway his    ears were opened and the string of his tongue was loosed and he    spake plain    and they were beyond measure astonished saying he    hath done all things well he maketh both the deaf to hear and the    dumb to speak  our greatest living philologer has said and said trulyif wonder arises from ignorance it is from that conscious ignorance which if we look back at the history of most of our sciences has been the mother of all human knowledge  till men began to wonder at the stratification of rocks and the fossilization of shells there was no science of geology till they began to wonder at the words which were perpetually in their mouths there was no science of language  he might have added that till men began to wonder at the organization of their own bodies there was no science of healing that in proportion as the common fact of health became mysterious and marvellous in their eyes just in that proportion did they become able to explain and to conquer disease  for there is a deep difference between the wonder of the uneducated or halfeducated man and the wonder of the educated man  the ignorant in all ages have wondered at the exception the wise in proportion as they have become wise have wondered at the rule pestilences prodigies portents the results of seeming accidents excite the vulgar mind  only the abnormal or casual is worthy of their attention  the man of science finds a deeper and more awful charm in contemplating the results of law in watching not what seem to be occasional failures in nature but what is a perpetual and calm success  the savage knows not i am told what wonder means save from some prodigy  seeing no marvel in the daily glory of the sunlight he is startled out of his usual stupidity and carelessness by the occurrence of an eclipse an earthquake a thunderbolt  the uneducated whatever their rank may be are apt to be more interested by the sight of deformities and defects or excesses in nature than by that of the most perfect normal and natural beauty  those in the same way who in the infancy of european science thought it worth while to register natural phenomena registered exclusively the exceptions  eclipses meteors auroras earthquakes storms and especially monstrosities animal or vegetable exercised their barbaric wonder  the mystery and miracle which underlies the unfolding of every bud the development of every embryo the growth of every atom of tissue in any organism animal or vegetableto all this their intellectual eye was blind  how different from such a state of mind that calm and constant wonder humbling and yet inspiring with which the modern man of science searches into the open mystery of the universe and sees that the true marvel lies not in the infringement of law but in its permanence not in the imperfect but in the perfect not in disease but in health not in deformity but in beauty  these words are true of all nature and specially true it seems to me of our outward senses and faculties true of sight hearing speech  the wonder i think with the wise man will be not that there are deaf and dumb persons to be found here and there among us but that the average nay the majority of mankind are not deaf and dumb  paradoxical as this assertion may seem at first a little thought i believe will prove it to be reasonable  whatever view you take of the origin of sight hearing voice the wonder to a thoughtful mind is just the same how under the storm of circumstances and through the lapse of ages those faculties have not been lost again and again by countless individuals nay by the whole species  for we must confess that those faculties are gradually developed in each individual that every animal and every human being which is born into the world has built up unconsciously involuntarily and as it were out of nothing those delicate and complex organs by which he afterwards learns to see hear and utter sounds  is not the wonder that he should in the majority of cases succeed without any effort of his own  and if i am answered that the success is owing to hereditary tendencies and to the laws by which the offspring resembles the parents i answer is not that a greater wonder still  a wonder which all the discoveries of the scalpel and the microscope have been as yet unable and will be i believe to the last unable to unravel even to touch  a wonder which can be explained by no theories of vibratory atoms vital forces plastic powers of nature or other such phrases which are but metaphysical abstractions having no counterpart in fact and only hiding from us our ignorance of the vast and venerable unknown  the physiologist when he considers the manifold combination of innumerable microscopic circumstances which are required to bring any one creature into the world with a perfectly hearing ear ought to confess that the chancesif the world were governed by chanceare infinitely greater in favour of a childs being born with an imperfect ear rather than with a perfect one and if he should evade the difficulty and try to explain the usual success by saying that nature is governed by law i answerwhat is nature  what is law  you never saw nature nor law either under the microscope  they too are metaphysical abstractions necessary notions and conceptions of your own brain  you have seen nothing but the fact and the custom and all you can do if you be strictly rational is with a certain modern school to say with a despairing humility which i deplore while i respectdeploring it because it is needless despair and yet respecting it because it is humility which is the path out of despair and darkness into hope and lightto say with them man can know nothing of causes he can only register positive facts  this i say is one pathone which i trust none here will tread  the only other path i believe is to go back to the lessons which we ought to have learnt in our childhood for those to whom the human race owes most learnt them thousands of years ago and to ascribe the ever successful miracles of nature to a will to a mind to a providence so like that which each of us exercises in his own petty sphere that we are not only able to understand in part the works of god but to know from the very fact of being able to understand themas one of our greatest astronomers has so well said latelythat we are made in the image of god  to say with the old psalmist that the universe is governed by a law which cannot be broken but why  because god has given it that law  to say all things continue as they were at the beginning but why  because all things serve him in whom we live and move and have our being  to confess the mystery and miracle of our mortal bodies and say with david i am fearfully and wonderfully made such knowledge is too wonderful and excellent for me i cannot attain unto it but to add the one only rational explanation of the mystery which thank god common sense has taught though it may be often in confused and defective forms to the vast majority of the human race in all times and all landsthat he who grasps the mystery and works the miracle is god that his eye sees our substances yet being imperfect and in his book are all our members written which day by day were fashioned when as yet there were none of them  and then to go forward with the psalmist and with the common sense of humanity to conclude that if there be a creator there must also be a providence that that lifegiving spirit which presided over the creation of each organism presides also over its growth its circumstances its fortunes and to say with david whither shall i go then from thy spirit or whither shall i flee from thy presence  if i climb up to heaven thou art there  if i go down to hell thou art there also  if i take the wings of the morning and remain in the uttermost parts of the sea even there thy hand shall lead me thy right hand shall hold me still  yes  to thisto faith and adorationought right and reason to lead the physical philosopher  and to what ought it to lead us who are most of us i presume not physical philosophers  to gratitude surely not unmixed with fear and trembling till we say to ourselveswho am i to boast  who am i to pride myself on possessing a single faculty which one of my neighbours may want  what have i that i did not receive considering the endless chances of failure if the world were left to chance and i may say the absolute certainty of failures if the world were left to the blind competition of merely physical laws is it not only of the lords mercies that we are not failures too that we have not been born crippled blind deaf dumbwhat notby the effect of circumstances over which we have had no control which have been working it may be for generations past in the organizations of our ancestors  but what shall we say of those who have not received what we have received  what shall we say of those who like the deaf and dumb are in some respects at least failuresinstances in which the laws which regulate our organization have not succeeded in effecting a full development  we can say this at least without entangling and dazzling ourselves in speculations about final causes without attempting to pry into the mystery of evil  we can say this that if there be a godas there is a godthese failures are not according to his will  the highest reason should teach us that for it must tell us that in the work of the divine artist as in the work of the human imperfection impotence disorder of any kind must be contrary to the mind and will of the creator  the highest reason i say teaches us this  and scripture teaches it like wise  for if we believe our lord to have been as he wasthe express image of the almighty father if we believe that he cameas he did cometo reveal to men his fathers will his fathers mind his fathers character then we must believe that he acted according to that will and according to that character when he made the healing of disease and the curing of imperfections of this very kind an important and an integral part of his work on earth  and they brought unto jesus one that was deaf and had an impediment in his speech and besought him to put his hand upon him  and jesus took him aside from the multitude and put his fingers into his ears and he spit and touched his tongue and looking up to heaven he sighed and said unto him ephphatha that is be opened  and straightway his ears were opened and the string of his tongue was loosed and he spake plain    and they were beyond measure astonished saying he hath done all things well he maketh both the deaf to hear and the dumb to speak  consider this story awhile  he healed the man miraculously by means at which we cannot guess which we cannot even conceive  but the healing signified at least two thingsthat the man could be healed and that the man ought to be healed that his bodily defectthe retribution of no sin of his ownwas contrary to the will of that father in heaven who willeth not that one little one should perish  but jesus sighed likewise  there was in him a sorrow a compassion most human and most divine  it may have beenmay he forgive me if i dare rashly to impute motives or thoughts to himthat there was something too of a divine wearinessi dare not say impatience seeing how patient he was then and how patient he has been since for more than 1800 yearsof the folly and ignorance of man who brings on himself and on his descendants these and a hundred other preventible miseries simply because he will not study and obey the physical laws of the universe simply because he will not see that those laws which concern the welfare of his body are as surely the will of god as those which concern the welfare of his soul and that therefore it is not merely his interest but his solemn duty to study and to obey them lest he bear the punishment of his own neglect and disobedience  it is not for man even to guess what thoughts may have passed through the mind of christ when he sighed over the very defect which he was healing but it is surely not irreverent in us to say that our lord had cause enough to sigh if he foresaw the follies of mankind during an age which was too soon to comehow men instead of taking the spirit of his miracles and acting on it would counterfeit the mere outward signs of them to feed the vanity or the superstition of a few devotees  how instead of looking on his miracles as rebukes to their own ignorance and imbecility instead of perceiving that their bodily afflictions were contrary to the will of god and therefore curable instead of setting themselves to work manfully in the light of god and by the help of god to discover and correct the errors which produced them mankind would idle away precious centuries in barbaric wonder at seeming prodigies and seeming miracles and would neglect utterly the study of those far more wondrous laws of nature which christ had proved to be under his government and his guidance and had therefore proved to be working for the good of those for whom he came to die  christ had indeed sown good seed in his field  he had taught men by his miracles as he had taught them by his parables to whom nature belonged and whose laws nature obeyed  and the cessation of miracles after the time of christ and his apostles had taught or ought to have taught mankind a further lesson the lesson that henceforth they were to carry on for themselves by the faculties which god had given them that work of healing and deliverance which he had begun  miracles like prophecies like tongues like supernatural knowledge were to cease and vanish away but charity charity which devotes itself for the welfare of the human race was to abide for ever  christ as i said had sown good seed but an enemywe know not whence or whencertainly within the three first centuries of the churchcame and sowed tares among that wheat  then began men to believe that devils and not their father in heaven were to all practical intents the lords of nature  then began they to believe that mans body was the property of satan and his soul only the property of god  then began they to fancy that man was to be delivered from his manifold earthly miseries not by purity and virtue reason and knowledge but by magic masked under the sacred name of religion  no wonder if in such a temper of mind the physical amelioration of the human race stood still  how could it be otherwise while men refused to see in facts the acted will of god and sought not in gods universe but in the dreams of their own brains for glimpses of that divine and wonderful order by which the eternal father and the eternal son are working together for ever through the eternal spirit for the welfare of the universe  we boast my friends at times of the rapid triumphs of modern science were we but aware of the vast amount of preventible misery around us and of the vast possibility of removing it which lies in the little science which we know already we should rather bewail the slow departure of modern barbarism  there has been no period of the world for centuries back i believe in which man might not have been infinitely healthier happier more prosperous more longlived than he has been if he had only believed that disease misery and premature death were not the will of god and of christ and that god had endowed him with an intellect which could understand the laws of the universe in order that he might use those laws for his own health wealth and life  very late is society in commencing that rational course on which it ought to have entered centuries ago and therefore very culpable  and it is not too much to say that to the average of persons suffering under preventible disease or defect even though it be hereditary society owes a sacred debt which it is bound to pay by making those innocent sufferers from others sins as happy as possible where it has not yet learntas it will learn please god some dayto cure them  there is thank god a healthier feeling than of old abroad of late upon this point  men are learning more and more to regard such sufferers not as the victims of gods wrath but of human ignorance vice or folly and it was with deep satisfaction that i read in the last report of the schools for the deaf and dumb a statement of what were considered the most probable physical causes of deafness and dumbness and a hope that it would be possible hereafter to prevent as well as cure those diseases  whether the causes assigned in that report are the true ones is a point of inferior importance for the moment  the really important point is that the principle should be allowed the question raised by a society composed of religious men and teaching to those poor deaf and dumb as almost their primary work that true religion which they are just as capable of receiving as we  the right path has been enteredthe path which is certain in due time to lead to success  and meanwhile our duty is while we confess that it is the fault of society and not of god that these afflicted ones exist among usit is our duty i say to cultivate and to develop to the highest every faculty instinct and power in them which gods order has preserved from the effects of mans disorder to feed the eye with fair and noble sights though the ear be shut to soothing and inspiring sounds to cultivate the intellect to such a pitch that it may be able to perform practical work and if possible to earn a sufficient livelihood even though the want of speech makes it impossible for them deaf and dumb to compete on equal terms with their fellowmen to awaken in them by religious training teaching and worship those purer and more unselfish emotions by which their hearts may become a field ready and prepared for gods grace  to do this and to regard them whenever we come in contact with them not merely with pity while we remember how much their intellects lose in losing the whole world of sound but with hope when we see that through the one sense which is left they take in fully not only the meaning of the voluble hands which teach them but more the meaning of that meaningthe spiritual truths and feelings which signs express with wonder not at the defect but at the innate health which almost compensates for the want of hearing by concentrating its powers upon the sight and lastly with admiration for that humanity which as it were imprisoned fettered maimed yet can by the godgiven force of the immortal spirit so burst its prisonbars and rise through hindrances which seem to us impassable to the tenderest the noblest the purest and most devout emotions     sermon vi  the fruits of the spirit   st john iii 8     the wind bloweth whither it listeth and thou hearest the sound    thereof but canst not tell whence it cometh or whither it goeth so    is every one that is born of the spirit  it is often askedmen have a right to askwhat would the world have been by now without christianity without the christian religion without the church  but before these questions can be answered we must define it is discovered what we mean by christianity the christian religion the church  and it is foundor i at least believe it will be foundmore safe and wise to ask a deeper and yet a simpler question still what would the world have been without that influence on which christianity and religion and the church depend  what would the world have been without the holy spirit of god  but some will say this is a more abstruse question still  how can you define how can you analyse the spirit of god  nay more how can you prove its existencesuch questioners have been as it were baptized unto johns baptism  they are very glad to see people do right and not do wrong from any wellcalculated motives or wholesome and pleasant emotions  but they have not as yet heard whether there be any holy spirit  we can only answer just so  this holy spirit in whom we believe defies all analysis all definition whatsoever  his nature can be brought under no terms derived from human emotions or motives  he is literally invisible as invisible to the conception of the brain as he is to the bodily eye  his presence is proved only by its effects  the spirit bloweth whither it listeth and thou hearest the sound thereof but thou canst not tell whence it cometh nor whither it goeth  such words must sound as dreams to those analytical philosophers who allow nothing in man below the sphere of consciousness actual or possible who have dissected the human mind till they find in it no personal will no indestructible and spiritual self but a character which is only the net result of innumerable states of consciousness who hold that mans outward actions and also his inmost instincts are all the result either of calculations about profit and loss pleasure and pain or of emotions whether hereditary or acquired  ignoring the deep and ancient distinction which no one ever brought out so clearly as st paul between the flesh and the spirit they hold that man is flesh and can be nothing more that each person is not really a person but is the consequence of his brain and nerves and having thus by logical analysis got rid of the spirit of man their reason and their conscience quite honestly and consistently see no need for or possibility of a spirit of god to ennoble and enable the human spirit  why need there be if the difference between an animal and a man be one of degree alone and not of kind  we answer that there is a flesh in man brain and nerves emotions and passions identical with that of animals we do not deny  we should be fools if we did deny it for the fact is hideously and shamefully patent none knew that better than st paul who gave a list of the works of the flesh the things which a man does who is the slave of his own brain and nervesand a very ugly list it isbeginning with adultery and ending with drunkenness after passing through all the seven deadly sins  and neither st paul nor we deny that in this fleshly carnal and animal state the vast majority of the human race has lived and lives still to its own infinite misery and confusion and that it has a perpetual tendency whenever lifted out of that state to fall back into it again and perish  but st paul says and we say that crushed under this animal nature there is in man a spirit  we say that below all his consciousness lies a nobler element a divine spark or at least a divine fuel which must be kindled into life by the divine spirit the spirit of god  and we say that in proportion as that spirit of god kindles the spirit of man he begins to act after a fashion for which he can give no logical reason that by instinct and without calculation of profit or loss pleasure or pain he begins to act on what he calls duty honour love selfsacrifice  but what these are he cannot analyse  mere words cannot define them  he can only obey that which prompts him he knows not what nor whence and say with luther of old i can do no otherwise  god help me  and we say that such men and women are the salt of the earth who keep society from rotting that by such men and women and by their example and influence direct and indirect has christendom been raised up out of the accursed slough into which europe and indeed the whole known world had fallen during the early roman empire and that to this influence and therefore to the holy spirit of god alone and not to any prudential calculations combined experiences or socalled philosophies of men is owing all which keeps europe from being a hell on earth  and we say moreover that those who deny this and dream of a morality and a civilization without the spirit of god are unconsciously throwing down the ladder by which they themselves have climbed and sawing off the very bough to which they cling  duty honour love selfsacrificethese are the fruits of the spirit unknown to and unobeyed by the savage or by the civilized man whoas has too often happenedas is happening now in too many lands on both sides of the atlantic is sinking back into inward savagery amid an outward and material civilization  moreoverand this appears to us a fair experimental proof that our old fashioned belief in a spirit of god which acts upon the spirit of man is a true beliefmoreover i say it is a patent fact that wherever and whenever there has been a revival of the christian religion whenever that is amid whatsoever confusions and errors men have begun to feel the need of the holy spirit of god and to pray for that spirit a moral revival has accompanied the religious one  men and women have not only become better themselves and that often suddenly and in very truth miraculously better but the yearning has awoke in them to make others better likewise  the grace of god as they have called it has made them gracious to their fellowcreatures and duty honour love selfsacrifice call it by what name we will has said to them with a still small voice more potent than all the thunders of the law go and seek and save that which is lost  in no case has this instinctive tendency to practical benevolence been more striking than in the case of that great religious revival throughout england at the beginning of this century which issued in the rise of the evangelical school a school rightly so called because its members did try to obey the precepts of the gospel according to their understanding of them in spirit and in truth  the doctrines which they held are a matter not for us but for god and their own souls  the deeds which they did are matter for us and for all england for they have left their mark on the length and breadth of the land  they were inspiredcultivated highborn and wealthy folk many of themwith a strange new instinct that god had bidden them to feed the hungry to clothe the naked to visit the prisoner and the sick to bind up the brokenhearted to proclaim liberty to the captives and to preach good tidings to the meek  a strange new instinct and from what cause save from the same cause as that which isaiah assigned to his own like deedsbecause the spirit of the lord was upon him  yes if those gracious men those gracious women did not shew forth the spirit and grace of god with power then there is either no spirit of god no grace of god or those who deny to them the name of saints forget the words of him who said by their fruits ye shall know them of him who said too that the unpardonable sin the sin which shewed complete moral perversion the sin against the holy spirit of god was to attribute good deeds to bad motives and say he casteth out devils by beelzebub the prince of the devils  yes that old evangelical school may now have passed its prime  it may now be verging toward old age and other schools younger and stronger with broader and clearer knowledge of dogma of history civil and ecclesiastical of the value of ceremonial of the needs of the human intellect and emotions may have passed it in a noble rivalry and snatched as it were from the hands of the old evangelical school the lamp of truth to bear it further forward in the race  but god forbid that the spiritual children should be ungrateful to their spiritual parents though god may have taught them things which their parents did not know  and they were our spiritual parents those old evangelicals  no just and wellinformed man who has passed middle age but must confess that to them we owe whatsoever vital religion exists at this moment in any school or party of the church of england that to them we owe the germs at least and in many cases the full organization and the final success of a hundred schemes of practical benevolence and practical justice without which this country in its haste to grow rich at all risks and by all means might have plunged itself ere now into anarchy and revolution  and he must confess too if he is one who has seen much of his fellowcreatures and their characters that that school numbered among its disciplesand thank god they are not all yet gone home to their restsome of the loveliest human souls whose converse has chastened and ennobled his own soul  ah well     the old order changeth giving place to the new    and god fulfils himself in many ways    lest one good custom should corrupt the world  and new methods and new institutions have arisen and will yet arise for seeking and saving that which is lost  gods blessing on them all to whatsoever party church or sect they may belong  whosoever cast out devils in christs name christ has forbidden us to forbid them whether they follow us or not  but yet shall we not still honour and love the old evangelical school and many an institution which it has left behind as heirlooms to some of us at least from our mothers or from women to whom we owed in long past years our earliest influences for good our earliest examples of a practical christian life our earliest proofs that there was indeed a spirit of god a gracious spirit who gave grace to the hearts the deeds the very looks and voices of those in whom he dwelt institutions which are too likely some of them to die simply from the loss of old friends  the loss of old friends  yes so it is always in this world  the old earnest hearts go home one by one to their rest and the young earnest heartsand who shall blame themgo elsewhere and try new fashions of doing good which are more graceful and more agreeable to them  for the religious world like all other forms of the world has its fashions and of them too stands true the saying of the apostle that this world and the fashion thereof pass away  many a good work which once was somewhat fashionable in its way has become somewhat unfashionable and something else is fashionable in its place and fiveandtwenty years hence something else will have become fashionable and our children will look back on our ways of doing good with pity if not with contempt as narrow and unenlightened just as we are too apt to look back on our fathers ways  and all the while what can they teach worth teaching what can we teach worth teaching save what our fathers and mothers taught what the spirit of god taught them and has taught to all who would listen since the foundation of the world shewing man what was good and what was thatwhat doth the lord require of thee but to do justly and to love mercy and to walk humbly with thy god  ah why do we even in religious and moral matters even in the doing good to the souls and bodies of our fellowcreatures allow ourselves to be the puppets of fashions  of fashions which even when harmless even beautiful are but the garments or rather stageproperties in which we dress up the high instincts which gods spirit bestows on us in order to make them agreeable enough for our own prejudices or pretty enough for our own tastes  how little do we perceive our own dangerso little that we yield to it every daythe danger of mistaking our fashion of doing good for the good done aye for the very spirit of god who inspires that good mistaking the garment for the person who wears it the outward and visible sign for the inward and spiritual grace and so in our hearts falling actually into that very error of transubstantiation of which we repudiate the name  why ah why will we not take refuge from fashions in him in whom are no fashionseven in the holy spirit of god who is unchangeable and eternal as the father and the son from whom he proceeds who has spoken words in sundry and divers manners to all the elect of god who has inspired every good thought and feeling which was ever thought or felt in earth or heaven but whose message of inspiration has been and will be for ever the samedo justly love mercy walk humbly with thy god  could we but utterly trust him and utterly believe in his presence then we should welcome all truth under whatever outward forms of the mere intellect it was uttered then we should bless every good deed by whomsoever and howsoever it was done then we should rise above all party strifes party cries party fashions and shibboleths to the contemplation of the one supreme good spiritthe spirit of jesus christ the same yesterday today and for ever and hold to the one fashion of almighty god which never changes for it is eternal by the necessity of his own eternal character namelyto be perfect even as our father in heaven is perfect because he causes his sun to shine on the evil and on the good and his rain to fall on the just and on the unjust     sermon vii  confusion   psalm cxix 31     i have stuck unto thy testimonies o lord confound me not  what is the meaning of this text  what is this which the psalmist and prophets call being confounded being put to shame and confusion of face what is it  it is something which they dread more than death which they dread as much as hell  nay it seems in the mind of some of them to be part and parcel of hell itself one of the very worst things which could happen to them after death for what is written in the book of the prophet danielmany of them that sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake some to everlasting life and some to shame and everlasting contempt  and we christians are excusable if we dread it likewise  how often does st paul speak of shame as an evil to be dreaded just as he speaks even more often of glory and honour as a thing to be longed for and striven after  that one word ashamed occurs twelve times and more in the new testament beside st johns warning which alone is enough to prove what i allege that we have not to be ashamed before christ at his coming  and how does the te deumthe noblest hymn written by man since st john finished his book of revelationshow does that end but with the same old cry as that of the psalmist in the 119th psalm  o lord in thee have i trusted let me never be confounded  now it is difficult to tell men what being confounded means difficult and almost needless for there are those who know what it means without being told and those who do not know what it means without being told are not likely to know by my telling or any mans telling  no not if an angel from heaven came and told them what being confounded meant would they understand him at least till they were confounded themselves and then they would know by bitter experienceperhaps when it was too late  and who are they  what sort of people are they  first silly persons whom solomon calls foolsthough they often think themselves refined and clever enoughluxurious and fashionable people who do not care to learn who think nothing worth learning save how to enjoy themselves who call it bad form to be earnest and turn off all serious questions with a jest  these are they of whom wisdom sayshow long ye simple ones will ye love simplicity and the scorners delight in their scorning and fools hate knowledge  i also will laugh at your calamity and mock when your fear cometh  next mean and truly vulgar persons who are shameless who do not care if they are caught out in a lie or in a trick  these are they of whom it is written that outside of gods kingdom in the outer darkness wherein are weeping and gnashing of teeth are dogs and whosoever loveth and maketh a lie  and next and worst of all selfconceited people  these are they of whom solomon says seest thou a man who is wise in his own conceit there is more hope of a fool than of him  they are the people who will not see when they are going wrong who will not hear reason nor take advice no nor even take scorn and contempt who will not see that they are making fools of themselves but while all the world is laughing at them walk on serenely selfsatisfied certain that they and they only know what the world is made of and how to manage the world  these are they of whom it is writtenhe that being often reproved hardeneth his neck shall suddenly be destroyed and that without remedy  then they will learn and with a vengeance what being confounded means by being confounded themselves and finding themselves utterly wrong where they thought themselves utterly right  yet no  i do not think that even that would cure some people  there are those i verily believe who would not confess that they were in the wrong even in the bottomless pit but like satan and his fallen angels in miltons poem would have excellent arguments to prove that they were injured and illused deceived and betrayed and lay the blame of their misery on god on man on anything but their own infallible selves  who then are the people who know what being confounded means who are afraid and terribly afraid of being brought to shame and confusion efface  i should say all human beings in proportion as they are truly human beings are not brutal in proportion that is as they are good or have the capacity of goodness in them that is in proportion as the spirit of god is working in them giving them the tender heart the quick feelings the earnestness the modesty the conscientiousness the reverence for the good opinion of their fellowmen which is the beginning of eternal life  do you not see it in the young  modesty bashfulness shamefacednessas the good old english word wasthat is the very beginning of all goodness in boys and girls  it is the very material out of which all other goodness is made and those who laugh at or torment young people for being modest and bashful are doing the devils work and putting themselves under the curse which god by the mouth of solomon the wise pronounced against the scorners who love scorning and the fools who hate knowledge  this is the rule with dumb animals likewise  the more intelligent the more highbred they are the more they are capable of feeling shame and the more they are liable to be confounded to lose their heads and become frantic with doubt and fear  who that has watched dogs does not know that the cleverer they are the more they are capable of being actually ashamed of themselves as human beings are or ought to be  who that has trained horses does not know that the stupid horse is never vicious never takes fright  the failing which highbred horses have of becoming utterly unmanageable not so much from bodily fear as from being confounded not knowing what people want them to dothat is the very sign the very effect of their superior organization and more shame to those who illuse such horses  if god my friends dealt with us as cruelly and as clumsily as too many men deal with their horses he would not be long in driving us mad with terror and shame and confusion but he remembers our frame he knoweth whereof we are made and remembereth that we are but dust else the spirit would fail before him and the souls which he hath made  and to him we can cry even when we know that we have made fools of ourselvesfather who made me christ who died for me holy spirit who teachest me have patience with my stupidity and my ignorance  lord in thee have i trusted let me never be confounded  but some will tell usit is a sign of weakness to feel shame  why should you care for the opinion of your fellowmen  if you are doing right what matter what they say of you  yes my friends if you are doing right  but if you are not doing rightwhat then  if you have only been fancying that you are doing right and suspect suddenly that you have been very likely doing wrongwhat then  when a man tells me that he does not care what people think of him that they cannot shame him in the first place i do not quite believe that he is speaking truth and in the next place i hope he is not speaking truth  i hopefor his own sakethat he does care what people think of him or else i must suspect him of being very dull or very conceited  and if he tells me that the old prophets and holy and just and heroic men in all ages never cared for peoples laughing at them and despising them provided they were doing right according to their own conscience i answerthat he knows nothing about the matter that he has not honestly read the writings of these men  i say that the psalmist who wrote ps 119 was a man on his own shewing intensely open to the feeling of shame and felt intensely what men said of him felt intensely slander and insult  we talk of independent and true patriots nowadays  i will tell you of four of the noblest patriots the world ever saw who were men of that stamp  i say that isaiah was such a man that jeremiah was such a man that ezekiel was such a man that their writings shew that they felt intensely the rebukes and the contempt which they had to endure from those whom they tried to warn and save  i say again that st paul as may be seen from his own epistles was such a man a man who was intensely sensitive of what men thought and said of him yearning after the love and approbation of his fellowmen and above all of his fellowcountrymen his own flesh and blood and that that feeling in him which may have been hurtful to him before he was converted was of the greatest use to him after his conversion that it enabled him to win all hearts because he felt with men and for men and gained him over the hearts of men such a power as no mere human being ever had before or since  and i say that of all men the lord jesus christ the son of man had that feeling that longing for the love and appreciation of menand above all for the love and appreciation of his countrymen according to the flesh the jews he hadstrange as it may seem yet there it is in the gospels written for ever and undeniablethat capacity of shame which is the mark of true nobleness of soul  he endured the cross despising the shame  yes but there are too many on earth who endure shame with brazen faces just because they do not feel it  if he had not felt the shame what merit in despising it  it was his glory that he felt the shame and yet conquered the shame and crushed it down by the might of his love for fallen man  do you fancy that in his agony in the garden when his sweat was as great drops of blood that it was only bodily fear of pain and death which crushed him for the moment  he felt that i doubt not as he had to taste death for every man and feel all human weakness yet without sin but it was a deeper more painful and yet more noble feeling than mere fear which then convulsed his sacred heart even the feeling of shamethe mockery of the crowdthebut i dare not enlarge on anything so awful at least i will say thisthat he had to cry as none ever cried before or since o god in thee have i trusted let me never be confounded for he had it seems actually at one supreme moment to feel confounded and to say my god my god why hast thou forsaken me  that was the highest and most precious jewel of all his selfsacrifice  of it let us only say  our lord and saviour stooped to be confounded for a moment that we might not be confounded to all eternity  and therefore our blessed lord is to us an example  as he did so must we try to do  he entered into glory by suffering shame and yet despising it  he submitted to be confounded before men that he might not be confounded in the sight of god his father  and so must we sometimes at least  every man who makes up his mind to do right and to be good must expect ridicule now and then  rich or poor boy or man if you try to keep your hands clean and your path straight the world will think you a fool and will be ready enough to tell you so for it is cruel and insolent enough  and the more tender your heart the more you wish for the love and approbation of your fellowmen the more of noble and modest selfdistrust there is in you the more painful will that be to you the more you will be tempted to obey man and not god and to follow after the multitude to do evil merely to keep the peace and live a quiet life and not be laughed at and tormented  and thus the fear of man brings a snare and naught can deliver you out of that snare save the opposite fearthe fear of god which is the same as trust in god  joseph of old feared god when he was tempted and said how can i do this great wickedness and sin against god  but i doubt not there were plenty in egypt who would have called him a fool for his pains  there are hundreds of gay youths in any great citythere may be a few in this abbey now for aught i knowwho would have laughed loudly enough at joseph for throwing away the opportunity of what certain foolish french have learnt to call as its proper name a bonne fortunea piece of good luckas if breaking the 7th commandment could be aught but bad fortune and the cause of endless miseries in this life and the life to come  and it may be as joseph was all but confounded and brought to shame at least from man when he found that all that he gained by fearing god wasa false accusation the very shame and contempt from which he most shrank danger of death imprisonment in a dungeon  but he was true to god and god was true to him  he trusted in god and therefore he feared god for he trusted that gods laws were just and good and worth obeying and therefore he was afraid to break them  he trusted in god and therefore he hoped in god for he trusted that god was strong enough and good enough to deliver him out of prison and make his righteousness as clear as the light and his just dealing as the noonday  he cried out of his prison doubt it not many a time and ofto god in thee have i trusted let me never be confounded  and he was not confounded  he came into egypt a slave  he was cast into prison on a shameful accusation but he came out of prison to be a ruler and a prince honoured and obeyed by the greatest nation of the old world  he trusted in god and he was not confounded for ever even as the lord christ trusted in god and was not confounded for ever even as we if we do not wish to be confounded for ever must trust in god and instead of being scornful careless conceited must fear him and say my flesh trembleth because of thy righteous judgments  and then the laughter of fools will end where it began in harmless noise like says solomon the crackling of thorns under a pot  then whosoever may scorn you on earth the great god in heaven will not scorn you  you may be confounded for a moment here on earth  worldly people may take advantage of your misfortunes and cry over youthere there so would we have it take him and persecute him for there is none to deliver him where is now his god  so it may be with you for as surely as you fall many a cur will spring up and bark at you who dared not open his mouth at you while you stood safe  orworse by far than thatthe world may take hold of your really weak points of your inconsistencies of your faults and failings and cryfie on thee fie on thee  we saw it with our eyes  for all his high professions for all his talk of truth and justice he is no better than the rest of the world  and that scoff does go very near to confound a man because he feels that it is half true half deserved and is afraid that it may be quite true and quite deserved and then confounded indeed he would be by his own conscience and by god as well as by man  all he can do is to cry to god like him who wrote the 119th psalmi have stuck unto thy testimonies o lord confound me not  i know i am weak ignorant unsuccessful full of faults too and failings which make me ashamed of myself every day of my life  i have gone astray like a sheep that is lost  but seek thy servant o lord for i do not forget thy commandments  i am trying to learn my duty  i am trying to do my duty  i have stuck unto thy testimonies o lord confound me not  man may confound me  but do not thou of thy mercy and pity o lord  do not let me find when i die or before i die that all my labour has been in vain that i am not a better man not a wiser man not a more useful man after all  do not let my grey hairs go down with sorrow to the grave  do not let me die with the miserable thought that in spite of all my struggles to do my duty my life has been a failure and i a fool  do not let me wake in the next life like dives in the torment to be utterly confounded to find that i was all wrong and have nothing left but everlasting disappointment and confusion of face  o lord who didst endure all shame for me save me from that most utter shame  o god in thee have i trusted let me never be confounded  wake in the next life to find oneself confounded  alas alas  many a man wakes in this life to find himself that and really sometimes by no fault seemingly of his own so that all he can do is to be dumb and not to open his mouth for it is gods doing  for a mans worst miseries and sorrows are too often caused not by himself but by those whom he loves  consider the one case of vice or even of mere ingratitude in those nearest and dearest to a mans heart and of being so confounded through them and by them in spite of all love care strictness tenderness teaching prayerswhat notand all in vain  no wonder that under that bitterest blow valiant and virtuous men ere now have never lifted up their heads again but turned their faces to the wall and died and may the lord have mercy on them  confounded they have been in this world confounded they will not be we must trust in the world to come  the lord of all pity will pity them and pour his oil and wine into their aching wounds and bring them to his own inn and to his secret dwellingplace where the wicked cease from troubling and the weary are at rest  one word more and i have done  do you wish to pray with hope that you may be heardo lord confound me not and bring me not to shame  then hold to one commandment of christs  do to others as you would they should do to you  for with what measure you measure to your fellowmen it shall be measured to you again  have charity have patience have mercy  never bring a human being however silly ignorant or weak above all any little child to shame and confusion of face  never by cruelty by petulance by suspicion by ridicule even by selfish and silly haste never above all by indulging in the devilish pleasure of a sneer crush what is finest and rouse up what is coarsest in the heart of any fellowcreature  never confound any human soul in the hour of its weakness  for then it may be in the hour of thy weakness christ will not confound thee     sermon viii  the shaking of the heavens and the earth   hebrews xii 2629     yet once more i shake not the earth only but also heaven  and this    word yet once more signifieth the removing of those things that are    shaken as of things that are made that those things which cannot be    shaken may remain  wherefore we receiving a kingdom which cannot be    moved let us have grace whereby we may serve god acceptably with    reverence and godly fear for our god is a consuming fire  this is one of the royal texts of scripture  it is inexhaustible like the god who inspired it  it has fulfilled itself again and again at different epochs  it fulfilled itself specially and notoriously in the first century  but it fulfilled itself again in the fifth century and again at the crusades and again at the reformation in the sixteenth century  and it may be that it is fulfilling itself at this very day that in this century both in the time of our fathers and in our own the lord has been shaking the heavens and the earth that those things which can be shaken may be removed as things that are made while those things which cannot be shaken may remain  all confess this to be true each in his own words  they talk of this age as one of change of rapid progress for good or evil of unexpected discoveries of revolutions intellectual moral social as well as political  our notions of the physical universe are rapidly altering with the new discoveries of science and our notions of ethics and theology are altering as rapidly  the era assumes a different aspect to different minds just as did the first century after christ according as men look forward to the future with hope or back to the past with regret  some glory in the nineteenth century as one of rapid progress for good as the commencement of a new era for humanity as the inauguration of a reformation as grand as that of the sixteenth century others bewail it as an age of rapid decay in which the old landmarks are being removed the old paths lost in which we are rushing headlong into scepticism and atheism in which the world and the church are both in danger and the last day is at hand  both parties may be right and yet both may be wrong  men have always talked thus at great crises in the worlds life  they talked thus in the first century and in the fifth and in the eleventh and again in the sixteenth and then both parties were partially right and partially wrong and so they may be now  what they meant to say what they wanted to say what we mean and want to say has been said already for us in far deeper wider and more accurate words by him who wrote this wonderful epistle to the hebrews when he told the jews of his time that the lord was shaking the heavens and the earth that those things which were shaken might be removed as things that are madecosmogonies systems theories prejudices fashions of mans invention while those things which could not be shaken might remain because they were according to the mind and will of god eternal as that source from whence they came forth even the bosom of god the father  yet once more i shake not the earth only but also heaven  how has the earth been shaken in our days and the heaven likewise  how rapidly have our conceptions of both altered  how easy simple certain it all looked to our forefathers in the middle age  how difficult complex uncertain it all looks to us  with increased knowledge has comenot increased doubt that i deny utterly  i deny once and for all that this age is an irreverent age  i say that an irreverent age is one like the age of the schoolmen when men defined and explained all heaven and earth by a priori theories and cosmogonies invented in the cloister and dared poor simple ignorant mortals to fancy that they could comprehend and gauge the ways of him whom the heaven and the heaven of heavens could not contain  this this is irreverence but it is neither irreverence nor want of faith if a man awed by the mystery which encompasses him from the cradle to the grave shall lay his hand upon his mouth with job and obey the voice which cries to him from earth and heavenbe still and know that as the heavens are higher than the earth so are my ways higher than thy ways and my thoughts higher than thine  but it was all easy and simple and certain enough to our forefathers the earth according to the popular notion was a flat plane or if it were as the wiser held a sphere yet antipodes were an unscriptural heresy  above it were the heavens in which the stars were fixed or wandered and above them heaven after heaven each tenanted by its own orders of beings up to that heaven of heavens in which deityand by him be it always remembered the mother of deitywas enthroned  and if above the earth was the kingdom of light and purity and holiness what could be more plain than that below it was the kingdom of darkness and impurity and sin  that was no theory to our forefathers it was a physical fact  had not even the heathens believed as much and said so by the mouth of the poet virgil  he had declared that the mouth of tartarus lay in italy hard by the volcanic lake avernus and after the unexpected eruption of vesuvius in the first century nothing seemed more clear than that virgil was right and that men were justified in talking of tartarus styx and phlegethon as indisputable christian entities  etna stromboli hecla were according to this cosmogony in like wise mouths of hell and there were not wanting holy hermits who had heard from within those craters shrieks and clanking chains and the howls of demons tormenting the souls of the endlessly lost  our forefathers were not aware that centuries before the incarnation of our lord the buddhist priests had held exactly the same theory of moral retribution and that painted on the walls of buddhist temples might be seen horrors identical with those which adorned the walls of many a christian church in the days when men believed in this tartarology as firmly as they now believe in the results of chemistry or of astronomy  and nowhow is the earth shaken and the heavens likewise in that very sense in which the expression is used by him who wrote to the hebrews our conceptions of them are shaken  how much of that mediaeval cosmogony do educated men believe in the sense in which they believe that the three angles of a triangle are equal to two right angles or that if they steal their neighbours goods they commit a sin  the earth has been shaken for us more and more violently as the years have rolled on  it was shaken when astronomy told us that the earth was not the centre of the universe but a tiny planet revolving round a sun in a remote region thereof  it was shaken when geology told us that the earth had endured for countless ages during which continents had become oceans and oceans continents again and again  and even now it is being shaken by researches into the antiquity of man into the origin and permanence of species whichlet the result be what it willmust in the meanwhile shake for us theories and dogmas which have been undisputed for 1500 years  and with the rest of our cosmogony that conception of a physical tartarus below the earth has been shaken likewise till good men have been fain to find a fresh place for it in the sun or in a comet or to patronize the probable but as yet unproved theory of a central fire within the earth not on any scientific grounds but simply if by any means they can assign a region in space wherein material torment can be inflicted on the spirits of the lost  and meanwhile the heavens the spiritual world is being shaken no less more and more frequently more and more loudly men are askingnot sceptics merely but pious men men who wish to be and who believe themselves to be orthodox christiansmore and more loudly are such men asking questions which demand an answer with a learning and an eloquence as well as with a devoutness and a reverence for scripture whichwhether rightly or wrongly employedis certain to command attention  rightly or wrongly these men are asking whether the actual and literal words of scripture really involve the mediaeval theory of an endless tartarus  they are saying it is not we who deny but you who assert endless torments who are playing fast and loose with the letter of scripture you are reading into it conceptions borrowed from virgil dante milton when you translate into the formula endless torment such phrases as the outer darkness the fire of gehenna the worm that dieth not which according to all just laws of interpretation refer not to the next life but to this life and specially to the approaching catastrophe of the jewish nation or when you say that eternal death really means eternal lifeonly life in torture  rightly or wrongly they are saying this and then they add we do not yield to you in love and esteem for scripture  we demand not a looser but a stricter not a more metaphoric but a more literal not a more contemptuous but a more reverent interpretation thereof  so these men speak rightly or wrongly  and for good or for evil they will be heard  and with these questions others have arisen not new at allsay these menbut to be found amid many contradictions in the writings of all the best divines when they have given up for a moment systems and theories and listened to the voice of their own hearts questions natural enough to an age which abhors cruelty has abolished torture labours for the reformation of criminals and debatesrightly or wronglyabout abolishing capital punishment  men are asking questions about the heaventhe spiritual worldand sayingthe spiritual world is it only another material world which happens to be invisible now but which may become visible hereafter or is it not rather the moral worldthe world of right and wrong  heaven  is not the true and real heaven the kingdom of love justice purity beneficence  is not that the eternal heaven wherein god abides for ever and with him those who are like god  and hell  is it not rather the anarchy of hate injustice impurity uselessness wherein abides all that is opposed to god  and with those thoughts come others about moral retributionwhat is its purpose  can itcan any punishment have any right purpose save the correction or the annihilation of the criminal  can god in this respect be at once less merciful and less powerful than man  is he so controlled by necessity that he is forced to bring into the world beings whom he knows to be incorrigible and doomed to endless misery  and if not so controlled is not the alternative as to his character even more fearful  he bids us copy his justice his love  is that his justice that his love which if we copied we should call each other and deservedly utterly unjust and unloving  can there be one morality for god and another for man made in the image of god  are these dark dogmas worthy of a father who hateth nothing that he hath made and is perfect in thisthat he makes his sun shine on the evil and on the good and his rain fall on the just and on the unjust and is good to the unthankful and to the evil  are they worthy of a son who in the fire of his divine charity stooped from heaven to earth to toil to suffer to die on the cross that the world by him might be saved  are they worthy of that spirit which proceeds from the father and the son even that spirit of boundless charity and fervent love by which the son offered himself to the father a sacrifice for the sins of the whole worldand surely not in vain  so men are askingrightly or wrongly and they are guarding themselves at the same time from the imputation of disbelief in moral retribution of fancying god to be a careless epicurean deity cruelly indulgent to sin and therefore in so far immoral  they saywe believe firmly enough in moral retribution  how can we help believing in it while we see it working around us in many a fearful shape here now in this life  and we believe that it may work on in still more fearful shapes in the life to come  we believe that as long as a sinner is impenitent he must be miserable that if he goes on impenitent for ever he must go on making himself miserableay it may be more and more miserable for ever  only do not tell us that he must go on  that his impenitence and therefore his punishment is irremediable necessary endless and thereby destroy the whole purpose and we should say the whole morality of his punishment  if that punishment be corrective our moral sense is not shocked by any severity by any duration but if it is irremediable it cannot be corrective and then what it is or why it is we cannotor rather dare notsay  we too believe in an eternal fire  but because we believe also the athanasian creed which tells us that there is but one eternal we believe that that fire must be the fire of god and therefore like all that is in god and of god good and not evil a blessing and not a curse we believe that that fire is for ever burning though men are for ever trying to quench it all day long and that it has been and will be in every age burning up all the chaff and stubble of mans inventions the folly the falsehood the ignorance the vice of this sinful world and we praise god for it and give thanks to him for his great glory that he is the everlasting and triumphant foe of evil and misery of whom it is written that our god is a consuming fire  such words are being spoken right or wrong  such words will bear their fruit for good or evil  i do not pronounce how much of them is true or false  it is not my place to dogmatize and define where the church of england as by law established has declined to do so  neither is it for you to settle these questions  it is rather a matter for your children  a generation more it may be of earnest thought will be required ere the true answer has been found  but it is your duty if you be educated and thoughtful persons to face these questions to consider seriously what these men would have you considerwhether you are believing the exact words of the bible and the conclusions of your own reason and moral sense or whether you are merely believing that cosmogony elaborated in the cloister that theory of moral retribution pardonable in the middle age which dante and milton sang  but this i do not hesitate to saythat if we of the clergy can find no other answers to these doubts than those which were reasonable and popular in an age when men racked women burned heretics and believed that every mussulman killed in a crusade went straight to tartarusthen very serious times are at hand both for the christian clergy and for christianity itself  what then are we to believe and do  shall we degenerate into a lazy scepticism which believes that everything is a little true and everything a little falsein plain words believes nothing at all  or shall we degenerate into faithless fears and unmanly wailings that the flood of infidelity is irresistible and that christ has left his church  we shall do neither if we believe the text  that tells us of a firm standingground amid the wreck of fashions and opinions  of a kingdom which cannot be moved though the heavens pass away like a scroll and the earth be burnt up with fervent heat  and it tells us that the king of that kingdom is he who is called jesus christthe same yesterday today and for ever  an eternal and changeless kingdom and an eternal and changeless king these the epistle to the hebrews preaches to all generations  it does not say that we have an unchangeable cosmogony an unchangeable eschatology an unchangeable theory of moral retribution an unchangeable dogmatic system not to these does it point the jews while their own nation and worship were in their very deathagony and the world was rocking and reeling round them decay and birth going on side by side in a chaos such as man had never seen before  not to these does the epistle point the hebrews but to the changeless kingdom and to the changeless king  my friends do you really believe in that kingdom and in that king  do you believe that you are now actually in a kingdom of heaven which cannot be moved and that the living acting guiding practical real king thereof is christ who died on the cross  these are days in which a preacher is bound to ask his congregationand still more to ask himselfwhether he really believes in that kingdom and in that king and to bid himself and them if they have not believed earnestly enough therein to repent in this time of lent of that at least to repent of having neglected that most cardinal doctrine of scripture and of the christian faith  but if we really believe in that changeless kingdom and in that changeless king shall we notconsidering who christ is the coequal and coeternal son of godbelieve also that if the heavens and the earth are being shaken then christ himself may be shaking them  that if opinions be changing then christ himself may be changing them  that if new truths are being discovered christ himself may be revealing them that if some of those truths seem to contradict those which he has revealed already they do not really contradict them  that as in the sixteenth century christ is burning up the wood and stubble with which men have built on his foundation that the pure gold of his truth may alone be left  it is at least possible it is probable if we believe that christ is a living acting king to whom all power is given in heaven and earth and who is actually exercising that power and educating christendom and through christendom the whole human race to a knowledge of himself and through himself of god their father in heaven  should we not saywe know that christ has been so doing for centuries and for ages  through abraham through moses through the prophets through the greeks through the romans and at last through himself he gave men juster and wider views of themselves of the universe and of god  and even then he did not stop  how could he who said of himself my father worketh hitherto and i work  how could he if he be the same yesterday today and for ever  through the apostles and specially through st paul he enlarged while he confirmed his own teaching  and did he not do the same in the sixteenth century  did he not then sweep from the minds and hearts of half christendom beliefs which had been held sacred and indubitable for a thousand years  why should he not be doing so now  if it be answered that the reformation of the sixteenth century was only a return to simpler and purer apostolic truthwhy again should it not be so now  why should he not be perfecting his work one step more and sweeping away more of mans inventions which are not integral and necessary elements of the one catholic faith but have been left behind in pardonable human weakness by our great reformers  great they were and good giants on the earth while we are but as dwarfs beside them  but as the hackneyed proverb says the dwarf on the giants shoulders may see further than the giant himself and so may we  oh that men would approach new truth in something of that spirit in the spirit of reverence and godly fear which springs from a living belief in christ the living king which isas the text tells usthe spirit in which we can serve god acceptably  oh that they would serve god waiting reverently and anxiously as servants standing in the presence of their lord for the slightest sign or hint of his will  then they would have grace by which they would receive new thought with grace gracefully courteously fairly charitably reverently believing that however strange or startling it may come from him whose ways are not as our ways nor his thoughts as our thoughts and that he who fights against it may haply be fighting against god  true they would receive all new thought with caution that conservative spirit which is the duty of every christian which is the peculiar strength of the englishman because it enables him calmly and slowly to take in the new without losing the old which his forefathers have already won for him  so they would be cautious even anxious lest in grasping too greedily at seeming improvements they let go some precious knowledge which they had already attained but they would be on the look out for improvements because they would consider themselves and their generation as under a divine education  they would prove all things fairly and boldly and hold fast that which is good all that which is beautiful noble improving and elevating to human souls minds or bodies all that increases the amount of justice mercy knowledge refinement all that lessens the amount of vice cruelty ignorance barbarism  that at least must come from christ  that at least must be the inspiration of the spirit of god unless the pharisees were right after all when they said that evil spirits could be cast out by the prince of the devils  be these things as they may one comfort it will give us to believe firmly and actively in the changeless kingdom and in the changeless king  it will give us calm patience faith and hope though the heavens and the earth be shaken around us  for then we shall see that the kingdom of which we are citizens is a kingdom of light and not of darkness of truth and not of falsehood of freedom and not of slavery of bounty and mercy and not of wrath and fear that we live and move and have our being not in a deus quidam deceptor who grudges his children wisdom but in a father of light from whom comes every good and perfect gift who willeth that all men should be saved and come to the knowledge of the truth  in his kingdom we are and in the king whom he has set over it we can have the most perfect trust  for us that king stooped from heaven to earth for us he was born for us he toiled for us he suffered for us he died for us he rose for us he sits for ever at gods right hand  and can we not trust him  let him do what he will let him lead us whither he will  wheresoever he leads must be the way of truth and life  whatsoever he does must be in harmony with that infinite love which he displayed for us upon the cross  whatsoever he does must be in harmony with that eternal purpose by which he reveals to men god their father  therefore though the heaven and the earth be shaken around us we will trust in him  for we know that he is the same yesterday today and for ever and that his will and promise is to lead those who trust in him into all truth     sermon ix  the kingdom of god   luke xxi 2933     and jesus spake to them a parable behold the fig tree and all the    trees when they now shoot forth ye see and know of your own selves    that summer is now nigh at hand  so likewise ye when ye see these    things come to pass know ye that the kingdom of god is nigh at hand    verily i say unto you this generation shall not pass away till all    be fulfilled  heaven and earth shall pass away but my words shall    not pass away  the question which naturally suggests itself when we hear these words iswhen were these things to take place  if we heard one whom we regarded as at least a person of perfect virtue truthfulness and earnestness foretell that the city in which we now stand should be destroyed  if he told us that when we saw it encompassed with armies we were to know that its desolation was at hand if he told us that then those who were in the surrounding country were to flee to the mountains and those in the city to come out of it  if he pronounced woe in that day on mothers and weak women who could not escape  if he told us nevertheless that when these things came to pass we were to rejoice and lift up our heads for our redemption was drawing nigh  if he told us to look at the trees in spring for as surely as their budding was a sign that summer was nigh so was the coming to pass of these terrible woes a sign that something was nigh which he called the kingdom of god  if he told us with a solemn asseveration that this generation should not pass away till all had happened  if he went on to warn us against profligacy frivolity worldliness lest that day should come upon us unaware  if he bade us keep awake always that we might be found worthy to escape all that was coming and to stand before him the son of man  if he used throughout his address the second person speaking to us but never mentioning our descendants giving the signs the warnings the counsels to us only should we not even if he had not solemnly told us that the present generation should not pass away till all was fulfilledshould we not i say suppose naturally that he spoke of events which in his opinion our own eyes would see which would in his opinion occur during our lifetime  whether he were right in his expectation or wrong still it would be clear that such was his expectation that he considered the danger as imminent the warning as addressed personally to us who heard him speak  we should leave his presence with that impression in fear and anxiety but if we afterwards discovered that our fear and anxiety were superfluous that the events of which he spokethe most awful and wonderful of them at leastwere not to occur for many centuries to come that even if some calamity were imminent the immediate future and the very distant future were so intermingled in his discourse that it would require the labours of commentator after commentator for many hundred years to disentangle them and that their labours would be in vain that the coming of the son of man and of the kingdom of god of which he had spoken were to be referred to a time thousands of years hence though we were told in the same breath to look to the figtree and all the trees as a sign that it was coming immediately and that our own generation would not pass away before all had taken placewould not such a discovery raise in us thoughts and feelings neither wholesome for us nor honourable to the prophet  i cannot think otherwise  we may be aware of the difficulties which beset this and any other interpretation of our lords prophecies in matthew mark and luke we may have the deepest respect for those learned and pious divines who from time to time have tried to part the prophecies relating to the fall of jerusalem from those relating to the end of the world and the day of judgment  yet in the face of such a passage as the text especially when we cannot agree with those who would make this generation mean this race or nation we maywe have a right todecline to separate the two sets of passages  we have a right to sayhe who spake as man never spake and therefore knew the force of words he who knew what was in manand therefore what effect his words would produce on his hearersdid deliver a discourseindeed many discourseswhich asserted as far as plain words could be understood by plain men that the kingdom of god was at hand and that the coming of the son of man would take place before that generation passed away  and that all his disciples and st paul as much as any put that meaning upon his words is a matter of fact and of history to be seen plainly in holy scripture  but while the text compels us to believe that the destruction of jerusalem by the romans was a coming of the son of mana manifestation of the kingdom of goda day of judgment in the strictest and most awful sense yet we are not compelled to limit the meaning of the text to the destruction of jerusalem  no prophecy of scripture is of private interpretation  prophets apostleshow much more our lord himselfdo not merely indulge in presages they lay down lawslaws moral spiritual eternalwhich have been fulfilling themselves from the beginning which are fulfilling themselves now which will go on fulfilling themselves to the end of time  so said our lord jesus of his own prophecies concerning the destruction of jerusalem  it was but one examplea most awful oneof the laws of his kingdom  not in judaea only but wherever the carcase was there would the eagles be gathered together  in the moral as in the physical word there were beasts of preythe scavengers of godready to devour out of his kingdom nations institutions opinions which had become dead and decayed and ready to infect the air  many a time since the roman eagles flocked to jerusalem has that prophecy been fulfilled and many a time will it be fulfilled once more and yet once more  and what else if we look at them carefully and reverently is the meaning of the words in this my text heaven and earth shall pass away but my words shall not pass away  shall we translate thisheaven and earth shall not come true but my words shall come true  by so doing we may put some little meaning into the latter half of the verse but none into the former  surely there is a deeper meaning in the words than that of merely coming true  surely they mean that his words are eternal perpetual for ever present possible imminent for ever coming true  so indeed they would not pass away  so they would be like the heavens and the earth and the laws thereof like heat gravitation electricity what notalways here always working always asserting themselveswith this difference that when the physical laws of the heavens and the earth which began in time in time have perished the spiritual laws of gods kingdom of christs moral government of moral beings shall endure for ever and for ever eternal as that god whose essence they reflect  therefore i mean nothing less than that the great and final day of judgment is past or that we are not to look for that second coming of our lord jesus christ which as our forefathers taught us to hope shall set right all the wrong of this diseased world  god forbid  for most miserable were the world most miserable were mankind if all that our lord prophesied had happened once and for all at the destruction of jerusalem by the roman armies  but most miserable also would this world be and most miserable would be mankind if these words were not to be fulfilled till some future last day and day of judgment for which the church has now been waiting for more than eighteen centuriesand as far as we can judge may wait for as many centuries more  most miserable if the son of man has never come since he ascended into heaven from olivet  most miserable if the kingdom of god has never been at hand since he gave that one short gleam of hope to men in judaea long ago  most miserable if there be no kingdom of god among us even now in one word if god and christ be not our king but the devil as some fancy or man himself as others fancy be the only king of this world and of its destinies if there be no order in this mad world save what man invents no justice save what he executes no law save what he finds convenient to lay upon himself for the protection of his person and property  most miserable if the human race have no guide save its own instincts and tendencies no history save that of its own greed ignorance and crime varied only by fruitless struggles after a happiness to which it never attains  most miserable world and miserable man if that be true after all which to the old hebrew prophet seemed incredible and horribleif god does look on while men deal treacherously and does hold his peace when the wicked devours the man who is more righteous than he and has made men as the fishes of the sea as the creeping things that have no ruler over them  i saidmost miserable in that case was the world and man  i did not say that they would consider themselves miserable  i did not say that they would think it a gospel and good news that christ was their king and that his kingdom was always at hand  they never thought that good news  when the prophets told them of it they stoned them  when the lord himself told them they crucified him  worldly men dislike the message now probably as much as they ever did  but they escape from it either by treating it as a selfevident commonplace which no christian denies and therefore no christian need think of or by smiling at it as an exploded superstition at least as a semitic form of thought with which we have nothing to do  they confound it often i fear purposely with those fancied miraculous interpositions those paltry special providences which fanatics in all ages have believed to be worked for their own special behoof  altogether they dislike and express very openly their dislike of the least allusion to a divine providence interfering as they strangely term it with them and their affairs  and they are wise doubtless in their generation  the news that christ is the king of men and of the world must be unpleasant even offensive to too many both of those who fancy that they are managing this world and of those who fancy that they could manage the world still better if they only had their rights  it must be unpleasant to be told that they are not managing the world and cannot manage it that it is being managed and ruled by an unseen king whose ways are far above their ways and his thoughts above their thoughts  for then prudence might demand of them that they should find out what are that kings ways thoughts and laws and obey theman enquiry so troublesome that many very highly educated persons consider it nowa days quite impossible and tell us that for practical purposes gods laws can neither be discovered nor obeyed  moreover their scheme of this world is one which would workso they fancyjust as well if there was no god  unpleasant therefore it must be for them to hear not merely that there is a god but that he has his own scheme of the world and that it is working whether they like or not that god and not they is making history god and not they appointing the bounds and the times of nations god and not they or any man or men distributing good and evil among mankind  they do not object of course to the existence of a god  they only object to his being what the hebrew prophets called hima living god a god who executes justice and judgment by his son jesus christ to whom he has committed all power both in heaven and earth  they are ready sometimes to allow even that provided they may relegate it into the past or into the future  they are ready to allow that god and christ exerted power over men at the first advent 1800 years ago and that they will exert power over men at the second adventnone knows how long hence  but that god and christ are exerting power nowin an everpresent and perpetual adventin this nineteenth century just as much as in any century before or sincethat they had rather not believe their creed is that though heaven and earth have not passed away though the laws of nature are working for ever as at the beginning yet christs words have passed away and fallen into abeyance for many centuries past to remain in abeyance for many centuries to come  in one wordwhile they believe more or less in a past god and a future god yet as to the existence of a present god in any practical and real sensethey believehow little i dare not say  whether this generation will awaken out of that sleep of practical atheism which is creeping on them more and more who can tell  that they are uneasy in the sleep there are many signs  for in their sleep dreams come of another world of which their five senses tell them nought  then do some fly to mediaeval superstitions which give them at least elaborate and agreeable substitutes for a living god  some fly to impostors who pretend by juggling tricks to put them in communication with that unseen world which they have so long denied  some again play with unfulfilled prophecy and fancy that it is for them though it was not for the apostles to know the times and seasons which the father has put in his own power and the day and hour of which no man knoweth no not the angels in heaven nor the son but the father only  better that than that they should believe that there is nothing and never will be anything in the world beyond what their five senses can apprehend  but whether they awake or not out of their sleep their blindness does not alter the eternal fact whether men believe it or not  that is true what the psalmist said of old the lord is king be the people never so impatient  he sitteth upon his throne though the earth be never so unquiet  the utterances of the old psalmists and prophets concerning the everpresent kingdom of god are facts not dreams  whether men believe it or not it is true that the power glory and righteousness of his kingdom may be known unto men that his kingdom is an everlasting kingdom and his dominion endureth throughout all ages that the lord upholds all such as fall and lifts up those that are down that the eyes of all wait on him that he may give them their meat in due season that he opens his hand and filleth all things living with plenteousness that the lord is righteous in all his ways and holy in all his works that he is nigh to them that call upon him yea to all who call upon him faithfully  he that planted the ear shall he not hear  he that made the eye shall he not see  he that chastiseth the nations it is he that teacheth man knowledge shall he not punish  whether men believe it or not that is true which the psalmist saidwhither shall i flee from his spirit or whither shall i go from his presence  if i climb up to heaven he is there if i go down to hell he is there also  if i take the wings of the morning and dwell in the uttermost part of the sea even there shall his hand lead me his right hand hold me still  whether men believe it or not that is true which christ spake on earththat the father hath committed all judgment to him because he is the son of man that to him is given all power in heaven and earth and that he is with us even to the end of the world  whether men believe it or not that is true which s paul spake on mars hill saying that the lord is not far from any one of us for in him we live and move and have our being and that he hath appointed a day in which he will judge the world in righteousness by that man whom he hath ordained and raised from the dead  whether men believe it or not that is true which christ spakeheaven and earth shall pass away but my words shall not pass away at least till he has put down all rule and all authority and power and delivered up the kingdom to god even the father that god may be all in all  that one faroff divine event toward which the whole creation moves will be not the resumption but the triumph of christs rule of a rule which began before the world which has endured through all the ages which endures now punishing or rewarding each and every one of us and of our childrens children as long as there shall be a man upon the earth  for by christs will alone the world of man consists in christs laws alone is true life health wealth possible for any man family or nation out of his kingdom he casts sooner or later all things which offend and whosoever loveth and maketh a lie  he said of himselfwhosoever falleth on this rock shall be broken but on whomsoever it shall fall it shall grind him to powder     sermon x  the law of the lord   psalm i 12     blessed is the man who hath not walked in the counsel of the ungodly    nor stood in the path of sinners nor sat in the seat of the scornful    but his delight is in the law of the lord and in his law will he    exercise himself day and night  the first and second psalms taken together are the key to all the psalms i may almost say to the whole bible  i will say a few words on them this morning especially to those who are coming to the holy communion to shew their allegiance to that lord in whose law alone is life and who sits on the throne of the universe king of kings and lord of lords but i say it to the whole congregation likewise nay if there were an infidel or a heathen in the church i should say it to them  for in this case what is true of one man is true of every man whether he knows it or not  we all should like to be blessed  we all should like to be as the psalm says like trees planted by the waterside whose leaves never wither and who bring forth their fruit in due season  we should all wish to have it said of uswhatsoever he doeth it shall prosper  then here is the way to inherit that blessingblessed is the man whose delight is in the law of the lord and who exercises himself in his law day and night the psalmist is not speaking of moses law nor of any other law of forms and ceremonies  he says expressly the law of the lordthat is the law according to which the lord has made him and all the world and according to which the lord rules him and all the world  the psalmsyou must remembersay very little about moses law and when they do speak of it almost slightingly as if to draw mens minds away from it to a deeper nobler more eternal law  in one psalm god asks thinkest thou that i will eat bulls flesh and drink the blood of goats  and in another psalm some one answers sacrifice and burntoffering thou wouldest not  then said i lo i come to do thy will o god  thy law is within my heart  this is that true and eternal law of which solomon speaks in his proverbs as the wisdom by which god made the heavens and laid the foundation of the earth and tells us that that wisdom is a tree of life to all who can lay hold of her that in her right hand is length of days and in her left hand riches and honour that her ways are ways of pleasantness and all her paths are peace  this is that law of which the prophet saysthat god will put it into mens hearts and write it in their minds and they shall be his people and he will be their god  this is that law which the inspired philosopherfor a philosopher he was indeedwho wrote the 119th psalm continually prayed and strove to learn intreating the lord to teach him his law and make him remember his everlasting judgments  this is that law which our lord jesus christ perfectly fulfilled because the law was his fathers law and therefore his own law and therefore he perfectly comprehended the law and perfectly loved the law and said with his whole hearti delight to do thy will o god  the will of god  for in one word this law which we have to learn and by keeping which we shall be blessed is nothing else than gods will gods will about us  what god has willed and chosen we should be  what god has willed and chosen we should do  the greatest philosopher of the 18th century said that every rational being had to answer four questionswhere am i  what can i know  what must i do  whither am i going  and he knew well thatas the bible tells us throughoutthe only way to get any answer to those four tremendous questions isto delight in the law of the lord to struggle think pray till we get some understanding of gods will of gods will about ourselves and about the world and so be blessed indeed  but to do that it is plain that we must heed the warning which the first verse of the psalm gives usblessed is the man that hath not walked in the counsel of the ungodly  for it is plain that a man will never learn gods will if he takes counsel from ungodly men who care nothing for gods will and do not believe that gods will governs the world  neither must he as the psalm says stand in the way of sinnersof profligate and dishonest men who break gods law  for if he follows their ways and breaks gods law himself it is plain that he will learn little or nothing about gods law save in the way of bitter punishment  for let him but break gods law a little too long and thenas the 2nd psalm saysgod will rule him with a rod of iron and break him in pieces like a potters vessel  but there is even more hope for himfor he may repent and amendthan if he sits in the seat of the scorners  the scorners the sneering the frivolous the unearnest the unbelieving the envious who laugh down what they call enthusiasm and romance who delight in finding fault and in blackening those who seem purer or nobler than themselves  these are the men who cannot by any possibility learn anything of the law of god for they will not even look for it they have cast away the likeness of rational men and have taken upon themselves the likeness of the sneering accusing satan who asks in the book of jobdoth job serve god for nought  when the greatest poet of our days tried to picture his idea of a fiend tempting a man to his ruin he gave his fiend just such a character as this a very clever courteous agreeable man of the world and yet a being who could not love any one could not believe in any one who mocked not only at man but at god and tempted and ruined man not out of hatred to him hardly out of envy but in mere sport as a cruel child may torment an insectin one word a scorner  and so true was his conception felt to be that men of that character are now often called by the very name which he gave to his satanmephistopheles  beware therefore of the scornful spirit as well as of the openly sinful or of the ungodly  if you wish to learn the law of the lord keep your souls pious pure reverent and earnest for it is only the pure in heart who shall see god and only those who do gods will as far as they know it who will know concerning any doctrine whether it be true or false in one word whether it be of god  and now bear in mind secondly that this law is the law of the lord  you cannot have a law without a lawgiver who makes the law and also without a judge who enforces the law and the lawgiver and the judge of the law of the lord is the lord himself our lord jesus christ  remembering him and that he is king we can understand the fervour of indignation and pity with which the writer of the 2nd psalm bursts outwhy do the heathen rage and why do the people imagine a vain thing  the kings of the earth stand up and the rulers take counsel together against the lord and against his anointed  let us break their bonds asunder and cast away their cords from us  for the great majority of mankind in every age and country will not believe that there is a law of the lord to which they must conform themselves  kings and governments and peoples are too often all alike in that  they must needs have their own way  their will is to be law their voice is to be the voice of god  they are they who ought to speak who is lord over them  and because the lord is patient and longsuffering and does not punish their presumption on the spot by lightning or earthquake they fancy that he takes no notice of them and of their crimes and follies and saytush shall god perceive it  is there knowledge in the most high  but sooner or later either by sudden and terrible catastrophes or by slow decay brought on sometimes by their own blind presumption sometimes by their own luxury they find out their mistake when it is too late  and then  he that dwelleth in heaven shall laugh them to scorn  the lord shall have them in derision  for he has set his king upon the throne of all the universe  yes christ the lord rules and knows that he rules whether we know it or not  christs law still hangs over our head ready to lead us to light and life and peace and wealth or ready to fall on us and grind us to powder whether we choose to look up and see it or not  the lord liveth though we may be too dead to feel him  the lord sees us though we may be too blind to see him  man can abolish many things and does bothwisely and unwiselyin these restless days of change  but let him try as long as he willfor he has often tried and will try againhe cannot abolish christ the lord  for christ is set upon the throne of the universe  the father of allif we may dare to hint even in scriptural words at mysteries which are in themselves unspeakableis eternally saying to himthou art my son this day have i begotten thee  and christ answers eternallyi come to do thy will o god  the nations are christs inheritance and the utmost parts of the earth are his possession now already whether we or they think so or not  and there are timesthere are times my friendswhen the awful words which follow come true likewisethou shalt bruise them with a rod of iron and break them in pieces like a potters vessel  for as to this world in which we live so to the god who created that world there is a terrible aspect  there is calm but there is storm also  there is fertilizing sunshine but there is also the destroying thunderbolt  there is the solid and fruitful earth where man can till and build but there is the earthquake and the flood likewise which destroy in a moment the works of man  so there is in god boundless love and boundless mercy but there is too a wrath of god and a fire of god which burns eternally against all evil and falsehood  and woe to those who fall under that wrath who are even scorched for a moment by that fire  it is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living god  we are all ready enough to forget this ready enough to think only of gods goodness and never of his severity  ready enough to talk of christ as gentle and suffering because we flatter ourselves that if he is gentle he may be also indulgent if he be suffering he may be also weak  we like to forget that he is and was and ever will belord of heaven and earth and to think of him only in his humiliation in judaea 1800 years ago forgetting that during that very humiliation while he was shewing love and mercy and miracles of healing and sympathy and compassion for every form of human sorrow and weakness he did not shrink from shewing to men the awful side of his character did not shrink from saying woe unto you scribes and pharisees hypocrites  ye serpents ye generation of vipers how can ye escape the damnation of helldid not shrink from declaring that he was coming again even before that very generation had passed away to destroy unless it repented the wicked city of jerusalem with an utter and horrible destruction  think of these things my friends for true they are and true they will remain whether you think of them or not  and take the warning of the second psalm which is needed now as much as it was ever neededbe wise now therefore o ye kings be learned ye that are judges of the earth serve the lord with fear and rejoice unto him with reverence  worship the son lest he be angry and so ye perish from the right way  if his wrath be kindled yea but a little blessed are all they that put their trust in him  but you are no kings you are no judges  is it so  and yet you boast yourselves to be free men in a free country  not so  every man who is a free man is a king or a judge whether he knows it or not  every one who has a duty is a king over his duty  every one who has a work to do is a judge whether he does his work well or not  he who farms is a king and a judge over his land  he who keeps a shop a king and a judge over his business  he who has a family a king and a judge over his household  let each be wise and serve the lord in fear knowing that according as he obeys the law of the lord he will receive for the deeds done in the body whether good or evil  not kings not judges  is not each and every human being who is not a madman a king over his own actions a judge over his own heart and conscience  let him govern himself govern his own thoughts and words his own life and actions according to the law of the lord who created him and he will be able to say with the poet     my mind to me a kingdom is    such perfect joy therein i find    as far exceeds all earthly bliss  but if he governs himself according to his own fancy which is no law but lawlessness then he will find himself rebelling against himself weakened by passions torn by vain desires and miserable by reason of the lusts which war in his members and so will taste here in this life of that anger of the lord of which it is written if his wrath be kindled yea but a little ye shall perish from the right way  therefore let each and all of us high and low take the warning of the last verse and worship the son of god  bow low before himfor that is the true meaning of the wordsas subjects before an absolute monarch who can dispose of us body and soul according to his will but who can be trusted to dispose of us well because his will is a good will and the only reason why he is angry when we break his laws is that his laws are the eternal laws of god wherein alone is life for all rational beings and to break them is to injure our fellowcreatures and to ruin ourselves and perish from that right way to bring us back to which he condescended of his boundless love to die on the cross for all mankind     sermon xi  god the teacher   psalm cxix 33 34     teach me o lord the way of thy statutes and i shall keep it unto    the end  give me understanding and i shall keep thy law yea i    shall observe it with my whole heart  this 119th psalm has been valued for many centuries by the wisest and most devout christians as one of the most instructive in the bible as the experimental psalm  and it is that and more  it is specially a psalm about education  that is on the face of the text  teach me o lord thy statutes and i shall keep them to the end  these are the words of a man who wishes to be taught and therefore to learn and to learn not mere booklearning and instruction but to acquire a practical education which he can keep to the end and carry out in his whole life  but it is more  it is to my mind as much a theological psalm as it is an experimental psalm and it is just as valuable for what it tells us concerning the changeless and serene essence of god as for what it tells us concerning the changing and struggling soul of man  let us think a little this morningand please god hereafter alsoof the psalm and what it says  for it is just as true now as ever it was and just as precious to those who long to educate themselves with the true education which makes a man perfect even as his father in heaven is perfect  the psalm is a prayer or collection of short prayers written by some one who had two thoughts in his mind and who was so full of those two thoughts that he repeated them over and over again in many different forms like one who having an air of music in his head repeats it in different keys with variation after variation yet keeps true always to the original air and returns to it always at the last  now what two thoughts were in the psalmists mind  first that there was something in the world which he must learn and would learn for everything in this life and the next depended on his learning it  and this thing which he wants to learn he calls gods statutes gods law gods testimonies gods commandments gods everlasting judgments  that is what he feels he must learn or else come to utter grief both body and soul  secondly that if he is to learn them god himself must teach them to him  i beg you not to overlook this side of the psalm  that is what makes it not only a psalm but a prayer also  the man wants to know something  but beside that he prays god to teach it to him  he was not like too many nowadays who look on prayer and on inspiration as oldfashioned superstitions who believe that a man can find out all he needs to know by his own unassisted intellect and then do it by his own unassisted will  where they get their proofs of that theory i know not certainly not from the history of mankind and certainly not from their own experience unless it be very different from mine  be that as it may this old psalmist would not have agreed with them for he held an utterly opposite belief  he held that a man could see nothing unless god shewed it to him  he held that a man could learn nothing unless god taught him and taught him moreover in two ways first taught him what he ought to do and then taught him how to do it  surely this man was at least a reasonable and prudent man and shewed his commonsense  i saycommonsense  for suppose that you were set adrift in a ship at sea to shift for yourself would it not be mere commonsense to try and learn how to manage that ship that you might keep her afloat and get her safe to land  you would try to learn the statutes laws and commandments and testimonies and judgments concerning the ship lest by your own ignorance you should sink her and be drowned  you would try to learn the laws about the ship namely the laws of floatation by fulfilling which vessels swim and by breaking which vessels sink  you would try to learn the commandments about her  they would be any books which you could find of rules of navigation and instruction in seamanship  you would try to learn the testimonies about the ship  and what would they be  the witness of course which the ship bore to herself  the experience which you or others got from seeing how she behavedas they sayat sea  and from whom would you try to learn all this from yourself  out of your own brain and fancy  would you invent theories of navigation and shipbuilding for yourself without practice or experience  i trust not you would go to the shipbuilder and the shipmaster for your information just asif you be a reasonable manyou will go for your information about this world to the builder and maker of the worldgod himself  and lastly you would try to learn the judgments about the ship and what would they be  the results of good or bad seamanship what happens to ships when they are wellmanaged or illmanaged  it would be too hard to have to learn that by experience for the price which you would have to pay would be probably that you would be wrecked and drowned  but if you saw other ships wrecked near you you would form judgments from their fate of what you ought to do  if you could find accounts of shipwrecks you would study them with the most intense interest lest you too should be wrecked and so judgment overtake you for your bad seamanship  for gods judgment of any matter is not as superstitious people fancy that god grows suddenly angry and goes out of his way to punish those who do wrong as by a miracle  god judges all things in heaven and earth without angeray with boundless pity but with no indulgence  the soul that sinneth it shall die  the ship that cannot swim it must sink that is the law of the judgments of god  but he is merciful in this that he rewardeth every man according to his work  his judgment may be favourable as well as unfavourable  he may acquit or he may condemn but whether he acquits or condemns we can only know by the event by the result  if a ship sinks for want of good sailing or other defect that is a judgment of god about the ship  he has condemned her  she is not seaworthy  but if the ship arrives safe in port that too is gods judgment  he has tried her and acquitted her  she is seaworthy and she has her reward  how simple this is  and yet men will not believe it will not understand it and therefore they wreck so often each man his own shiphis own life and immortal soul and sink and perish for lack of knowledge  for each one of us is at sea each in his own ship and each must sail her and steer her as best he can or sink and drown for ever  for the sea which each of us is sailing over is this world and the ship in which each of us sails is our own nature and character what st paul like a truly scientific man calls our flesh and what modern scientific men and rightly call our organisation  and the land to which we are sailing is eternal life  shall we make a prosperous voyage  shall we fail or shall we succeed  shall we founder and drown at sea and sink to eternal death  or shall we as the clergyman prayed for us when we were baptized so pass through the waves of this troublesome world that finally we may come to the land of everlasting life  which shall it be my friends  shall we sink or shall we swim  certain is one thingthat we shall sink and not swim if we do not learn and keep the law and commandments and testimonies and judgments of god concerning this our mortal life  if we do not then we shall go through life without knowing how to go through life ignorantly and blindly and the end of that will be failure and ruin and death to our souls  if we do not know and keep the laws of god the laws of god will keep themselves in spite of us and grind us to powder  do not fancy that you may do wrong without being punished and break gods law because you are not under the law but under grace  you are only under grace as long as you keep clear of gods law  the moment you do wrong you put yourself under the law and the law will punish you  suppose that you went into a mill and that the owner of that mill was your best friend even your father  would that prevent your being crushed by the machinery if you got entangled in it through ignorance or heedlessness  i think not  even so though god be your best of friends ay your father in heaven that will not prevent your being injured it may be ruined not only by wilful sins but by mere folly and ignorance  therefore your only chance for safety in this life and for ever is to learn gods laws and statutes about your life that you may pass through it justly honourably virtuously successfully  and the man who wrote the 119th psalm knew that and said oh that my ways were made so direct that i might keep thy statutes  but moreover you must learn gods commandments  he has laid down certain commands certain positive rules which must be kept if you do not intend to die the eternal death  so says our lord  if thou wilt enter into life keep the commandments  thou shalt love the lord thy god with all thy heart and soul and thy neighbour as thyself  there the ten commandments are and kept they must be and if you break one of them it will punish you and you cannot escape  and the man who wrote the 119th psalm knew that and said with my whole heart have i sought thee oh let me not go wrong out of thy commandments  moreover you must learn gods testimonies what he has witnessed and declared about himself and his own character his power and his goodness his severity and his love  and where will you learn that as in the bible  the bible is full of testimonies of god in christ about himself who he is what he does what he requires and of testimonies of holy men of old concerning god and concerning duty concerning gods dealings with their souls and with other men and with all the nations of the old world and with all nations likewise to the end of time  and if people will not read and study their bibles they cannot expect to know the way to eternal life  that too the man who wrote the 119th psalm knew and said i have had as great delight in thy testimonies as in all manner of riches  moreover you must learn gods judgments the way in which he rewards and punishes men  and those too you will learn in the bible which is full of accounts of the just and merciful judgments of god  and you may learn them too from your own experience in life from seeing what actually happens to those whom you know when they do right things and what happens again when they do wrong things  if any man will open his eyes to what is going on around him in a single city or in the mere private circle of his own kinsfolk and acquaintance if he will but use his common sense and look how righteousness is rewarded and sin is punished all day long then he might learn enough and to spare about gods judgments but men will not  a man will see his neighbour do wrong and suffer for it and then go and do exactly the same thing himself as if there were no living god no judgments of god as if all was accident and chance as if he was to escape scotfree while his neighbour next door has brought shame and misery on himself by doing the same thing  for it was well written of old the fool hath said in his heartthough he is afraid to say it with his lipsthere is no god  and the man who wrote the 119th psalm knew that and said i remembered thine everlasting judgments o lord and received comfort for i was horribly afraid for the ungodly who forsake thy law  i say again that the only way to attain eternal life is to know and keep and profit by gods laws gods commandments gods testimonies gods judgments and therefore it is that the psalmists say so often that these laws and commandments are life  not merely the way to eternal life but the life itself as it is written in the prayerbook o god whom truly to know is everlasting life  but some will say how shall i learn  i am very stupid and i confess that freely  and when i have learnt how shall i act up to my lesson for i am very weak and that i confess freely likewise  how indeed my friends  stupid we are the cleverest of us and weak we are the strongest of us  and if god left us to find out for ourselves and to take care of ourselves we should not sail far on the voyage of life without being wrecked and going down body and soul to hell  but blessed be god he has not left us to ourselves  he has not only commanded us to learn he has promised to teach  andas i said in the beginning of my sermonhe who wrote the 119th psalm knew that well  he knew that god would teach him and strengthen him enlightening his dull understanding and quickening his dull will and therefore his psalm as i said is a prayer a prayer for teaching and a prayer for light and he cries to godmy soul cleaveth to the dust  i am lowminded stupid and earthly at the best  oh quicken thou me that isoh give me lifemore lifeaccording to thy word  thy word  the word of god of whom the psalmist sayso lord thy word endureth for ever in heaven  even the word of god jesus christ our lord the son of man who is in heaven and who because he is in heaven both god and man can and will give us light and life now and for ever  and now take home with you this one thought  there is one education which we must all get one thing which we must all learn and learn to obey or come to utter shame and ruin either in this world or the world to come and that is the laws and commandments and testimonies of godgod the father god the son and god the holy spirit for only by keeping them can we enter into eternal life  and if we wish to know them god himself will teach us them  and if we wish to keep them god himself will give us strength to keep them  amen     sermon xii  the reasonable prayer   psalm cxix 33 94     o lord teach me thy statutes and i shall keep them to the end  i am    thine o save me for i have kept thy commandments  some who heard me last sunday both morning and afternoon may have remarked an apparent contradiction between my two sermons  i hope they have done so  for then i shall hope that they are facing one of the most difficult and yet most necessary of all problems namely the difference between the law and the gospel  in my morning sermon i spoke of the eternal law of godhow it was unchangeable even as god its author rigid awful inevitable by every soul of man and certain if he kept it to lead him into all good for body soul and spirit but certain too if he broke it to grind him to powder  and in the afternoon i spoke of the gospel and free grace of godhow that too was unchangeable even as god its author full of compassion and tender mercy and forgiveness of sins willing not the death of a sinner but rather that he should be converted and live  but how are these two statements both scriptural bothas i hold from practical experience true to the uttermost and not to be compromised or explained awayhow are they to be reconciled i say  by these two texts  by taking them both together and never one without the other and by taking them also in the order in which you find them and neveras too many dothe second before the first  at least this was the opinion of the psalmist  he first seeks gods commandments and statutes and praysgive me understanding and i shall keep thy law yea i shall keep it with my whole heart  make me to go in the path of thy commandments for therein is my desire  and then only then finding himself in trouble anxiety even in danger of death he feels he has a sort of right to cry to god to help him out of his trouble and praysi am thine oh save me  and why  what reason can he give why god should save him  because he says i have sought thy commandments  now let all rational persons lay this to heart and consider it well there are very few heathens and savages as well as christians who will not cry when they find themselves in troubleoh save me  the instinct of every man is to cry to some unseen persons or powers to help him  if he does not cry to the true and good god he will cry to some false or bad god or to some idol material or intellectual of his own invention but that is no reason why his prayers should be heard  we read of old heathens at rome who prayed to mercury the god of moneymakingda mihi fallerehelp me to cheat my neighbours while the philosophers heathen though they were laughed with just contempt at such men and their prayers and askeddo you suppose that any god if he be worth calling a god will answer such a request as that  nay in our own times have not the brigands of naples been in the habit of carrying a leaden image of st januarius in their hats and praying to it to protect them in their trade of robbery and murder  i leave you to guess what answer good st januarius and much more he who made st januarius and all heaven and earth was likely to give to such a prayer as that  so it is not all prayers for help that are heard or deserve to be heard and indeedi do not wish to be hard but the truth must be spokenthere are too many people in the world who pray to god to help them when they are in difficulties or in danger or in fear of death and of hell but never pray at any other time or for any other thing  they pray to be helped out of what is disagreeable  but they never pray to be made good they are not good and they do not care to become good  all they care for is to escape death or pain or poverty or shame when they see it staring them in the face and god knows i do not blame them  we are all children and like children we cry out when we are hurt and that is no sin to us  but that is no part of godliness not even of mere religion  but worseit is still more sad to have to say it but it is truemost peoples notions of the next world and of salvation as they call it are just as childish material selfish as their notions of this world  they all wish and pray to be saved  what do they mean  to be saved from bodily pain in the next life and to have bodily pleasure instead pain and pleasure are the only gods which they really worship  they call the formerhell  they call the latterheaven  but they know as little of one as of the other and their notions of both are equally worthy ofshall i say it  must i say itequally worthy of the savage in the forest  they believe that they must either go to heaven or to hell  they have of course no wish to go to the latter place for whatever else there is likely to be theresome of which might not be quite unpleasant or new to them such as evilspeaking lying and slandering envy hatred malice and all uncharitableness bigotry includedthere will be certainly therethey have reason to believebodily pain the thing which they being mostly comfortable people dread most and avoid most contrary you will remember to the opinion of the blessed martyrs who dreaded bodily pain least and avoided it least of all the ills which could befal them  wherefore they are in the sight of god and of all true men unto this daythe blessed martyrs  but these peopleand there are too many of them by hundreds of thousandsdo not want to be blessed  they only want to be comfortable in this world and in the next  as for blessedness they do not even know what it means and our lords seven beatitudes which beginblessed are the poor in spiritare not at all to their mind even alas alas to the mind of many who call themselves religious and orthodox at least till they are so explained away that they shall mean anything or nothing savei trust i am poor in spirit and nevertheless i am right and everyone who differs from me is wrong  the plain truth iswhen all fine words whether said in prayers or sung in hymns are stript offthat they do not wish to go to hell and pain and therefore prefer very naturally though not very spiritually to go to heaven and pleasure and so sing of crossing over jordan to canaans shore or of jerusalem the golden with milk and honey blest and so forth without any clear notion of what they mean thereby save selfish comfort without end they really know not what they really care not where  and that they may arrive there or at a far better place and have their wish and more than their wish i for one heartily desire  but whether they arrive there or not and indeed whether they arrive at some place infinitely better or infinitely worse depends on whether they will give up selfish calculations of loss and gain selfish choosing between mere pain and pleasure and choose this choose whatever it may cost them between being good and being bad or even being only half good as little good as they can afford to be without the pains of hell into the bargain  my friendswhat if christ should answer such peoplei do not say that he does always answer them so for he is very pitiful and of tender mercybut what if he were to answer them save you  help you  o presumptuous mortal what have you done that christ should save or help you  you are afraid of being ruined  why should you not be ruined  what good will it be to your fellowmen if you keep your money instead of losing it  you are making nothing but a bad use of your money  why should christ help you to keep it and misuse it still more  you are afraid of death  you do not wish to die  but why should you not die  why should christ save you from death  of what use is your life to christ or to any human being  if you are living a bad life your life is a bad thing and does harm not only to yourself but to your neighbours  why should christ keep you alive to hurt and corrupt your neighbours and to set a bad example to your children  if you are not doing your duty where christ has put you you are of no use a cumberer of the ground  what reason can you shew why he should not take you away and put some one in your place who will do his duty  you are afraid of being lostwhy should you not be lost  you are offensive and an injury to the universe  you are an actual nuisance on christs earth and in christs kingdom  why should he notas he has sworncast out of his kingdom all things which offend and you among the rest  why should he not get rid of you as you get rid of vermin as you get rid of weeds and cast you into the fire to be burned up with all evil things  answer that before you ask christ to save you and deliver you from danger and from death and from the hell which you so muchand perhaps so justlyfear  and how that question is to be answered i cannot see  certainly the selfish man cannot answer it  the idle man cannot answer it  the profligate man cannot answer it  they are doing nothing for christ or for their neighbours or for the human race and they cannot expect christ to do anything for them  the only men who can answer it the only men it seems to me who can have any hope of their prayers being heard are those who like the psalmist are trying to do something for christ and their neighbours and the human race who are in a word trying to be good  those i mean who have already prayed earnestly and often the first prayer teach me o lord thy statutes and i shall keep them to the end  they havenot a right no one has a right against christ no not the angels and archangels in heavennot a right but a hope through christs most precious and undeserved promises that their prayers will be heard and that christ will save them from destruction because they are at least likely to become worth saving because they are likely to be of use in christs world and to do some little work in christs kingdom  they are gods they are soldiers in christs army  they are labourers in christs garden  they are on gods side in the battle of life which is the battle of christ and of all good men against evil against sin and ignorance and the numberless miseries which sin and ignorance produce  they are not the profligate they are not the selfish the idle they are not the frivolous the insolent they are not the wilfully ignorant who do not care to learn and do not evenso brutish are theythink that there is anything worth learning in the world save how to turn sixpence into a shilling and then spend it on themselves  not such are those who may hope to have their prayers heard because they are worth hearing and worth helping  but they are the people who say to themselves not once in their lives not once a week on sundays but every day and all day longi must be good i will be good  i must be of use i must be doing some work for god and therefore i must learn  i must learn gods laws and statutes and commandments about my station and calling and business in life  else how can i do it aright  i dare no more be ignorant than i dare be idle  i must learn  but how shall i learn  stupid i am and ignorant and the more i try to learn the more i discover how stupid i am  the more i do actually learn the more i discover how ignorant i am  there is so much to be learned and how to learn it passes my understanding  who will teach me  how shall i get understanding  how shall i get knowledge  and if i get them how shall i be sure that they are true understanding and true knowledge  mad people have understanding enough and so have some who are not mad but merely fools  wit enough they have active and rapid brains but their understanding is of no use for it is only misunderstanding and therefore the more clever they are the more foolish they are and the more dangerous to themselves and their fellowcreatures  knowledge toohow shall i be sure that my knowledge if i get it is true knowledge and not false knowledge knowledge which is not really according to facts  i see too many who have knowledge for which i care little enough  some know a thousand things which are of no use to them or to any human being  others know a thousand things but know them in a shallow inaccurate fashion and so cannot make use of them for any practical purpose  others know a thousand things but know them all in a prejudiced and onesided fashion till they see things not as things are but as they are not and as they never will be and therefore their knowledge instead of leading them misleads them and they misjudge facts misjudge men and earth and heaven just as much as the man who should misjudge the sunlight of heaven and fancy it to be green or blue because he looked at it through a green or blue glass  how then shall i get true knowledge  knowledge which will be really useful really worth knowing  knowledge which i shall know accurately and practically too so that i can use it in daily life for myself and my fellowmen knowledge too which shall be clear knowledge not warped or coloured by my own fancies passions prejudices but pure and calm and sound siccum lumen dry light as the greatest of english philosophers called it of old  to all such who long for light that by the light they may see to live the life god answers through his onlybegotten son the word who endureth for ever in heaven  ask and ye shall receive seek and ye shall find knock and it shall be opened to you  for if ye being evil know how to give good gifts to your children much more will your heavenly father give his holy spirit to those who ask him  yes ask for that holy spirit of god that he may lead you into all truth into all truth that is which is necessary for you to know in order to see your way through the world and through your duty in the world  ask for that holy spirit that he may give you eyes to see things as they are and courage to feel things as they are and to do your work in them and by them whether they be pleasant or unpleasant prosperous or adverse  ask him and he will give you true knowledge to know what a serious position you are in what a serious thing life is death is judgment is eternity is that you may be no trifler nor idler nor mere scraper together of gain which you must leave behind you when you die but a truly serious man seriously intent on your duty seriously intent on working gods work in the place and station to which he has called you before the night comes in which no man can work  if a man is doing that if he is earnestly trying to learn what is true in order that he may do what is right then he hasi do not say a rightbut at least a reason or a shadow of reason when he cries to god in his trouble  i am thine oh save me for i have sought thy commandments  i am thine  not merely gods creature the very birds and bees and flowers are that and do their duty far better than igod forgive medo mine  i am thine  not merely gods child the sinners and the thoughtless are that thoughgod help themthey care not for him nor for his laws nor for themselves and their glorious inheritance as children of god  and i too am gods child but i trust that i am more  i am gods school child  o lord jesus christ i claim thy help as my schoolmaster as well as my lord and saviour  i am the least of thy schoolchildren and it may be the most ignorant and most stupid  i do not pretend to be a scholar a divine a philosopher a saint  i am a very weak foolish insufficient personage sitting on the lowest form in thy great school house which is the whole world and trying to spell out the mere letters of thy alphabet in hope that hereafter i may be able to make out whole words and whole sentences of thy commandments and having learnt them do them  for if thou wilt but teach me thy statutes o lord then i will try to keep them to the end  for i long to be on thy side and about thy work  i long to helpif it be ever so littlein making myself better and my neighbours better  i long to be useful and not useless a benefit and not a nuisance a fruitbearing tree and not a noxious weed in thy garden and therefore i hope that thou wilt not cut me down nor root me up nor let foul creatures trample me under foot  have mercy on me o lord in my trouble for the sake of the truth which i long to learn and for the good which i long to do  poor little weak plant though i may be i am still a plant of thy planting which is doing its best to grow and flower and bear fruit to eternal life and thou wilt not despise the work of thine own hands o lord who died that i might live  thou wilt not let me perish  i have stuck unto thy testimonies o lord confound me not  therefore remember this  if you wish to have reasonable hope when you have to praylord save me pray first and pray continuallyteach me o lord thy statutes and i will keep them to the end     sermon xiii  the one escape   psalm cxix 67     before i was troubled i went wrong but now have i kept thy word  let me speak this afternoon once more about the 119th psalm and the man who wrote it  and first he was certainly of a different opinion from nine persons out of ten i fear from ninetynine out of a hundred of every country every age and every religion  for he saysbefore i was troubled i went wrong but now have i kept thy word  whereas nine people out of ten would say to god if they daredbefore i was troubled i kept thy word  but now that i am troubled of course i cannot help going wrong  he makes his troubles a reason for doing right  they make their troubles an excuse for doing wrong  is it not so  do we not hear people saying whenever they are blamed for doing what they know to be wrongi could not help it  i was forced into it  what would you have a man do  one must live and so forth  one finds himself in danger and tries to lie himself out of it  another finds himself in difficulties and begins playing ugly tricks in money matters  another finds himself in want and steals  the general opinion of the world is that rightdoing justice truth and honesty are very graceful luxuries for those who can afford them very good things when a man is easy prosperous and well off and without much serious business on hand but not for the real hard work of life not for times of ambition and struggle any more than of distress and anxiety or of danger and difficulty  in such times if a man may not lie a little cheat a little do a questionable stroke of business now and then how is he to live  so it is in the world so it always was and so it always will be  from statesmen ruling nations and men of business conducting great financial operations as the saying is now down to the beggar woman who comes to ask charity the rule of the world is that honesty is not the best policy that falsehood and cunning are not only profitable but necessary that in proportion as a man is in trouble in that proportion he has a right to go wrong  a right to go wrong  a right to make bad worse  a right to break gods laws because we are too stupid or too hasty to find out what gods laws are  a right as the wise man puts it to draw bills on nature which she will not honour but return them on a mans hands with no effects written across them leaving the man to pay after all in misery and shame  truly said solomon of oldthe foolishness of fools is folly  but the psalmist because he was inspired by the spirit of god was of quite the opposite opinion  so far from thinking that his trouble gave him a right to go wrong he thought that his trouble laid on him a duty to go right more right than he had ever gone before and that going right was the only possible way of getting out of his troubles  take from me he cries the way of lying and cause thou me to make much of thy law  i have chosen the way of truth and thy judgments have i laid before me  incline mine heart unto thy testimonies and not unto covetousness  oh turn away mine eyes lest they behold vanity and quicken thou me in thy way  thy word is my comfort in my trouble for thy word hath quickened me  the proud have had me exceedingly in derision yet have i not shrunk from thy law  for i remembered thine everlasting judgments o god and received comfort  thy statutes have been my songs in the house of my pilgrimage  i have thought upon thy name o lord in the nightseason and have kept thy law  this was the psalmists plan for delivering himself out of trouble  a very singular plan which very few persons try either now or in any age  and therefore it is that so many persons are not delivered out of their troubles but sink deeper and deeper into them heaping new troubles on old ones till they are crushed beneath the weight of their own sins  what the special trouble was in which the psalmist found himself we are not told  but it is plain from his words that it was just that very sort of trouble in which the world is most ready to excuse a man for lying cringing plotting and acting on the old devils maxim that cunning is the natural weapon of the weak  for the psalmist was weak oppressed and persecuted by the great and powerful  but his method of defending himself against them was certainly not the way of the world  princes he says sat and spoke against him  but instead of fawning on them excusing himself entreating their mercy he was occupied in gods statutes  the proud had him exceedingly in derisionas i am afraid too many worldly men poor as well as rich working men as well as idlers would do nowseeing him occupied in gods statutes when he might have been occupied in winning money and place and renown for himself  but he did not shrink from gods law  if it was true he could afford to be laughed at for obeying it  the congregation of the ungodly robbed him  but he did not forget gods law  if they did wrong that was no reason why he should do wrong likewise  the proud imagined a lie against him  but he would keep gods commandments with his whole heart instead of breaking gods commandments and justifying their slander and making their lie true  still it went very hard with him  his honour and his faith were sorely tried  he was dried up like a bottle in the smoke  it seems to have been with him at times a question of life and death till he had hardly any hope left  he had to ask almost in despairhow many are the days of thy servant  when wilt thou be avenged of them that persecute me  the proud dug pits for him contrary to the law of god contrary to honour and justice and almost made an end of him upon earth  the ungodly laid wait to destroy him  but against them all he had but one weapon and one defence  however much afraid he might be of his enemies he was still more afraid of doing wrong  his flesh he said trembled for fear of god and he was afraid of gods judgments  therefore his only safety was in pleasing god and not men  i deal he says with the thing that is lawful and right  oh give me not over to my oppressors  make thy servant to delight in what is good that the proud do me no wrong  if he could but keep right he would be safe at last  i will consider thy testimonies o lord  i see that all things come to an end  bad times and bad chances and still more bad men and bad ways for escaping out of troublethey all come to an end  but thy commandment is exceeding broad  exceeding broad  there are depths below depths of meaning in that true saying depths which you will find true if you will but read your bibles and obey your bibles  for in them i tell you openly you will find rules to guide you in every chance and change of this mortal life  truly said the good man that there were in the bible shallows where a lamb may drink and deeps wherein an elephant may swim  there are no possible circumstances good or bad pleasant or unpleasant in which you can find yourselves be you rich or poor young or old without finding in the bible sound advice and a clear rule as to how god would have you behave under those circumstances  for gods commandments are exceeding broad and take in all cases of conscience all details of duty saying to each and every one of us at every turnthis is the way walk ye in it  at least this is the teaching this is the testimony this is the life experience of a true hero namely the man who wrote the 119th psalm a hero according to god but not according to the world and the pomp and glory of the world  no great statesman was he nor conqueror nor merchant nor financier passing millions of money through his hands yearly and all fancying that they and not god govern the nations upon earth and decide the fate of empires  he was a man who made no noise in the world though the world it seems made a little noise at him in his time as it does often bark and yell at those who will not go its way as it barked at poor christian when he went through vanity fair and would not buy its wares or join in its frivolities  such a man was this psalmist for whom the world had nothing but scorn first and then forgetfulness  we do not know his name or where he lived  we do not even know within a few hundred years when he lived  i picture him to myself always as a poor shrivelled stooping meanlooking old man his visage marred more than any man and his figure more than the sons of men no form nor comeliness in him nor beauty that men should desire him despised and rejected of men a man of sorrows and acquainted with grief even as his master was after him  and all that he has left behind himas far as we can tellis this one psalm which he wrote as may be guessed from its arrangement slowly and with exceeding care as the very pith and marrow of an experience spread over many painful years of struggle and of humiliation  i say of humiliation  for there is not a taint of selfconceit not even of selfsatisfaction in him  he only sees his own weakness and want of life of spirit of manfulness of power  his soul cleaveth to the dust he is tempted of course again and again to give way to become low minded cowardly timeserving covetous worldly  but he dares not  he feels that his only chance is to keep his honour unspotted and he crieswhatever happensi must do right  i must learn to do right teach me to do right  teach me o lord teach me and strengthen me o lord strengthen me and then all must come right at last  that was his cry  and be you sure he did not cry in vain  for this man had one precious possession which he determined not to lose not though he died in trying to hold it fast namely the eternal spirit of god the spirit of righteousness and truth and justice which leads men into all truth  by that spirit he saw into the eternal laws of god  by that spirit he saw who made and who administers those eternal laws even the eternal word of god who endureth for ever in heaven  by that spirit he saw that his only hope was to keep those eternal laws  by that spirit he vowed to keep them  by that spirit he had strength to keep them  by that spirit when he failed he tried again when he fell he rose and fought on once more to keep the commandments of the lord  and where is he now  where is he now  where those will never comelet false preachers and false priests flatter them as they maywho fancy that they can get to heaven without being good and doing good  where those will never come likewise who when they find themselves in trouble try to help themselves out of it by false and mean methods and so begin worshipping the devil just when they have most need to worship god  he is where the fearful and unbelievers and all liars can never come  he is with the word of the lord who endureth for ever in heaven  with the word of the lord who endured awhile on earth even as he the psalmist endured  who before pontius pilate witnessed a good confession and endured the cross despising the shame because he cared neither for riches nor for pleasure for power nor for glory but simply for his fathers will and his fathers law that he might do to the uttermost the will of his father who sent him and keep to the uttermost that law of which his father says to him for everthou art my son today have i begotten thee  into his presence may we all come at last  but we shall never come thither unless we keep our honour bright our courage unbroken and ourselves unspotted from the world  for so only will be fulfilled in us the sixth beatitudeblessed are the pure in heart for they shall see god  unto which may god of his free mercy bring us all  amen     sermon xiv  the word of god   psalm cxix 8996     o lord thy word endureth for ever in heaven  thy truth also    remaineth from one generation to another thou hast laid the    foundation of the earth and it abideth  they continue this day    according to thine ordinance for all things serve thee  if my    delight had not been in thy law i should have perished in my trouble    i will never forget thy commandments for with them thou hast    quickened me  i am thine oh save me for i have sought thy    commandments  the ungodly laid wait for me to destroy me but i will    consider thy testimonies  i see that all things come to an end but    thy commandment is exceeding broad  this text is of infinite importance to you and me and all mankind  for if the text is not true if there is not a word of god who endures and is settled for ever in heaven then this world is a miserable and a mad place and the best thing it seems to me that we poor ignorant human beings can do is to eat and drink for to morrow we die  but that is not the best thing we can do but the very worst thing  the best thing that we can do and the only thing worth doing is to be good and do good at all risks and all costs trusting to the word of god who endures for ever in heaven  but who is this word of god  i say who not what  we often call the bible the word of god and so it is in one sense because it tells us from beginning to end about this other word of god  it is so to speak gods word or message about this word  but it is plain that the psalmist is not speaking here of the bible for he says  thy word endureth for ever in heaven and the bible is not in heaven but on earth  but in the bible usually this word of the lord means not only the message which god sends but him by whom god sends it  the word of god word of the lord is spoken of again and again not as a thing but as a person a living rational being who comes to men and speaks to them and teaches them sometimes seemingly by actual word of mouth sometimes again by putting thoughts into their minds and words into their mouths  recollect samuel how when he was young the word of the lord was preciousthat is uncommon and almost unknown in those days and how the lord came and called samuel samuel and put a word into his mouth against eli  and so the lord appeared again in shiloh for the lord revealed himself to samuel in shiloh by the word of the lord  in samuels case there was it seems an actual voice which fell on samuels ears  in the case of the later prophets we do not read that they usually heard any actual voice or saw any actual appearance  it seems that the word of the lord who came to them inspired their minds with true thoughts and inspired their lips to speak those thoughts in noble words often in regular poetry  but he was the word of the lord nevertheless  again and again we read in those grand old prophets the word of the lord came unto me sayingor again the word which came to jeremiah from the lord saying  it is not the bible which is meant by such words as thesei am sorry to have to remind a nineteenth century congregation of this factbut a living being putting thoughts into the prophets minds and words into their mouths and a divine passion too into their hearts which they could not resist like poor jeremiah of old when he was reproached and derided about the word of the lord and said i will not make mention of him nor speak any more in his name but he was in my heart as a burning fire shut up in my bones and i was weary with forbearing and i could not hold my peace  but now what words are these which we read of this same word of the lord in the first chapter of st johns gospel  in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god  by him all things were made and without him was not anything made that was made and in him was life and the life was the light of men  thusas alwaysthe old testament and the new the psalmist and st john agree together  this is the gospel and good news which the psalmist saw in part but which st john saw fully and perfectly  but because the psalmist saw it even in part he saw that the word of the lord endured for ever in heaven and that therefore his only hope of safety was to listen eagerly and reverently for what that word might choose to say to him  but why does the psalmist seemingly go out of his way as it were to say thou hast laid the foundation of the earth and it abideth  they continue this day according to thine ordinance for all things serve thee  for the very same reason that st john goes seemingly out of his way to say all things were made by the word and without him was not anything made that was made  why is this  look at it thus what an important question it is whether this word of god is a being of order a regular being a lawabiding being a being on whose actions men can count who can be trusted and depended on not to alter his own ways not to deceive us poor mortal men  the psalmist wants to know his way through this world and his duty in this mortal life  therefore he must learn the laws and rules of this world  and he has the sense to see that no one can teach him the rules of the world but the ruler of the world and the maker of the world  then comes the terrible questiontoo many alas have not got it answered rightly yet  but are there any rules at all in the world  does the lord manage the world by rules and laws  or does he let things go by chance and accident and take no care about them  is there such a thing as gods providence or is there not  to that the psalmist answers firmly because he is inspired by the spirit of god  o lord thy word endurethis settledfor ever in heaven  in thee is no carelessness neglect slothfulness nor caprice  thou hast no variableness neither shadow of turning  thou hast laid the foundation of the earth and it abideth  they continue this day according to thine ordinance for all things serve thee  the world is full of settled and enduring rules and laws and god keeps to them  the psalmist looks at the sun moon and stars over his head each keeping its settled course and its settled season and he sees them all obeying law  he looks at summer and winter seedtime and harvest and he sees them obeying law  he looks at birth and growth at decay and death and sees them too obeying law  he looks at the very flowers beneath his feet and the buds in the woodland and all the crowd of living things about him animal vegetable and mineral and they too obey law each after their kind  the world he says is full of law  it is a settled world an orderly world made and governed by a lord of order who makes laws and enforces laws a lord whose word endures for ever in heaven  thereforehe feelsi can trust that lord  if he has laws for the beasts and birds he must have much more laws for men  if he has laws for mens bodies much more has he laws for their souls  what i have to do is to ask him to teach me those laws that i may live  but then comes another and even a more awful questionif i ask him will he teach me  alas alas too many have not found the answer yet too many of those who know most about the laws of nature and reverence those laws most and all honour to them for so doing for even though they know it not they are preparing the way of the lord and making his paths straight  but they have not found the right answer to that question yet  still there the question is and you and i and every soul of man must get some reasonable answer or other to it if we wish to be men indeed men in spirit and in truth and it is this  if i ask this word of god to teach me his lawswill he teach me  will he hear me  can he hear or is he himself a mere brute force a law of nature and necessity  and even if not will he hear  or is he too like those epicurean gods of whom our great poet singsa sad and hopeless song     they lie beside their nectar and the bolts are hurled    far below them in the valleys and the clouds are lightly curled    round their golden houses girdled with the gleaming world    where they smile in secret looking over wasted lands    blight and famine plague and earthquake roaring deeps and fiery    sands    clanging fights and flaming towns and sinking ships and praying    hands  and praying hands  oh my friends is not the question of all questions for such poor mortal souls as you and me beset by ignorance and weakness and passions which are our own worst enemies and chances and catastrophes which we cannot avertis not the question of all questions for such as uswill this same word of godwill any unseen being out of the infinite void which surrounds our little speck of a planet take any notice of our praying hands  will he hear us teach us when we cry  or is god and the word of god like those old heathen gods  is he a god who hides himself and leaves us to despair and chance or is he a god who hears and gives us even a single ray of hope is he a gracious god who will hear every mans tale however clumsily told and judge it according to its merits or evenfor that is better than dead silence and carelessnessaccording to its demerits  is he a just god  or has he likes and dislikes favourites and victims as human rulers and statesmen and human parties too and mobs are wont to have may he not even like those epicurean gods despise men find a proud satisfaction in deceiving them or at least letting them deceive themselvesin playing with their ignorance and leaving them to reap the fruits of their own childishness  to that the psalmist answersand i know not how he learnt to answer so save by the inspiration of the spirit of god for i know well that neither flesh and blood the experience of his own brain thoughts and emotions nor the world around him either of nature or of man would ever have revealed that to himto that he answers confidently in spite of all appearances  thy truth o lord abideth from one generation to another  thou art a truthful god a faithful god whose word can be taken  a god in whom is no variableness neither shadow of turning who keepeth his promise for ever true as man can be true and truer than the truest man  and i know it says he by experience  god has actually taught me his law for if my delight had not been in it i should have perished in my trouble  i will never forget his commandments for by them he has given me life has taught me what to do and enabled me to do it to prevent the death and ruin of my body and soul and spirit  now for the very same reason it is that st john is so careful first to tell us that the word of god made all things and then to tell us that he is full of grace and truth  he tells us that the word made all things that we may be sure that he is a god of order because all things which he has made are full of order a god who acts by rules and laws which we may trust  he tells us that the word made all things that we may be sure that all things being his handywork will bear witness of him and teach us about him and shew forth his glory  but he tells us moreoveroh gospel and good news for blind and weak humanitythat the words glory is full of grace gracious ready to condescend ready to teach us and give us light to see our way through this world which he has made  he tells us that the words glory is full of truth that he is truthful accurate and to be depended on and will tell us nothing but what is true  that he is a true word of god and when he speaks to us of his father and of our father he tells the truth  and so do st john and the psalmist agree in the same gospel and good news of the mystery of christ the word  there is an eternal being in heaven who is called the word of god because he speaks of and revealsthat is unveils and shewsto men and angels and archangels and all created beings that god whom no man hath seen or can see a word who dwells for ever in the bosom of the father in the light which no man can approach unto but who for ever comes forth from thence to proclaim to all created beingsthere is a god and the word is his likeness the brightness of his glory and the express image of his person  none hath seen the father at any time but the onlybegotten son who is in the bosom of the father he hath declared him  none cometh to the father but through him  but he who hath seen him hath seen the father and he is none other than jesus christ our lord  he is the word of god who speaks to men gods words because he speaks not his own words but his fathers and does not his own will but his fathers who sends him  he speaks to us and to all men in many ways and to each according to his needs  to all men christ speaks through their consciences shewing them what is good and warning them of what is evil for he is the light that lighteth every man that cometh into the world  to christians christ speaks in many waysto which alas too few give heedthrough the bible through the sacraments through sermons through the thoughts and words of all wise and holy men  to the good he speaks with gracious encouragement to the wicked with awful severity  to the hypocrites he says at times ye serpents ye generation of vipers how can ye escape the damnation of hell  to the selfsatisfied and bigoted he says if ye had been blind ye had had no sin but now ye say we see therefore your sin remaineth  to the careless and worldly he says i know thy works that thou art neither cold nor hot  thou sayest i am rich and increased with goods i have need of nothing and knowest not that thou art wretched and miserable and poor and blind and naked  to those who are ruining themselves by their own folly he says why will ye die  i have no pleasure in the death of him that dieth saith the lord but rather that he should be converted and live  to those who are tormented by their own passions he says take my yoke upon you and learn of me for i am meek and lowly of heart and ye shall find rest unto your souls  to those who are wearied with the burden of their own sins he says come unto me all ye that are weary and heavy laden and i will give you rest  to those who are struggling however weakly to do what is right he says i know thy works  behold i have set before thee an open door and none can shut it for thou hast a little strength and hast kept my word and hast not denied my name  because thou hast kept the word of my patience i also will keep thee from the hour of temptation  and to those who mourn for those whom they have loved and lost he says fear not i am the first and the last i am he that liveth and was dead and behold i am alive for evermore amen and have the keys of hell and of death  he that believeth in me though he die yet shall he live and he that liveth and believeth in me shall never die  for every one of us according to his character and his needs christ speaks a fitting word from god because he is the word of god and every word which he speaks to us is true and sure and eternal according to the laws of god his father  for he is the word who endures for ever in heaven and though heaven and earth may pass away his words cannot pass away  yes christ the word speaks to all but most of all to children to the children of whom he saidsuffer the little children to come to me and forbid them notof whom he said to grownup people notexcept these children be converted and become as youhe left that message for the pharisees of his own time and of every age and creed butexcept you grown people be converted and become as little children you and not they shall in no wise enter into the kingdom of heaven  let us tell children thatthat christ himself is speaking to them  that the word of god is educating them  that the light who lightens every man who comes into the world is labouring to enlighten them their intellect and memory their emotions and their consciences  let that be the ground of all our education of children  then it will matter little to us who teaches them what is miscalled secular knowledge  for we shall tell our childrenin it too christ is teaching you  the understanding by which you understand the world about you is christs gift  the world which you are to understand is christs world for he laid the foundation of the earth and it abideth  the physical laws of the universe are christs laws for all things serve him and continue this day according to his ordinance  every natural object is a result of christs will and its organization a product of christs mind for without him was not anything made that was made  the whole course of events great and small is christs providence for to him all power is given in heaven and earth so far therefore from being afraid to teach our children natural science we shall hold it a sacred duty to teach it for it is the will and mind of christ the word of god  and as for moralitywe shall be ready to teach that as far as the prudential and paying virtues are concerned as boldly and on the very same grounds as the merest utilitarian  for we shall teach honesty courtesy decency selfrestraint patience foresight on the warrant of the bible which is that christ has made the world so well that sooner or later every wise and just act rewards itself every foolish and unjust act punishes itself by the very constitution of nature and society which again are laid down by christ  but what of the nobler the non prudential and nonpaying virtuescall them rather gracesthem we shall teach our childrenas i believe we can only teach them rationally and logically either to children or to grownup peopleby pointing them to christ upon his cross and saying to them behold your god  for so we shall be able to train them in the orthodox doctrine of morals which is  that there is nothing good in man which is not first in god  we shall be able to make them comprehend what we mean when we tell them that they are members of christ and must live the life of christ that they are children of god and as such must imitate their father and become perfect even as their father in heaven is perfect  for we shall saythe pure and perfect graces the disinterested virtues the unselfish virtuesobedience mercy chivalry beneficence magnanimity heroismin one word selfsacrificebeautiful these are but are they necessary are they mere ornaments or are they sacred duties  the duty which dares and suffers for the thing it ought to do the love which dares and suffers for the thing it loves the unselfish spirit which looks for no rewardwhy should these dwell in man  to that we shall answerbecause they dwell for ever in god  if we are askedwhy are they beautiful in man we shall answerbecause they are the very beauty and glory of god the glory which the incarnate word of god manifested to men when he hung on the cross of calvary and was more utterly then if possible than ever the word of god because he then declared most utterly to men the character and essence of god  love which is not contentas what true love isto be a passive sentiment a selfcontained possibility but which must go out of itself pitying yearning agonizing to seek to struggle to suffer and if need be to die for the creature which it loves even if that creature love it not again  we need not say this to children  we need only point them to christ upon his cross and trust christ to say it to them in their heart of hearts through instincts too deep for words  all we need say to our children isbehold your god  he it is who inspires you with every dutiful generous and unselfish impulse you have ever felt for they are the fruits of his spirit  by that spirit he was once unselfish even to the death  by that spirit he will enable you to carry out in action as he did the unselfish instincts which he has given you and to live the noble life the heroic life the life of selfsacrifice the life of god the life of the father and of the son and of the holy spirit and therefore the only life fit for those who are baptized into that holy name  this is the ground and method on which we should educate our children for it is the ground and method on which the word of god is educating us     sermon xv  i   psalm cxix 94     i am thine oh save me  let us think seriously this afternoon of one word the word which is the keynote of this psalm  a very short word for in our language there is but one letter in it  a very common word for we are using it all day long when we are awake and even at night in our dreams and yet a very wonderful word for though we know well whom it means yet what it means we do not know and cannot understand no nor can the wisest philosopher who ever lived and a most important word too for we cannot get rid of it we cannot help thinking of it cannot help saying it all our life long from childhood to the grave  after death too we shall probably be saying that word to ourselves each of us for ever and ever  if the whole universe sun moon and stars and all that we ever thought of or can think of were destroyed and became nothing that word would probably be left and we should be left alone with it and on what we meant by that little word would depend our everlasting happiness or misery  and what is this wonderful little word  what but the word i  each one of us says ii think i know i feel i ought i ought not i did that and cannot undo it and why  because we are not things nor mere animals but persons living souls though our bodies are like the bodies of animals only more perfect that they may be fit dwellingplaces for more perfect souls  the animals as far as we know do not think of themselves each as i  little children do not at first  they call themselves by names by which they hear others call them not in the first but in the third person  after a while there grows up in them the wonderful thought that they are persons different from any other person round them and they begin to sayi want this i like that  i trust that i shall not seem to you as one who dreams when i say that i believe that is a revelation from god to each child and just what makes the difference between him and an animal that god teaches each child to say i to know that it is not a mere thing but a person a living soul with a will of its own and a duty of its own responsible for itself which ought to do some things and ought not to do other things  and what a solemn and awful revelation that is we shall see more clearly the more we think of it  it may be a very dreadful and tormenting thought  it does not torment the mere savage who has no sense of right and wrong who follows his own appetites and passions and has never learnt to say i ought and i ought not  but it does torment the heathen when they begin to be civilized and to think it has tormented them in all ages  it tormented the old greeks and romans it torments some eastern peoples stillthat terrible thoughti am i myself and cannot be any one else  i am answerable for all that i ever did or shall do and no one can be answerable for me  all the bad deeds i ever did the bad thoughts i ever thought are mine parts of me and will be for ever  i can no more escape from them than i can spring off my own shadow  but men have been always trying to escape to escape from the burden of their own self and the dread of an evil conscience and have invented religion after religion often fantastic enough often pathetic enough likewise in hopes of hiding from themselves the secret thoughti am i and must be myself for ever  but i am not what i ought to be and therefore i may be wrong and miserable for ever  and how many people in this christian land are saying at this very moment to themselves oh that i could get rid of this i myself in me which is so discontented and unhappy  oh that i had no conscience  oh that i could forget myself  and they try to forget themselves by dissipation by gaming by drinking by taking narcotic drugs even sometimes by suicide as a last desperate attempt to escape from themselves they know not and care not whither  it is all in vain  there is no escape from self  as the pious poet whose bust stands beneath yonder tower has said     each in his separate sphere of joy and woe    our hermit spirits dwell and range apart  i must be i thou must be thou he must be he she must be she and no one else throughout our mortal lives and for aught we can tell for ever alone each of us with our own souls our own thoughts our own actions our own hopes our own fears our own deservings  stay alonewith all these  yes and alone with one more  each of us is alone with god  face to face with god seen by him through and through and directly answerable to him at every moment of our lives for every deed and word and thought  and is that not a more terrible thought than any  ah my friends it may be  but it may be also the most comforting of all thoughts the only really comforting thought if we will but look at the question as the psalmist looks at it and cry with him to god i am thine oh save the me whom thou hast made  there are those and those who deserve a respectful hearing who will differ from all that i have been saying and indeed from the beliefs of 999 out of 1000 of the human race in every age  they will saythis fancy that you are an i a self individual and indivisible is but a fancy one of the many idols which man creates for himself by bestowing reality and personality on mere abstractions like this i and self  each man is not one indivisible much less indestructible thing or being  he is really many things  he is the net result of all the organic cells of his body and of all the forces which act through them within and of all the circumstances which influence them from without ay and of all the forces and circumstances which have influenced his ancestors ever since man appeared on the earth  but because he remembers many states of consciousness many moments in which he was aware of sensations within him and of circumstances without him therefore he strings all these together and talks of them as one thing which he calls i and speaks of them as his remembrances of himself when really the many things are but links of a chain which is perpetually growing at one end and dropping off at the other  to say therefore that he is the same person as he was when a child or as he would be when an old manis when we know that every atom of his physical frame has changed again and again during the course of years a popular delusion or at least a misnomer used for convenience sake as when we say that the sun rises and sets when we know that the earth moves and not the sun  a man therefore according to this school is really no more a person one and indivisible than is the coral with its million polypes the tree with its million buds or even the thunderstorm with its million vesicles of attracting and repelling vapour  now that a truth underlies such a theory as this i am the last to deny how much of the character of each man is inherited how much of it depends on his actual bodily organization how much of it alas on the circumstances of his youth how much of it changes with the mere physical change from youth to old agewho does not know all this who has ever needed to fight for himself the battle of life  only i say this is but half the truth and these philosophers cannot state their halftruth without employing the very words which they repudiate without using the very personal pronouns the i and me the thou and thee the he and him to which they deny any real existence  beside i askis the experience and the conclusion of the vast majority of all mankind to go for nothing for if there be one point on which human beings have been and are still agreed it is thisthat each of them is to his joy or his sorrow an i a separate person  and i should have said this conviction becomes stronger and stronger in each of them the more human they become civilized and worthy of the respect and affection of their fellowmen  for what rises in them or seems to rise more and more painfully and fiercely  what but that protest that battle between the everlasting i within them and their own passions and motives and circumstances which st paul of old called the battle between the spirit on one side and the flesh and the world on the other  the nobler surely and healthier even for a moment the manhood of any man is the more intense is that inward struggle which man alone of all the animals endures  is it in moments of brave endeavour whether to improve our own character or to benefit our fellowmen or is it in moments of depression disappointment bodily sickness that we are tempted to sayi will fight no more  i cannot mend myself or the world  i am what nature has made me and what i am i must remain  i and all i know and all i love are things not persons parts of nature even as the birds upon the bough only more miserable because tormented by a hope which never will be fulfilled an empty pageant of mere phenomena blown onward toward decay like dying autumn leaves before the everlasting storm which no one guides  is this the inward voice of health and strength or rather for evil or for good that voice which bids the man the woman in the mysterious might of the free i within trample on their own passions defy their own circumstances even to the death fall back in utter need on the absolute instinct of self and even though all seem lost say with medea in the tragedy     che resta  io  medeasome one will ask and have a right to askis that the model which you set before us  the imperious sorceress who from the first has known no law but self her own passions her own intellect who at last maddened by a grievous wrong asserts that self by the murder of her own babes  you might as well set before us as a model miltons satan  just so  remember first nevertheless the old maxim that the best when corrupted is the worst that the higher the nature when used aright in its right place the baser it becomes when used wrongly in its wrong place  when satan fell from his right place said the old jews he became remember not a mere brute but worse a fiend  there is a deep and true philosophy in that  as long as he was what he was meant to bethe servant of godhe was an archangel and more the fairest of all the sons of the morning  when he rebelled when in pride and selfwill he tore himselfhis personaway from that god in whom he lived and moved and had his being the personality remained he could still like medea fall back even when he knew that he had rebelled against his creator on his indomitable self and reign a selfsufficing king even in the depths of hell  but the very strength and richness of that personality made him like medea only the more capable of evil  he stood that is his moral health endured only by loyalty to god  when he lost that he fell to moral disease disease the vaster the vaster were his own capacities  and so it is with you and me and every soul of man  only by loyalty to god can this undying i this self this person which each of us hasor rather which each of us isbe anything but a torment and a curse the more terrible to us and those around us the stronger and the richer are the nature and faculties through which it works  wouldest thou not be a curse unto thy self  then cry with him who wrote the 119th psalmi am thine  oh save the me whom thou o god hast made  for he who wrote that psalm had an intense conviction of his own personality  i and me are words for ever in his mouth but not in self satisfied conceit nor in selftormenting superstition crying perpetually shall i be saved shall i be lost  no  faith in god delivers him from either of these follies  he is forced to think of self  sad persecuted seemingly friendless he is alone with self yet not alone  for at every moment he is referring himself to his true place in the universe to god gods law gods help  the burden of selfof mingled responsibility and weaknessis to him past bearing  it would be utterly past bearing if he could not cast it down at least at moments at the foot of the throne of god and cry i am thine  oh save me  and if any should askas has been asked ere nowbut is there not in this tone of mind something undignified something even abject thus to cry for help instead of helping oneself thus to depend on another being instead of bearing stoically with manly independence  i answerthe psalmist does bear stoically just because he cries for help for the old stoics cried for help the earlier and truerhearted of them at least  some here surely have read epictetus the heathen whose thought most exactly coincides with that of the psalmist  if so do they not see what enabled him the slave of neros minion to assert himself and his own unconquerable personality to defy circumstance and to preserve his own calm his own honour his own purity amid a degradation which might well have driven a good man to suicide  and was it not thisthe intensity of his faith in god  in god the helper god the guide  if any man here have learnt to his own loss to undervalue the experience of prophets psalmists apostles then let him turn to epictetus the heathen and learn from that heroic slave that the true dignity of man lies in true faith in god  nay more  it is a serious question whether ungodlinessby which i mean as the psalmist means the assertion of self independent of godwhether ungodliness i say is ever dignified whether as has been often said miltons still dignified satan is not an impossible character whether goethes utterly undignified mephistopheles is not the true ideal of an utterly evil spirit  ungodliness as we see it manifested in human beings may be repulsive as in the mere ruffian whose mouth is filled with cursing and his feet swift to shed blood  it may again be pitiable as in those human butterflies who live only to enjoy or to minister to what they call luxury and fashion  and it may be againwhen it calmly and deliberately asserts itself to be a philosophy and an explanation of man and of the universe and gives itself magisterial airs however courteously and kindlyit may be then i dare to think a little ludicrous  but as for its dignity i leave to you to say which of the two beings is the more dignified which the more abjecta little organism of flesh and blood at most not more than six feet high liable to be destroyed by a tile off the roof or a blast of foul gas or a hundred other accidents standing selfpoised and selfcomplacent in the centre of such an universe as this and asserting that it acknowledges no superior and needs no guideor the same being awakened to the mystery of his own actual weakness his possible strength his own actual ignorance his possible wisdom his own actual sinfulness his possible holiness and then by a humility which is the highest daring by a selfdistrust which is the truest selfassertion vindicating the divine element within by taking personal and voluntary service under no less a personage than him who made him and crying directly to the creator of sun and stars and all the universei am thine  oh save the me which thou hast made  make up your own minds make up your minds which of the two figures is the more abject which the more dignified  for me i have had too good cause long since to make up mine  and if you wish to judge further for yourselves whether the teaching of the psalmist is more likely to produce an abject or a dignified character i advise you to ponder carefully a certain singulari had almost said uniqueeducational document written by men who had thoroughly imbibed the teaching of this psalm a document which the oftener i peruse it arouses in me more and more admiration not only for its theology but for its knowledge of human nature and not only for what it does but for what it does not say  i mean the catechism of the church of england  you will remark at first sight that it does not affect to teach the child with one remarkable exception to be hereafter noticed  it does not tell the childyou should do this you should not do that  it is strictly an educational catechism  it tries to educethat is draw outwhat is in the child already its own native instincts and native conscience  therefore it makes the child speak for itself  it makes each child feel that he or she is an i a person a responsible soul  it beginswhat is your name  it makes the child confess that it has a name as a sign that it is a person a self a soul different from all other persons in earth or heaven and that its name was given it at baptism for a sign that god made it a person and wishes it to know that it is a person and will teach it how to be a true person and a good person  it teaches the child to sayi and me not in fear and dread like those heathen of whom i spoke just now but with manly confidence and selfrespect and gratitude to god who has made it a person and an immortal soul  to sayi am a person and in order that i might be a right kind of person and not a wrong kind i was made a member of christ a child of god and an inheritor of the kingdom of heaven  to sayi am a person and that i may be a right kind of person i must know and believe certain things concerning god himself father son and holy ghost  i am a person and that i may be a right kind of person i must keep certain commandments and do certain duties toward god and my parents and my queen and my country and my neighbour and all toward whom i am responsible for right behaviour  and then and only then after it has made the child say all this for itself and about itself the catechism does begin to teach and in a few very short words tell the child about that which is not itself  my good child know this that thou art not able to do these things of thyself nor to walk in the commandments of god and to serve him without his special grace which thou must learn at all times to call for by diligent prayer  now consider these words  there is comfort and strength in them comfort for the child comfort for you and me and every human being who has awakened to the sense of his own personal responsibility and finds it too often a burden heavier than heand alas often shecan bear  the catechism tells the child that it must not merely know doctrines about god or do duties to god but more that it is alone with god himself face to face with god himself day and night  but that therefore it is to dread god and look up to god as a taskmaster and tyrant and try to hide from gods awful eye and forget god and forget itselfif it cangod forbid god forbid  the catechism leaves such teaching for those pharisees who tell little children that unless they are converted and become as them they shall in no wise enter into the kingdom of heaven  the catechism says my good childnot my bad childknow this know that thou art weak but know that god is strong and look up to him as the father of all fathers the teacher of all teachers the helper of all helpers the friend of all friends who has i called thee unto his kingdom of grace that he might shew thee graciousness and make thee gracious and graceful in all thy thoughts and works and ways and therefore far from trying to hide from him call on him with diligent prayer  for the father of all fathers is the father of thy soul the son of all sons died for thee upon the cross the holy spirit of all holy spirits will make thee a holy spirit and person even as he is a holy spirit and person himself  believing those words no one will dare to forget to say his prayers  for when he prays he is indeed a person  he is himself and not ashamed however sinful to be himself and to tell god about himself  oh think of that  you each of you have a right as gods children to speak to the god who made the universe  therefore be sure that when you dislike to say your prayers it is because you do not like to be what you are a person and preferah foolish soulto be a thing and an animal  believing those words no man need long to forget himself to escape from himself  he can lift up himself to god who made him with reverence and fear and yet with gratitude and trust and say  i lord am i and what i ama very poor pitiful sinful person  but thou lord art thou and what thou arthappily for me and for the whole universeperfect  thou art what thou oughtest to begoodness itself  and therefore thou canst and thou wilt make me what i ought to be at last a good person  to thee o lord i can bring the burden of this undying i which i carry with me too often in shame and sadness and ask thee to help me to bear it sayingthou knowest lord the secrets of our hearts  shut not thy merciful ears to our prayers but spare us o lord most holy o god most mighty thou worthy judge eternal and suffer us not for any temptation of the world the flesh or the devil to fall from thee  guide me teach me strengthen me till i become such a person as thou wouldst have me be pure and gentle truthful and highminded brave and able courteous and generous dutiful and useful like thy son jesus christ when he increased not only in stature but in favour with god and man  to which may god in his mercy bring us all  amen     sermon xvi  the cedars of lebanon   psalm civ 16     the trees of the lord are full of sap the cedars of lebanon which he    hath planted  let me say a few words this afternoon about the noble 104th psalm which was read this afternoon as it is now in many churches and most wisely and rightly as the harvest psalm  it is a fit psalm for a service in which we thank god for such harvest as he has thought best to send us whether it be above or below the average  but it is also a fit psalm to be thought earnestly over just now considering the turn which mens minds are taking more and more in these times in which it has pleased god that we should live  for we have lost all of us unlearned as well as learned the old superstitious notions about this world around us which our forefathers held for many hundred years  no rational person now believes that witches can blight crops or cattle or that evil spirits cause storms  no one now believes that nymphs and fairies live in fountains or in trees or that the spirits of the planets rule the fates of men  that old belief is gone for good and for evil and it was good that it should go for it was false and falsehoods can do no good but only harm to any man in body and in soul alike  it has died out quickly and strangely  some say that modern science has destroyed it  i can hardly agree to that for it has died outand that almost since my own recollection and under my own eyesin the minds of country people who know nothing of science  i had rather sayas i presume the man who wrote the 104th psalm would have saidthe lord has taken the belief out of mens hearts and minds  and i cannot but hope that he has taken it away and allows us to believe no more in demons and fairies ruling the world around us in order that we may believe in him and nothing but him the true ruler of the world in him of whom it is written him shalt thou worship and him only shalt thou serve even god the father of whom are all things and god the son by whom are all things and god the holy spirit who is the lord and giver of life alike to sun and stars over our heads and to the meanest weed and insect under our feet the lord and giver of life alike to matter and spirit soul and body worm and man and angel and archangel before the throne of god  i hope it is so  i trust it is so  for we never had more need than now to believe with all our hearts in the living god to take into all our hearts the teaching of the 104th psalm  for now that we have given up believing in superstitions we are in danger of going to the other extreme and believing in nothing at all which we cannot see with our eyes and handle with our hands  now that we have given up believing in the fabled supernatural in ghosts fairies demons witches and such like we are in danger of giving up believing in the true and eternal supernatural which is the holy spirit of god by whom the whole creation is kept alive and sound  we are in danger of falling into a low stupid brutish view of this wonderful world of god in which we live in danger of thinking of naturethat is of the things which we can see and handleonly as something of which we can make usetill we fall as low as that poor ruffian of whom the poet says     a primrose on the rivers brim    a yellow primrose was to him       and it was nothing more  lower that is than even our own children whom god has at least taught to admire and love the primroses for their beautyas something precious and divine quite independent of their own emotions about them  men in these days are but too likely to fall into the humour of those poor savages of whom one who knows them well said to me oncebitterly but trulythat when a savage sees anything new however wonderful or beautiful he has but two thoughts about it firstwill it hurt me and nextcan i eat it  and from that truly brutish view of gods world we shall be delivered i believe only by taking in with our whole hearts the teaching of the 104th psalm which is indeed the teaching of all holy scripture throughout  the psalmist in the passage which i have chosen is talking of the circulation of water on the earth how wisely and well it is ordered how the vapours rise off the sea till the waters stand above the mountain tops to be brought down in thunderstormsfor in his country as in many hot ones thunder was generally needed at the end of the dry season to bring down the rain how it forms springs in the highland and flows down from thence in brooks and rivers making the whole lowland green and fertile  wellall very true you may say  but that is simply a matter of science or indeed of common observation and common sense  it is not a subject for a psalm or for a sermon  true in the words in which i have purposely put it  but not in the words in which the psalmist puts it and which i purposely left out to shew you just the difference between even the soundest science and faith  he brings in another element which is the true cause of the circulation of water and that is none other but almighty god  this is the way in which the inspired psalmist puts it and this is the truth of it all this is the very kernel and marrow and life and soul of it all while the facts which i told you just now are the mere shell and dead skeleton of itthou sendest the springs into the rivers  thou art the lord of the lightning and of the clouds the lord of the highlands and of the lowlands and the lord of the rainfall and of the drought the lord of good seasons and of bad of rich harvests and of scanty  they like all things obey thine everlasting laws and of them whatever may befal poor purblind man can say in faith and hopeit is the lord let him do what seemeth him good  yes  he was not of course a man of science in the modern sense of the word this old psalmist  but this i know that he was a man of science in the soundest and deepest sense an inspired philosopher as well as an inspired poet and had the highest of all sciences which is the science and knowledge of the living god  for he saw god in everything and everything in god  buthe saysthe trees of the lord are full of sap even the cedars of lebanon which he hath planted  why should he say that specially of the cedars  did not god make all trees  does he not plant all wild trees and every flower and seed  my dear friends happy are you if you believe that in spirit and in truth  but let me tell you that i think you would not have believed that unless the psalmist and others who wrote the holy scriptures had told you about trees of god and rivers of god and winds of god and had taught you that the earth is the lords and the fulness thereof  you do not knownone of us can knowhow much we owe to the bible for just and rational as well as orthodox and christian notions of the world around us  we andthank godour forefathers for hundreds of years have drunk in bible thoughts as it were with our mothers milk till much that we have really learnt from the bible we take as a matter of course as selfevident truths which we have found out for ourselves by common sense  and yet so far from that being the case if it had not been for the bible we might be believing at this moment that one god made one tree and another another that one tree was sacred to one god and another flower to another goddess as the old greeks believed and that the wheat and barley were the gift and therefore the property of some special deity and be crying now in fear and trembling to the sungod or the raingod or some other deified power of nature because we fancied that they were angry with us and had therefore sent us too much rain and a short harvest  it is difficult nowadays to make even cultivated people understand the follies of those who like the heathen round the jews worshipped many gods and all the more because our modern folly runs in a different channel because we are tempted not to believe in many gods but in no god at all to believe not that one god made one thing and another another but that all things have made themselves  when hiram king of tyre sent down timber cut from the cedars of lebanon to build the temple of god for solomon his heathen workmen probably were angry and terrified at what they were doing  they said among themselvesthese cedars belong to baal or to melkart the gods of tyre  our king has no right to send them to build the temple of jehovah the god of the jews  it is a robbery and a sacrilege and baal will be angry with us and curse us with drought and blight  but nowadays men saythe cedars of lebanon are not gods trees nor are any other trees  they belong to nature  now i believe in nature no more than i do in baal  nature is merely thingsa great many things it is true but only thingsand when i add them all up together and call them nature as if they were one thing i make an abstraction of them there is no harm in that but if i treat that abstraction as if it really existed and did anything then i make of it an idol the which i have no mind to do  i believe i say in nature no more than i do in baal  both words were at first symbols and both have become in due course of time mere idols  but those who worship nature and not god say nowgod did not make trees they were made by the laws of nature and nothing else well i believe that the socalled philosophers who say that will be proved at last to be no more right and no more rational than those heathen workmen of tyre  but meanwhile what the psalmist says and what the bible says isthose trees belong to god  he made them he made all things the sapthe mysterious life in them by which each grows and seeds according to its kindis his gift  their growth is ordered by him and so are all things in earth and heaven  then why speak of them especially as trees of god  because my friends we can only find out that something is true of many things by finding out that it is true of one thing and that we usually find out by some striking instance some case about which there can be no mistake  and these cedars of lebanon were and are still such a striking instance which there was no mistaking  upon the slopes of the great snowmountain of lebanon stood those gigantic cedartreeswhole forests of them thennow only one or two small groups but awful travellers tell us even in their decay  whence did they come  there are no trees like them for hundreds i had almost said for thousands of miles  there are but two other patches of them left now on the whole earth one in the atlas one in the himalaya  the jews certainly knew of no trees like them and no trees either of their size  there were trees among them then probably two and three hundred feet in height trees whose tops were as those minster towers whose shafts were like yonder pillars and their branches like yonder vaults  no king however mighty could have planted them up there upon the lofty mountain slopes  the jew when he entered beneath the awful darkness of these cedars the cedars with a shadowy shroudas the scripture saysthe cedars high and lifted up whose tops were among the thick boughs and their height exalted above all the trees of the field fair in their greatness their boughs multiplied and their branches longfor it is in such words of awe and admiration that the bible talks always of the cedarsthen the jew said god has planted these and god alone  and when he thought not merely of their grandeur and their beauty but of their use of their fragrant and incorruptible timber fit to build the palaces of kings and the temples of gods he saidand what could he say betterthese are trees of god wonderful and glorious works of a wonderful and a glorious creator  if he had not he would have had less reason in him and less knowledge of god than the hindoos of old who when they saw the other variety of the cedar growing in like grandeur on the slopes of the himalaya called them the deodarawhich means in the old sanscrit tongue neither more nor less than the timber of god the lance of godand what better could they have said  my friends i speak on this matter from the fulness of my heart  it has happened to methrough the bounty of god for which i shall be ever gratefulto have spent days in primeval forests as grand and far stranger and far richer than that of lebanon and its cedars amid trees beside which the hugest tree in britain would be but as a sapling gorgeous too with flowers rich with fruits timbers precious gums and all the yet unknown wealth of a tropic wilderness  and as i looked up awestruck and bewildered at those minsters not made by hands i found the words of scripture rising again and again unawares to my lips and saidyes the bible words are the best words the only words for such a sight as this  these too are trees of god which are full of sap  these too are trees which god not man has planted  mind i do not say that i should have said so if i had not learnt to say so from the bible without the bible i should have been i presume either an idolater or an atheist  and mind also that i do not say that the psalmist learnt to call the cedars trees of god by his own unassisted reason  i believe the very opposite  i believe that no man can see the truth of a thing unless god shews it him that no man can find out god in earth or heaven unless god condescends to reveal himself to that man  but i believe that god did reveal himself to the psalmist did enlighten his reason by the inspiration of his holy spirit did teach him as we teach a child what to call those cedars and as it were whispered to him though with no audible voice thou wishest to know what name is most worthy whereby to call those mighty trees then call them trees of god  know that there is but one god of whom are all things and that they are his trees and that he planted them to shew forth his wisdom his power and his good will to man  and do you fancy that because the jew called the great cedars trees of god that therefore he thought that the lentiscs and oleanders by the brook outside were not gods shrubs or the lilies and anemones upon the down below were not gods flowers  some folk have fancied soit seems to me most unreasonably  i should have thought that here the rule stood true that that which is greater contains the less that if the psalmist knew god to be mighty enough to make and plant the cedars he would think him also mighty enough to make and plant the smallest flower at his feet i think so  for i know it was so with me  my feeling that those enormous trees over my head were gods trees did not take away in the least from my feeling of gods wisdom and power in the tiniest herb at their feet  nay rather it increased my feeling that god was filling all things with life and beauty till the whole forestif i may so speak in all humility but in all honestyfrom the highest to the lowest from the hugest to the smallest and every leaf and bud therein seemed full of the glory of god  and if i could feel thatbeing the thing i amhow much more must the inspired psalmist have felt it  you see by this very psalm that he did feel it  the grass for the use of cattle and the green herb for men and the corn and the wine and the oil he says are just as much gods making and gods gift  the earth is filled he says with the fruit of gods works  filled not dotted over here and there with a few grand and wonderful things which god cares for while he cares for nothing else but filled  let us take the words of scripture honestly in their whole strength and believe that if the psalmist saw gods work in the great cedars he saw it everywhere else likewise  nay more i will say this  that i believe it was such teaching as that of this very 104th psalmteaching which runs my friends throughout the old testament especially through the psalmists and the prophetswhich enabled the jews to understand our lords homely parables about the flowers of the field and the birds of the air  those of them at least who were israelites indeed those who did understand and had treasured up in their hearts the old revelation of moses and the psalmists and the prophets those who did still believe that the cedars were the trees of god and that god brought forth grass for the cattle and green herb for the service of men and who could see gods hand gods laws gods love working in themthose men and women be sure were the very ones who understood our lord when he said consider the lilies of the field how they grow  they toil not neither do they spin  and yet i say unto you that solomon in all his glory was not compared unto one of these  and why should it not be so with you townsfolk though you are  every londoner has now in the public parks and gardens the privilege of looking on plants and flowers more rich more curious more varied than meet the eye of any average countryman  then when you next avail yourselves of that real boon of our modern civilization let me beg you not to forget the lesson which i have been trying to teach you  you may feelyou ought to feelthat those strange and stately semitropic forms are indeed plants of god the work of a creative spirit who delights to employ his almighty power in producing ever fresh shapes of beautyseemingly unnecessary seemingly superfluous seemingly created for the sake of their beauty alonein order that the lord may delight himself in his works  let that sight make you admire and reverence more not less the meanest weed beneath your feet  remember that the very weeds in your own garden are actually more highly organized have costif i may so say with all reverence but i can only speak of the infinite in clumsy terms of the finitethe creator more thought more pains than the giant cedars of lebanon and the giant cypresses of california  remember that the smallest moss or lichen which clings upon the wall is full of wonders and beauties as inexplicable as unexpected and that of every flower on your own windowsill the words of christ stand literally truethat solomon in all his glory was not arrayed as one of these and bow your hearts and souls before the magnificent prodigality the exquisite perfection of his work who can be as often as he will greatest in that which is least because to his infinity nothing is great and nothing small who hath created all things and for his pleasure they are and were created who rejoices for ever in his own works because he beholds for ever all that he makes and it is very good  and then refresh your hearts as well as your brainstired it may be too often with the drudgery of some mechanical or merely calculating occupationrefresh your hearts i say by lifting them up unto the lord in truly spiritual truly heavenly thoughts which bring nobleness and trust and peace to the humblest and the most hardworked man  for you can say in your heartsall the things which i see are gods things  they are thoughts of god  god gives them law and life and use  my heavenly father made them  my saviour redeemed them with his most precious blood and rules and orders them for ever  the holy spirit of god which was given me at my baptism gives them life and power to grow and breed after their kinds  the divine miraculous and supernatural power of god himself is working on them and for them perpetually and how much more on me and for me and all my children and fellowcreatures for whom christ died  without my father in heaven not a sparrow falls to the ground and am i not of more value than many sparrows  god feeds the birds and will he not feed me  god clothes the lilies of the field and will he not clothe me  ah me of little faith who forget daily that in god i live and move and have my being and am in spite of all my sins the child of god  him i can trust in prosperous times and in disastrous times in good harvests and in bad harvests in life and in death in time and in eternity  for he has given all things a law which cannot be broken  and they continue this day as at the beginning serving him  and if i serve him likewise then shall i be in harmony with god and with gods laws and with gods creatures great and small  the whole powers of nature as well as of spirit will be arrayed on my side in the struggle for existence and all things will work together for good to those who love god     sermon xvii  life   psalm civ 24 2830     o lord how manifold are thy works in wisdom hast thou made them all    the earth is full of thy riches     that thou givest them they gather  thou openest thine hand they are    filled with good  thou hidest thy face they are troubled  thou    takest away their breath they die and return to their dust  thou    sendest forth thy spirit they are created and thou renewest the face    of the earth  what is the most important thing to you and me and every man  i suppose that most if they answered honestly would saylife  i will give anything i have for my life  and if some among you answeredas i doubt not some wouldno not life but honour and duty  there is many a thing which i would rather die than dothen you would answer like valiant and righteous folk and may god give you grace to keep in the same mind and to hold your good resolution to the last  but you too will agree that except doing your duty life is the most important thing you have  the mother when she sacrifices her life to save her child shews thereby how valuable she holds the childs life to be so valuable that she will give up even her own to save it  but did you never consider againand a very solemn and awful thought it isthat this so important thing called life is the thing above all other earthly things of which we know leastay of which we know nothing  we do not know what death is  we send a shot through a bird and it falls deadthat is lies still and after a while decays again into the dust of the earth and the gases of the air  but what has happened to it  how does it die  how does it decay  what is this life which is gone out of it  no man knows  men of science by dissecting and making experiments which they do with a skill and patience which deserve not only our belief but our admiration will describe to us the phenomena or outward appearances which accompany death and follow death  but death itselffor want of what the animal has diedwhat has gone out of itthey cannot tell  no man can tell for that is invisible and not to be discovered by the senses  they are therefore forced to explain death by theories which may be true or false but which are after all not death itself but their own thoughts about death put into their own words  death no man can see but only the phenomena and effects of death and still more life no man can see but only the phenomena and effects of life  for if we cannot tell what death is still more we cannot tell what life is  how life begins how it organizes each living thing according to its kind and makes it grow how it gives it the power of feeding on other things and keeping up its own body thereby of this all experiments tell us as yet nothing  experiment gives us here again the phenomenathe visible effects  but the causes it sees not and cannot see  this is not a matter to be discussed here  but this i say that scientific men in the last generation or two have learnt to their great honour and to the great good of mankindeverything or almost everything about itexcept the thing itself and that below all facts below all experiments below all that the eye or brain of man can discover lies always a something nameless invisible imponderable yet seemingly omnipresent and omnipotent retreating before the man of science deeper and deeper the deeper he delves namely the life which shapes and makes all phenomena and all facts  scientific men are becoming more and more aware of this unknown force i had almost said ready to worship it  more and more the noblest minded of them are becoming engrossed with that truly miraculous element in nature which is always escaping them though they cannot escape it  how should they escape it  was it not written of oldwhither shall i go from thy presence and whither shall i flee from thy spirit  what then can we know of this same life which is so precious in most mens eyes  my friends it was once saidthat mans instinct was in all unknown matters to take refuge in god  the words were meant as a sneer  i as a christian glory in them and ask where else should man take refuge save in god  when man sees anythingas he must see hundreds of thingswhich he cannot account for things mysterious and seemingly beyond the power of his mind to explain what safer what wiser word can he say thanthis is the lords doing and it is marvellous in our eyes god understands it though i do not  be it what it may it is a work of god  from god it comes by god it is ruled and ordered  that at least i know and let that be enough for me  and so we may say of life  when we are awed and all but terrified by the unfathomable mystery of life we can at least take refuge in god  and if we be wise we shall take refuge in god  whatever we can or cannot know about it this we know that it is the gift of god  so thought the old jewish prophets and psalmists and spoke of a breath of god a vapour a spirit of god which breathed life into all things  it was but a figure of speech of course but if a better one has yet been found let the words in which it has been written or spoken be shewn to me  for to me at least they are yet unknown  i have read as yet no wiser words about the matter than those of the old jewish sages who told how at the making of the world the spirit or breath of god moved on the face of the waters quickening all things to life or how god breathed into mans nostrils the breath or spirit of life and man became a living soul  and in the same temper does that true philosopher and truly inspired psalmist who wrote the 139th psalm speak of the spirit or breath of god  he considers his own body how fearfully and wonderfully it is made how god did see his substance yet being imperfect and in gods book were all his members written which day by day were fashioned while as yet there was none of them  thou he says o god hast fashioned me behind and before and laid thine hand upon me  such knowledge is too wonderful and excellent for me i cannot attain to it  but he says to himself there is one who has attained to it who does know for he has done it all and is doing it still and that is god and the spirit of god  whitherhe asksshall i go then from gods spirit  whither shall i flee from gods presence  and so he sees by faithand by the highest reason likewisethe spirit of god as a living thinking acting being who quickens and shapes and orders not his mortal body merely but all things giving life law and form to all created things from the heights of heaven to the depths of hell and ready to lead him and hold him if he took the wings of the morning and fled into the uttermost parts of the sea  and so speaks again he who wrote the 104th psalm and the text which i have chosen  to him too the mystery of death and still more the mystery of life could be explained only by faith in god and in the spirit of god  if things died it was because god took away their breath and therefore they returned to their dust  and if things lived it was because the spirit of god breathed forth and proceeding from god gave them life  he pictured to himself i dare to fancy what we may picture to ourselvesfor such places have often been and are now in this worldsome new and barren land even as the very gravel on which we stand was once just risen from the icy sea all waste and lifeless without a growing weed an insect even a moss  then gradually seeds float thither across the sea or are wafted by the winds and grow and after them come insects then birds then trees grow up and larger animals arrive to feed beneath their shade till the once barren land has become fertile and rich with life and the face of the earth is renewed but by what  god says the psalmist has renewed the face of the earth  true the seeds the animals came by natural causes but who was the cause of those causes  who sent the things thither save god  and who gave them life  who kept the life in floating seeds in flying spores  who made that life when they reached the barren shore grow and thrive in each after their kind  who but the spirit of god the lord and giver of life  god let his spirit proceed and go forth from himself upon them and they were made and so he renewed the face of the earth  that my good friends is not only according to scripture but according to true philosophy  men are slow to believe it now and no wonder  they have been always slow to believe in the living god and have made themselves instead dead godsif not of wood and stone still out of their own thoughts and imaginations and talk of laws of nature and long abstractions ending in ation and ality like that evolution with which so many are in love just now and worship them as gods mere words the work of their own brains though not of their own handseven though they beas many of them areevolution i hold among the resttrue and fair approximations to actual laws of god  but before them and behind them and above them and below them lives the author of evolution and of everything else  for god lives and reigns and works for ever  the spirit of god proceedeth from the father and the son giving evolving and ruling the life of all created things and what we call nature and this world and the whole universe is an unfathomable mystery and a perpetual miracle the one author and ruler of which is the everblessed trinity of whom it is writtenthe glorious majesty of the lord shall endure for ever the lord shall rejoice in his works  i believe therefore that the psalmist in the text is speaking not merely sound doctrine but sound philosophy  i believe that the simplest and the most rational account of the mystery of life is that which is given by the christian faith and that the nicene creed speaks truth and fact when it bids us call the holy spirit of god the lord and giver of life  that this is according to the orthodox catholic faith there is no doubt many mistakes were made on this matter in the early times of the church even by most learned and holy divines as was to be expected considering the mysteriousness of the subject  they were inclined often to what is called pantheismthat is to fancy that all living things are parts of god that gods spirit is in them as our soul is in our body or as heat is in a heated matter and to speak of gods spirit as the soul and life of the world  but this is exactly what the nicene creed does not do  it does not say that the holy spirit is life but that he is the lord and giver of lifea seemingly small difference in words but a most vast and important difference in meaning and in truth  the true doctrine it seems to me is laid down most clearly by the famous bishop cyril of alexandria who whatever personal faults he hadand they were manyhad doubtless dialectic intellect enough for this and even deeper questions  and he saysthe holy spirit moves all things that are moved and holds together and animates and makes alive the whole universe  nor is he another nature different from the father and the son but as he is in us of the same nature and the same essence as they  and so says another divine eneas of gazathe father with the son sends forth the holy spirit and inspiring with this spirit all things beyond sense and of senseinvisible and visiblefills them with power and holds them together and draws them to himself  and he prays thus to the holy spirit a prayer which is to my mind as noble as it is trueo holy spirit by whom god inspires and holds together and preserves all things and leads them to perfection  i quote such words to shew you that i am not giving you new fancies of my own but simply what i believe to be the ancient orthodox and honest meaning of that same nicene creed which you just new heard where it says that the holy spirit is the lord and giver of life and the meaning of the 104th psalm also where it saysthou lettest thy breaththy spiritgo forth and they shall be made and thou shall renew the face of the earth  and nowif anyone shall saythis may be all very true  but what is it to me  you are talking about nature about animals and plants and lands and seas  what i come to church to hear of is about my own soul  i should answer such a manmy good friend you come to church to hear about god as well as about what you call your soul  and any sound knowledge which you can learn about god must bebelieve meof use to your immortal soul  for if you have wrong notions concerning god how can you avoid having wrong notions concerning your soul which lives and moves and has its being in god  but look at it thus  at least i have been speaking of the works of god and are not you too a work of god  the lord shall rejoice in his works even to the tiniest gnat that dances in the sun  is the lord rejoicing in you  i have saidwhither shall a man go from gods presence  are you forgetting or remembering gods presence  andwhither shall a man flee from gods spirit  are you o man fleeing from gods spirit and forgetting his gracious inspirations all pure and holy and noble and just and lovely and truly human thoughts in the whirl of pleasure or covetousness or ambition or actual sin  if so look at the tiniest gnat which dances in the air the meanest flower beneath your feet and be ashamed and fear and tremble before the living god and before his spirit  for the gnat and the flower are doing their duty and pleasing the holy spirit of god and you are not doing your duty and are grieving the holy spirit of god  for simply because that spirit is the spirit of god he is a holy spirit who tries to make youo man and not animalholy a moral and spiritual and good being  because you are a moral and spiritual being gods spirit exercises over you a moral power which he does not exercise over the plants and animals  he works not merely on your body and your brain but on your heart and immortal soul but if you choose to be immoral when he is trying to keep you moral if you choose to be carnal like the brutes while he is trying to make you spiritual like jesus christ from whom he proceeds then oh then tremble and beware and be ashamed before the very flowers which grow in your own gardenbed for they fulfil the law which god has given them they are what they ought to be each after its kind  but you are not what you ought to be after your kind which is a good man or a good woman or a good child  oh beware lest the lord should fulfil in you the awful words of this psalm lest he should hide his face from you and you be troubled and lest when he takes away your breath you should die and turn again to your dust and find too late that the wages of sin are deathdeath not merely of the body but of the soul  rather repent and amend and remember that most blessed and yet most awful factthat gods spirit is with you from your baptism until now putting into your heart good desires and ready to enable youif you willto bring those good desires to good effect instead of leaving them only as good intentions with which says the too true proverb hell is paved  so will be fulfilled in you the blessed words of the next versewhen thou lettest thy spirit go forth they shall be made and thou shalt renew the face of the earthwords which st augustine of old applied to the work of gods spirit on the souls of men  for well it is with usas st augustine sayswhen god takes away from us our own spirit the spirit of pride and selfwill and selfrighteousness and we see that we are but dust and ashes worse than the animals in that we have sinned and they have not  confesshe saysthy weakness and thy dust and then listen to what followsthou shalt take away from them their own spirit but thou shalt send forth thy spirit on them and they shall be made and created anew  as the apostle says we are gods own workmanship created in christ jesus unto good works  and sohe saysgod will indeed renew the face of the earth with converted and renewed men who confess that they are not righteous in themselves but made righteous by the grace of the spirit of god and so the lord shall rejoice in his works you will be indeed his work and he will rejoice in you  yes  god will indeed rejoice in us if we obey the godly inspirations of his spirit  but again we shall rejoice in god if we be but led by his spirit into all truth and thence into all righteousness  then we shall be in harmony with god and with the whole universe of god  we shall have our share in that perpetual worship which is celebrated throughout the universe by all creatures rational and irrational who are obeying the laws of their being the laws of the spirit of god the lord and giver of life  we shall take our part in that perpetual hymn which calls on all the works of the lord from angels and powers sun and stars winds and seasons seas and floods trees and flowers beasts and cattle to the children of men and the servants of the lord and the spirits and souls of the righteous and the holy and humble men of hearto all ye works of the lord bless ye the lord praise him and magnify him for ever     sermon xviii  death   psalm civ 20 21     thou makest darkness and it is night wherein all the beasts of the    forest do creep forth  the lions roar after their prey and seek    their meat from god  let me say a few words on this text  it is one which has been a comfort to me again and again  it is one which if rightly understood ought to give comfort to pitiful and tenderhearted persons  have you never been touched by never been even shocked by the mystery of pain and death  i do not speak now of pain and death among human beings but only of that pain and death among the dumb and irrational creatures which from one point of view is more pitiful than pain and death among human beings  for pain suffering and death we know may be of use to human beings it may make them happier and better in this life or in the life to come if they are the christians which they ought to be  but of what use can suffering and death be to dumb animals  how can it make them better in this life and happier in the life to come  it seems in the case of animals to be only so much superfluous misery thrown away  would to god that people would remember that when they unnecessarily torment dumb creatures and then excuse themselves by sayingoh they are not human beings they are not christians and therefore it does not matter so much  i should have thought that therefore it mattered all the more and that just because dumb animals have as far as we know only this mortal life therefore we should allow them the fuller enjoyment of their brief mortality  and yet how much suffering how much violent death there is among animals  how much  the world is full of it and has been full of it for ages  i dare to say that of the millions on millions of living creatures in the earth the air the sea full onehalf live by eating each other  in the sea indeed almost every kind of creature feeds on some other creature and what an amount of pain of terror of violent death that means or seems to mean  we here in a cultivated country are slow to take in this thought  we have not here as in india africa america lion and tiger bear and wolf jaguar and puma perpetually prowling round the farms and taking their tithe of our sheep and cattle  we have never heard as the psalmist had the roar of the lion round the village at night or seen all the animals down to the very dogs crowding together in terror knowing but too well what that roar meant  if we had and had been like the psalmist thoughtful men then it would have been a very solemn question to usfrom whom the lion was asking for his nightly meal whether from god or from some devil as cruel as himself  but even here the same slaughter of animals by animals goes on  the hawk feeds on the small birds the small birds on the insects the insects many of them on each other  even our most delicate and seemingly harmless songsters like the nightingale feed entirely on living creatureseach one of which however small has cost god as much painsif i may so speak in all reverenceto make as the nightingale itself and thus from the top to the bottom of creation is one chain of destruction and pain and death  what is the meaning of it all  ought it to be so or ought it not  is it gods will and law or is it not  that is a solemn question and one which has tried many a thoughtful and tender and virtuous soul ere now both christian and heathen and has driven them to find strange answers to it which have been often enough not according to scripture or to the catholic faith  some used to say in old times and they may say againthis world so full of pain and death is a very illmade world  we will not believe that it was made by the good god  it must have been made by some evil being or at least by some stupid and clumsy beingthe demiurgus they called himor the worldmakersome inferior god whom the good god would conquer and depose and so do away with pain and misery and death  a pardonable mistake but as we are bound to believe a mistake nevertheless  others again good christians and good men likewise have invented another answer to the mysterylike that which milton gives in his paradise lost  they have saidbefore adam fell there was no pain or death in the world  it was only after adams fall that the animals began to destroy and devour each other  ever since then there has been a curse on the earth and this is one of the fruits thereof  now i say distinctly as i have said elsewhere that we are not bound to believe this or anything like it  the book of genesis does not say that the animals began to devour each other at adams fall  it does not even say that the ground is cursed for mans sake now much less the animals for we read in genesis ix 21and the lord said i will not any more curse the ground for mans sake  neither do the psalmists and prophets give the least hint of any such doctrine  surely if we found it anywhere we should find it in this very 104th psalm and somewhere near the very verse which i have taken for my text  but this psalm gives no hint of it  so far from saying that god has cursed his own works or looks on them as cursed it saysthe lord shall rejoice in his works  others will tell us that st paul has said so where he says that by one man sin entered into the world and death by sin  but i must very humbly but very firmly demur to that  st paul shews that when he speaks of the world he means the world of men for he goes on to say and so death passed upon all men in that all have sinned  by mentioning men he excludes the animals he excludes all who have not sinned according to a sound rule of logic which lawyers know well  what st paul meant i believe is most probably this that adam by sinning lost his heavenly birthright and put on the carnal and fleshly likeness of the animals instead of the likeness of god in which he was created and therefore sowing to the flesh of the flesh reaped corruption and became subject to death even as the dumb beasts are  be that as it may we knowas certainly as we can know anything from the use of our own eyes and common sensethat long ages before adam long ages before men existed on this earth the animals destroyed and ate each other even as they are doing now  we know that ages ago in old worlds long before this present world in which we live the seas swarmed with sharks and other monsters who not only died as animals do now but who did devourfor there is actual proof of itother living creatures and that the same process went on on the land likewise  the rocks and soils for miles beneath our feet are one vast graveyard full of the skeletons of creatures almost all unlike any living now who long before the days of adam and still more before the days of noah lived and died generation after generation and sought their meatfrom whomif not from god  yes that last is the answerthe only answer which can give a thoughtful and tenderhearted soul comfort at the sight of so much pain and death on earthin every unknown question to take refuge in god  and that is the answer which the inspired psalmist gives in the 104th psalmthe lions roaring after their prey do seek their meat from god  and if they seek it from god all must be right we know not how but he who made them knows  consider with respect and admiration the manful cheerful view of pain and death and indeed of the whole creation which the psalmist has because he has faith  there is in him no sentimentalism no complaining of god no impious or at least weak and peevish cry of why hast thou made things thus  he sees the mystery of pain and death  he does not attempt to explain it but he faces it faces it cheerfully and manfully in the strength of his faith sayingthis too mysterious painful terrible as it may seem is as it should be for it is of the law and will of god from whom come all good things of the god in whom is light and in him is no darkness at all  therefore to the psalmist the earth is a noble sight filled to his eyes with the fruit of gods works  and so is the great and wide sea likewise  he looks upon it full of things creeping innumerable both small and great beasts for ever dying for ever devouring each other  and yet it does not seem to him a dreadful and a shocking place  what impresses his mind is just what would impress the mind of a modern poet a modern man of science namely the wonderful variety richness and strangeness of its living things  their natures and their names he knows not  it was not given to his race to know  it is enough for him that known unto god are all his works from the foundation of the world  but one thing more important than their natures and their names he does know for he perceives it with the instinct of a true poet and a true philosopherthese all wait upon thee o god that thou mayest give them meat in due season  but morethere go the ships things specially wonderful and significant to him the landsman of the judaean hills as they were afterward to muhammed the landsman of the arabian deserts  and he has talked with sailors from those ships from tarshish and the far atlantic or from eziongeber and the indian seas  and he has heard from them of mightier monsters than his own mediterranean breeds of the leviathan the whale larger than the largest ship which he has ever seen rolling and spouting among the ocean billows far out of sight of land and swallowing at every gape of its huge jaws hundreds of living creatures for its food  but he does not talk of it as a cruel and devouring monster formed by a cruel and destroying deity such as the old canaanites imagined whenso the legend ranthey offered up andromeda to the seamonster upon that very rock at joppa which the psalmist doubtless knew full well  no  this psalm is an inspired philosophers rebuke to that very superstition it is the justification of the noble old greek tale which delivers andromeda by the help of a hero taught by the gods who love to teach mankind  for what strikes the psalmist is again exactly what would strike a modern poet or a modern man of science the strength and ease of the vast beast its enjoyment of its own life and power  it is to him the leviathan whom god has made to play in the sea to take his pastime therein  truly this was a healthyminded man as all will be and only they who have full faith in the one good god of whom are all things both in earth and heaven  then he goes further still  he has looked into the face of life innumerable  now he looks into the face of innumerable death and sees there too the spirit and the work of god     thou givest to them they gather    thou openest thy hand they are filled with good    thou hidest thy face they are troubled    thou takest away their breath they die and are turned again to their    dust  poetry  yes but like all highest poetry highest philosophy and soundest truth likewise  nay he goes further stillfurther it may be than most of us would dare to go had he not gone before us in the courage of his faith  he dares to say of such a world as thisthe glory of the lord shall endure for ever  the lord shall rejoice in his works  the glory of the lord then is shewn forth and endures for ever in these animals of whom the psalmist has been speaking though they devour each other day and night  the lord rejoices in his works even though his works live by each others death  the lord shall rejoice in his workssays this great poet and philosopher  but what lord and what god  ah my friends all depends on the answer to that question  there be says st paul lords many and gods many and since his time men have made fresh lords and gods for themselves and believed in them and worshipped them while they fancied that they were believing in the one true god in the same god in whom the man believed who wrote the 104th psalm  do we truly believe in that one true god father son and holy spirit  let me beg you to consider that question earnestly  the psalmist when he talked of the lord did not mean merely what some people call the deity or the supreme being or the creator  you will remark that i saidwhat  i do not care to say whom of such a notion that is of a god who made the world and set it going once for all but has never meddled with it never so to speak looked at it since so that the world would go on just the same and just as well if god thenceforth had ceased to be  no that is a dead god an absentee godas one said bitterly once  but the psalmist believed in the living god and a present god in whom we live and move and have our being in a god who does not leave the world alone for a moment nor in the smallest matter but is always interested in it attending to it enforcing his own laws workingif i may so speak in all reverenceand using the most pitifully insufficient analogyworkingi sayhis own machinery making all things work together for good at least to those who love god a god without whom not a sparrow falls to the ground and in whose sight all the hairs of our heads are numbered  in one word he believed in a living god  if anyone had said to the psalmist as i have heard men say nowadaysof course we believe with you in a general providence of god over the whole universe  but you do not surely believe in special providences  that would be superstition god governs the world by law and not by special providences  then i believe that the psalmist would have answeredlaws  i believe in them as much as you and perhaps more than you  but as for special providences i believe in them so much that i believe that the whole universe and all that has ever happened in it from the beginning has happened by special providences that not an organic being has assumed its present form after long ages and generations save by a continuous series of special providences that not a weed grows in a particular spot without a special providence of god that it should grow there and nowhere else then and nowhen else  i believe that every step i take every person i meet every thought which comes into my mindwhich is not sinfulcomes and happens by the perpetual special providence of god watching for ever with fatherly care over me and each separate thing that he has made  and if a modern philosopheror one so calledhad said to himthis is unthinkable and inconceivable and therefore cannot be  i cannot think ofi cannot conceive a mindor as i call ita series of states of consciousness as antecedent to the infinity of processes simultaneously going on in all the plants that cover the globe from scattered polar lichens to crowded tropical palms and in all the millions of animals which roam among them and the millions of millions of insects which buzz among themthen the psalmist would have answered him i believeif you cannot my friend i can  and you must not make your power of thought and conception the measure of the universe or even of other mens intellects or saybecause i cannot conceive a thing therefore no man can conceive it and therefore it does not exist  but pray o philosopher if you cannot think and conceive of the omnipresence and omnipotence of god what can you think and conceive  then if that philosopher had answered himas some would nowadaysi can conceive that the properties of very different elementsand therefore the infinite variety and richness of nature which i cannot conceive as caused by a godthat the propertiesi sayof different elements result from differences of arrangement arising by the compounding and recompounding of ultimate homogeneous unitsthen i think the psalmist would have replied as soon as he hadlike socrates of old in a like caserecovered from the dizziness caused by an eloquence so unlike his ownwhy this proposition is far more unthinkable to me and will be to 999 of 1000 of the human race than mine about a god and a providence  alas for the vagaries of the mind of man  when it wants to prove a pet theory of its own it will strain at any gnat and swallow any camel  but againif a philosopher of more reasonable mood had said to himas he very likely would saythis is a grand conception of god but what proof have you of it  how do you know that god does interfere by special providences in the world around us not only as you say perpetually but even now and then and at all  then the psalmist like all true jews would have gone back to a certain old story which is to me the most precious story save one that ever was written on earth and have taken his stand on that  he would have gone backas the scripture always goes backto the story of moses and the israelites in egypt and have saidwhatever i know or do not know about the laws of nature this i knowthat god can use them as he chooses to punish the wicked and to help the miserable  for he did so by my forefathers  when we jews were a poor small despised tribe of slaves in egypt the god who made heaven and earth shewed himself at once the god of nature and the god of grace  for he took the powers of nature and fought with them against proud pharaoh and all his hosts and shewed that they belonged to him and that he could handle them all to do his work  he shewed that he was lord not only of the powers of nature which give life and health but of those which give death and disease  nothing was too grand nor too mean for him to use  he took the lightning and the hail and the pestilence and the darkness and the east wind and the springtides of the red sea and he took also the locustswarms and the frogs and the lice and the loathsome skindiseases of egypt and the microscopic atomies which turn whole rivers into blood and kill the fish and with them he fought against pharaoh the mangod the tyrant ruling at his own will in the name of his father the sungod and of the powers of nature till egypt was destroyed and pharaohs host drowned in the sea and he brought out my forefathers with a mighty hand and an outstretched arm because he had heard their cry in egypt and saw their oppression under cruel taskmasters and pitied them and had mercy on them in their slavery and degradation  that is my godthe old psalmist would have said  not merely a strong god or a wise god but a good god and a gracious god and a just god likewise a god who not only made heaven and earth the sea and all that therein is but who keepeth his promise for ever who helpeth them to right who suffer wrong and feedeth the hungry  yes my friends it is this magnificent conception of gods living and actual goodness and justice which the psalmist had which made him trust god about all the strange and painful things which he saw in the worldabout for instance the suffering and death of animals and sayif the lion roaring after his prey seeks his meat he seeks his meat from god and therefore he ought to seek it and he will find it  it is all well i know not why but well it is for it is the law and will of the good and righteous and gracious god who brought his people out of the land of egypt  and that is enough for me  enough for him and should it not be enough for us and more than enoughwe know what the psalmist knew not  we know god to be more good more righteous more gracious than any prophet or psalmist could know  we know that god so loved the world that he spared not his only begotten son but freely gave him for us  we know that the onlybegotten son jesus christ so loved the world that he stooped to be born and suffer as mortal man and to die on the cross even while he was telling men that not a sparrow fell to the ground without the knowledge of their heavenly father and bidding them see how god fed the birds and clothed the lilies of the field  ah my friends in this case as in all cases rest and comfort for our doubts and fears is to be found in one and the same placeat the foot of the cross of christ  if we believe that he who hung upon that cross isas he isthe maker and ruler of the universe the same from day to day and for ever then we can trust him in darkness as well as in light in doubt as well as in certainty in the face of pain disease and death as well as in the face of joy health and life and saylord we know not but thou knowest  lord we believe help thou our unbelief  make us sure that thou lord shalt save both man and beast  for great are thy mercies o lord and the children of men shall put their trust under the shadow of thy wings  yes my friends this is after all a strange world a solemn world a world full of sad mysteries past our understanding  as was said once by the holiest of modern englishmen now gone home to his restwhose bust stands worthily in yonder chapelthis is a world in which men must be sometimes sad who love god and care for their fellowmen  but it is not over the dumb animals that we must mourn  for they fulfil the laws of their being and whatever meat they seek they seek their meat from god  rather must we mourn over those human beings who being made in the likeness of god and redeemed again into that likeness by our lord jesus christ and baptized into that likeness by the holy spirit put on again of their own will the likeness of the beasts which perish and find too often alas too late that the wages of sin are death  rather must we mourn for those human beings who do not fulfil the laws of their being but break those laws by sin till they are ground by them to powder  rather must we mourn for those who seek their meat not from god but from the world and the flesh and neglect the bread which cometh down from heaven and the meat which endureth to eternal life whereof the lord who gives it saidseek ye first the kingdom of god and his righteousness and all other things shall be added unto you  rather must we pray for ourselves and for all we love that gods spirit of eternal life would raise us up more and more day by day out of the likeness of the old adam who was of the earth earthy of whom it is written thatlike the animalsdust he was and unto dust he must return and would mould us into the likeness of the new adam who is the lord from heaven into the likeness of which it is written that it is created after gods image in righteousness and true holiness the end of which is not death but everlasting life through jesus christ our lord  and so will be fulfilled in us the saying of the psalmist and the lord shall rejoice in his works for we too not only body and soul but spirit also shall be the work of god and god will rejoice in us and we in god     sermon xix  signs and wonders   john iv 4850     then said jesus unto him except ye see signs and wonders ye will not    believe  the nobleman saith unto him sir come down ere my child    die  jesus saith unto him go thy way thy son liveth  these words of our lord are found in the gospel for this day  they are a rebuke though a gentle one  he reproved the nobleman seemingly for his want of faith but he worked the miracle and saved the life of the child  we do not know enough of the circumstances of this case to know exactly why our lord reproved the nobleman and what want of faith he saw in him some think that the mans fault was his mean notion of our lords power his wish that he should come down the hills to capernaum and see the boy himself in order to cure him whereas he ought to have known that our lord could cure himas he didat a distance and by a mere wish which was no less than a command to nature and to that universe which he had made  i cannot tell how this may be but of one thing i think we may be surethat this saying of our lords is very deep and very wide and applies to many people in many timesperhaps to us in these modern times  we must recollect one thingthat our lord did not put forward the mere power of his miracles as the chief sign of his being the son of god  not so he declared his almighty power most chiefly by shewing mercy and pity  twice he refused to give the scribes and pharisees a sign from heaven  an evil and adulterous generation he said seeketh after a sign but there shall be no sign given them but the sign of the prophet jonas  and what was thatbut a warning to repent and mend their ways ere it was too late  now the slightest use of our common sense must tell us that our lord could have given a sign of his almighty power if he had chosen and such a sign as no man even the dullest could have mistaken  what prodigy could he not have performed before scribes and pharisees herod and pontius pilate  thinkest thou he said himself that i cannot now pray to my father and he will send me presently more than twelve legions of angels  yet how did our lord use that miraculous and almighty power of his  sparingly and secretly  sparingly for he used it almost entirely in curing the diseases of poor people and secretly for he used it almost entirely in remote places  jerusalem itself recollect was at best a remote city compared with any of the great cities of the roman empire  and even there he refused to cast himself down from a pinnacle of the temple for a sign and wonder to the jews  if he the lord of the world had meant to convert the world by prodigious miracles he would surely have gone to rome itself the very heart and centre of the civilized world and have shewn such signs and wonders therein as would have made the caesar himself come down from his throne and worship him the lord of all  but no  our lord wished for the obedience not of mens lips but of their hearts  it was their hearts which he wished to win that they might love himand be loyal to himfor the sake of his goodness and not fear and tremble before him for the sake of his power  and therefore he kept so to speak his power in the background and put his goodness foremost only shewing his power in miracles of healing and mercy that so poor neglected oppressed hardworked souls might understand that whoever did not care for them christ their lord did and that their disease and misery were not his will nor the will of his father and their father in heaven  but because also christ was lord of heaven and earth thereforeif i may make so bold as to guess at the reason for anything which he didhe seems to have interfered as little as possible with those regular rules and customs of this world about us which we now call the laws of nature he did not offeras the magicians of his time did offerand as too many have pretended since to doto change the courses of the elements to bring down tempests or thunderbolts to shew prodigies in the heaven above and in the earth beneath  why should he  heaven and earth moon and stars fire and tempest and all the physical forces in the universe were fulfilling his will already doing their work right well according to the law which he had given them from the beginning  he had no need to disturb them no need to disturb the growth of a single flower at his feet  rather he loved to tell men to look at them and see how they went well because his father in heaven cared for them  to tell people to look not at prodigies comets earthquakes and the seeming exceptions of gods rule but at the common regular simple peaceful work of god which is going on around us all day long in every blade of grass and flower and singing bird and sunbeam and shower  to consider the lilies of the field how they grow which toil not neither do they spin and yet i say unto you that solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of theseand the birds of the air they sow not neither reap nor gather into barns and yet your heavenly father feedeth them  how much more will he feed you who can sow and reap and gather into barnso ye of little faith who fancy always that besides sowing and reaping honestly you must covet and cheat and lie and break gods laws instead of obeying them or else forsooth you cannot earn your living  to see that the signs of gods kingdom are not astonishing convulsions terrible catastrophes and disorders but order and peace and usefulness in creatures which are happy because they live according to the law which god has given them and do their dutythat duty of which the great poet of the english church has sung           stern lawgiver  thou yet dost wear             the godheads most benignant grace          nor know we anything so fair             as is the smile upon thy face          flowers laugh before thee on their beds          and fragrance in thy footing treads       thou dost preserve the stars from wrong    and the most ancient heavens through thee are fresh and strong  but men would not believe that in our lords time neither would they believe it after his time  will they believe it even now  they craved after signs and wonders they saw gods hand not in the common sights of this beautiful world not in seedtime and harvest summer and winter not in the blossoming of flowers and the song of birds but only in strange portents absurd and lying miracles which they pretended had happened because they fancied that they ought to have happened and so built up a whole literature of unreason which remains to this day a doleful monument of human folly and superstition  but is not this too true of some at least of us in this very day  must not people now see signs and wonders before they believe in god  do they not consider whatever is strange and inexplicable as coming immediately from god  while whatever they are accustomed to or fancy that they can explain they consider comes in what they call the course of nature without gods having anything to do with it  if a man drops down dead they say he died by the hand of god or by the visitation of god as if any created thing or being could die or live either save by the will and presence of god as if a sparrow could fall to the ground without our fathers knowledge  but so it is because mens hearts are far from god  if an earthquake swallowed up half london this very day how many would be ready to cry here is a visitation of god  here is the immediate hand of god  perhaps christ is coming and the end of the world at hand  and yet they will not see the true visitation the immediate hand of god in every drop of rain which comes down from heaven and returneth not again void but gives seed to the sower and bread to the eater  but so it always has been  men used to see god and his power and glory almost exclusively in comets auroras earthquakes  it was not so very long ago that the birth of monstrous or misshapen animals and all other prodigies as they were called were carefully noted down and talked of far and wide as signs of gods anger presages of some coming calamityatheists while they are in safety superstitious when they are in dangerrequiring signs and wonders to make them believeinterested only in what is uncommon and seems to break gods lawscareless about what is common and far more wonderful because it fulfils gods lawssuch have most men been for ages and will be perhaps to the end shewing themselves in that respect carnal and no wiser than dumb animals  for it is carnal animal and brutish and a sign of want of true civilization as well as of true faith only to be interested and surprised by what is strange like dumb beasts who if they see anything new are attracted by it and frightened by it at the same time but who when once they are accustomed to it and have found out that it will do them no harm are too stupid to feel any curiosity or interest about it though it were the most beautiful or the most wonderful object on earth  but i will tell you of a man after gods own heart who was not like the dumb animals nor like the ungodly and superstitious because he was taught by the spirit of god and spoke by the spirit of god  one who saw no signs and wonders and yet believed in godnamely the man who wrote the 139th psalm  he needed no prodigies to make him believe  the thought of his own body how fearfully and wonderfully it was made was enough to make him do that  he looked on the perfect order and law which ruled over the development of his own organization and saidi will praise thee  for i am fearfully and wonderfully made  marvellous are thy works and that my soul knoweth right well  thine eyes did see my substance yet being imperfect and in thy book were all my members written which day by day were fashioned when as yet there was none of them  how dear are thy counsels unto me o god how great is the sum of them  and i will tell you of another man who needed no signs and wonders to make him believethe man namely who wrote the 19th psalm  he looked upon the perfect order and law of the heavens over his head and the mere sight of the sun and moon and stars was enough for him and he saidthe heavens declare the glory of god the firmament sheweth his handywork one day telleth another and one night certifieth another  there is neither speech nor language where their voice is not heard among them  and i will tell you of yet another man who needed no signs and wonders to make him believenamely the man who wrote the 104th psalm  he looked on the perfect order and law of the world about his feet and saido lord how manifold are thy works  in wisdom hast thou made them all the earth is full of thy riches  so is the great and wide sea also wherein are things creeping innumerable both small and great beasts  these all wait upon thee that thou mayest give them their meat in due season  thou givest to them they gather  thou openest thy hand they are filled with good  thou hidest thy face they are troubled  thou takest away their breath they die and return to their dust  thou sendest forth thy breath they are created and thou renewest the face of the earth  the glory of the lord shall endure for ever  the lord shall rejoice in his works  my friends let us all pray to god and to christ that they will put into our hearts the spirit by which those psalms were written that they will take from us the evil heart of unbelief which must needs have signs and wonders and forgets that in god we live and move and have our being  for are we not alleven the very best of usapt to tempt our lord in this very matter  when all things go on in a commonplace way with usthat is in this wellmade world comfortably easily prosperouslyhow apt we all aregod forgive usto forget god  how we forget that on him we depend for every breath we draw that christ is guarding us daily from a hundred dangers a hundred sorrows it may be from a hundred disgraces of which we in our own selfsatisfied blindness never dream  how dull our prayers become and how short  we almost think at times that there is no use in praying for we get all we want without asking for it in what we choose to call the course of circumstances and naturegod forgive us indeed  but when sorrow comes anxiety danger how changed we are all of a sudden  how gracious we are when pangs come upon uslike the wicked queenmother in jerusalem of old when the invaders drove her out of her cedar palace  how we cry to the lord then and get us to our god right humbly  then indeed we feel the need of prayer  then we try to wrestle with god and cry to himand what else can we dolike children lost in the dark entreat him if there be mercy in himas there is in spite of all our follyto grant some special providence to give us some answer to our bitter entreaties  if he will but do for us this one thing then we will believe indeed  then we will trust him obey him serve him as we never did before  ah if there were in christ any touch of pride or malice  ah if there were in christ aught but a magnanimity and a generosity altogether boundless  ah if he were to deal with us as we have dealt with him  ah if he were to deal with us after our sins and reward us according to our iniquities  if he refused to hear us if he said to usyou forgot me in your prosperity why should i not forget you in your adversitywhat could we answer  would that answer not be just  would it not be deserved however terrible  but our hope and trust is that he will not answer us so because he is not our god only but our saviour that he will deal with us as one who seeks and saves that which is lost whether it knows that it is lost or not  our hope is that the lord is very pitiful and of tender mercy that because he is man as well as god he can be touched with the feeling of our infirmities that he knoweth our frame he remembereth of what we are made else the spirit would fail before him and the souls which he has made  so we can have hope that though christ rebuke us he will yet hear us if our prayers are reasonable and therefore according to his will  and surely surely surely if our prayers are for the improvement of any human being if we are praying that we or any human being may be made better men and truer christians at last and saved from the temptations of the world the flesh and the deviloh then then shall we not be heard  the lord may keep us long waiting as he kept st monica of old when she wept over st augustines youthful sins and follies  but he may answer us as he answered her by the good bishopbe of good cheer  it is impossible that the son of so many prayers should perish and so though he may shame us in our inmost heart by the rebukeexcept ye see signs and wonders ye will not believehe will in the same breath grant our prayer undeserved though his condescension be and saygo in peace thy son liveth     sermon xx  the judgments of god   luke xiii 15     there were present at that season some that told him of the galilaeans    whose blood pilate had mingled with their sacrifices  and jesus    answering said unto them suppose ye that these galilaeans were    sinners above all the galilaeans because they suffered such things  i    tell you nay but except ye repent ye shall all likewise perish  or    those eighteen upon whom the tower in siloam fell and slew them    think ye that they were sinners above all men that dwelt in jerusalem    i tell you nay but except ye repent ye shall all likewise perish  this story is often used it seems to me for a purpose exactly opposite to that for which it is told  it is said that because these galilaeans whom pilate slew and these eighteen on whom the tower in siloam fell were no worse than the people round them that therefore similar calamities must not be considered judgments and punishments of god that it is an offence against christian charity to say that such sufferers are the objects of gods anger that it is an offence against good manners to introduce the name of god or the theory of a divine providence in speaking of historical events  they must be ascribed to certain brute forces of nature to certain inevitable laws of history to the passions of men to chance to fate to anything and everything rather than to the will of god  no man disagrees more utterly than i do with the latter part of this language  but i cannot be astonished at its popularity  it cannot be denied that the theory of a divine providence has been much misstated that the doctrine of final causes has been much abused that in plain english gods name has been too often taken in vain about calamities private and public  rational men of the world therefore may be excused for begging at times not to hear any more of divine providence excused for doubting the existence of final causes excused for shrinking whenever they hear a preacher begin to interpret the will of god about this event or that  they dread a repetition of the mistaketo call it by the very gentlest termwhich priests in all ages have been but too ready to commit  for all priesthoodswhether heathen or christian whether calling themselves priests or merely ministers and preachershave been in all ages tempted to talk as if divine providence was exercised solely on their behalf in favour of their class their needs their health and comfort as if the thunders of jove never fell save when the priesthood needed i had almost said commanded them  thus they have too often arrogated to themselves a right to define who was cursed by god which has too soon again and again degenerated into a right to curse men in gods name while they have too often taught men to believe only in a providence who interfered now and then on behalf of certain favoured persons instead of a providence who rules always and everywhere over all mankind  but men have again and again reversed their judgments  they have had to saythe facts are against you  you prophesied destruction to such and such persons and behold they have not been destroyed but live and thrive  you said that such and such persons calamities were a proof of gods anger for their sins  we find them on the contrary to have been innocent and virtuous persons often martyrs for truth for humanity for god  the facts we say are against you  if there be a providence it is not such as you describe  if there be judgments of god you have not found out the laws by which he judges and rather than believe in your theory of providence your theory of judgments we will believe in none  thus in age after age in land after land has fanaticism and bigotry brought forth by a natural revulsion its usual fruit of unbelief  butlet men believe or disbelieve as they choosethe warning of the psalmist still stands truebe wise  take heed ye unwise among the people  he that nurtureth the heathen it is he that teacheth man knowledge shall he not punish  for as surely as there is a god so surely does that god judge the earth and every individual family institution and nation on the face thereof and judge them all in righteousness by his son jesus christ whom he hath appointed heir of all things and given him all power in heaven and earth who reigns and will reign till he hath put all enemies under his feet  this is the good news of advent  and therefore it is well that in advent if we believe that christ is ruling us we should look somewhat into the laws of his kingdom as far as he has revealed them to us and among others into the law whichas i thinkhe laid down in the text  now i beg you to remark that the text taken fully and fairly means the very opposite to that popular notion of which i spoke in the beginning of my sermon  our lord does not saythose galilaeans were not sinners at all  their sins had nothing to do with their death  those on whom the tower fell were innocent men  he rather implies the very opposite  we know nothing of the circumstances of either calamity but this we knowthat our lord warned the rest of the jews that unless they repentedthat is changed their mind and therefore their conduct they would all perish in the same way  and we know that that warning was fulfilled within forty years so hideously and so awfully that the destruction of jerusalem remains as one of the most terrible cases of wholesale ruin and horror recorded in history andas i believea key to many a calamity before and since  like the taking of babylon the fall of rome and the french revolution it stands out in lurid splendour as of the nether pit itself forcing all who believe to say in fear and tremblingverily there is a god that judgeth the earthand a warning to every man class institution and nation on earth to set their houses in order betimes and bear fruit meet for repentance lest the day come when they too shall be weighed in the balance of gods eternal justice and found wanting  but another lesson we may learn from the text which i wish to impress earnestly on your minds  these galilaeans it seems were no worse than the other galilaeans yet they were singled out as examples as warnings to the rest  believingas i dothat our lord was always teaching the universal through the particular and in each parable nay in each comment on passing events laying down worldwide laws of his own kingdom enduring through all timei presume that this also is one of the laws of the kingdom of god  and i think that factsto which after all is the only safe appealprove that it is so that we see the same law at work around us every day  i think that pestilences conflagrations accidents of any kind which destroy life wholesale even earthquakes and storms are instances of this law warnings from god judgments of god in the very strictest sense by which he tells men in a voice awful enough to the few but merciful and beneficent to the many to be prudent and wise to learn henceforth either not to interfere with the physical laws of his universe or to master and to wield them by reason and by science  i would gladly say more on this point did time allow but i had rather now ask you to consider whether this same law does not reveal itself throughout history in many great national changes or even calamities and in the fall of many an ancient and timehonoured institution  i believe that the law does reveal itself and in forms which rightly studied may at once teach us christian charity and give us faith and comfort as we see that god however severe is still just  i mean thisthe more we read in history of the fall of great dynasties or of the ruin of whole classes or whole nations the more we feelhowever much we may acquiesce with the judgment as a wholesympathy with the fallen  it is not the worst but often the best specimens of a class or of a system who are swallowed up by the moral earthquake which has been accumulating its forces perhaps for centuries  innocent and estimable on the whole as persons they are involved in the ruin which falls on the system to which they belong  so far from being sinners above all around them they are often better people than those around them  it is as if they were punished not for being who they were but for being what they were  history is full of such instances instances of which we say and cannot help sayingwhat have they done above all others that on them above all others the thunderbolt should fall  was charles the first for example the worst or the best of the stuarts and louis the sixteenth of the bourbons  look again at the fate of sir thomas more bishop fisher and the hapless monks of the charterhouse  were they sinners above all who upheld the romish system in england  were they not rather among the righteous men who ought to have saved it if it could have been saved  and yet on themthe purest and the holiest of their partyand not on hypocrites and profligates fell the thunderbolt  what is the meaning of these thingsfor a meaning there must be and we i dare to believe must be meant to discover it for we are the children of god into whose hearts because we are human beings and not mere animals he has implanted the inextinguishable longing to ascertain final causes to seek not merely the means of things but the reason of things to ask not merely how but why  may not the reason bei speak with all timidity and reverence as one who shrinks from pretending to thrust himself into the counsels of the almightybut may not the reason be that god has wished thereby to condemn not the persons but the systems  that he has punished them not for their private but for their public faults  it is not the men who are judged it is the state of things which they represent and for that very reason may not god have made an example a warning not of the worst but of the very best specimens of a doomed class or system which has been weighed in his balance and found wanting  therefore we need not suppose that these sufferers themselves were the objects of gods wrath  we may believe that of them too stands true the great law whom the lord loveth he chasteneth and scourgeth every son whom he receiveth  we may believe that of them too stands true st pauls great parable in 1 cor xii which though a parable is the expression of a perpetually active law  they have built it may be on the true foundation but they have built on it wood hay stubble instead of gold and precious stone  and the fire of god which burns for ever against the falsehoods and follies of the world has tried their work and it is burned and lost  but they themselves are saved yet as through fire  looking at history in this light we may justify god for many a heavy blow and fearful judgment which seems to the unbeliever a wanton cruelty of chance or fate while at the same time we may feel deep sympathy withoften deep admiration formany a noble spirit who has been defeated and justly defeated by those irreversible laws of gods kingdom of which it is writtenon whomsoever that stone shall fall it will grind him to powder  we may look with reverence as well as pity on many figures in history such as sir thomas mores on persons who placed by no fault of their own in some unnatural and unrighteous position involved in some decaying and unworkable system conscious more or less of their false position conscious too of coming danger have done their best according to their light to work like men before the night came in which no man could work to do what of their duty seemed still plain and possible and to set right that which would never come right more forgetting that alas the crooked cannot be made straight and that which is wanting cannot be numbered till the flood came and swept them away standing bravely to the last at a post long since untenable but stillall honour to themstanding at their post  when we consider such sad figures on the page of history we may have i say all respect for their private virtues  we may accept every excuse for their public mistakes  and yet we may feel a solemn satisfaction at their downfall when we see it to have been necessary for the progress of mankind and according to those laws and that will of god and of christ by which alone the human race is ruled  we may look back on old orders of things with admiration even with a touch of pardonable though sentimental regret  but we shall not forget that the old order changes giving place to the new     and god fulfils himself in many ways    lest one good custom should corrupt the world  and we shall believe too if we be wise that all these things were written for our example that we may see and fear and be turned to the lord each asking himself solemnly what is the system on which i am governing my actions  is it according to the laws and will of god as revealed in facts  let me discover that in time lest when it becomes bankrupt in gods books i be involvedi cannot guess how farin the common ruin of my compeers  what is my duty  let me go and work at it lest a night come in which i cannot work  what fruit am i expected to bring forth  let me train and cultivate my mind heart whole humanity to bring it forth lest the great husbandman come seeking fruit on me and find none  and if i see a man who falls in the battle of life let me not count him a worse sinner than myself but let me judge myself in fear and trembling lest god judge me and i perish in like wise     sermon xxi  the war in heaven   rev xix 1116     and i saw heaven opened and behold a white horse and he that sat    upon him was called faithful and true and in righteousness he doth    judge and make war  his eyes were as a flame of fire and on his head    were many crowns and he had a name written that no man knew but he    himself  and he was clothed with a vesture dipped in blood and his    name is called the word of god  and the armies which were in heaven    followed him upon white horses clothed in fine linen white and    clean  and out of his mouth goeth a sharp sword that with it he    should smite the nations and he shall rule them with a rod of iron    and he treadeth the winepress of the fierceness and wrath of almighty    god  and he hath on his vesture and on his thigh a name written king    of kings and lord of lords  let me ask you to consider seriously this noble passage  it was never more worth mens while to consider it than now when various selfish and sentimental religionscall them rather superstitionshave made men altogether forget the awful reality of christs kingdom the awful fact that christ reigns and will reign till he has put all enemies under his feet  who then is he of whom the text speaks  who is this personage who appears eternally in heaven as a warrior with his garments stained with blood the leader of armies smiting the nations and ruling them with a rod of iron  st john tells us that he had one name which none knew save himself  but he tells us that he was called faithful and true and he tells us too that he had another name which st john did know and that is the word of god  now who the word of god is all are bound to know who call themselves christians even jesus christ our lord who was born of the virgin mary crucified under pontius pilate rose again the third day ascended into heaven and sitteth at the right hand of god  he it is who makes everlasting war as king of kings and lord of lords but against what does he make war  his name tells us that  for it isfaithful and true and therefore he makes war against all things and beings who are unfaithful and false  he himself is full of chivalry full of fidelity and therefore all that is unchivalrous and treacherous is hateful in his eyes and that which he hates he is both able and willing to destroy  moreover he makes war in righteousness  and therefore all men and things which are unrighteous and unjust are on the opposite side to him his enemies which he will trample under his feet  the only hope for them and indeed for all mankind is that he does make war in righteousness and that he himself is faithful and true whoever else is not that he is always just always fair always honourable and courteous that he always keeps his word and governs according to fixed and certain laws which men may observe and calculate upon and shape their conduct accordingly sure that christs laws will not change for any soul on earth or in heaven  but within those honourable and courteous conditions he will as often as he sees fit smite the nations and rule them with a rod of iron and tread the winepress of the fierceness and wrath of almighty god  and if any sayas too many in these luxurious unbelieving days will saywhat words are these  threatening terrible cruel  my answer isthe words are not mine  i did not put them into the bible  i find them there and thousands like them in the new testament as well as in the old in the gospels and epistles as well as in the revelation of st john  if you do not like them your quarrel must be not with me but with the whole bible and especially with st john the apostle who saidlittle children love one another and who therefore was likely to have as much love and pity in his heart as any philanthropic or sentimental or superstitious or bigoted personage of modern days  and if any one saybut you must mistake the meaning of the text  it must be understood spiritually  the meek and gentle jesus who is nothing but love and mercy cannot be such an awful and destroying being as you would make him out to be  then i must answerthat our lord was meek and gentle when on earth and therefore is meek and gentle for ever and ever there can be no doubt  i am meek and lowly of heart he said of himself  but with that meekness and lowliness and not in contradiction to it there was when he was upon earth and therefore there is now and for ever a burning indignation against all wrong and falsehood and especially against that worst form of falsehoodhypocrisy and that worst form of hypocrisycovetousness which shelters itself under religion  when our lord saw men buying and selling in the temple he made a scourge of cords and drove them out and overthrew the tables of the moneychangers and saidit is written my fathers house is a house of prayer but ye have made it a den of thieves  when he faced the pharisees who were covetous he had no meek and gentle words for them but ye serpents ye generation of vipers how can ye escape the damnation of hell  and because his character is perfect and eternal because he is the same yesterday today and for ever we are bound by the christian faith to believe that he has now and will have for ever the same divine indignation against wrong the same determination to put it down and to cast out of his kingdom which is simply the whole universe all that offends and whosoever loveth and maketh a lie  and if any say as some say nowadaysah but you cannot suppose that our lord would propagate his gospel by the sword or wish christians to do so  my friends this chapter and this sermon has nothing to do with the propagation of the gospel in the popular sense nothing to do with converting heathens or others to christianity  it has to do with that awful government of the world of which the bible preaches from beginning to end that moral and providential kingdom of god which rules over the destiny of every kingdom every nation every tribe every family nay over the destiny of each human being ay of each horde of tartars on the furthest siberian steppe and each group of savages in the furthest island of the pacific rendering to each man according to his works rewarding the good punishing the bad and exterminating evildoers even wholesale and seemingly without discrimination when the measure of their iniquity is full  christs herald in this noble chapter calls men not to repentance but to inevitable doom  his angelhis messengerstands in the sun the source of light and life above this petty planet its fashions its politics its sentimentalities its notions of how the universe ought to have been made and managed and calls to whomto all the fowl that fly in the firmament of heavencome and gather yourselves together to the feast of the great god that ye may eat the flesh of kings and of captains and of mighty men and the flesh of horses and of them that sit on them and the flesh of all men both free and slave both small and great  what those awful words may mean i cannot say  but this i say that the apostle would never have used such words conveying so plain and so terrible a meaning to anyone who has ever seen or heard of a battlefield if he had really meant by them nothing like a battlefield at all  it may be that these words have fulfilled themselves many timesat the fall of jerusalemat the wars which convulsed the roman empire during the first century after christat the final fall of the roman empire before the lances of our german ancestorsin many another great war and national calamity in many a land since then  it may be too that as learned divines have thought they will have their complete fulfilment in some war of all wars some battle of all battles in which all the powers of evil and all those who love a lie shall be arrayed against all the powers of good and all those who fear god and keep his commandments to fight it out if the controversy can be settled by no reason no persuasion a battle in which the whole world shall discover that even in an appeal to brute force the good are stronger than the bad because they have moral force also on their side because god and the laws of his whole universe are fighting for them against those who transgress law and outrage reason  the wisest of living britons has saidinfinite pity yet infinite rigour of law  it is so that the world is made  i should add it is so the world must be made because it is made by jesus christ our lord and its laws are the likeness of his character pitiful because christ is pitiful and rigorous because he is rigorous  so pitiful is christ that he did not hesitate to be slain for men that mankind through him might be saved  but so rigorous is christ that he does not hesitate to slay men if needful that mankind thereby may be saved  war and bloodshed pestilence and famine earthquake and tempestall of them as sure as there is a god are the servants of god doing his awful but necessary work for the final benefit of the whole human race  it may be difficult to believe this at least to believe it with the same intense faith with which prophets and apostles of old believed it and criedwhen thy judgments o lord are abroad in the earth then shall the inhabitants of the world learn righteousness  but we must believe it or we shall be driven to believe in no god at all and that will be worse for us than all the evil that has happened to us from our youth up until now  but most people find it very difficult to believe in such a god as the scripture sets fortha god of boundless tenderness and yet a god of boundless indignation  the covetous and luxurious find it very difficult to understand such a being  their usual notion of tenderness is a selfish dislike of seeing any one else uncomfortable because it makes them uncomfortable likewise their usual notion of indignation is a selfish desire of revenge against anyone who interferes with their comfort  and therefore they have no wholesome indignation against wrong and wrongdoers and a great deal of unwholesome tenderness for them  they are afraid of any ones being punished probably from a fellowfeeling a suspicion that they deserve to be punished themselves  they hate and dread honest severity and stern exercise of lawful power  they are indulgent to the bad severe upon the good till as has been bitterly but too truly saidpublic opinion will allow a man to do anything except his duty  now this is a humour which cannot last  it breeds weakness anarchy and at last ruin to society  and then the effeminate and luxurious terrified for their money and their comfort fly from an unwholesome tenderness to an unwholesome indignation break out into a panic of selfish rage and become as cowards are apt to do blindly and wantonly cruel and those who fancied god too indulgent to punish his enemies will be the very first to punish their own  but there are those left i thank god in this land who have a clear understanding of what they ought to be and an honest desire to be it who know that a manful indignation against wrongdoing a hearty hatred of falsehood and meanness a rigorous determination to do their duty at all risks and to repress evil with all severity may dwell in the same heart with gentleness forgiveness tenderness to women and children active pity to the weak the sick the homeless and courtesy to all mankind even to their enemies  god grant that that spirit may remain alive among us  for without it we shall not long be a strong nation not indeed long a nation at all  and it is alive among us  not that we any of us have enough of itgod forgive us for all our shortcomings  and god grant it may remain alive among us for it is as far as it goes the likeness of christ the maker and ruler of the world  christian said a great genius and a great divine     if thou wouldst learn to love    thou first must learn to hate  and if any one answerhate  even god hateth nothing that he has made the rejoinder isand for that very reason god hates evil because he has not made it and it is ruinous to all that he has made  go you and do likewise  hate what is wrong with all your heart and mind and soul and strength  for so and so only you will shew that you love god with all your heart and mind and soul and strength likewise  oh prayand that not once for all merely but day by day ay almost hour by hourstrengthen me o lord to hate what thou hatest and love what thou lovest and therefore whenever i see an opportunity to put down what thou hatest and to help what thou lovestthat so at the last dread day when every man shall be rewarded according to his works you may have some answer to give to the awful questionon whose side wert thou in the battle of life  on the side of good men and of god or on the side of bad men and the devil  lest you find yourselves forced to replyas too many will be forcedwith surprise and something like shame and confusion of facei really do not know  i never thought about the matter at all  i never knew that there was any battle of life  never knew that there was any battle of life  and yet you were christened and signed with the sign of the cross in token that you should fight manfully under christs banner against sin the world and the devil and continue christs faithful soldier and servant to your lifes end  did it never occur to you that those words might possibly mean something  and you used to sing hymns too on earth about soldiers of christ arise and put your armour on  what prophets and apostles and martyrs and confessors meant by those words you should know well enough  did it never occur to you that they might possibly mean something to you  that as long as the world was no better than it is there was still a battle of life and that you too were sworn to fight in it  how many will answeryesyesbut i thought that these words only meant having my soul saved and going to heaven when i died and how did you expect to do that  by believing certain doctrines which you were told were true and leading a tolerably respectable life without which you would not have been received into society  was that all which was needed to go to heaven  and was that all that was meant by fighting manfully under christs banner against sin the world and the devil  why cyrus and his old persians 2400 years ago were nearer to the kingdom of god than that  they had a clearer notion of what the battle of life meant than that when they said that not only the man who did a merciful or just deed but the man who drained a swamp tilled a field made any little corner of the earth somewhat better than he found it was fighting against ahriman the evil spirit of darkness on the side of ormuzd the good god of light and that as he had taken his part in ormuzds battle he should share in ormuzds triumph  oh be at least able to say in that daylord i am no hero  i have been careless cowardly sometimes all but mutinous  punishment i have deserved i deny it not  but a traitor i have never been a deserter i have never been  i have tried to fight on thy side in thy battle against evil  i have tried to do the duty which lay nearest me and to leave whatever thou didst commit to my charge a little better than i found it i have not been good but i have at least tried to be good  i have not done good it may be either but i have at least tried to do good  take the will for the deed good lord  accept the partial selfsacrifice which thou didst inspire for the sake of the one perfect selfsacrifice which thou didst fulfil upon the cross  pardon my faults out of thine own boundless pity for human weakness  strike not my unworthy name off the rollcall of the noble and victorious army which is the blessed company of all faithful people and let me too be found written in the book of life even though i stand the lowest and last upon its list amen     sermon xxii  noble company   hebrews xii 22 23     ye are come to the city of the living god and to the spirits of just    men made perfect  i have quoted only part of the passage of scripture in which these words occur  if you want a good employment for all saints day read the whole passage the whole chapter and no less the 11th chapter which comes before it so will you understand better the meaning of all saints day but sufficient for the day is the good thereof as well as the evil and the good which i have to say this morning isyou are come to the spirits of just men made perfect for this is all saints day  into the presence of this noble company we have come even nobler company remember than that which was spoken of in the text  for more than 1800 years have passed since the epistle to the hebrews was written and how many thousands of just men and women pure noble tender wise beneficent have graced the earth since then and left their mark upon mankind and helped forward the hallowing of our heavenly fathers name the coming of his kingdom the doing of his will on earth as it is done in heaven and helped therefore to abolish the superstition the misrule the vice and therefore the misery of this struggling moaning world  how many such has christ sent on this earth during the last 1800 years  how many before that before his own coming for many a century and age  we know not and we need not know  the records of holy scripture and of history strike with light an isolated mountain peak or group of peaks here and here through the ages but between and beyond all is dark to us now  but it may not have been dark always  scripture and history likewise hint to us of great hills far away once brilliant in the one true sunshine which comes from god now shrouded in the mist of ages or literally turned away beyond our horizon by the revolution of our planet and of lesser hills too once bright and green and fair giving pasture to lonely flocks sending down fertilizing streams into now forgotten valleys themselves all but forgotten now save by the god who made and blessed them  yes many a holy soul many a useful soul many a saint who is now at gods right hand has lived and worked and been a blessing himself blest of whom the world and even the church has never heard who will never be seen or known again till the day in which the lord counteth up his jewels  let us rejoice in that thought on this day above all days in the year on this day we give special thanks to god for all his servants departed this life in his faith and fear  let us rejoice in the thought that we know not how many they are only that they are an innumerable company out of all tongues and nations whom no man can number  let us rejoice that christs grace is richer and not poorer than our weak imaginations can conceive or our narrow systems account for  let us rejoice that the goodly company in whose presence we stand can be limited and defined by no mortal man or school of men but only by him from whom with the father proceeds for ever the holy spirit the inspirer of all good and who said of that spiritthe wind bloweth where it listeth and thou hearest the sound thereof but canst not tell whence it cometh and whither it goeth  so is every one who is born of the spiritand who said again john came neither eating nor drinking and ye said he hath a devil  the son of man came eating and drinking and ye say behold a man gluttonous and a winebibber a friend of publicans and sinners  but i say unto you verily wisdom is justified of all her childrenand who said againwhen john said to him master we saw one casting out devils in thy name and he followeth not usforbid him not  for i say to you that he that doeth a miracle in my name will not lightly speak evil of meand who said lastlyand most awfullythat the unpardonable sin either in this life or the life to come was to attribute beneficent deeds to a bad origin because they were performed by one who differed from us in opinion and to say he casteth out devils by beelzebub prince of the devils  these are words of our lord which we are specially bound to keep in our minds with reverence and godly fear on all saints day lest by arranging our calendar of saints according to our own notions of who ought to be a saint and who ought notthat is who agrees with our notions of perfection and who does notwe exclude ourselves by fastidiousness from much unquestionably good company and possibly mix ourselves up with not a little which is to say the least questionable  men in all ages churchmen or others have fallen into this mistake  they have been but too ready to limit their calendar of saints to narrow the thanksgivings which they offer to god on all saints day  the romish church has been especially faulty on this point  it has assumed as necessary preliminaries for saintshipat least after the christian erathe practice of or at least the longing after celibacy and after the separation of the eastern and western churches unconditional submission to the church of rome  but how has this injured if not spoiled their exclusive calendar of saints  amid apostles martyrs divines who must be always looked on as among the very heroes and heroines of humanity we find more than one fanatic persecutor more than two or three clearly insane personages and too many who all but justify the terrible sneerthat the romish calendar is the pantheon of hysteria  and protestants toohow have they narrowed the number of the spirits of just men made perfect and confined the paean which should go up from the human race on all saints day till a saint has too often meant with them only a person who has gone through certain emotional experiences and assented to certain subjective formulas neither of which according to the opinion of some of the soundest divines both of the romish greek and anglican communions are to be found in the letter of scripture as necessary to salvation and who have moreover finished their coursedoubtless often a holy beneficent and beautiful courseby a rapturous deathbed scene which is more rare in the actual experience of clergymen and indeed in the conscience and experience of human beings in general than in the imaginations of the writers of religious romances  but we of the church of england as by law establishedand i recognize and obey and shall hereafter recognize and obey no otherhave no need so to narrow our all saints day our joy in all that is noble and good which man has said or done in any age or clime  we have no need to define where formularies have not defined to shut where they have opened to curse where they either bless or are humbly charitably and therefore divinely silent  with a magnificent faith in the justice of the father and in the grace of christ and in the inspiration of the holy spirit our church bids usjudge not the dead lest ye be judged condemn not the dead lest ye be condemned  for she bids us commit to the earth the corpses of all who die not unbaptized excommunicate or wilful suicides and who are willing to lie in our consecrated ground giving thanks to god that our dear brother has been delivered from the miseries of this sinful world and in sure and certain hope of the resurrection to eternal life  at least we of the abbey of westminster have a right to hold this for we thank god act on it and have acted on it for many a year  we have a right to our wide free charitable and truly catholic conception of all saints day  ay if we did not use our right these walls would use it for us and in us would our lords words be fulfilledif we were silent the very stones beneath our feet would cry out  for hither we gather as far as is permitted us and hither we gather proudly the mortal dust of every noble soul who has done good work for the british nation accepting each and all of them as gifts from the father of lights from whom proceedeth every good and perfect gift as sent to this nation by that lord jesus christ who is the king of all the nations upon earth and acknowledgingfor fear of falling into that pelagian heresy which is too near the heart of every living manthat all wise words which they have spoken all noble deeds which they have done have come must have come from the one eternal source of wisdom of nobleness of every form of good even from the holy spirit of god  we make no severe or minute inquiries here  we leave them if they must be made to god the judge of all things and christ who knows the secrets of the hearts to him who is merciful in this that he rewardeth every man according to his works  all we ask isand all we dare askof divine or statesman poet or warrior musician or engineerof dryden or of handelof isaac watts or of charles dickensbut why go on with the splendid diversities of the splendid cataloguewhat was your work  did we admire you for it  did we love you for it  and why  because you made us in some way or other better men  because you helped us somewhat toward whatsoever things are pure true just honourable of good report  because if there was any virtuethat is true valour and manhood if there was any praisethat is just honour in the sight of men and therefore surely in the sight of the son of man who died for men you helped us to think on such things you in one word helped to make us better men  welcome then friends unknownand alas friends known and loved and lostwelcome into englands pantheon not of superstitious and selfish hysteria but of beneficent and healthy manhood  your words and your achievements have gone out into all lands and your sound unto the ends of the world and let them go and prosper in that for which the lord of man has sent them  our duty is to guard your sacred dust  our duty is to point out your busts your monuments around these ancient walls to all who come of every race and creed as proofs that the ancient spirit is not dead that christ has not deserted the nation of england while he sends into it such men as you that christ has not deserted the church of england while he gives her grace to recognize and honour such men as you and to pray christ that he would keep up the sacred succession of virtue talent beneficence patriotism and make us most unworthy at last worthy one at least here and there of the noble dead above whose dust we now serve god  yes so ought we in westminster to keep our all saints day in giving thanks to god for the spirits of just men made perfect  not only for those just men and women innumerable whoas i said at firsthave graced this earth during the long ages of the past but specially for those who lie around us here with whom we can enter and have entered already often into spiritual communion closer than that almost of child with parent whose writings we can read whose deeds we can admire whose virtues we can copy and to whom we owe a debt of gratitude we and our children after us which never can be repaid  and if ever the thought comes over usbut these men had their faults mistakesoh what of that     nothing is left of them    now but pure manly  let us think of them not as they were compassed round with infirmitiesas who is notknowing in part and seeing in part as st paul himself in the zenith of his inspiration said that he knew and saw as through a glass darkly  let us think of them not as they were the spirits of just men imperfect but as the spirits of just men made or to be made hereafter perfect when as st paul says that which is in part is done away and that which is perfect is come  and let us trust christ for them as we would trust him for ourselves sure that the path of the just is as a shining light which shineth more and more unto the perfect day  ah how many lie in this abbey to meet whom in the world to come would be an honour most undeserved  how many more worthy and therefore more likely than any of us here to behold that endless all saints day to which may god in his mercy in spite of all our shortcomings bring us all  amen     sermon xxiii  de profundis   psalm cxxx     out of the deep have i called unto thee o lord lord hear my voice    o let thine ears consider well the voice of my complaint  if thou    lord wilt be extreme to mark what is done amiss o lord who may    abide it  for there is mercy with thee therefore shall thou be    feared  i look for the lord my soul doth wait for him in his word    is my trust  my soul fleeth unto the lord before the morning watch i    say before the morning watch  o israel trust in the lord for with    the lord there is mercy and with him is plenteous redemption  and he    shall redeem israel from all his sins  let us consider this psalm awhile for it is a precious heirloom to mankind  it has been a guide and a comfort to thousands and tens of thousands  rich and poor old and young jews and christians romans greeks and protestants have been taught by it the character of god and taught to love him and trust in him in whom is mercy therefore he shall be feared  the psalmist cries out of the deep out of the deep of sorrow perhaps and bereavement and loneliness or out of the deep of poverty or out of the deep of persecution and illusage or out of the deep of sin and shame and weakness which he hates yet cannot conquer or out of the deep of doubt and anxietyand ah how common is that deep and how many there are in it that swim hard for their lives may god help them and bring them safe to landor out of the deep of overwork so common nowa days when duty lies sore on aching shoulders a burden too heavy to be borne  out of some one of the many deeps into which poor souls fall at times and find themselves in deep water where no ground is and in the mire wherein they are ready to sink the psalmist cries  but out of the deep he criesto god  to god and to none else  he goes to the fountainhead to the fount of deliverance and of forgiveness  for he feels that he needs not only deliverance but forgiveness likewise  his sorrow may not be altogether his own fault what we call in our folly accident and chance and fortunebut which is really the wise providence and loving will of godmay have brought him low into the deep  or the injustice cruelty and oppression of men may have brought him low or many another evil hap  but be that as it may he dares not justify himself  he cannot lift up altogether clean hands  he cannot say that his sorrow is none of his own fault and his mishap altogether undeserved  if thou lord wert extreme to mark what is done amiss o lord who could abide it  not i says the psalmist  not i says every human being who knows himself and knows too well thatif we say we have no sin we deceive ourselves and the truth is not in us  but the psalmist says likewise there is forgiveness with thee therefore shall thou be feared  my friends consider this the key of the whole psalm the gospel and good news for the sake of which the psalm has been preserved in holy scripture and handed down to us  god is to be feared because he is merciful  it is worth while to fear him because he is merciful and of great kindness and hateth nothing that he hath made and willeth not the death of a sinner but rather that he should turn from his wickedness and live  superstitious people in all ages heathens always and sometimes i am sorry to say christians likewise have had a very different reason an opposite reason for fearing god  they have said notthere is mercy but there is anger with god therefore shall he be feared  they have saidwe must fear god because he is wrathful and terrible and ready to punish and is extreme to mark what is done amiss and willeth the death of a sinner and therefore they have not believed when holy scripture told them that god was love and that god so loved the world that he gave his onlybegotten son and sent him to visit the world in great humility that the world through him might be saved  god has seemed to them only a proud stern and formidable being a condemning judge and not a merciful father and therefore when they have found themselves in the deep of misery they have cried out of it to saints angels the virgin mary or even to sun moon and stars and all the powers of nature or even againwhat is more foolish stillto astrologers wizards mediums and quacks of every shape and hue to any one and any thing rather than to god  but do not you do so my friends  fix it in your hearts and minds and fix it now before you fall into the deep as most are apt to do before they die lest when the dark day comes you have no time to learn in adversity the lesson which you should have learnt in prosperity  fix in your hearts and minds the blessed gospel and good newsthere is mercy with thee o god therefore shall thou be feared  there is mercy with him pity tenderness sympathy a heart which can be touched with the feeling of our infirmities which knoweth what is in man which despiseth not the work of his own hands which remembereth our weak frame and knoweth that we are but dust else the spirit would fail before him and the souls which he has made  think of god as that which he isa compassionate god a longsuffering god a generous god a magnanimous god a truly royal god in one word a perfect god who causeth his sun to shine on the evil and on the good and sendeth his rain on the just and on the unjust a god who cannot despise cannot neglect cannot lose his patience with any poor soul of man who sets himself against none but the insolent the proud the malicious the mean the wilfully stupid and ignorant and frivolous  against those who exalt themselves whether as terrible tyrants or merely contemptible boasters he exalts himself and will shew them sooner or later whether he or they be the stronger whether he or they be the wiser  but for the poor soul who is abased who is down and in the depth who feels his own weakness folly ignorance sinfulness and out of that deep cries to god as a lost child crying after its fathereven a lost lamb bleating after the eweof that poor soul be his prayers never so confused stupid and illexpressedof him it is written the lord helpeth them that fall and lifteth up all those that are down  he is nigh to all that call on him yea to all that call upon him faithfully  he will fulfil the desire of those that fear him he also will hear their cry and will help them  yes  to all such does god the father god who made heaven and earth hold up as it were his onlybegotten son christ hanging on the cross for us and say behold thy god  behold the brightness of gods glory and the express image of gods person  behold what god gave for thee even his onlybegotten son  behold that in which god the father was well pleased in his son not condemning you not destroying you but humbling himself dying himself awhile that you may live for ever  look and by seeing the son see the father alsoyour father and the father of the spirits of all flesh and know that his essence and his name islove  therefore when you are in the deep of sorrow whatever that depth may be cry to god  to god himself and to none but god  if you can go to the pure fountainhead why drink of the stream which must have gathered something of defilement as it flows  if you can get light from the sun itself why take lamp or candle in place of his clear rays  if you can go to god himself why go to any of gods creatures however holy pure and loving  go to god who is light of light and life of life the source of all light the source of all life all love all goodness all mercy  from him all goodness flows  all goodness which ever has been shall be or can be is his alone the fruit of his spirit  go then to him himself  out of the depth however deep cry unto god and god himself  if david the jew of old could do so much more can we who are baptized into christ much more can we who have access by one spirit to the father much more can we whoif we know who we are and where we areshould come boldly to the throne of grace to find mercy and grace to help us in the time of need  boldness  that is a bold word but it is st pauls not mine  and by shewing that boldness we shall shew that we indeed fear god  we shall shew that we reverence god  we shall shew that we trust god  for so and so only we shall obey god  if a sovereign or a sage should bid you come to him would you shew reverence by staying away  would you shew reverence by refusing his condescension  you may shew that you are afraid of him that you do not trust him but that is not to shew reverence but irreverence  if god calls you are bound by reverence to come however unworthy  if he bids you you must obey however much afraid  you must trust him you must take him at his word you must confide in his goodness in his justice in his wisdom and since he bids you go boldly to his throne and find him what he is a gracious lord  my friends to you every one of youhowever weak however ignorant ay however sinful if you desire to be delivered from those sinsthis grace is given liberty to cry out of the depth to god himself who made sun and stars all heaven and earth liberty to stand face to face with the father of the spirits of all flesh and cling to the one being who can never fail nor change even to the one immortal eternal god of whom it is written thou lord in the beginning hast laid the foundation of the earth and the heavens are the work of thy hands  they shall perish but thou shalt endure  they all shall wax old like a garment and as a vesture shalt thou change them and they shall be changed  but thou art the same and thy years shall not fail  but it is written again my soul waits for the lord  yes if you can trust in the god who cannot change you can afford to wait you need not be impatient as it is writtenfret not thyself lest thou be moved to do evil and againhe that believeth shall not make haste  for god in whom you trust is not a man that he should lie nor a son of man that he should repent  hath he promised and shall he not do it  his word is like the rain and dew which fall from heaven and return not to it again useless but give seed to the sower and bread to the eater  so is every man that trusteth in him  his kingdom says the lord is as if a man should put seed into the ground and sleep and wake and the seed should grow up he knoweth not how  so the seed which we sowthe seed of repentance the seed of humility the seed of sorrowful prayers for helpit too shall take root and grow and bring forth fruit we know not how in the good time of god who cannot change  we may be sad we may be weary our eyes may wait and watch for the lord as the psalmist says more than they that watch for the morning but it must be as those who watch for the morning for the morning which must and will come for the sun which will surely rise and the day which will surely dawn and the saviour who will surely deliver and the god who is merciful in thisthat he rewardeth every man according to his work  oh trust in the lord  for with the lord there is mercy and with him is plenteous redemption and he shall deliver his people from all their sins  from their sins  not merely from the punishment of their sins not always from the punishment of their sins in this life but what is better far from the sins themselves from the sins which bring them into fresh and needless troubles and which make the old troubles which cannot now be escaped intolerable  from all their sins  not only from the great sins which if persisted in will surely destroy both body and soul in hell but from the little sins which do so easily beset us from little bad habits tempers lazinesses weaknesses ignorances which hamper and hinder us all every day when we try to do our duty  from all these will the lord deliver us by the blood of christ and by the inspiration of his holy spirit that we may be able at last to say to children and friends and all whom we love and leave behind us  oh taste and see that the lord is gracious  blessed is the man that trusteth in him  yes  this at least we may dotrust in our god and thank god that we may do it for if men may not do that then is that true of them which homer said of oldthat man is more miserable than all the beasts of the field  for the animals look neither forward nor back  they live but for the present moment and pain and grief being but for the moment fall lightly upon them  but wewe who have the fearful power of looking back and looking forwardwe who can feel regret and remorse for the past anxiety and terror for the futureto us at times life would be scarce worth having if we had not a right to cry with all our hearts  o god in thee have i trusted let me never be confounded     sermon xxiv  the blessing and the curse   preached on whitsunday  deut xxx 19 20     i call heaven and earth to record this day against you that i have    set before you life and death blessing and cursing therefore choose    life that both thou and thy seed may live that thou mayest love the    lord thy god and that thou mayest obey his voice and that thou    mayest cleave unto him for he is thy life and the length of thy    days that thou mayest dwell in the land which the lord sware unto thy    fathers to abraham to isaac and to jacob to give them  these words the book of deuteronomy says were spoken by moses to all the israelites shortly before his death  he had led them out of egypt and through the wilderness  they were in sight of the rich land of canaan where they were to settle and to dwell for many hundred years moses the book says went over again with them all the law the admirable and divine law which they were to obey and by which they were to govern and order themselves in the land of canaan  he had told them that they owed all to god himself that god had delivered them out of slavery in egypt god had led them to the land of canaan god had given them just laws and right statutes which if they kept they would live long in their new home and become a great and mighty nation  then he calls heaven and earth to witness that he had set before them life and death blessing and cursing  if they trusted in the one true god and served him and lived as men should who believed that a just and loving god cared for them then they would live then a blessing would come on them and their children on their flocks and herds on their land and all in it  but if they forgot god and began to worship the sun and the moon and the stars the earth and the weather like the nations round them then they would die they would grow superstitious cowardly lazy and profligate and therefore weak and miserable like the wretched canaanites whom they were going to drive out and then they would die their souls would die in them and they would become less than men and at lastas the canaanites had becomeworse than brutes till their numbers would diminish and they would be left moses says few in number and at last perish out of the good land which god had given them  so he says you know how to live and you know how to die  choose between them this day  they knew the road to wealth health prosperity and order peace and happiness and life and they knew the road to ruin poverty weakness disease shame and death  they knew both roads for god had set them before them  and you know both roads for god has set them before you  then he saysi call heaven and earth to witness against you this day that i have set before you life and death blessing and cursing  he called heaven and earth to witness  that was no empty figure of speech  if you will recollect the story of the israelites you will see plainly enough what moses meant  the heaven would witness against them  the same stars which would look down on their freedom and prosperity in canaan had looked down on all their slavery and misery in egypt hundreds of years before  those same stars had looked down on their simple forefathers abraham isaac and jacob wandering with their flocks and herds out of the mountains of the far north  that heaven had seen gods mercies and care of them for now five hundred years  everything had changed round them but those stars that sun that moon were the same still and would be the same for ever they were witnesses to them of the unchangeable god those heavens above they would seem to sayjust as the heavens above you are the same wherever you go and whatever you are like so is the god who dwells above the heaven unchangeable everlasting faithful and true full of light and love from whom comes down every good and perfect gift in whom is neither variableness nor shadow of turning  do you turn to him continually and as often as you turn away from him and you shall find him still the same governing you by unchangeable law keeping his promise for ever  and the earth would witness against them  that fair land of canaan whither they were going with its streams and wells spreading freshness and health around its rich corn valleys its uplands covered with vines its sweet mountain pastures a very garden of the lord cut off and defended from all the countries round by sandy deserts and dreary wildernesses that land would be a witness to them at their daily work of gods love and mercy to their forefathers  the ruins of the old canaanite cities would be a witness to them and saybecause of their sins the lord drove out these old heathens from before you  copy their sins and you will share their ruin  do as they did and you will surely die like them  god has given you life here in this fair land of canaan beware how you choose death as the canaanites chose it  they died the death which comes by sin and god has given you life the life which is by righteousness  be righteous men and just and godfearing if you wish to keep this land you and your children after you  and now my dear friends if moses could call heaven and earth to witness against those old jews that he had set before them life and death a blessing and a curse may we not do the same  does not the heaven above our heads and the earth beneath our feet witness against us here  do they not say to usgod has given you life and blessing  if you throw that away and choose instead death and a curse it is your own fault not gods  look at the heaven above us  does not that witness against us  has it not seen for now fifteen hundred years and more gods goodness to us and to our forefathers  all things have changed language manners customs religion  we have changed our place as the israelites did and dwell in a different land from our forefathers but that sky abides for ever  that same sun that moon those stars shone down upon our heathen forefathers when the lord chose them and brought them out of the german forests into this good land of england that they might learn to worship no more the sun and the moon and the storm and the thundercloud but to worship him the living god who made all heaven and earth  that sky looked down upon our forefathers when the first missionaries baptized them into the church of christ and england became a christian land and made a covenant with god and christ for ever to walk in his laws which he has set before us  from that heaven ever since hath god been sending rain and fruitful seasons filling our hearts with food and gladness for a witness of his love and fostering care prospering us whensoever we have kept his laws above all other nations upon earth  shall not that heaven witness against us  into that heaven ascended christ the lord that he might fill all things with his power and his rule and might send from thence on us his holy spirit the spirit whom we worship this day the spirit of wisdom and understanding the spirit of counsel and might the spirit of knowledge and the fear of the lord  by that same spirit and by none other have been thought all the noble thoughts which englishmen ever thought  by that spirit have been spoken all the noble words which englishmen ever spoke  by that spirit have been done all the noble deeds which englishmen have ever done  to that spirit we owe all that is truly noble truly strong truly stable in our english life  it is he that has given us power to get wealth to keep wealth to use wealth  and if we begin to deny that as we are inclined to do nowa days if we lay our grand success and prosperity to the account of our own cleverness our own ability if we say as moses warned the israelites they would say in the days of their success and prosperity notit is god who has given us power to get wealth butmine arm and the might of my hand has gotten me this wealthin plain wordsif we begin to do what we are all too apt to do just now to worship our own brains instead of god then the heaven above us will witness against us this whitsuntide above all seasons in the year and sayinto heaven the lord ascended who died for you on the cross  from heaven he sent down gifts for you and your forefathers even while you were his enemies that the lord god might dwell among you  and behold instead of thanking god fearing god and confessing that you are nothing and god is all you talk as if you were the arbiters of your own futures the makers of your own gifts  instead of giving god the glory you take the glory to yourselves  instead of declaring the glory of god like the heavens and shewing his handiwork like the stars you shew forth your own glory and boast of your own handiwork  beware and fear as your forefathers feared and lived because they gave the glory to god  and shall not the earth witness against us  look round when you go out of church upon this noble english land  why is it not as many a land far richer in soil and climate is now a desolate wilderness the land lying waste and few men left in it and those who are left robbing and murdering each other every mans hand against his fellow till the wild beasts of the field increase upon them  in that miserable state now is many a noble land once the very gardens of the worldjudaea and almost all the east which was once the very garden of the lord as thick with living men as a hive is with bees and vast sheets both of north africa and of south and of north america  why is not england thus  why but because the lord set before our forefathers life and death blessing and cursing and our forefathers chose life and lived and it was well with them in the land which god gave to them because they chose blessing and god blessed them accordingly  in spite of many mistakes and shortcomingsfor they were sinful mortal men as we arethey chose life and a blessing and clave unto the lord their god and kept his covenant and they left behind for us their children these churches these cathedrals for an everlasting sign that the lord was with us as he had been with them and would be with our children after us  ah my friends while we look round us over the face of this good land and see everywhere the churches pointing up to heaven each amid towns and villages which have never seen war or famine for now long centuries all thriving and improving year by year and which never for 800 years have been trodden by the foot of an invading enemy one ought to feel if one has a thoughtful and godfearing heartverily god has set before us life and blessing and prospered us above all nations upon earth and if we do not cleave to him we shall shew ourselves fools above all nations upon earth  and then when one reads the history of england when one thinks over the history of any one city even one country parish above all when one looks into the history of ones own foolish heart one sees how often though god has given us freely life and blessing we have been on the point of choosing death and the curse instead of sayingwe will go our own way and not gods way  the land is ours not gods the houses are our own not gods our souls are our own not gods  we are masters and who is master over us  that is the way to choose death and the curse shame and poverty and ruin my friends and how often we have been on the point of choosing it  what has saved us  what has kept us from it  certainly not our own righteousness nor our own wisdom nor our own faith  after reading the history of england or after recollecting our own livesthe less we say of them the better  what has kept us from ruin so long  we are all day long forgetting the noble things which god did for our forefathers  why does not god in return remember our sins and the sins of our forefathers  why is he not angry with us for ever  why in spite of all our shortcomings and backslidings are we prospering here this day  i know not my friends unless it be for this one reason that into that heaven which witnesses against us the merciful and loving christ is ascended that he is ever making intercession for us a highpriest who can be touched with the feeling of our infirmities and that he has received gifts for men even for his enemiesas we have too often beenthat the lord god might dwell among us  yes  he ascended on high that he might send down his holy spirit and that spirit is among us working patiently and lovingly in many heartswould that i could say in allgiving men right judgments putting good desires into their hearts and enabling them to put them into good practice  the holy spirit is the life of england and of the church of england and of every man whether he belongs to the church or not who loves the good and desires to do it and to see it done  and those in whom the holy spirit dwells are the salt of england which keeps it from decay they are those who have chosen life and blessing and found them  oh may god increase their number more and more till all know him from the least unto the greatest and the land be filled with the knowledge of the lord as the waters cover the sea  and then shall all days be whitsundays and the name of the father be hallowed indeed and his kingdom come and his will be done on earth as it is in heaven     sermon xxv  the silence of faith   psalm cxxxi     lord my heart is not haughty nor mine eyes lofty neither do i    exercise myself in great matters or in things too high for me  surely    i have behaved and quieted myself as a child that is weaned of his    mother my soul is even as a weaned child  let israel hope in the    lord from henceforth and for ever  we know not at what period of davids life this psalm was written  we know not what matters they were which were too high for him to meddle with matters about which he had to refrain his soul to quiet his feelings to suspend his judgment to check his curiosity and say about them simplytrust in the lord  we do not know i say what these great matters these mysteries were but that concerns us little  human life human fortune human history human agonynay the whole universe the more we know of it is full of such mysteries  only the shallow and the conceited are unaware of their presence  only the shallow and the conceited pretend to explain them and have a why ready for every how  david was not like them  his was too great a mind to be highminded too deep a heart to have proud looks and to pretend to himself or to others that he knew the whole counsel of god  solomon his son had the same experience  for him too in spite of all his wisdom the mystery of providence was too dark  though a man laboured to seek it yet should he not find it out  all things seemed at least to come alike to all  there was one event to the righteous and to the wicked to the clean and to the unclean  vanity of vanity all was vanity  of making books there was no end and much study was a weariness to the flesh  and the conclusion of the whole matter wasfear god and keep his commandments  thatand not to pry into the unfathomable will of godwas the whole duty of man  job too what is the moral of the whole book of job save that gods ways are unsearchable and his paths past finding out  the lord be it remembered in the closing scene of the book vouchsafes to job no explanation whatsoever of his affliction  instead of telling him why he has been so sorely smitten instead of bidding him even look up and trust he silences job by the mere plea of his own power  where wast thou when i laid the foundation of the earth  declare if thou hast understanding  when the morning stars sang together and all the sons of god shouted for joy  shall he that contendeth with the almighty instruct him  he that reproveth god let him answer  but it may be said these are old testament sayings  the patriarchs and prophets had not that full light of knowledge of the mind of god which the evangelists and apostles had  what do the latter the writers of the new testament say with that fuller knowledge of god which they gained through jesus christ our lord  my friendsthis is not i trust by gods great goodness the last time that i am to preach in this abbey  what the evangelists and apostles taught which the prophets and psalmists did not teach i hope to tell you as far as i know hereafter  but this i am bound to tell you beforehandthat there are no truer words in the articles of the church of england than those in the viith articlethat the old testament is not contrary to the new for both in the old and new testament everlasting life is offered to mankind by christ the only mediator between god and man being both god and man  yes  that the old testament is not contrary to the new i believe with my whole heart and soul  and therefore to those who say that the apostles had solved the whole mystery of human life its sins its sorrows its destinies i must reply that such is not the case at least with the most gifted of all the writers of the new testament  we may think fit to claim omniscience for st paul but he certainly does not claim it for himself  when he is vouchsafed a glimpse of the high counsels of god he exclaims as one dazzledoh the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of god  how unsearchable are his judgments and his ways past finding out  for who hath known the mind of the lord or who hath been his counsellorwhile of himself he speaks in a very different toneeven though he have been as he says caught up into the third heaven and heard words unspeakable which it is not lawful for a man to utter yet he knows he says in part he prophesies in part but when that which is perfect comes that which is partial shall be done away  he is as the child to the fullgrown man into which he hopes to develop in the future life  he sees as in a glass darkly but then face to face  he knows now in part  thenbut not till thenwill he know even as he is known  nay more  in the ninth chapter of his epistle to the romans he does not hesitate to push to the utmost that plea of gods absolute sovereignty which we found in the book of job  he has mercy on whom he will have mercy and whom he will he hardeneth and if any say why doth he then find fault  for who hath resisted his will  who art thou that repliest against god  shall the thing formed say to him that formed it why hast thou made me thus  hath not the potter power over the clay of the same lump to make one vessel to honour and another to dishonour  what those words may mean or may not mean i do not intend to argue now i only quote them to shew you that st paul just as much as any old testament thinker believed that there were often mysteries ay tragedies in the lives not only of individuals nor of families but of whole races to which we shortsighted mortals could assign no rational or moral final cause but must simply do that which spinoza forbade us to do namelyin every unknown case flee unto god and sayit is the lord let him do what seemeth him goodcertain of this which the cross and passion of our lord jesus christ shewed forth as nothing else in heaven or earth could shewthat the will of god toward man is an utterly good will and that therefore what seemeth good to him will be good in act and fact  it is this faith and i believe this faith alone which can enable truly feeling spirits to keep anything like equanimity if they dwell long and earnestly on the miseries of mankind on sorrow pain bereavement on the fate of many a widow and orphan on sudden premature and often agonizing deathbut why pain you with a catalogue of ills which all savethank godthe youngest know too well  and it is that want of faith in the will and character of a living god which makes and will always make infidelity a sad state of minda theory of man and the universe which contains no gospel or good news for man  i do not speak now of atheism dogmatic selfsatisfied insolent cynic i speak especially tonight of a form of unbelief far more attractive which is spreading i believe among people often of high intellect often of virtuous life often of great attainments in art science or literature  such repudiate and justly the name of theists but they decline and justly the name of atheists  they wouldthe finest and purest spirits among themaccept only too heartily the whole of the psalm which i have chosen for my text save its ascription and the last verse  we toothey would saydo not wish to be highminded and dogmatize and assert and condemn  we too do not wish to meddle with matters too high for us or for any human intellect  we too wish to refrain ourselves from asserting whathowever pleasantwe cannot prove and to wean ourselveshowever really painful the processfrom the milk the mere childs food on which mother church has brought up the nations of europe for the last 1500 years  but for that very reason as for asking us to trust in the lord either for this life or an eternal life to come do not ask that of us  we do not say that there is no god no providence of god no life beyond the grave only we say that we cannot find them  they may exist or they may not  but to us and as we believe to all mankind if they used their reason aright they are unthinkable and therefore unknowable  god we see not but this we seeman tortured by a thousand ills and then alas perishing just as the dumb beasts perish  we see death decay pain sorrow bereavement weakness and these produced not merely by laws of nature in which however terrible we could stoically acquiesce but worse still by accidentthe sports of seeming chancesand those often so slight and mean  man in his fullest power woman in her highest usefulness the victim not merely of the tempest or the thunderstroke but of a fallen match a stumbling horse  therefore the sight of so much human woe without a purpose and without a cause is too much for them as without faith in god it ought to be too much for us  and therefore in their poetry and in their proseand they are masters some of them both of poetry and of prosethere is a weary sadness a tender despair which one must not praise yet which one cannot watch without sympathy and affection  for the mystery of human vanity and vexation of spirit the mystery which weighed down the soul of david and of solomon and of him who sang the song of job and of st paul and of st augustine and all the great theologians of old time is to them nought but utter darkness  for they see not yet as our great modern poet says              hands    athwart the darkness shaping man  they see not yet athwart the darkness a face most human yet divine of utter sympathy and love and hear not yetoh let me say once more not yet of such fine soulsthe only words which can bring true comfort to one who feels for his fellowmen amid the terrible chances and changes of this mortal life  let not your heart be troubled  believe in god and believe also in me  all power is given to me in heaven and in earth  lo i am with you even to the end of the world  oh let us to whom god has given that most undeserved grace by the confession of a true faith to acknowledge the glory of the eternal trinity and in the power of the divine majesty to worship the unitylet us i say beseech god that he would give to them as well as to us that comfortable and wholesome faith and evermore defend them and usif it seem good in his gracious sightfrom all adversity  and surely we need that faiththose of us at least who know what we have lostin the face of such a catastrophe as was announced in this abbey on this day week which thrilled this congregation with the awful newsthat one of the most gifted men in europe the most eloquent of all our preachersthe most energetic of all our prelates the delight of so many of the most refined and cultivated the comforter of so many pious souls not only by his sermons not only by his secret counsels but by those exquisite confirmation addresses to have lost which is a spiritual loss incalculablethose confirmation addresses which touched and ennobled the hearts alike of children and of parents and made so many spirits young and old indebted to him from thenceforth for everthat this man with his enormous capacity and will for doing his duty like a valiant man and doing each duty better than any of us his clergy had ever seen it done beforewith his genius too now so rare and yet so needed for governing his fellowmenthat he in the fulness of his power his health his practical example his practical success should vanish in a moment and that immense natural vitality that organism of forces so various and so delicate just as it was developing to perfection under long and careful selfeducation should be lost for ever to this earth leaving england and her colonies and indeed all christendom so much the poorer so much the more weak and inflictingforget not thata bitter pang on hundreds of loving hearts and all by reason of the stumbling of a horse  and why  our reason our conscience our moral sense that by virtue of which we are not brutes but men forces us to ask that question even if no answer be found to it in earth or heaven  what was the important why which lay hid behind that little howthe means were so paltry the effect was so vastthere must have been a final cause a purpose for that death or the fact would be altogether hideousa scribble without a meaninga skeleton without a soul  why did he die  i became dumb and opened not my mouth for it was thy doing  so says the burial psalm  so let us say likewise  i became dumb not with rage not with despair but because it was thy doing and therefore it was done well  it was the deed not of chance not of necessity for had it been then those who loved him might have been excused had they cursed chance cursed necessity cursed the day in which they entered a universe so cruel so capricious  not so  for it was the deed of the father without whom a sparrow falls not to the ground of the son who died upon the cross in the utterness of his desire to save of the holy ghost who is the lord and giver of life to all created things  it was the deed of one who delights in life and not in death in bliss and not in woe in light and not in darkness in order and not in anarchy in good and not in evil  it had a final cause a meaning a purpose and that purpose is very good  what it is we know not and we need not know  to guess at it would be indeed to meddle with matters too high for us  so let us be dumb but dumb not from despair but from faith dumb not like a wretch weary with calling for help which does not come but dumb like a child sitting at its mothers feet and looking up into her face and watching her doings understanding none of them as yet but certain that they all are done in love     sermon xxvi  god and mammon   matthew vi 24     ye cannot serve god and mammon  this is part of the gospel for this sunday and a specially fit text for this day which happens to be st matthews day  on this day we commemorate one who made up his mind once and for all that whoever could serve god and money at once he could not and who therefore threw up all his prospects in lifewhich were those of a peculiarly lucrative profession that of a farmer of roman taxesin order to become the wandering disciple of a reputed carpenters son  he became it is true in due time an apostle an evangelist and a martyr and if posthumous fame be worth the ambition of any man matthew the publicansaint matthew as we call himhas his share thereof because he discovered like a wise man that he could not serve god and money and therefore when jesus saw him sitting at the receipt of custom and bade him follow me he rose up and left his moneybags and followed him whom he afterwards discovered to be no less than god made man  ye cannot serve god and mammon  it is very difficult to make men believe these words  so difficult that our lord himself could not make the jews believe them especially the rich and comfortable religious people among them  when he told them that they could not serve two masters that they could not worship god and money at the same time the pharisees who were covetous derided him  they laughed to scorn the notion that they could not be very religious and respectable and so forth and yet set their hearts on making money all the while  they thought that they could have their treasure on earth and in heaven also and they went their way in spite of our lords warnings and made money honestly no doubt if they could but if not why then dishonestly for money must be made at all risks  st paul warned them by his disciple timothy of their danger  he told them that the love of money is the root of all evil and that those who will be rich fall into temptation and a snare and into many foolish and hurtful lusts which drown men in destruction and perdition  st james warned them even more sternly and told the rich men among the jews of his day to weep and howl for the miseries which were coming on them  they had heaped up treasure for the last days when it would be of no use to them  they were fattening their heartshe told themagainst a day of slaughter  but they listened to st paul and st james no more than they did to our lord  after the fall of jerusalem even more than before they became the moneymakers and the moneylenders of the whole world  and what befel them  their wealth stirred up the envy and the suspicion of the gentiles  they were persecuted robbed slaughtered again and again for the sake of their money  and yet they would not give up their ruinous passion  throughout all the middle ages here in england just as much as on the continent they lent money at exorbitant interest and then their debtors to escape payment turned on them for not being christians accused them of poisoning the wells and what not massacred them burnt them alive and committed the most horrible atrocities fulfilling the warnings of our lord and his apostles only too terribly and brutally again and again  do i say this to make any man dislike or despise the jews  god forbid the jews have noble qualities in them by which they have prospered and for the sake of whichas i believegods blessing rests on them to this day  they have prospered not by their love of money not even by their extraordinary courage persistence and intellectual power but by their keeping two at least of the commandments as no other people on earth has kept them  they have kept the second commandment and hated idolatry and any approach to it with a stern and noble hatred which would god that all who call themselves christians would imitate  they have kept likewise the fifth commandment and have honoured their parents as no other people on earth have done except it may be the chinese who prosper still in spite of many sins  their family affections are so intense their family life is so pure and sound that they put to shame too many christians and where the family life is sound the heart of a people is sure to be sound likewise and all will come right with them at last and meanwhile the days of the jews will be long in whatsoever land the lord their god shall give them till the day of which st paul prophesied when the veil shall be taken off their hearts and they shall acknowledge that christ whom their forefathers crucified in their blindness for their king and lord and god and so all israel shall be saved  amen  amen  and meanwhile who are we that we should complain of the jews now or the jews of our lords time for being too fond of money  is anything more certain than that we english are becoming given up more and more to the passion for making money at all risks and by all means fair or foul our covetousness isalas that it should be sobecome a byword among foreign nations while our old english commercial honestywhich was once our strength and protected us from and all but atoned for our covetousnessis going fast and leaving us feared indeed for our power but suspected for our chicanery and odious for our arrogance  and it is most sad but most certain that we are like those pharisees of old in this also that we too have made up our mind that we can serve god and mammon at once that the very classes among us who are most utterly given up to moneymaking are the very classes which in all denominations make the loudest religious profession that our churches and chapels are crowded on sundays by people whose souls are set the whole week through upon gain and nothing but gain who pretend to reverence scripture while they despise the warning of scripture that the love of money is the root of all evil  have we not seen in our own days persons of the highest religious profession whose names were the foremost on every charitable subscription list so devoured by this mad love for money for its own sake that though they had already more money than they could spend or enjoy in any way soever save by saying to themselvesi have got it i have got itthey must needs in the mere lust for becoming richer still ruin themselves and others by frantic speculations  have we not seenbut why should i defile myself and you and this holy place by telling you what i have seen and what i hope and hope alas in vain that i shall never see again among those who must needs serve god and mammon  has not the love of money become such a chronic disease among us that we can actually calculate now when the disease will come to a head and relieve itself for a while though alas only for a while  about every eleven years i am informed we are to expect a commercial crisis panics bankruptcies and misery and ruin to hundreds a sort of terrible but beneficent thunderstorm which clears the foul atmosphere of our commercial system at the expense alas not merely of the guilty but of the innocent involving the widow and the orphan the poor and the simple in the same fate as the rich and powerful whom they have trusted to their own ruin  and yet we boast of our civilization and of our christianity and hardly one here and there lays the lesson to heart but each man like a moth about a candle unwarned by the fate of his fellows fancies that he at least can flutter round the flames and not be burned that whoever else cannot serve god and mammon he can do it and holds by virtue of his superior prudence a special dispensation from the plain warnings of holy scripture  but every reasonable man knows what advantages money and nothing but money will obtain not only for a man himself but for his children and answers meif i wish to rise in life if i wish my children to rise in life how can i do it without making money  god forbid that i should check an honourable ambition and a desire to rise in life  we all ought to rise in life and to rise far higher than most of us are likely to rise  but i ask you to consider very seriously what you mean by rising in life  do you mean by rising in life merely becoming a richer man living in a larger house eating drinking clothing better having more servants carriages plate  is that to be the highest triumph of all your labours is that your notion of rising in life  if it is you are not singular in your notion  there are thousands who call themselves civilized and christians and yet have no higher notion of what mans highest good may be  but do you mean by rising in life simply becoming a nobler because a better man  for if you mean that latter i seriously advise you to hearken to what the creator and governor of all heaven and earth jesus christ our lord has told you on that matter when he saidseek ye first the kingdom of god and his righteousness and all these things shall be added unto you  seek ye first the kingdom of god  alas this moneymaking generation talks a great deal about religion and saving their souls being quite indifferent to the serious questionwhether their souls are worth saving or not but as for the kingdom of god of which our lord and his apostles speak so often they have forgotten altogether what it is  they talk too a great deal about the righteousness of christ but they have forgotten also what the righteousness of christ which is also the righteousness of god is like  the kingdom of god the government of god the laws and rules by which christ king of kings and king too of every nation and man on earth whether they know it or not governs mankind that is what you have to seek because it is there already  you are in christs kingdom  if you wish to prosper in it find out what its laws are  that will be true wisdom  for in keeping the commandments of god and in obeying his laws in that alone is life life for body and soul life for time and for eternity  and the righteousness of god which is the righteousness of christfind out what that is and pray to christ to give it to you for so alone will you be what a man should be created after god in righteousness and true holiness and renewed into the image and likeness of god  you will find plenty of persons now as in all times who will tell you that you need not do that that all you need for this world or the world to come is some righteousness of the scribes and pharisees calling thatoh shame that such a glorious and eternal truth should be so caricatured and degraded by manjustification by faith while all they mean is justification not by faith but by mere assent assenting to certain doctrines keeping certain religious watchwords in your mouth and over and above leading a tolerably respectable life  but what says our lord except your righteousness exceed the righteousness of the scribes and pharisees ye shall in no wise enter into the kingdom of heaven  not merelynot dwell in it for ever but not even enter it not even get through the very gate and cross the very threshold of it  the merely assenting merely respectable even the socalled religious and orthodox life will not let you into the kingdom of heaven either in this life or the life to come  no  that requires the noble life the pure life the just life the gentle life the generous life the heroic life the godlike life which is perfect even as our father in heaven is perfect because he lets his sun shine on the evil and on the good and his rain fall on the just and on the unjust  but how will this help you to rise in life  our lord himself answersand our lord should surely knowseek ye first the kingdom of god and his righteousness and all these things shall be added to you  have faith in god and in his promise and your faith in god shall be rewarded  you shall find that your heavenly father knows that you have need of all these things and has arranged his kingdom and the whole universe accordingly  the very good things of this worldwealth honour power and the rest for the sake of which worldly men quarrel and envy and slander and bully and cringe and commit all basenesses and crimesall these shall come to you of their own accord by the providence of your father in heaven and by his everlasting laws if you will but learn and do gods will and lead the christlike and the godlike life  honour and power wealth and prosperity as much of them as is justly good for you and as much of them as you deservethat is earn and merit by your own ability and self controlshall come to you by the very laws of the universe and by the very providence of god  you shall find that godliness hath the promise of this life as well as of the life which is to come  you shall find that gods kingdom is a wellmade and wellordered kingdom and that his laws are life and are far more worth trusting in than the maxims of that illmade and illordered world of man which you all renounced at your baptism  you shall find that the promises of scripture are no dreams but actual practical living truths which come true and fulfil themselves in the lives and histories of men  choose young men choose now and make up your minds which way you will rise in life by merely getting money or by getting wisdom and honour and virtue  the psalmists of old yea our lord himself tell you what will happen in each case  if you want only to be rich why then be rich if you are clever enough  the lord may give you what you want in this evil world  he may give you your portion in this life and fill you with his hid treasure  he may let you heap up money which you do not know how to spend and be a laughingstock to others while you live and after you die your children will probably squander what you have hoarded while you will carry away nothing when you die neither will your pomp follow you and take care lest you wake after all like dives in the torment to hear the fearful but most reasonable wordsson thou in thy lifetime receivedst thy good things and therefore thou art tormented  those words too i fear will come true in this very generation of many a wretched soul who while he lived counted himself a happy man and had all men speaking well of him because he did well unto himself  on whose souls may god have mercy  choose young men choose now in the golden days of youth and strength and honour ere you have laid a yoke on your own shoulderseven the yoke of moneyworshipnot light and easy like the yoke of christ but heavier and heavier as the years roll on while you with fading intellect fading hopes and it may be fading credit and certainly fading power of any rational enjoyment have still like the doomed souls in dantes inferno to roll up hill the moneybags which are perpetually slipping back  i have seen that and more than once or twice and it is i think the saddest sight on earthsave one  choose i say again then young men before you have spread a net round your own feet which as in disturbed dreams grows and tangles more and more each time you moveeven the net of greed and craft which men set for their neighbours and are but too apt ere all is done to be taken in themselves the net of truly bad society of the society of men who have set their hearts on making money somehow or other and with whom if you cast in your lot you may descendo god i know full well what i am sayingto depths from which your young spirits now would shrink till your higher nature be subdued to the element in which it works and the poets curse on all who bind themselves to natures lower than their own come true of you     thou shall lower to their level day by day    all that once was fine within thee growing coarse to sympathize with    clay  or you may choosegod grant that you may choosethe other path the path of the law of christ and of the spirit of christ the kingdom of god and his righteousness  and then shall come true of you as far as god shall see good for your immortal soul those other promises  come ye children and hearken unto me and i will teach you the fear of the lord  what man is he that loves life and would fain see good days let him keep his tongue from evil and his lips that they speak no deceit  let him eschew evil and do good let him seek peace and pursue it  for the eyes of the lord are over the righteous and his ears are open to their prayers   for the lord ordereth a good mans going and maketh his way acceptable to himself  though he fall he shall not be cast away for the lord upholdeth him with his hand    i have been young and now am old and yet never saw i the righteous forsaken nor his seed begging their bread  flee from evil and do the thing that is good and dwell for evermore  for the lord loveth the thing that is righteous  he forsaketh not his that be godly but they are preserved for ever  choose that the better part which shall not be taken from you for it is according to the true laws of political and social economy which are the laws of the maker of the universe and of the redeemer of mankind  and then whether or not you leave your children wealth you will at all events leave them an example by which they and their childrens children must prosper to the worlds end  and your prayer will be more and more as you grow old and weary with the hard work of life  i will go forth in the strength of the lord god and make mention of his righteousness only  thou o god hast taught me from my youth up until now  therefore will i tell of thy wondrous works  forsake me not o lord in my old age when i am greyheaded till i have shewn thy strength unto this generation and thy power unto those that are yet to come  to which end may christ bring us all of his infinite mercy  amen     sermon xxvii  the beatific vision   psalm lvii     a psalm of david when he fled from saul in the cave     be merciful unto me o god be merciful unto me for my soul trusteth    in thee and under the shadow of thy wings shall be my refuge until    this tyranny be overpast  i will call unto the most high god even    unto the god that shall perform the cause which i have in hand  he    shall send from heaven and save me from the reproof of him that would    eat me up  god shall send forth his mercy and truth my soul is among    lions  and i lie even among the children of men that are set on    fire whose teeth are spears and arrows and their tongue a sharp    sword  set up thyself o god above the heavens and thy glory above    all the earth  they have laid a net for my feet and pressed down my    soul they have digged a pit before me and are fallen into the midst    of it themselves  my heart is fixed o god my heart is fixed i will    sing and give praise  awake up my glory awake lute and harp i    myself will awake right early  i will give thanks unto thee o lord    among the people and i will sing unto thee among the nations  for    the greatness of thy mercy reacheth unto the heavens and thy truth    unto the clouds  set up thyself o god above the heavens and thy    glory above all the earth  some people nowadays would call this poetry and so it is  but what poetry  they would call it a hebrew song a hebrew lyric and so it is but what a song  there is something in us if we be truly delicate and highminded people which will surely make us feel a deep difference between it and common poetry or common songs which made our forefathers read or chant it in church and use it as many a pious soul has ere now in private devotion  david did not compose it in church or in temple  he never meant it perhaps to be sung in public worship  he little dreamed that we and millions more in lands of which he had never heard should be repeating his words in a foreign tongue in our most sacred acts of worship  he was thinking when he composed it mainly of himself and his own sorrows and dangers  he intends he says to awake early and sing it to lute and harp  perhaps he had composed it in the night as he lay either in the cave of adullam or engedi hiding from saul among the cliffs of the wild goats and meant to go forth to the caves mouth and there before the sun rose over the downs he would to translate his words exactly awake the dawning with his song in the free air and the clear sky singing to his little band of men  and to some one more than man my friends  for his poetry was poetry concerning god  his song was a song to god  he does not sing of his own sorrows to himself as too many poets have done ere now  he does not sing to his men though he no doubt wished them to hear him and learn from him and gain faith and comfort and courage from his song  he sings of his sorrows to god himself to the god who made heaven and earth the god who is above the heavens and his glory above all the earth  this is the secret the virtue the charm of the song that it sings to god  this is why it has passed into many lands into many languages through hundreds and hundreds of years and is as fresh and mighty and full of meaning and of power now here to us in england as it was to david when he was a poor outlaw wandering in the hills of the little country of judaea more than 2000 years ago  the poet says     a thing of beauty is a joy for ever  and this psalm is most beautiful and a joy for ever to delicate and noble intellects  but more a thing of truth is a help for ever  and this psalm is most true and a help for ever to all sorrowing and weary hearts  for the spirit of truth it was who put this psalm into davids heart and brain and taught him to know and say what was true for him and true for all men what was true then and will be true for ever  and what in it is true for ever  the very figures the metaphors of the psalm are true for ever  under the shadow of thy wings shall be my refugethat is a noble figure can we not feel its beauty  and more do none of us know that it is true  david did not believe any more than we do that god had actual wings  but david knewand it may be some of us know toothat god does at times strangely and lovingly hide us keep us out of temptation keep us out of harms way as it is written thou shall hide them privately in thy presence from the provoking of all men thou shall keep them in thy tabernacle from the strife of tongues  ah my dear friends in such a time as this when the strife of tongues is only too loud have you never had reason to thank god for being by some seemingly mere accident kept out of the strife of tongues and out of your chance of striving too and of making a fool of yourself like too many others  the image of the mother bird hiding her brood under her wings seemed to david just to express that act of gods fatherly love in words which will be true for ever as long as a brooding bird is left on the earth to remind us of davids song and of one greater than david too who saido jerusalem jerusalem how often would i have gathered thy children as a hen gathereth her chickens under her wings and thou wouldest not  god grant that we all may do when our time comes that which those violent conceited jews would not do and therefore paid the awful penalty of their folly  and the darker and more painful figures of the psalm are they not true still  is not a mans soul even in this just and peaceful land and far oftener in lands which are still neither just nor peacefulis not a mans soul i say sometimes among lionsamong greedy violent tyrannous persons who are ready to entangle him in a quarrel shout him down ay or shoot him down literally ready to eat him up  are not the children of men still too often set on fire on fire with wild party cries with superstitions which they do not half understand with brute excitements which pander to their basest passions running like fire from head to head and heart to heart till whole classes whole nations sometimes are on fire ready like fire to consume and destroy all they touch and like fire to consume and destroy themselves likewise  are there none now too whose teeth are spears and arrows and their tongue a sharp sword  such use the pen now rather than the tongue but they know as well as those whom david met how to handle the spears and arrows of slander and the sharp sword of insult  are there none left who set nets for their neighbours feet by gambling swindling puffing by tricks of trade and tricks of partynone who like the scribes of old try to entangle men in their talk and make them offenders for a word and who like davids enemies fall now and then into the very pit which they have digged and ruin themselves in trying to ruin others  my friends such men will be as long as there is sin upon the earth their weapons are very different now from what they were in davids time but their hearts are the same as they were then  the works of the flesh they do which are manifest and a very ugly list they make as all who read st pauls epistles know full well  but such men have their wages  god is merciful in this that he rewards every man according to his work  and he is merciful to the whole human race in rewarding such men according to their work  to the flesh they sow and of the flesh they shall reap corruption  of old it was writtenthe wages of sin are death and that like all gods words is a gospel and good news to poor human beings  for if the wages of sin were not death what end could there be to sin and therefore to misery  but while such men exist how shall a man escape them  how shall he defend himself from them  not by craft and falsehood not by angry replies not by fighting them with their own weapons  the honest man is no match for them with those  the man who has a conscience is no match for the man who has none  the man who has no conscience does what he wills everything is fair to him in war and therein his unscrupulousnesslies his evil strength  the man who has a conscience dares not do what he likes  his scruplesin plain words his fear of godhamper him and put him at a disadvantage which will always defeat him as often as he borrows the devils tools to do gods work withal  he must give up those weapons as david threw off sauls armour when he went to fight the giant  it was strong enough doubt not but he could not go in it he said he was not accustomed to it  he would take simpler weapons to which he was accustomed and fight his battle with them trusting not in armour but in the name of the living god  in the name of the living god  that is the only sure weapon and the only sure defence  in that david trusted when he went to fight the giant  in that he trusted when he was hid in the cave  and because he trusted in god he prayed to god  he spoke to god  remember that and understand how much it means  david the simple yeomans son the outlaw the wanderer despised and rejected by men one who was no scholar either who very probably could neither read nor write and knew neither sciences nor arts save how to play in some simple way upon his harpthis man found out that however oppressed miserable ignorant he was in many respects he had a right to speak face to face with the almighty and infinite god who had made heaven and earth  he found out that that great god cared for him protected him and would be true to him if only he would be true to god and to himself  what a discovery was that  worth all the wealth and power ay worth all the learning and science in the worldto have found the pearl of great price the secret of all secrets i david may speak to god  ah my friends consider the meaning of that  consider it i say  for when that great thought has once flashed across a mans mind he is a new creature thenceforth  he need speak to no fatherconfessor or director to no saints or angels to no sages or philosophers  for he can speak to god himself and he need speak to no one else  nay at times he dare speak to no one else  if he can tell his story to god why tell it to any of gods creatures  he is in the presence of god himself god his father god his saviour god his comforter father son and holy ghost  god is listening to him to god he can tell all his sorrows all his wrongs all his doubts all his sins all his weaknesses as david told his and god will hear him and instead of striking him dead for his presumption or for his sinfulness will comfort him comfort him with a feeling of peace of freedom of being right and of being safe such as he never had before till all the troubles and dangers of this life shall seem light to him let the world rage  let the foolish people deal foolishly and the treacherous ones treacherously  for if god be with a man who can be against him  he has no fears left now  he has nothing to do save to thank god for his boundless condescension and to trust on  to trust on if he has set his heart on the lord he need not fear what man will do to him  if his heart is fixed if he is sure that god cares for him he will as it were by instinct sing and give praise to god as the bird sings when the rain is past and the sun shines out once more  but i think that when a man has reached that state of mind as david reached it he will rise as david rose to a higher state of mind still he will rise as david rises in this psalm from thoughts about his own soul to thoughts about god  in one word he will rise from religion to that which is above even religion namely theology  his first cry to god was somewhat selfish  he went to god about himself about his own sorrows and troubles  that is natural and harmless  the child in pain and terror cries to its mother selfishly to be helped out of its own little woes  but when it is helped and comforted and safe in its mothers bosom and its sobbing is over then it forgets itself and looks up into its mothers face and thinks of her and her alone  and so it should be with the man whom god has comforted  when the deliverance has come when the peace of mind has come then surely if he be worthy of the name of man he will forget himself and his own petty sorrows and look up to god to god himself and say within his heartthis great awful being eternal infinite omnipotent who yet condescends to take care of a tiny creature like me who am in comparison with him less than the worm which crawls upon the ground less than the fly which lives but for an hourthis god so mighty and yet so merciful who is he  what is he like  he is good to me  is he not good to all  he is merciful to me  is not his mercy over all his works  nay is he not good in himself  the one good  must not god be the one good who is the cause and the fountain of all other goodness in man in angels in all heaven and earth  but if sowhat a glorious being he must be  not merely a powerful not merely a wise but a glorious because perfect god  then will he cry as david cries in this very psalmoh that men could see that  oh that men could understand that  oh that they would do god justice and confess his glorious name oh that he would teach them his name and shew them his glory that they might be dazzled by the beauty of it awed by the splendour of it  oh that he would gladden their souls by the beatific vision of himself till they loved him worshipped him obeyed him for his own sake not for anything which they might obtain from him but solely because he is the perfectly good  oh that god would set up himself above the heavens and his glory above all the earth and that men would lift up their eyes above the earth and above the heavens likewise to god who made heaven and earth and would crythou art worthy o lord to receive glory and honour and power for thou hast made all things and for thy pleasure they are and were created and thy pleasure is peace on earth and goodwill toward men  thou art the high and holy one who inhabitest eternity  yet thou dwellest with him that is of a contrite spirit to revive the heart of the feeble and to comfort the heart of the contrite we adore the glory of thy power we adore the glory of thy wisdom but most of all we adore the glory of thy justice the glory of thy condescension the glory of thy love  and now friendsalmost all friends unknownand alas never to be known by meyou who are to me as people floating down a river while i the preacher stand upon the bank and call in hope that some of you may catch some word of mine ere the great stream shall bear you out of sightoh catch at least catch this one wordthe last which i shall speak here for many months and which sums up all which i have been trying to say to you of late  fix in your mindsor rather ask god to fix in your mindsthis one idea of an absolutely good god good with all forms of goodness which you respect and love in man good as you and i and every honest man understand the plain word good  slowly you will acquire that grand and allilluminating idea slowly and most imperfectly at best for who is mortal man that he should conceive and comprehend the goodness of the infinitely good god  but see then whether in the light of that one idea all the oldfashioned christian ideas about the relations of god to man whether a providence prayer inspiration revelation the incarnation the passion and the final triumph of the son of godwhether all these i say do not begin to seem to you not merely beautiful not merely probable but rational and logical and necessary moral consequences from the one idea of an absolute and eternal goodness the living parent of the universe  and so i leave you to the grace of god     footnotes   0a  second edition pp 78 79  39  j p richter  cambridge  printed by c j clay ma at the
