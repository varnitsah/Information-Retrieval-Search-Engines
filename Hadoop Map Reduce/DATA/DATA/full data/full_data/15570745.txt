15570745	sermons on national subjects     ithe king of the earth    first sunday in advent preached in 1849  behold thy king cometh unto theematthew xxi 4  this sunday is the first of the four sundays in advent  during those four sundays our forefathers have advised us to think seriously of the coming of our lord jesus christnot that we should neglect to think of it at all times  as some of you know i have preached to you about it often lately  perhaps before the end of advent you will all of you more or less understand what all that i have said about the cholera and public distress and the sins of this nation and the sins of the labouring people has to do with the coming of our lord jesus christ  but i intend especially in my next four sermons to speak my whole mind to you about this matter as far as god has shown it to me taking the collect epistle and gospels for each sunday in advent and explaining them  i am sure i cannot do better for the more i see of those collects epistles and gospels and the way in which they are arranged the more i am astonished and delighted at the wisdom with which they are chosen the wise order in which they follow each other and fit into each other  it is very fit too that we should think of our lords coming at this season of the year above all others because it is the hardest seasonthe season of most want and misery and discontent when wages are low and work is scarce and fuel is dear and frosts are bitter and farmers and tradesmen and gentlemen too are at their wits end to square their accounts and pay their way  then is the time that the evils of society come home to usthat our sins and our sorrows which after all are the punishment of our sins stare us in the face  then is the time if ever for mens hearts to cry out for a saviour who will deliver them out of their miseries and their sins for a heavenly king who will rule them in righteousness and do justice and judgment on the earth and see that those who are in need and necessity have right for a heavenly counsellor who will guide them into all truthwho will teach them what they are and whither they are going and what the lord requires of them  i say the hard days of winter are a fit time to turn mens hearts to christ their kingthe fittest of all times for a clergyman to get up in his pulpit as i do now and tell his people as i tell you that jesus christ your king has not forgotten youthat he is coming speedily to judge the world and execute justice and judgment for the meek of the earth  now do not be in a hurry and fancy from what i have just said that i am one of those who think the end of the world is at hand  it may be for aught i know  of that day and that hour knoweth no man not even the angels of god nor the son but the father only  if you wish for my own opinion i believe that what people commonly call the end of the world that is the end of the earth and of mankind on it is not at hand at all  as far as i can judge from scripture and from the history of all nations the earth is yet young and mankind in its infancy  five thousand years hence our descendants may be looking back on us as foolish barbarians in comparison with what they know  just as we look back upon the ignorance of people a thousand years ago  and yet i believe that the end of this world in the real scripture sense of the word world is coming very quickly and very trulythe end of this system of society of these present ways in religion and moneymaking and conducting ourselves in all the affairs of life which we english people have got into nowadays the end of it is coming  it cannot last much longer for it is destroying itself  it will not last much longer for christ and not the devil is the king of the earth  as st paul said to his people so say i to you the night is far spent the day is at hand  these may seem strange words but almost every one is saying them in his own way  one large party among religious people in these days is complaining that christ has left his church and that the cause of christianity will be ruined and lost unless some great change takes place  another large party of religious people say that the prophecies are on the point of being all fulfilled that the 1260 days spoken of by the prophet daniel are just coining to an end and that christ is coming with his saints to reign openly upon earth for a thousand years  the wisest philosophers and historians of late years have been all foretelling a great and tremendous change in england and throughout all europe and in the meantime manufacturers and landlords tradesmen and farmers artisans and labourers all say that there must be a change and will be a change i believe they are all right every one of them  they put it in their words i think it better to put it in the scripture words and say boldly jesus christ the king of the earth is coming  but you will ask what right have you to stand up and say anything so surprising  my friends the world is full of surprising things and this age above all ages  it was not sixty years ago that a nobleman was laughed at in the house of lords for saying that he believed that we should one day see ships go by steam and now there are steamers on every sea and ocean in the world  who expected twenty years ago to see the whole face of england covered with these wonderful railroads  who expected on the 22nd of february last year that within a single month half the nations of europe which looked so quiet and secure would be shaken from top to bottom with revolution and bloodshedkings and princes vanishing one after the other like a dreampoor men sitting for a day as rulers of kingdoms and then hurled down again to make room for other rulers as unexpected as themselves  can anyone consider the last fifty years can anyone consider that one last year 1848 and then not feel that we do live in a most strange and awful time a time for which nothing is too surprisinga time in which we all ought to be prepared from the least to the greatest to see the greatest horrors and the greatest blessings come suddenly upon us like a thief in the night so much for christs coming being too wonderful a thing to happen just now  still you are right to ask  what do you mean by christs being our king what do you mean by his coming to us  what reason have you for supposing that he is coming now rather than at any other time  and if he be coming what are we to do  what is there we ought to repent of what is there we ought to amend  well my friendsit is just these very questions which i hope and trust god will help me to answer to you in my next few sermonsi am perfectly convinced that we must get them answered and act upon them speedily  i am perfectly convinced that if we go on as most of us are going in england now the lord of us all will come in an hour when we are not aware and cut us asunder in the deepest and most real sense as he came and cut asunder france germany and austria only last year and appoint us our portion with the unbelievers  and i believe that our punishment will be seven times as severe as that of either france germany or austria because we have had seven times their privileges and blessings seven times their gospel light and christian knowledge seven times their freedom and justice in laws and constitution seven times their wealth and prosperity and means of employing our population  much has been given to england and of her much will be required  and if you could only see the state of mankind over the greatest part of the globe how infinitely fewer opportunities they have of knowing gods will than you have you would feel that to you poor and struggling as some of you are to you much has been given and of you much will be required  now first what do i mean by christ being our king  i daresay there are some among you who are inclined to think that when we talk of christ being a king that the word king means something very different from its common meaningand god knows that that is true enough  our blessed lord took care to make people understand that how he was not like one of the kings of the nations how his kingdom was not of this world  but yet the bible tells us again and again that all good kings all real kings are patterns of christ and therefore that when we talk of christ being a king we mean that he is a king in everything that a king ought to be that he fulfils perfectly all the duties of a king that he is the pattern which all kings ought to copy  kings have been in all ages too apt to forget that and indeed so have the people too  we english have forgotten most thoroughly in these days that christ is our king or even a king at all  we talk of christ being a spiritual king and then we say that that merely means that he is king of christians hearts and when anyone asks what that means it comes out that all we mean is that christ has a very great influence over the hearts of believing christianswhen he can obtain it or else that it means that he is king of a very small number of people called the elect whom he has chosen out but that he has absolutely nothing to do with the whole rest of the world  and then when anyone stands up with the bible in his hand and says in the plain words of scripture christ is not only the king of believers he is the king of the whole earth the king of the clouds and the thunder the king of the land and the cattle and the trees and the corn and to whomsoever he will he giveth them  christ is not only the king of believershe is the king of allthe king of the wicked of the heathen of those who do not believe him who never heard of him  christ is not only the king of a few individual persons one here and one there in every parish but he is the king of every nation  he is the king of england by the grace of god just as much as queen victoria is and ten thousand times more  if any man talks in this way people starethink him an enthusiastask him what new doctrine this is and call his words unscriptural just because they come out of scripture and not out of mens perversions and twistings of scripture  nevertheless christ is king really and truly king of kings and lord of lords and he will make men know it  what he was that he is and ever will be there is no change in him his kingdom is an everlasting kingdom and his dominion endureth throughout all ages and woe unto those small or great who rebel against him  but what sort of a king is he  he is a king of law and order and justice  he is not selfish fanciful selfwilled  he said himself that he came not to do his own will but his fathers  he is a king of gentleness and meekness too  but do not mistake that  there is no weak indulgence in him  a man may be very meek and yet stern enough and strong enough  moses was the meekest of men we read and yet he made those who rebelled against him feel that he was not to be trifled with  korah dathan and abiram found that to their cost he would not even spare his own brother aaron his own sister miriam when they rebelled  and he was right  he showed his love by it indulgence is not love  it is no sign of meekness but only of cowardice and carelessness to be afraid to rebuke sin  moses knew that he was doing gods work that he was appointed to make a great nation of those slavish besotted jews his countrymen that he was sent by god with boundless blessings to them and woe to whoever hindered him from that  because he loved the jews therefore he dared punish those who tempted them to forget the promised land of canaan or break gods covenant in which lay all their hope  and such a one is our king my friends jesus christ the son of god like moses says st paul he is faithful in all his office therefore he is severe as well as gentle  he was so when on earth with the poor the outcast the neglected those on whom men trampled who was gentler than the lord jesus  to the proud pharisee the canting scribe the cunning herodian who was sterner than the lord jesus  read that awful 23rd chapter of st matthew and then see how the saviour the lamb dumb before his shearers he of whom it was said he shall not strive nor cry nor shall his voice be heard in the streetshow he could speak when he had occasion    woe unto you scribes and pharisees hypocrites  ye serpents ye generation of vipers how can ye escape the damnation of hell  my friends those were the words of our king of him in whom was neither passion nor selfishness who loved us even to the death and endured for us the scourge the cross the grave  and believe me such are his words now though we do not hear him the heaven and the earth hear him and obey him  his message is pardon mercy deliverance to the sorrowful and the oppressed and the neglected and to the proud the tyrannical the selfrighteous the hypocritical tribulation and anguish shame and woe  because he is the saviour therefore he is a consuming fire to all those who try to hinder him from saving men  because he is the son of god he will sweep out of his fathers kingdom all who offend and whosoever maketh and loveth a lie  because he is boundless mercy and love therefore he will show no mercy to those who try to stop his purposes of love  because he is the king of men the enemies of mankind are his enemies and he will reign till he has put them all under his feet    iiholy scripture    second sunday in advent  whatsoever things were written aforetime were written for our example that we through patience and comfort of the scriptures might have hoperomans xv 4  whatsoever was written aforetime  there is no doubt i think that by these words st paul means the bible that is the old testament which was the only part of the bible already written in his time for it is of the psalms which he is speaking  he mentions a verse out of the 69th psalm the reproaches of him that reproached thee fell on me which he says applies to christ just as much as it did to david who wrote it  christ he says pleased not himself any more than david but suffered willingly and joyfully for gods sake because he knew that he was doing gods work  and we he goes on to say must do the same do as christ did we must not please ourselves but every one of us please our brother for his good and edification that is in order to build him up strengthen him make him wiser better more comfortable  for he says christ pleased not himself but like david lived only to help others and therefore this verse out of davids psalms the reproaches of them that reproached thee fell on me is a lesson to us a pattern of what we ought to feel and do and suffer  for whatsoever was written aforetime all these ancient psalms and prophets and histories of men and nations who trusted in god were written for our example that we through patience and comfort of the scriptures might have hope  yes my friends this is true and the longer you live a life of faith and godliness the longer you read and study that precious book of books which god has put so freely into your hands in these days the more true you will find it  and if it was true of the old testament written before the lord came down and dwelt among men how much more must it be true of the new testament which was written after his coming by apostles and evangelists who had far fuller light and knowledge of the lord than ever david or the old prophets even in their happiest moments had  ah what a treasure you have every one of you in those bibles of yours which too many of you read so little  from the first chapter of genesis to the last of revelations it is all written for our example all profitable for teaching for reproof for correction for instruction in righteousness that the man of god may be perfect thoroughly furnished for all good works  ah friends friends is not this the reason why so many of you do not read your bibles that you do not wish to be furnished for good worksdo not wish to be men of god godly and godlike men but only to be men of the world caring only for money and pleasuresome of you alas not wishing to be men and women at all but only a sort of brute beasts with clothes on given up to filth and folly like the animals that perish or rather worse than the animals for they could be no better if they tried but you might be  oh what might you not be what are you not already if you but knew it  members of christ children of god heirs of the kingdom of heaven heirs of a hope undying pure that will never fade away having a right given you by the promise and oath of almighty god himself to hope for yourselves for your neighbours for this poor distracted world for ever and ever a right to believe that there is an everlasting day of justice and peace and happiness in store for the whole world and that you if you will may have your share in that glorious sunrise which shall never set again  you may have your share in it each and every one of you and if you ask why go to the scriptures and there read the promises of god the grounds of your just hope for all heaven and earth  first of hope for yourselvesi say first for yourselves not because a man is right in being selfish and caring only for his own soul but because a man must care for his own soul first if he ever intends to care for others a man must have hope for himself first if he is to have hope for others  he may stop there and turn his religion into a selfish superstition and spend his life in asking all day long shall i be saved shall i be damned or worse still in chuckling over his own good fortune and saying to himself i shall be saved whoever else is damned but whether he ends there or not he must begin there begin by trying to get himself saved  for if he does not know what is right and good for himself how can he tell what is right and good for others  if he wishes to bring his neighbours out of their sins he must surely first have been brought out of his own sins and so know what forgiveness and sanctification means  if he wishes to make others at peace with god he must first be at peace with god himself to know what gods peace is  if he wants to teach others their duty he must first know his own duty for all mens duty is one and the same  if he wishes to have hope for the world he must first have hope for himself for he is in the world a part of it and he must learn what blessings god intends for him and they will teach him what blessings god has in store for the earth  faith and hope like charity must begin at home  by learning the corruption of our own hearts we learn the corruption of human nature  by learning what is the only medicine which can cure our own sick hearts we learn what is the only medicine which can cure human nature  we learn by our own experience that god is all forgiving love that his peace shines bright upon the soul which casts itself utterly on jesus christ the lord for pardon strength and safety that gods spirit is ready and able to raise us out of all our sin and sottishness and weakness and wilfulness and selfishness and renew us into quite new men different characters from what we used to be and so by having hope for ourselves we learn step by step and year by year to have hope for our friends for our neighbours and for the whole world  for that is another great lesson which the bible teaches ushope for the world  men say to us this world has always gone on ill and will always go on so  tyrants and knaves and hypocrites have always had the power in it idlers have always had the enjoyment of it while the humble and industrious and godly who would not foul their hands with the wicked ways of the world have been always laughed at neglected oppressed persecuted  the world they say is very bad and we cannot live in it without giving way a little to its badness and going the old road  but he who through patience and comfort of the scriptures has hope can answer yesand yet no  yeswe agree that the world has gone on badly enough  perhaps we think the world worse than it thinks itself for gods spirit has taught us to see sin and shame and ruin in many a thing which the world thinks right and reasonable and yet says the true christian man although we think the world worse than anyone else thinks it and are more unhappy than anyone else about all the sin and injustice and misery we see in it we have the very strongest faithwe are perfectly certainwe are as sure as if we saw it coming to pass here before us that the world will come right at last  for the bible tells us that the son of god is the king of the world that he has been the master and ruler of it from the beginning  he the bible tells us condescended to come down on earth and be born in the likeness of a poor man and die on the cross for this poor world of his that he might take away the sins of it  behold the lamb of god said john the baptist who takes away the sin of the world  how dare we who call ourselves christians we who have been baptized into his name we who have tasted of his mercy we who know the might of his love the converting and renewing power of his spirithow dare we doubt but that he will take away the sins of the world  ay step by step nation by nation year by year the lord shall conquer love and justice and wisdom shall spread and grow for he must reign till he has put all enemies under his feet  he has promised to take away the sins of the world and he is god and cannot lie  there is the christians hope  let him leave infidels to say the world always was bad and it must remain so to the end the christian ought to be able to answer the world was bad and is bad but for that very reason it will not remain so to the end  for the lord and king of the earth is boundless love justice goodness itself and he will thoroughly purge his floor and cast out of his kingdom all things that offend and make in his good time the kingdoms of this world the kingdoms of god and of his christ  ah but someone may say that if it ever happens at all will not happen till we are dead and what part or lot shall we have in it we who die in the midst of all this sin and injustice and distress there again the bible gives us hope  i believe says the creed in the resurrection of the flesh  the bible teaches us to believe that we each of us as human beings men and women shall have a share in that glorious day not merely as ghosts and disembodied spiritsof which the bible thanks be to god says little or nothing but as real live human beings with new bodies of our own on a new earth under a new heaven  therefore says david my flesh shall rest in hope not merely my soul my ghost but my flesh  for the lord who not only died but rose again with his body shall raise our bodies according to the mighty working by which he subdues all things to himself and then the whole manhood of each of us body soul and spirit shall have one perfect consummation and bliss in his eternal and everlasting glorythat is our hope  if that is not a gospel and good news from heaven to poor distressed creatures in hovels and on sick beds to people racked with lifelong pain and disease to people in crowded cities who never from weeks end to weeks end look on the green fields and bright skyif that is not good news and a dayspring of boundless hope from on high for them what news can be  but how are we to get this hope  the text tells us through comfort of the scriptures through the strengthening and comforting promises and examples and rules of gods gracious dealings which we find therein  through comfort of the scriptures but also through patience  ah my friends of that too we must think we must as st james says let patience have her perfect work or else we shall not be perfect ourselves  if we are hasty selfconceited covetous ready to help ourselves by the first means that come to hand if we are full of hard judgments about our neighbours and doubts about gods good purpose toward the world in short if we are not patient the bible will teach us little or nothing  it may make us superstitious bigoted fanatical conceited pharisaical but like jesus christ the lord it will not make us unless we have patience  and where are we to get patience  god knows it is hard in such a world as this for poor creatures to be patient always  but faith can breed patience though patience cannot breed itselfand faith in whom  faith in our father in heaven even in the almighty god himself  he calls himself the god of patience and consolation pray for his holy spirit and he will make you patient pray for his holy spirit and he will console and comfort you  he has promised that spirit of his the spirit of love trust and patiencethe comforterto as many as ask him  ask him now this daycome to his holy table this day and ask him to make you patient ask him to take all the hastiness and pride and illtemper and selfwill and greediness out of you and to change your wills into the likeness of his will  then your eyes will be opened to understand his law  then you will see in the scriptures a sure promise of hope and glory and redemption for yourself and all the world  then you will see in the blessed sacrament of the lords body and blood a sure sign and warrant handed down from land to land and age to age from year to year and from father to son that these promises shall come true that hope shall become fact that not one of the lords words shall fail or pass away till all be fulfilled    iiithe kingdom of god    third sunday in advent  the spirit of the lord is upon me because the lord has anointed me to preach good tidings to the meek he has sent me to bind up the brokenhearted to proclaim liberty to the captives and the opening of the prison to them that are boundisaiah lxi 1  my friends i do entreat those of you who wish to get any real good from this sermon to listen to me carefully all through it  not that i have to complain of you in general for not attending to me  i thank god and thank you that you do listen to what is said in this pulpit  but there are many people who have a bad trick of minding the preacher carefully enough for a minute or two and then letting their wits wander and think about something else and then if any word in the sermon strikes them waking up suddenly and thinking again for a little and then letting their thoughts run wild again and so on  whereby it happens that they only recollect a few scraps of the sermon a word here and a sentence there and get into their heads all sorts of mistakes and false notions about the preachers meaning  that is not right that is not worthy of reasonable grown men  that is only pardonable in little scatterbrained children  men and women should listen steadily reverently throughout so and so only will they be able to judge of the message which the preacher brings them listen to me therefore all through this sermon and may god give you grace to understand it and lay it to heart for it is the good news of the kingdom of god  you recollect i hope that i have often told you that the lord jesus christs words would never pass away that his prophecies are continually coming true and being fulfilled over and over again now this text is not one of his prophecies but it is a prophecy about him one which he fulfilled and which he has been fulfilling again and again  he is fulfilling it as i believe more than ever now in these very days  if you will look at the 61st chapter of isaiah you will find this prophecy and you will find too what will surprise you at first that isaiah was speaking of himself  he says that the spirit of the lord was upon himisaiahbecause the lord had appointed him to preach good tidings to the meek to bind up the brokenhearted and deliverance to the captives to preach the acceptable year of the lord  isaiah must have spoken truly about himself  he could not have meant to tell a falsehood to say a thing was true of himself which was only true of jesus who did not come till 800 years afterwards  and he did speak the truth  you cannot read his prophecies without seeing that the spirit of the lord was indeed upon him that the words which he spoke must have comforted all those who were sorrowing for their sins and the sins of the nation in their time  we know for a fact that his prophecies came true that the jewish captives were delivered and brought back out of judaea to jerusalem again and that jerusalem was rebuilt as isaiah prophesied and the jewish nation raised to far greater holiness and prosperity and happiness than it had ever been in before  and yet 800 years afterwards the lord took those very same words to himself and said that he fulfilled them  he read them aloud once in a jewish synagogue out of the book of the prophet isaiah and then told the congregation this day is the scripture fulfilled in your ears and again as we read in the gospel for this day when john the baptist sent to ask him if he was really the christ he made use of another prophecy of isaiah and told johns disciples that he was the christ because he was fulfilling that prophecy because he was making the deaf hear and the blind see and preaching the gospel to the poor  now how is that  could isaiah be right in applying those words to himself and yet christ be right in applying them to himself  can a prophecy be fulfilled twice over  no doubt it can my friends and two hundred times over  no prophecy of scripture is of private interpretation says st peter  that is it does not apply to any one private particular thing that is to happen  every prophecy of scripture goes on fulfilling itself more and more as time rolls on and the world grows older  st peter tells us the reason why  no prophecy of scripture is of private interpretation because it does not come from the will of man from any invention or discovery of poor shortsighted human beings who can only judge by what they see around them in their own times  but holy men of old spoke as they were moved by the holy spirit  and who is the holy spirit  the spirit of god the everlasting spirit the spirit who cannot change for he is god  the spirit who searcheth the deep things of god and teaches them to men  and what are the deep things of god  they are eternal as god is  eternal laws everlasting rules which cannot alter  that is the meaning of it all the spirit of god is the spirit which teaches men the laws of god the unchangeable rules and ordinances by which he governs all heaven and earth and men and nations the laws which come into force not once only but always the laws of god which are working round us now just as much as they were eighteen hundred years ago just as much as they were in isaiahs time  therefore it is that i said that these old jewish prophecies which were inspired by the holy spirit are coming true now and will keep on coming true time after time in their proper place and order and whensoever the times are fit for them even to the end of the world  but again we read that the spirit of god takes of the things of christ and shows them unto us  and what are the things of christ they must be eternal things unchangeable things for christ is unchangeablejesus christ the same yesterday today and for ever he is over all god blessed for ever  to him all power is given in heaven and earth  he reigns and he will reign  do you think he is less a saviour now than he was when he spoke those things to johns disciples  do you think he is less able to hear and to help than he was in johns time  do you think he used to care about peoples bodies then but that he only cares about their souls now  do you think that he is less compassionate and less merciful as well as less powerful than he was when he made the blind see and the lame walk and the deaf hear in judaea of old  less powerful less compassionate  one would have expected that christ was more powerful more compassionate if that were possible at least one would expect that his power and compassion would show itself more and more and make itself felt more and more year by year and age by age more and more healing disease more and more comforting sorrow more and still more casting out cunning and evil spirits till he had put all under his feet  he himself said it should be so  he always spoke of his own kingdom as a thing which was to grow and increase by laws of its own men knew not how but he knew  like seed cast into the ground his kingdom was he said at first the smallest of all seeds but it was to grow and take root and spread into a mighty tree he said till the very birds in the air lodged in the branches of it and davids words should be fulfilled thou lord shalt save both man and beast  and does not st paul speak of his kingdom in the same way as a kingdom which should grow that he was to reign till he had put all enemies under his feet that he would deliver at last the whole creation the earth on which we stand the dumb animals around us  for as st paul says the whole creation is groaning in labourpangs waiting to be raised into a higher state  and it shall be raised  the whole creation shall be set free into the glorious liberty of the children of god  what does that mean  how can i tell you  this i can tell you that it cannot mean that jesus christ was merciful enough to heal peoples bodies at first but that he has given up doing it now and will never do it again  well but some would say what does all this come to  you are merely telling us what we knew beforethat if any of us are cured from disease or raised up from a sick bed it is all the lords doing  if you do believe that really my friends happy are you  many of you i think do believe it  the poor are more inclined to believe it i think than the rich  but even in the mouths of the poor one often hears words which make one suspect that they do not believe it  i am very much afraid that a great many have got into the trick of saying that it was gods mercy that they were cured and that it pleased the lord to raise them up from a sick bed very much as a piece of cant they say the words by rote because they have been accustomed to hear them said by others without thinking of the meaning of them just as on the other hand a great many people curse and swear without thinking of the awful oaths they use  ay and often enough the very same persons will say that it was the lords mercy they were cured of their sickness and then if they get into a passion pray the very same lord to do that to the bodies and souls of their neighbours which it is a shame to speak of here  out of the same mouth proceed blessings and cursings  showing that whether or not they are in earnest in cursing they are not earnest in blessing  again  if people really believed that it was the lord jesus christ who cured their sicknesses for them they would behave when they got well more as the lord jesus christ would wish them to behave  they would show forth their thankfulness not only with their lips but in their lives  you who believeyou who saythat christ has cured your sicknesses show your faith by your works  live like those who are alive again from the dead who are not your own but bought with a price and bound to work for god with your bodies and your spirits which are histhen and then only can either god or man believe you  again  there is a third reason which makes one suspect that people do not mean what they say about this matter  i think too many say it has pleased god merely as an empty form of words when all they mean is what must be must and it cannot be helped  else why do they say it has pleased the lord to send me sickness  what is the use of saying it has pleased the lord to cure me when you say in the same breath it has pleased the lord to make me ill  i know you will say that of course whatever happens must be the lords will if it did not please him it would not happen  i do not care for such words i will have nothing to do with them  i will neither entangle you nor myself in those endless disputings and questions about freewill and necessity which never yet have come to any conclusion and never will because they are too deep for poor short sighted human beings like us  to the law and to the testimony say i  i will hold to the words of the bible what it says i will say what it does not say i will not say to please any mans system of doctrines  and i say from the bible that we have no more right to say it has pleased the lord to make me sick than it has pleased the lord to make me a sinner  scripture everywhere speaks of sickness as a real evil and a cursea breaking of the health and order and strength and harmony of gods creation  it speaks of madmen as possessed with evil spirits did that please god  the woman who was bowed with a spirit of infirmity and could not lift herself updid our lord say that it had pleased god to make her a wretched cripple  no he spoke of her as this daughter of israel whom satan had bound and not god this eighteen years and that was his reason for healing her even on the sabbathday because her disease was not the work of god but of the cruel disordering destroying evil spirit which is at enmity with god  that was why christ cured her  and thatfor this is the point i have been coming to step by stepthat was the reason why when john the baptist sent to ask if jesus was the christ our lord answered  go and show john again those things which ye do see and hear  the blind receive their sight and the lame walk the lepers are cleansed and the deaf hear the dead are raised up and the poor have the gospel preached to them  do not be in a hurry my friends and suppose that our lord meant merely  tell john what wonderful miracles i am working  if he had meant that why would he have put in as the last proof that he was the christ that he was preaching the gospel to the poor  what wonderful miracle was there in that  no  it was as if he had said  go and tell john that i am the christ because i am the great physician the healer and deliverer of body and soul  one who will and can cure the loathsome diseases the uselessness the misery the ignorance of the poorest and meanest  he has proved himself the christ by showing not only his boundless power but his boundless love and mercy and that not only to mens souls but to their bodies also  to prove himself the christ by wonderful and astonishing miracles was exactly what he would not do  he refused when the scribes and pharisees came and asked of him a sign from heaven to prove that he was christ wanting him i suppose to bring some apparition or fiery comet or great voice out of the sky to astonish them with his power he told them peremptorily that he would give them no such thing  and yet he said that his mighty works did prove him to be christ he pronounced woe against chorazin and bethsaida for not believing him on account of his mighty works  he told the scribes and pharisees that they ought to believe on him merely for his works sake  and why would they not believe on him  just because they could not see that gods power was shown more in healing and delivering sufferers than in astonishing and destroying  they could not see that gods perfect likeness shone out in christthat he was the express image of the father just because he went about doing good and healing all manner of sicknesses and all manner of infirmities among the people  but so it is my friends  jesus is the saviour the deliverer the great physician the healer of soul and body  not a pang is felt or a tear shed on earth but he sorrows over it  not a human being on earth dies young but he as i believe sorrows over it  what it is which prevents him healing every sickness soothing every sorrow wiping away every tear now we cannot tell  but this we can tell that it is his will that none should perish  this we can tell that he is willing as ever to heal the sick to cleanse the leper to cast out devils to teach the ignorant to bind up the brokenhearted  this we can tell that he will go on doing so more and more year by year and age by age  this we can tell from scripture that christ is stronger than the devil  this we can tell that christ and all good men the spirits of just men made perfect the wise and the great in gods sight who have left us their books their sayings their writings as precious healthgiving heirloomshave been fighting and are fighting and will fight to the end against the devil and sin and oppression and misery and disease and everything which spoils and darkens the face of gods good earth  and this we can tell that they will conquer at the last because christ is stronger than the devil good is stronger than evil light is stronger than darkness gods spirit the giver of life and health and order is stronger than all the evil customs and ignorance and carelessness and cruelty and superstition which makes miserable the lives and as far as we can see destroys the souls of thousands  yes i say christs kingdom is a kingdom of health and deliverance for body and soul and it will conquer and it will spread and it will grow till the nations of the world have become the kingdoms of god and of his christ  christ reigns and christ will reign till he has put all his enemies under his feet and the last of his enemies which shall be destroyed is death  death is his enemy  he has conquered death by rising from the dead  and the day will come when death will be no morewhen sickness and sorrow shall be unknown and god shall wipe away tears from all eyes  i say it againnever forget itchrist is king and his kingdom is a kingdom of health and life and deliverance from all evil  it always has been so from the first time our lord cured the leper in galilee it will be so to the end of the world  and thereforeto come back to the very place from which i started at the beginning of my sermontherefore whenever one of the days of the lord is at hand whenever gods kingdom makes a great step forward this same prophecy in our text is fulfilled in some striking and wonderful way  and i say it is fulfilled now in these days more than it ever has been  christ is healing the sick cleansing the leper giving sight to the blind raising the dead and preaching the gospel to the poor seven times more in these days in which we live than he did when he walked upon earth in judaea  do you doubt my words  at all events you confess that the cure of all diseases comes from christ  then consider i beseech you how many more diseases are cured now than were formerly  one may say that the knowledge of medicine is not one hundred years old nothing my friends makes me feel more strongly what a wonderful and blessed time we live in and how christ is showing forth mighty works among us than this same sudden miraculous improvement in the art of healing which has taken place within the memory of man  any country doctor now knows more thank god or ought to know than the greatest london physicians did two generations ago  new cures for deafness blindness lameness every disease that flesh is heir to are being discovered year by year  oh my friends you little know what christ is doing among you for your bodies as well as for your souls  there is not a parish in england now in which the poorest as well as the richest are not cured yearly of diseases which if they had lived a hundred years ago would have killed them without hope or help  and then when one looks at these great and blessed plans for what is called sanitary reform at the sickness and the misery which has been done away with already by attending to them even though they have only just begun to be put in practiceour hearts must be hard indeed if we do not feel that christ is revealing to us the gifts of healing far more bountifully and mercifully than even he did to the first apostles  but you will say perhaps the dead are not raised in these days oh my friends which shows christs mercy most to raise those who are already dead or to save those alive who are about to die  those in this church who have read history know as well as i how in our forefathers time people died in england by thousands of diseases which are scarcely ever deadly now ay of diseases which have now actually vanished out of the land before the new light of medicine and of civilisation which christ has revealed to us in these days for one child who lived and grew up in old times two live and grow up now  in london alone there are not half as many deaths in proportion to the number of people as there were a hundred years ago and is not that a mightier work of christs power and love than if he had raised a few dead persons to life  and now for the last part of our lords witness about himself  to the poor the gospel is preached  oh my friends is not that coming true in our days as it never came true before  look back only fifty years and consider the difference between the doctrines which were preached to the poor and the doctrines which are preached to them now  look round you and see how everywhere earnest and godly ministers have sprung up of all sects and opinions as well as of the church of england not only to preach the gospel in the pulpit but to carry it to the sick bedside of the lonely cottage to the prison and to those fearful sties worse than prisons where in our great cities the heathen poor live crowded together  look at the teaching which the poor man can get now compared to what he used to the sermons the bibles the tracts the lending libraries the schoolsjust consider the hundreds of thousands of pounds which are subscribed every year to educate the children of the poor and then say whether christ is not working a mighty work among us in these days  i know that not half as much is done as ought to be done in that way not half as much as will be done and what is done will have to be done better than it has been done yet but still can anyone in this church who is fifty years old deny that there is a most enormous and blessed improvement which is growing and spreading every year  can anyone deny that the gospel is preached to the poor now in a way that it never was before within the memory of man  now recollect that this is an advent sermona sermon which proclaims to you that christ is come yes he is comecome never to leave mankind again  christ reigns over the earth and will reign for ever  at certain great and important times in the worlds history like this present time times which he himself calls days of the lord he shows forth his power and the mightiness and mercy of his kingdom more than at others  but still he is always with us we have no need to run up and down to look for christ  to say who shall ascend into heaven to bring him down  who shall descend into the deep to bring him up  for the kingdom of god as he told us himself is among us and within us  yes within us  all these wonderful improvements and discoveries all things beneficial to men which are found out year by year though they seem to be of mens invention are really of christs revealing the fruits of the kingdom of god within us of the spirit of god who is teaching men though they too often will not believe it though they disclaim gods spirit and take all the glory to themselves  truly christ is among us and our eyes are held and we see him not  that is our english sinthe sin of unbelief the root of every other sin  christ works among us and we will not own him  truly jesus christ may well say of us english at this day there were ten cleansed but where are the nine  how few are there who return to give glory to god  oh consider what i say the kingdom of god is among us now its blessings are growing richer fuller among us every day  beware lest if we refuse to acknowledge that kingdom and christ the king of it it be taken away from us and given to some other nation who will bring forth the fruits of it fellowhelp and brotherly kindness purity and sobriety and all the fruits of the spirit of god    iva preparation for christmas    fourth sunday in advent  rejoice in the lord alwaysphilippians iv 4  this is the beginning of the epistle for today the sunday before christmas  we will try to find out why it was chosen for today and what lesson we may learn from it  now christmastime was always a time of rejoicing among many heathen nations and long before the lord jesus christ came  that was natural and reasonable enough if you will consider it  for now the shortest day is past  the sun is just beginning to climb higher and higher in the sky each day and bring back with him longer sunshine and shorter darkness and spring flowers and summer crops and a whole new year with new hopes new work new lessons new blessings the old year with all its labours and all its pleasures and all its sorrows and all its sins is dying all but gone  it lies behind us never to return  the tears which we shed we never can shed again the mistakes we made we have a chance of mending in the year to come  and so the heathens felt and rejoiced that another year was dying another year going to be born  and christmas was a time of rejoicing too because the farming work was done  the last years crop was housed the next years wheat was sown the cattle were safe in yard and stall and men had time to rest and draw round the fire in the long winter nights and make merry over the earnings of the past year and the hopes and plans of the year to come  and so over all this northern half of the world christmas was a merry time  but the poor heathens did not know the lord  they did not know who to thank for all their christmas blessings  and so some used to thank the earth for the crops and the sun for coming back again to lengthen the days as if the earth and sun moved of themselves  and some used to thank false gods and ancient heroes who perhaps never really lived at all  and some perhaps the greater number thanked nothing and no one but just enjoyed themselves and took no thought as too many do now at christmastime  so the world went on christmas after christmas and the times of that ignorance as st paul says god winked at  but when the fulness of time was come he sent forth his son made of a woman to be the judge and ruler of the world and commanded all men everywhere to repent and turn from all their vanities to serve the living god who had made heaven and earth and all things in them  he did not wish them to give up their christmas mirth  no  all along he had been trying to teach them by it about his love to them as st paul told them once god had not left himself without witness in that he gave them rain and fruitful seasons filling their hearts with joy and gladness  god did not wish them or us to give up christmas mirth  the apostles did not wish it  the great men true followers of the apostles who shaped our prayerbook for us and sealed it with their lifeblood did not wish it  they did not wish farmers labourers servants masters to give up one of the old christmas customs but to remember who made christmas and its blessings in short to rejoice in the lord  our forefathers had been thanking the wrong persons for christmas  henceforward we were to thank the right person the lord and rejoice in him  our forefathers had been rejoicing in the sun and moon and earth in wise and valiant kings who had lived ages before in their own strength and industry and cunning  now they were to rejoice in him who made sun and moon and earth in him who sent wise and valiant kings and leaders in him who gives all strength and industry and cunning by whose inspiration comes all knowledge of agriculture and manufacture and all the arts which raise men above the beasts that perish  so their christmas joys were to go on year by year while the world lasted  but they were to go on rightly and not wrongly  men were to rejoice in the lord and then his blessing would be on them and the thanks and praise which they offered him he would return with interest in fresh blessings for the coming year  therefore i think this epistle was chosen for today the sunday before christmas to show us in whom we are to rejoice and therefore to show us how we are to rejoice  for we must not take the first verse of the epistle and forget the rest  that would neither be wise nor reverent toward st paul who wrote the whole and meant the whole to stand together as one discourse or to the blessed and holy men who chose it for our lesson on this day  let us go on then with the epistle line by line throughout  rejoice in the lord always and again i say rejoice  as much as to say you cannot rejoice too much you cannot overdo your happiness thankfulness merriment  you do not know halfno not the thousandth part of gods love and mercy to you and you never will know  so do not be afraid of being too happy or think that you honour god by wearing a sour face when he is heaping blessings on you and calling on you to smile and sing  but let your moderation be known unto all men  there is a right and a wrong way of being merry  there is a mirth which is no mirth whereof it is written in the midst of that laughter there is a heaviness and the end thereof is death  drunkenness gluttony indecent words and jests and actions these are out of place on christmasday and in the merriment to which the pure and holy lord jesus calls you all  they are rejoicing in the flesh and the devil and not in the lord at all and whosoever indulges in them and fancies them merriment is keeping the devils christmas and not jesus christs  so let your moderation be known to all men  be merry and wise  the fool lets his mirth master him and carry him away till he forgets himself and says and does things of which he is ashamed when he gets up next morning sick and sad at heart  the wise man remembers that let the occasion be as joyful a one as it may the lord is at hand christs eye is on him while he is eating and drinking and laughing  he is not afraid of christs eye because though it is divine it is a human loving smiling eye rejoicing in the happiness of his poor hardworked brothers here below  but he remembers that it is a holy eye too an eye which looks with sadness and horror on anything which is wrong on all drunkenness quarrelling indecency and so on in all his merriment he is still master of himself  he remembers that his soul is nobler than his body that his will must be stronger than his appetite and so he keeps himself in check he keeps his tongue from evil and his stomach from sottishness and though he may be and ought to be the merriest of the whole party yet he takes care to let his moderation his sobriety be known and plain to everyone remembering that the lord is at hand  and that mani will stand surety for himwill be the one who will rise from his bed next morning best able to carry out the next verse of the epistle and be careful for nothing  now that is no easy matter here in england to rich and poor christmas is the time for settling accounts and paying debts  and therefore in england where living is dear and everyone more or less struggling to pay his way christmas is often a very anxious disturbing time of year  many a family for all their economy cannot clear themselves at the years end and though they are able to forget that now and then thank god through great part of the year yet they cannot forget it at christmas  but as i said the man who at christmastime will be most able to be careful for nothing will be the man whose moderation has been known to everyone for he will if he has lived the year through in the same temper in which he has spent christmas have been moderate in his expenses he will have kept himself from empty show and pretending to be richer than he is  he will have kept himself from throwing away his money in drink and kept his daughters from throwing away money in dress which is just what too many in their foolish godless indecent hurry to get rid of their own children off their hands do not do  and he will be the man who will be in the best humour and have the clearest brain to kneel down when he gets up to his daily work and in everything by prayer and supplication make his requests known to god  and then whether he can make both ends meet or not whether he can begin next year free from debt or not still the peace of god will keep his heart  he may be unable to clear himself but still he will know that he has a loving and merciful father in heaven who has allowed distress and difficulty to come on him only as a lesson and an education  that this distress came because god chose and that when god chooses it will go awayand that till thenconsidering that the lord god sent itit had better not go away  he will believe that gods gracious promises stand truethat the lord will never let those who trust in him be confounded and brought to shamethat he will let none of us be tempted beyond what we are able but will always with the temptation make a way for us to escape that we may be able to bear it  and so the peace of god which passes understanding will keep that mans mind  and in whom  in jesus christ  now what did st paul mean by putting in the lord jesus christs name there what is the meaning of in jesus christ  this is what it means it means what christmasday means  a man may say your sermon promises fine things but i am miserable and poor it promises a holy and noble rejoicing to everyone but i am unholy and mean  it promises peace from god and i am sure i am not at peace  i am always fretting and quarrelling i quarrel with my wife my children and my neighbours and they quarrel with me and worst of all says the poor man i quarrel with myself  i am full of discontented angry sulky anxious unhappy thoughts my heart is dark and sad and restless within mewould god i were peaceful but i am not  look in my face and see  true my friend but on christmasday the son of god was born into the world a man like you  well says the poor man but what has that to do with my anxiety and my illtemper  it would take the whole year through my friend to show you all that it has to do with you and your unhappiness  all the lessons epistles and gospels of the year are set out to show you what it has to do with you  but in the meanwhile before christmasday comes consider this one thing  why are you anxious  because you do not know what is to happen to you  then christmasday is a witness to you that whatsoever happens to you happens to you by the will and rule of jesus christ the perfect man think of that  the perfect manwho understands mens hearts and wants and all that is good for them and has all the wisdom and power to give us what is good which we want ourselves  and what makes you unhappy my friends  is it not at heart just this one thingyou are unhappy because you are not pleased with yourselves  and you are not pleased with yourselves because you know you ought not to be pleased with yourselves and you know you ought not to be pleased with yourselves because you know in the bottom of your hearts that god is not pleased with you  what cure what comfort for such thoughts can we findthis  the child who was born in a manger on christmasday and grew up in poverty and had not where to lay his head went through all shame and sorrow to which man is heir  he jesus the poor child of bethlehem is lord and king of heaven and earth  he will feel for us he will understand our temptations he has been poor himself that he might feel for the poor he has been evil spoken of that he might feel for those whose tempers are sorely tried  he bore the sins and felt the miseries of the whole world that he might feel for us when we are wearied with the burden of life and confounded by the remembrance of our own sins  oh my friends consider only who was born into the world on christmasday and that thought alone will be enough to fill you with rejoicing and hope for yourselves and all the world and with the peace of god which passes understanding the peace which the angels proclaimed to the shepherds on the first christmas nighton earth peace and good will toward menand if god wills us good my friend what matter who wishes us evil    vchristmasday    he made himself of no reputation and took upon him the form of a slavephilippians ii 7  on christmasday 1851 years ago if we had been at rome the great capital city and mistress of the whole world we should have seen a strange sightstrange and yet pleasant  all the courts of law were shut no war was allowed to be proclaimed and no criminals punished the sorrow and the strife of that great city had stopped in great part for three days and all people were giving themselves up to merriment and good cheermaking up quarrels and giving and receiving presents from house to house  and we should have seen too a pleasanter sight than that  for those three days of christmastime were days of safety and merriment for the poor slaves tens of thousands of whommen women and childrenthe romans had brought out of all the countries in the worldmany of our forefathers and mothers among themand kept them there in cruel bondage and shame worked and fed bought and sold like beasts and not like human beings not able to call their lives or their bodies their own forced to endure any shame or sin which their tyrants required of them and liable any moment to be beaten tortured or crucified at the mercy of cruel and foul masters and mistresses  but on that christmasday according to an old custom they were allowed for once in the whole year to play at being free to dress in their masters and mistresses clothes to say what they thought of them boldly without fear of punishment and to eat and drink at their masters tables while their masters and mistresses waited on them it was an old custom that among the heathen romans which their forefathers who were wiser and better than they had handed down to them  they had forgotten perhaps what it meant  but still we may see what it must have meant  that the old forefathers of the romans had intended to remind their children every year by that custom that their poor hardworked slaves were after all men and women as much as their masters that they had hearts and consciences and sense in them and a right to speak what they thought as much as their masters that they as much as their masters could enjoy the good things of gods earth from which mans tyranny had shut them out and to remind those cruel masters by making them once every year wait on their own slaves at table that they were after all equal in the sight of god and that it was more noble for those who were rich and called themselves gentlemen to help others than to make others slave for them  i do not mean of course that those old heathens understood all this clearly  you will see by the latter part of my sermon why they could not understand it clearly  but there must have been some sort of dim confused suspicion in their minds that it was wrong and cruel to treat human beings like brute beasts which made them set up that strange old custom of letting their slaves play at being free once every christmastide  but if on this same day 1851 years ago instead of being in the great city of rome we had been in the little village of bethlehem in judaea we might have seen a sight stranger still a sight which we could not have fancied had anything to do with that merrymaking of the slaves at rome and yet which had everything to do with it  we should have seen in a mean stable among the oxen and the asses a poor maiden with her newborn baby laid in the manger for want of any better cradle and by her her husband a poor carpenter whom all men thought to be the father of her child     there in the stable amid the straw through the cold winter days and nights in want of many a comfort which the poorest woman and the poorest womans child would need they stayed there that young maiden and her newborn babe  that young maiden was the blessed virgin mary and that poor baby was the son of god  the son of god in whose likeness all men were made at the beginning the son of god who had been ruling the whole world all along who brought the jews out of slavery a thousand years before and destroyed their cruel tyrants in the red sea the son of god who had been all along punishing cruel tyrants and oppressors and helping the poor out of misery whenever they called on him  the light which lightens every man who comes into the world was that poor babe  it was he who gives men reason and conscience and a tender heart and delight in what is good and shame and uneasiness of mind when they do wrong  it was he who had been stirring up year by year in those cruel romans hearts the feeling that there was something wrong in grinding down their slaves and put into their minds the notion of giving them their christmas rest and freedom  he had been keeping up that good old custom for a witness and a warning that all men were equal in his sight that all men had a right to liberty of speech and conscience a right to some fair share in the good things of the earth which god had given to all men freely to enjoy  but those old romans would not take the warning  they kept up the custom but they shut their eyes to the lesson of it  they went on conquering and oppressing all the nations of the earth and making them their slaves  and now he was comehe himself the true lord of the earth the true pattern of men  he was come to show men to whom this world belonged  he was come to show men in what true power true nobleness consistednot in making others minister to us but in ministering to them  he was come to set a pattern of what a man should be he was the son of man the man of all menand therefore he had come with good news to all poor slaves and neglected hardworked creatures  he had come to tell them that he cared for them that he could and would deliver them that they were gods children and his brothers just as much as their roman masters and that he was going to bring a terrible time upon the earthdays of the son of man when he would judge all men and show who were true men and who were notsuch a time as had never been before or would be again when that great roman empire in spite of all its armies and its cunning and its riches plundered from every nation under heaven would crumble away and perish shamefully and miserably off the face of the earth before tribes of poor untaught savage men the brothers and countrymen of those very slaves whom the romans fancied were so much below them that they had a right to treat them like the beasts which perish  that was the message which that little child lying in the manger there at bethlehem had been sent out from god to preach  do you not see now what it had to do with that strange merrymaking of the poor slaves in rome which i showed you at the beginning of my sermon  if you do not i must remind you of the song which st luke says the shepherds in judaea heard the angels sing on this night 1851 years ago  that song tells us the meaning of that babes coming that song tells us what that babes coming had to do with the poor slaves of rome and with all poor creatures who have suffered and sorrowed on this earth before or since  glory to god in the highest they sang and on earth peace good will to men  glory to god in the highest  that little babe lying in the manger among the cattle was showing what was the very highest glory of the great god who had made heaven and earth  not to show his power and his majesty but to show his condescension and his love  to stoop to condescend to have mercy to forgive that is the highest glory of god  that is the noblest the most godlike thing for god or man and god showed that when he sent down his onlybegotten sonnot to strike the world to atoms with a touch not to hurl sinners into everlasting flame but to be born of a village maiden to take on himself all the shame and weakness and sorrow to which man is heir even to death itself to make himself of no reputation and take on himself the form of a slave and forgive sinners and heal the sick and comfort the outcast and despised that he might show what god was likeshow forth to men as a poor maidens son the brightness of gods glory and the express likeness of his person  and on earth peace they sang  men had been quarrelling and fighting then and men are quarrelling and fighting now  that little babe in the manger was come to show them how and why they were all to be at peace with each other  for what causes all the war and quarrelling in the world but selfishness  selfishness breeds pride passion spite revenge covetousness oppression  the strong care for themselves and try to help themselves at the expense of the weak by force and tyranny the weak care for themselves in their turn and try to help themselves at the expense of the strong by cunning and cheating  no one will condescend give way sacrifice his own interest for his neighbours and hence come wars between nations quarrels in families spite and grudges between neighbours but in the example of that little child of bethlehem jesus christ the lord god was saying to men acquaint yourselves with me and be at peace  god is not selfish it is our selfishness which has made us unlike god  god so loved the sinful world that he gave his only begotten son for it  is that an action like ours  the son of god so obeyed his father and so loved this world that he made himself of no reputation and took on him the likeness of a slave and became obedient to death even to the most fearful and shameful of all deaths the death of the cross not for himself but for those who did not know him hated him killed him  in short he sacrificed himself for us  that is gods likeness  selfsacrifice  jesus christ the babe of bethlehem proved himself the son of god and the express likeness of the father by sacrificing himself for us sacrifice yourselves then for each other  give up your own pride your own selfishness your own interest for each other and you will be all at peace at once  but the angels sang good will toward men  without that their song would not have been complete  for we are all ready to say at such words as i have been speaking ah pleasant enough and pretty enough if they were but possible but they are not possible  it is in the nature of man to be selfish  men have gone on warring grudging struggling competing oppressing cheating from the beginning and they will do so to the end  yes it is not in the nature of man to do otherwise  in as far as man yields to his nature and is like the selfish brute beasts it is not possible for him to do anything but go on quarrelling and competing and cheating to the last  but what mans nature cannot do gods grace can  gods good will is toward you  he loves you he willsand if he wills what is too hard for himhe wills to raise you out of this selfish quarrelsome life of sin into a loving brotherly peaceful life of righteousness  his spirit the spirit of love by which he made and guides all heaven and earth the spirit of love in which he gave his only son for you the spirit of love in which his son jesus christ sacrificed himself for you and took on himself a meaner state than any of you can ever havethe likeness of a slavethat spirit is promised to you and ready for you  that little baby in the manger at bethlehemgod sacrificing himself for you in the spirit of loveis a sign that that spirit of love is the spirit of god and therefore the only right spirit for you and me who are men and women made in the image of god  that babe in the manger at bethlehem is a sign to you and me that god will freely give us that spirit of love if we ask for it  for he would not have set us that example if he had not meant us to follow it and he would not ask us to follow it if he did not intend to give us the means of following it  therefore my friends it is written ask and ye shall receive  if your heavenly father spared not his own son but freely gave him for you will he not with him likewise freely give you all things  oh ask and you shall receive however poor ignorant sinful you may be gods promises are ready for you signed and sealed by the bread and wine on that table the memorial of jesus the babe of bethlehem  ask and you shall receive  comfort from sorrow peaceful assurance of gods good will toward you deliverance from your sins and a share in the likeness of him who on this day made himself of no reputation and took on him the form of a slave    vitrue abstinence    first sunday in lent  i keep under my body and bring it into subjection1 cor ix 27  in the collect for this day we have just been praying to god to give us grace to use such abstinence that our flesh being subdued to our spirit we may follow his godly motions  now we ought to have meant something when we said these words  what did we mean by them  perhaps some of us did not understand them they could not be expected to mean anything by them  but it is a sad thing a very sad thing that people will come to church sunday after sunday and repeat by rote words which they do not understand words by which they therefore mean nothing and yet never care or try to understand them  what are the words there for except to be understood  all of you call people foolish who submit to have prayers read in their churches in a foreign language which none at least of the poor can understand  but what right have you to call them foolish if you whose prayerbooks are written in english take no trouble to find out the meaning of them  would to heaven that you would try to find out the meaning of the prayerbook  would to heaven that the day would come when anyone in this parish who was puzzled by any doctrine of religion or by any text in the bible or word in the prayerbook would come confidently to me and ask me to explain it to him  god knows i should think it an honour and a pleasure as well as a duty  i should think no time better spent than in answering your questions  i do beseech you to ask me every one of you when and where you like any questions about religion which come into your minds  why am i put in this parish except to teach you and how can i teach you better than by answering your questions  as it is i am disheartened and all but hopeless at times about the state of this parish and the work i am trying to do here because though you will come and hear me thank god willingly enough you do not seem yet to have gained confidence enough in me or to have learnt to care sufficiently about the best things to ask questions of me about them  my dear friends if you wanted to get information about anything you really cared for you would ask questions enough if you wanted to know some way to a place on earth you would ask it why not ask your way to things better than this earth can give  but whether or not you will question me i must go on preaching to you though whether or not you care to listen is more alas than i can tell  but listen to me now i beseech you while i try to explain to you the meaning of the words which you have been just using in this collect  you have asked god to give you grace to use abstinence now what is the meaning of abstinence  abstinence means abstaining refraining keeping back of your own will from doing something which you might do  take an example  when a man for his healths sake or his purses sake or any other good reason drinks less liquor than he might if he chose he abstains from liquor  he uses abstinence about liquor  there are other things in which a man may abstain indeed he may abstain from doing anything he likes  he may abstain from eating too much from lying in bed too long from reading too much from taking too much pleasure from making money from spending money from right things from wrong things from things which are neither right nor wrong on all these he may use abstinence  he may abstain for many reasons for good ones or for bad ones  a miser will abstain from all sorts of comforts to hoard up money  a superstitious man may abstain from comforts because he thinks god grudges them to him or because he thinks god is pleased by the unhappiness of his creatures or because he has been taught poor wretch that if he makes himself uncomfortable in this life he shall have more comfort more honour more reason for pride and self glorification in the life to come  or a man may abstain from one pleasure just to be able to enjoy another all the more as some great gamblers drink nothing but water in order to keep their heads clear for cheating  all these are poor reasons some of them base some of them wicked reasons for abstaining from anything  therefore abstinence is not a good thing in itself for if a thing is good in itself it can never be wrong  love is good in itself and therefore you cannot love anyone for a bad reason  justice is good in itself pity is good in itself and therefore you can never be wrong in being just or pitiful  but abstinence is not a good thing in itself  if it were we should all be bound to abstain always from everything pleasant and make ourselves as miserable and uncomfortable as possible as some superstitious persons used to do in old times  abstinence is only good when it is used for a good reason  if a man abstains from pleasure himself to save up for his children if he abstains from over eating and over drinking to keep his mind clear and quiet if he abstains from sleep and ease in order to have time to see his business properly done if he abstains from spending money on himself in order to spend it for others if he abstains from any habit however harmless or pleasant because he finds it lead him towards what is wrong and put him into temptation then he does right then he is doing gods work then he may expect gods blessing then he is trying to do what we all prayed god to help us to do when we said give us grace to use such abstinence then he is doing more or less what st paul says he did keeping his body under and bringing it into subjection  for see the collect does not say give us grace to use abstinence as if abstinence were a good thing in itself but to use such abstinence thatto use a certain kind of abstinence and that for a certain purpose and that purpose a good one such abstinence that our flesh may be subdued to our spirit that our flesh the animal bodily nature which is in us loving ease and pleasure may not be our master but our servant so that we may not follow blindly our own appetites and do just what we like as brute beasts which have no understanding  and our flesh is to be subdued to our spirit for a certain purpose not because our flesh is bad and our spirit good not in order that we may puff ourselves up and admire ourselves and say as the philosophers among the heathen used what a strongminded sober selfrestraining man i am  how fine it is to be able to look down on my neighbours who cannot help being fond of enjoying themselves and cannot help caring for this worlds good things  i am above all that  i want nothing and i feel nothing and nothing can make me glad or sorry  i am master of my own mind and own no law but my own will  the collect gives us the true and only reason for which it is right to subdue our appetites which is that we may keep our minds clear and strong enough to listen to the voice of god within our hearts and reasons to obey the motions of gods spirit in us not to make our bodies our masters but to live as gods servants  this is st pauls meaning when he speaks of keeping under his body and bringing it into subjection  the exact word which he uses however is a much stronger one than merely keeping under it means simply to beat a mans face black and blue and his reason for using such a strong word about the matter is to show us that he thought no labour too hard no training too sharp which teaches us how to restrain ourselves and keep our appetites and passions in manful and godly control  now a few verses before my text st paul takes an example from footracers  these footracers he says heathens though they are and only trying to win a worthless prize the petty honour of a crown of leaves see what trouble they take how they exercise their limbs how careful and temperate they are in eating and drinking how much pain and fatigue they go through to get themselves into perfect training for a race  how much more trouble ought we to take to make ourselves fit to do gods work  for these footracers do all this only to gain a garland which will wither in a week but we to gain a garland which will never fade away a garland of holiness and righteousness and purity and the likeness of jesus christ  the next example of abstinence which st paul takes is from the prizefighters who were very numerous and very famous in the country in which the corinthians lived  i fight he says not like one who beats the air that is not like a man who is only brandishing his hands and sparring in jest but like a man who knows that he has a fight to fight in hard earnest a terrible lifelong fight against sin the world and the devil and therefore he says i do as these fighters do  they poor savage and brutal heathens as they are go through a long and painful training  their very practice is not play it is grim earnest  they stand up to strike and be struck and are bruised and disfigured as a matter of course in order that they may learn not to flinch from pain or lose their tempers or turn cowards when they have to fight  and so do i says st paul they poor men submit to painful and disagreeable things to make them brave in their paltry battles  i submit to painful and disagreeable things to make me brave in the great battle which i have to fight against sin and ignorance and heathendom  therefore he says in another place i take pleasure in afflictions in persecutions in necessities in distresses and that not because those things were pleasant they were just as unpleasant to him as to anyone else but because they taught him to bear taught him to be brave taught him in short to become a perfect man of god  this is st pauls account of his own training  in the epistle for today we have another account of it a description of the life which he led and which he was content to leadin much suffering in stripes in imprisonments in tumults in labours in watching in fastingsand an account too of the temper which he had learnt to show amid such a life of vexation and suffering and shame and dangerapproving himself in all things the minister of god by pureness by wisdom by longsuffering by kindness by the spirit of holiness by love unfeigned as dying and behold we live as chastened and not killed as sorrowful yet always rejoicing as poor yet making many rich as having nothing yet possessing all thingsin all things proving himself a true messenger from god by being able to dare and to endure for gods sake what no man ever would have dared and endured for his own sake  butsomeone may sayst paul was an apostle he had a great work to do in the world he had to turn the heathen to god and it is likely enough that he required to train himself and keep strict watch over all his habits and ways of thinking and behaving lest he should grow selfish lazy cowardly covetous fond of ease and amusement  he had of course to lead a life of strange suffering and danger and he had therefore to train himself for it  but what need have we to do as st paul did  just as much need my good friends if you could see it  which of us has not to lead a life of suffering  we shall each and all of us have our full share of trouble before we die doubt it not  and which of us has not to lead a life of danger  i do not mean bodily danger of that there is little enoughperhaps too little in england now but of danger to our hearts minds characters  oh my friends i pity those who do not think themselves in danger every day of their lives for the less danger they see around them the more danger there is  there is not only the common danger of temptation but over and above it the worse danger of not knowing temptation when it comes  who will be most likely to walk into pits and mires upon the moorthe man who knows that they are there around him or the man who goes on careless and light of heart fancying that it is all smooth ground  woe to you young people if you fancy that you are to have no woe  danger to you young people if you fancy yourselves in no danger  this is sad and dreary newssome of you may say  ay my friends it would be sad and dreary news indeed and this earth would be a very sad and dreary place and life with all its troubles and temptations would not be worth having if it were not for the blessed news which the gospel for this day brings us  that makes up for all the sadness of the epistle that gives us hope that tells us of one who has been through life and through death too yet without sin  that tells us of one who has endured a thousand times more temptation than we ever shall a thousand times more trouble than we ever shall and yet has conquered it all and that he who has thus been through all our temptations borne all our weaknesses is our king our saviour who loves us who teaches us who has promised us his holy spirit to make us like himself strong brave and patient to endure all that man or devil or our own low animal tempers and lusts can do to hurt us  the gospel for this day tells us how he went and was alone in the wilderness with the wild beasts and yet trusted in god his father and ours to keep him safe  how he went without food forty days and nights and yet in his extreme hunger refused to do the least selfwilled or selfish thing to get himself food  is that no lesson no message of hope for the poor man who is tempted by hunger to steal or tempted by need to do a mean and selfish thing to hear that the lord jesus christ who bore need and hunger far worse than his understands all his temptations and feels for him and pities him and has promised him gods spirit to make him strong as he himself was  is it no comfort to young people who are tempted to vanity and display and selfwilled conceited longings tempted to despise the advice of their parents and elders and set up for themselves and choose their own wayis it no good news i say for them to hear that their lord and saviour was tempted to it also and conquered itthat he will teach them to answer the temptation as he did when he refused even to let angels hold him over the temple up between earth and heaven for a sign and a wonder to all the jews because god his father had not bidden him to do it and therefore he would not tempt the lord his god  is it no good news again to those who are tempted to do perhaps one little outward wrong thing to yield on some small point to the ways of the world in order to help themselves on in life to hear that their lord and saviour conquered that temptation toothat he refused all the kingdoms of the world and the glory of them when the devil offered them because he knew that the devil could not give them to him that all wealth and power and glory belonged to god and was to be got only by serving him  oh do you all young people especially think of this  as you grow up and go out into life you will be tempted in a hundred different ways by things which are pleasanteveryone knows that they are pleasant enoughbut wrong  one will be tempted to be vain of dress another to be selfconceited another to be lazy and idle another to be extravagant and roving another to be over fond of amusement another to be over fond of money another to be over fond of liquor another to go wrong as too many young men and young women do and bring themselves and those with whom they keep company and whom they ought if they really love them to respect and honour down into sin and shame  you will all be tempted and you will all be troubled one by poverty one by sickness one by the burden of a family one by being laughed at for trying to do right  but remember oh remember whenever a temptation comes upon you that the blessed jesus has been through it all and conquered all and that his will is that you shall be holy and pure like him and that therefore if you but ask him he will give you strength to keep pure  when you are tempted pray to him  the struggle in your own minds will no doubt be very great it will be very hard work for yousin looks so pleasant on the outside  poor souls it is a sad struggle for you  many a poor young fellow who goes wrong deserves rather to be pitied than to be punished  well then if no man else will pity him jesus the man of all men will  pray to him  cry aloud to him  ask him to make you stouthearted patient really manful to fight against temptation  ask him to give you strength of mind to fight against all bad habits  ask him to open your eyes to see when you are in danger  ask him to help you to keep out of the way of temptation  ask him in short to give you grace to use such abstinence that your flesh may be subdued to your spirit  and then you will not follow as the beasts do just what seems pleasant to your flesh no you will be able to obey christs godly motions that is to do as well as to love the good desires which he puts into your hearts  you will do not merely what is pleasant but what is right you will not be your own slaves you will be your own masters and gods loyal and obedient sons you will not be as too many are mere animals going about in the shape of men but truly men at heart who are not afraid of pain poverty shame trouble or death itself when they are in the right path about the work to which god has called them  but if you ask christ to make true men and women of you you must believe that he will give you what you ask if you ask him to help you you must believe that he will and does help youyou must believe that it is he himself who has put into your hearts the very desire of being holy and strong at all and therefore you must believe that you can help yourselves  help yourselves and he will help you  if you ask for his help he will give it  but what is the use of his giving it if you do not use it  to him who has shall be given and he shall have more but from him who has not shall be taken away even what he seems to have  therefore do not merely pray but struggle and try yourselves  train yourselves as st paul did train yourselves to keep your temper train yourselves to bear unpleasant things for the sake of your duty train yourselves to keep out of temptation train yourselves to be forgiving gentle thrifty industrious sober temperate cleanly as modest as little children in your words and thoughts and conduct  and god when he sees you trying to be all this will help you to be so  it may be hard to educate yourselves  life is a hard business at bestyou will find it a thousand times harder though if you are slaves to your own fleshly sins  but the more you struggle against sin the less hard you will find it to fight the more you resist the devil the more he will flee from you the more you try to conquer your own bad passions the more god will help you to conquer them it may be a hard battle but it is a sure one  no fear but that everyone can if he will work out his own salvation for it is god himself who works in us to will and to do of his good pleasure  all you have to do is to give yourselves up to him to study his laws to labour as well as long to keep them and he will enable you to keep them he will teach you in a thousand unexpected ways he will daily renew and strengthen your hearts by the working of his spirit that you may more and more know and love and do what is right and you will go on from strength to strength to the height of perfect men to the likeness of jesus christ the lord who conquered all human temptations for your sake that he might be a highpriest who can be touched with the feeling of our infirmities because he was tempted in all points like as we are yet without sin    viigood friday    in all their affliction he was afflicted and the angel of his presence saved them  in his love and in his pity he redeemed them and he bare them and carried them all the days of oldisaiah lxiii 9  on this very day at this very hour 1817 years ago hung one nailed to a cross bruised and bleeding pierced and naked dying a felons death between two thieves in perfect misery in utter shame mocked and insulted by all the great the rich the learned of his nation one who had grown up as a man of low birth believed by all to be a carpenters son without scholarship money respectability even without a home wherein to lay his headand here was the end of his life  true he had preached noble words he had done noble deeds but what had they helped him  they had not made the rich the learned the respectable the religious believe on him they had not saved him from persecution and insult and death  the only mourners who stood by to weep over his dying agonies were his mother a poor countrywoman a young fisherman and one who had been a harlot and a sinner  there was an end  do you know who that man was  he was your king the king of rich and poor and he was your king not in spite of his suffering all that shame and misery but just because he suffered it because he chose to be poor and miserable and despised because he endured the cross despising the shame because he took upon himself to fulfil his fathers will all ills which flesh is heir totherefore he is now your king the saviour of the world the poor mans friend the lord of heaven and earth  is he such a king as you wish for  is he the sort of king you want my friends  does he fulfil your notions of what the poor mans friend should be  do you in your hearts wish he had been somewhat richer more glorious more successful in the worlds eyesa wealthy and prosperous man like solomon of old  are any of you ready to say as the moneyblinded jews said when they demanded their true king to be crucified we have no king but caesarprovided the lawmakers and the authorities take care of our interests and protect our property and do not make us pay too many rates and taxes that is enough for us  will you have no king but caesar  alas those who say that find that the law is but a weak deliverer too weak to protect them from selfishness and covetousness and decent cruelty and so caesar and the law have to give place to mammon the god of money  do we not see it in these very days  and mammon is weak too  this world is not a shop men are not merely moneymakers and wagesearners  there are more things in heaven and earth than are dreamt of in that sort of philosophy selfinterest and covetousness cannot keep society orderly and peaceful let sham philosophers say what they will  and then comes tyranny lawlessness rich and poor staining their hands in each others blood as we saw happen in france two years ago and so after all mammon has to give place to moloch the fiend of murder and cruelty and woe to rich and poor when he reigns over them  ay woewoe to rich and poor when they choose anyone for their king but their real and rightful lord and master jesus the poor man afflicted in all their afflictions the man of sorrows crucified on this day  is he the kind of king you like  make up your minds my friends make up your minds  for whether you like him or not your king he was your king he is your king he will be blessed be god for ever blessed be god indeed  if he were not our king if anyone in heaven or earth was lord of us except the man of sorrows the prince of sufferers what hope what comfort would there be  what a horrible black fathomless riddle this sad diseased moaning world would be no king would suit us but the prince of sufferersjesus who has borne all this worlds griefs and carried all its sorrowsjesus who has himself smarted under pain and hunger oppression and insult treachery and desertion who knows them all feels for them all and will right them all in his own good time  believing in jesus we can travel on through one wild parish after another upon english soil and see as i have done the labourer who tills the land worse housed than the horse he drives worse clothed than the sheep he shears worse nourished than the hog he feedsand yet not despair  for the prince of sufferers is the labourers saviour he has tasted hunger and thirst and weariness poverty oppression and neglect the very tramp who wanders houseless on the moorside is his brother in his sufferings the saviour of the world has shared when the foxes had holes and the birds of the air had nests while the son of god had not where to lay his head  he is the king of the poor firstborn among many brethren his tenderness is almighty and for the poor he has prepared deliverance perhaps in this world surely in the world to comeboundless deliverance out of the treasures of his boundless love  believing in jesus we can pass by mines and factories and by dungeons darker and fouler still in the lanes and alleys of our great towns and cities where thousands and tens of thousands of starving men and wan women and children grown old before their youth sit toiling and pining in mammons prisonhouse in worse than egyptian bondage to earn such pay as just keeps the broken heart within the wornout bodyay we can go through our great cities even now and see the women whom god intended to be christian wives and mothers the slaves of the rich mans greed by day the playthings of his lust by nightand yet not despair for we can cry no thou proud mammon moneymaking fiend  these are not thine but christs they belong to him who died on the cross and though thou heedest not their sighs he marks them all for he has sighed like them though there be no pity in thee there is in him the pity of a man ay and the indignation of a god  he treasures up their tears he understands their sorrows his judgment of their guilt is not like thine thou pharisee  he is their lord who said that to those to whom little was given of them shall little be required  generation after generation they are being made perfect by sufferings as their saviour was before them and then woe to thee  for even as he led israel out of egypt with a mighty hand and a stretchedout arm and signs and wonders great and terrible so shall he lead the poor out of their misery and make them households like a flock of sheep even as he led israel through the wilderness tender forbearing knowing whereof they were made having mercy on all their brutalities and idolatries murmurings and backslidings afflicted in all their afflictionseven while he was punishing them outwardly as he is punishing the poor man noweven so shall he lead this people out in his good time into a good land and large a land of wheat and wine of milk and honey a rest which he has prepared for his poor such as eye hath not seen nor ear heard nor hath it entered into the heart of man to conceive  he can do it for the almighty deliverer is his name  he will do it for his name is love  he knows how to do it for he has borne the griefs and carried the sorrows of the poor  oh sad hearts and suffering  anxious and weary ones  look to the cross this day  there hung your king  the king of sorrowing souls and more the king of sorrows  ay pain and grief tyranny and desertion death and hell he has faced them one and all and tried their strength and taught them his and conquered them right royally  and since he hung upon that torturing cross sorrow is divine godlike as joy itself  all that mans fallen nature dreads and despises god honoured on the cross and took unto himself and blessed and consecrated for ever  and now blessed are the poor if they are poor in heart as well as purse for jesus was poor and theirs is the kingdom of heaven  blessed are the hungry if they hunger for righteousness as well as food for jesus hungered and they shall be filled  blessed are those who mourn if they mourn not only for their afflictions but for their sins and for the sins they see around them for on this day jesus mourned for our sins on this day he was made sin for us who knew no sin and they shall be comforted  blessed are those who are ashamed of themselves and hate themselves and humble themselves before god this day for on this day jesus humbled himself for us and they shall be exalted  blessed are the forsaken and the despiseddid not all men forsake jesus this day in his hour of need and why not thee too thou poor deserted one  shall the disciple be above his master  no everyone that is perfect must be like his master  the deeper the bitterer your loneliness the more are you like him who cried upon the cross my god my god why hast thou forsaken me  he knows what that grief too is like  he feels for thee at least  though all forsake thee he is with thee still and if he be with thee what matter who has left thee for a while  ay blessed are those that weep now for they shall laugh  it is those whom the lord loveth that he chasteneth  and because he loves the poor he brings them low  all things are blessed now but sin for all things excepting sin are redeemed by the life and death of the son of god  blessed are wisdom and courage joy and health and beauty love and marriage childhood and manhood corn and wine fruits and flowers for christ redeemed them by his life  and blessed too are tears and shame blessed are weakness and ugliness blessed are agony and sickness blessed the sad remembrance of our sins and a broken heart and a repentant spirit  blessed is death and blessed the unknown realms where souls await the resurrection day for christ redeemed them by his death  blessed are all things weak as well as strong  blessed are all days dark as well as bright for all are his and he is ours and all are ours and we are his for ever  therefore sigh on ye sad ones and rejoice in your own sadness ache on ye suffering ones and rejoice in your own sorrows  rejoice that you are made free of the holy brotherhood of mourners that you may claim your place too if you will among the noble army of martyrs rejoice that you are counted worthy of a fellowship in the sufferings of the son of god  rejoice and trust on for after sorrow shall come joy  trust on for in mans weakness gods strength shall be made perfect  trust on for death is the gate of life  endure on to the end and possess your souls in patience for a little while and that perhaps a very little while  death comes swiftly and more swiftly still perhaps the day of the lord  the deeper the sorrow the nearer the salvation   the night is darkest before the dawn when the pain is sorest the child is born and the day of the lord is at hand   ay if the worst should come if neither the laws of your country nor the benevolence of the righteous were strong enough to defend you if one charitable plan after another were to fail if the labourmarket were getting fuller and fuller and poverty were spreading wider and wider and crime and misery were breeding faster and still faster every year than education and religion all hope for the poor seemed gone and lost and they were ready to believe the men who tell them that the land is overpeopledthat there are too many of us too many industrious hands too many cunning brains too many immortal souls too many of gods children upon gods earth which god the father made and god the son redeemed and god the holy spirit teaches  then the lord the prince of sufferers he who knows your every grief and weeps with you tear for tear he would come out of his place to smite the haughty ones and confound the cunning ones and silence the loud ones and empty the full ones to judge with righteousness for the meek of the earth to hearken to the prayer of the poor whose heart he has been preparing and to help the fatherless and needy to their right that the man of the world may be no more exalted against them  in that day men will find out a wonder and miracle  they will see many that are first last and many that are last first  they will find that there were poor who were the richest after all the simple who were wisest and gentle who were bravest and weak who were strongest that gods ways are not as mens ways nor gods thoughts as mens thoughts  alas who shall stand when god does this  at least he who will do it is jesus who loved us to the death boundless love and gentleness boundless generosity and pity who was tempted even as we are who has felt our every weakness  in that thought is utter comfort that our judge will be he who died and rose again and is praying for us even now to his father and our father therefore fear not gentle souls patient souls pure consciences and tender hearts  fear not you who are empty and hungry who walk in darkness and see no light for though he fulfil once more as he has again and again the awful prophecy before the text though he tread down the people in his anger and make them drunk in his fury and bring their strength to the earth though kings with their armies may flee and the stars which light the earth may fall and there be great tribulation wars and rumours of wars and on earth distress of nations with perplexityyet it is when the day of his vengeance is at hand that the year of his redeemed is come  and when they see all these things let them rejoice and lift up their heads for their redemption draweth nigh  do you ask how i know this  do you ask for a sign for a token that these my words are true  i know that they are true  but as for tokens i will give you but this one the sign of that bread and that wine  when the lord shall have delivered his people out of all their sorrows they shall eat of that bread and drink of that wine one and all in the kingdom of god    viiieasterday    if ye then be risen with christ seek those things which are above where christ sitteth on the right hand of godcolossians iii 1  i know no better way of preaching to you the gospel of easter the good news which this day brings to all men year after year than by trying to explain to you the epistle appointed for this day which we have just read  it begins if ye then be risen with christ  now that does not mean that st paul had any doubt whether the colossians to whom he was speaking were risen with christ or not  he does not mean i am not sure whether you are risen or not but perhaps you are not but if you are you ought to do such and such things  he does not mean that  he was quite sure that these colossians were risen with christ  he had no doubt of it whatsoever  if you look at the chapter before he says so  he tells them that they were buried with christ in baptism in which also they were risen with christ through faith of the operation of god who has raised him from the dead  now what reason had st paul to believe that these colossians were risen with jesus christ  because they had given up sin and were leading holy lives  that cannot be  the epistle for this day says the very opposite  it does not say you are risen because you have left off sinning  it says you must leave off sinning because you are risen  was it then on account of any experiences or inward feeling of theirs  not at all  he says that these colossians had been baptized and that they had believed in gods work of raising jesus christ from the dead and that therefore they were risen with christ  in one word they had believed the message of easterday and therefore they shared in the blessings of easterday as it is written in another place if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the lord jesus christ and believe in thy heart that god has raised him from the dead thou shalt be saved  now these seem very wide words too wide to please most people  but there are wider words still in st pauls epistles  he tells us again and again that gods mercy is a free gift that he has made to us a free present of his son jesus christ  that he has taken away the effect of all mens sin and more than that that men are gods children that they have a right to believe that they are so because they are so  for he says the free gift of jesus christ is not like adams offence  it is not less than it narrower than it as some folks say  it is not that by adams sin all became sinners and by jesus christs salvation an elect few out of them shall be made righteous  if you will think a moment you will see that it cannot be so  for jesus christ conquered sin and death and the devil  but if as some think sin and death and the devil have destroyed and sent to hell by far the greater part of mankind then they have conquered christ and not christ them  mankind belonged to christ at first  sin and death and the devil came in and ruined them and then christ came to redeem them but if all that he has been able to do is to redeem one out of a thousand or even nine out of ten of them then the devil has had the best of the battle  he and not christ is the conqueror  if a thief steals all the sheep on your farm and all that you can get back from him is a part of the whole flock which has had the best of it you or the thief  if christs redemption is meant for only a few or even a great many elect souls out of all the millions of mankind which has had the best of it christ the master of the sheep or the devil the robber and destroyer of them  be sure my friends christ is stronger than that his love is deeper than that his redemption is wider than that  how strong how deep how wide it is we never shall know st paul tells us that we never shall know for it is boundless but that we shall go on knowing more and more of its vastness for ever finding it deeper wider loftier than our most glorious dreams could ever picture it  but this he says we do know that we have gained more than adam lost  for if by one mans offence many were made sinners much more shall they who receive abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness reign in life by one even jesus christ for he says where sin abounded gods grace and free gift has much more abounded  therefore as by the offence of one judgment came upon all men to condemnation even so by the righteousness of one the free gift came upon all men to justification of life  upon all men you see  there can be no doubt about it  upon you and me and foreigners and gipsies and heathens and thieves and harlotsupon all mankind let them be as bad or as good as young or as old as they may the free gift of god has come to justification of life they are justified pardoned and beloved in the sight of almighty god they have a right and a share to a new life a different sort of life from what they are inclined to lead and do lead by natureto a life which death cannot take away a life which may grow and strengthen and widen and blossom and bear fruit for ever and ever they have a share in christs resurrection in the blessing of easterday  they have a share in christ every one of them whether they claim that share or not  how far they will be punished for not claiming it is a very different matter of which we know nothing whatsoever  and how far the heathen who have never heard of christ or of their share in him will be punished we know notwe are not meant to know  but we know that to their own master they stand or fall and that their master is our master too and that he is a just master and requires little of him to whom he gives little a just and merciful master who loved this sinful world enough to come down and die for it while mankind were all rebels and sinners and has gone on taking care of it and improving it in spite of all its sin and rebellion ever since and that is enough for us  st paul knew no more  it was a mystery he says a wonderful and unfathomable matter which had been hidden since the foundation of the world of which he himself says that he saw only through a glass darkly and we cannot expect to have clearer eyes than he  but this he seems to have seen that the lord when he rose again bought a blessing even for the dumb beasts and the earth on which we live for he says the whole creation is now groaning in the pangs of labour being about to bring forth something and the whole creation will rise again how and when and into what new state we cannot tell  but st paul seems to say that when the lord shall destroy death the last of his enemies then the whole creation shall be renewed and bring forth another earth nobler and more beautiful than this one free from death and sin and sorrow and redeemed into the glorious liberty of the children of god  but this on the other hand st paul did see most clearly and preached it to all to whom he spoke that the ground and reason of this great and glorious mystery was the thing which happened on the first easterday namely the lord jesus rising from the dead  about that at least there was no doubt at all in his mind  we may see it by the easter anthem which we read this morning taken out of the fifteenth chapter of his first epistle to the corinthians  christ is risen from the dead and become the first fruits of them that slept  for since by man came death by man came also the resurrection of the dead  for as in adam all die even so in christ shall all be made alive  now he is not talking here merely of the rising again of our bodies at the last day  that was in his mind only the end and outcome and fruit and perfecting of mens rising from the dead in this life for he tells these same corinthians and the colossians and others to whom he wrote that life the eternal life which would raise their bodies at the last day was even then working in them  neither is he speaking only of a few believers  he says that owing to the lords rising on this day all shall be made alivenot merely all christians but all men  for he does not say as in adam all christians die but all men and so he does not say all christians shall be made alive but all men  for here as in the sixth chapter of romans he is trying to make us understand the likeness between adam and jesus christ whom he calls the new adam  the first adam he says was only a living soul as the savages and heathens are but the second adam the lord from heaven the true pattern of men is a quickening lifegiving spirit to give eternal life to every human being who will accept his offer and claim his share and right as a true man after the likeness of the new adam jesus christ  we then every one of us who is here today have a right to believe that we have a share in christs eternal life  that our original sin that is the sinfulness which we inherited from our forefathers is all forgiven and forgotten and that mankind is now redeemed and belongs to the second adam the true and original head and pattern of man jesus christ in whom was no sin and that because mankind belongs to him god is well pleased with them and reconciled to them and looks on them not as a guilty but as a pardoned and beloved race of beings  and we have a right to believe also that because all power is given to christ in heaven and earth there is given to him the power of making men what they ought to belike his own blessed and glorious and perfect self  ask him and you shall receive knock at the gate of his treasurehouse and it shall be opened  seek those things that are above and you shall find them  you shall find old bad habits die out in you new good habits spring up in you old meannesses become weaker new nobleness and manfulness become stronger the old selfish covetous savage cunning cowardly brutal adam dying out the new loving brotherly civilised wise brave manful adam growing up in you day by day to perfection till you are changed from grace to grace and glory to glory into the likeness of the lord of men  these are great promises you may say glorious promises but what proof have you that they belong to us  they sound too good to be true too great for such poor creatures as we are give us but some proof that we have a right to them give us but a pledge from jesus christ give us but a sign an assurance from god and we may believe you then  my friends i am certainand the longer i live i am the more certainthat there is no argument no pledge no sign no assurance like the bread and the wine upon that table  assurances in our own hearts and souls are good but we may be mistaken about them for after all they are our own thoughts notions in our own souls these inward experiences and assurances delightful and comforting as they are at times yet we cannot trust themwe cannot trust our own hearts they are deceitful above all things who can know them  yes our own hearts may tell us lies they may make us fancy that we are pleasing god when we are doing the things most hateful to him  they have made thousands fancy so already  they may make us fancy we are right in gods sight when we are utterly wrong  they have made thousands fancy so already  these hearts of ours may make us fancy that we have spiritual life in us that we are in a state higher and nobler than the sinners round us when all the while our spirits are dead within us  they made the pharisees of old fancy that their souls were alive and pure and religious when they were dead and damned within them and they may make us fancy so too  no  we cannot trust our hearts and inward feelings but that bread that wine we can trust  our inward feelings are a sign from man that bread and wine are a sign from god  our inward feelings may tell us what we feel toward god  that bread that wine tell us something ten thousand times more important they tell us what god feels towards us  and god must love us before we can love him god must pardon us before we can have mercy on ourselves god must come to us and take hold of us before we can cling to him god must change us before we can become right god must give us eternal life in our hearts before we can feel and enjoy that new life in us  then that bread that wine say that god has done all that for us already they say  god does love you god has pardoned you god has come to you god is ready and willing to change and convert you god has given you eternal life and this love this mercy this coming to find you out while you are wandering in sin this change this eternal life are all in his son jesus christ and that bread that wine are the signs of it  it is for the sake of jesus blood that god has pardoned you and that cup is the new covenant in his blood  come and drink and claim your pardon  it is simply because jesus christ was man and you too are men and women wearing the flesh and blood which christ wore eating and drinking as christ ate and drank and not for any works or faith of your own that god loves you and has come to you and called you into his family  this is the gospel the good news of christs free grace and pardon and salvation and that bread that wine the common food of all men not merely of the rich or the wise or the pious but of saints and penitents rich and poor christians and heathens alikethat plain common everyday bread and wineare the signs of it  come and take the signs and claim your share in gods love in gods family  and it is in jesus christ too that you have eternal life  it is because you belong to jesus christ to mankind of which he is the head and king that god will change you strengthen your soul to rise above your sins raise you up daily more and more out of spiritual death out of brutishness and selfishness and ignorance and malice into an eternal life of wisdom and love and courage and mercifulness and patience and obedience a life which shall continue through death and beyond death and raise you up again for ever at the last day because you belong to christs body and have been fed with christs eternal life  and that bread that wine are the signs of it  take eat said jesus this is my body drink this is my blood  those are the signs that god has given you eternal life and that this life is in his son  what better sign would you have  there is no mistaking their message they can tell you no lies  and they can and will bring your own gospelblessings to your mind as nothing else can  they will make you feel as nothing else can that you are the beloved children of god heirs of all that your king and head has bought for you when he died and rose again upon this day  he gave you the lords supper for a sign  do you think that he did not know best what the best sign would be  he said  do this in remembrance of me  do you think that he did not know better than you and me and all men that if you did do it it would put you in remembrance of him  oh come to his table this day of all days in the year and claim there your share in his body and his blood to feed the everlasting life in you which though you see it not now though you feel it not now will surely if you keep it alive in you by daily faith and daily repentance and daily prayer and daily obedience raise you up body and soul to reign with him for ever at the last day    ivthe comforter    fourth sunday after easter  if i go not away the comforter will not come unto you but if i depart i will send him unto youjohn xvi 7  we are now coming near to two great days ascensionday and whit sunday which our forefathers have appointed year by year to put us continually in mind of two great works which the lord worked out for us his most unworthy subjects and still unworthier brothers  on ascensionday he ascended up into heaven and received gifts for men even for his enemies that the lord god might dwell among them and on whitsunday he sent down those gifts  the spirit of god came down to dwell in the hearts of men to be the right of everyone who asks for it white or black young or old rich or poor and never to leave this earth as long as there is a human being on it  and because we are coming near to these two great days the prayerbook in the collects epistles and gospels tries to put us in mind of those days and to make us ready to ask for the blessings of which they are the yearly signs and witnesses  the gospel for last sunday told us how the lord told his disciples just before his death that for a little while they should not see him and again a little while and they should see him because he was going to the father and that they should have great sorrow but that their sorrow should be turned into joy  and the gospel for today goes further still and tells us why he was going awaythat he might send to them the comforter his holy spirit and that it was expedientgood for them that he should go away for that if he did not the comforter would not come to them  now in these words i do not doubt he was speaking of ascensionday and of whitsunday and therefore it is that these gospels have been chosen to be read before ascensionday and whit sunday and in proportion as we attend to these gospels and take in the meaning of them and act accordingly ascensionday and whit sunday will be a blessing and a profit to us and in proportion as we neglect them or forget them ascensionday and whitsunday will be witnesses against our souls at the day of judgment that the lord himself condescended to buy for us with his own blood blessings unspeakable and offer them freely unto us in spite of all our sins and yet we would have none of them but preferred our own will to gods will and the little which we thought we could get for ourselves to the unspeakable treasures which god had promised to give us and turned away from the blessings of his kingdom to our own foolish pleasure and covetousness like the dog to his vomit and the sow that was washed to her wallowing in the mire  i said that god had promised to us an unspeakable treasure  and so he has a treasure that will make the poorest and weakest man among us richer than if he had all the wealth gathered from all the nations of the world which everyone is admiring now in that great exhibition in london and stronger than if he had all the wisdom which produced that wealth  let us see now what it is that god has promised usand then those to whom god has given ears to hear and hearts to understand will see that large as my words may sound they are no larger than the truth  christ said that if he went away he would send down the comforter the holy spirit of god  the nicene creed says that the holy spirit of god is the lord and giver of life and so he is  he gives life to the earth to the trees to the flowers to the dumb animals to the bodies and minds of men all life all growth all health all strength all beauty all order all help and assistance of one thing by another which you see in the world around you comes from him he is the lord and giver of life in him the earth the sun and stars all live and move and have their being  he is not them or a part of them but he gives life to them  but to men he is more than thatfor we men ourselves are more than that and need more  we have immortal spirits in usa reason a conscience and a will strange rights and duties strange hopes and fears of which the beasts and the plants know nothing  we have hearts in us which can love and feel and sorrow and be weak and sinful and mistaken and therefore we want a comforter  and the lord and giver of life has promised to be our comforter and the father and the son from both of whom he proceeds have promised to send him to us to strengthen and comfort us and give our spirits life and health and knit us together to each other and to god in one common bond of love and fellowfeeling even as he the spirit knits together the father and the son  i said that we want a comforter  if we consider what that word comforter means we shall see that we do want a comforter and that the only comforter which can satisfy us for ever and ever must be he the very spirit of god the lord and giver of life  now comforter means one who gives comfort so the meaning of it will depend upon what comfort means  our word comfort comes from two old latin words which mean with and to strengthen  and therefore a comforter means anyone who is with us to strengthen us and do for us what we could not do for ourselves  you will see that this is the proper meaning of the word when you remember what bodily things we call comforts  you say that a person is comfortable or lives in comfort if he has a comfortable income a comfortable house comfortable clothes comfortable food and so on  now all these things his money his house his clothes his food are not himself they make him stronger and more at ease  they make his life more pleasant to him  but they are not him they are round him with him to strengthen him  so with a persons mind and feelings when a man is in sorrow and trouble he cannot comfort himself  his friends must come to him and comfort him talk to him advise him show their kind feeling towards him and in short be with him to strengthen him in his afflictions  and if we require comfort for our bodies and for our minds my friends how much more do we for our spiritsour souls as we call them  how weak and ignorant and selfwilled and perplexed and sinful they aresurely our souls require a comforter far more than our bodies or our minds do  and to comfort our spirits we require a spirit for we cannot see our own spirits our own souls as we can our bodies  we cannot even tell by our feelings what state they are in  we may deceive ourselves and we do deceive ourselves again and again and fancy that our souls are strong when they are weakthat they are simple and truthful when they are full of deceit and falsehoodthat they are loving god when they are only loving themselvesthat they are doing gods will when they are only doing their own selfish and perverse wills  no man can take care of his own spirit much less give his own spirit life no man can quicken his own soul says david that is no man can give his own soul life  and therefore we must have someone beyond ourselves to give life to our spirits  we must have someone to teach us the things that we could never find out for ourselves someone who will put into our hearts the good desires that could never come of themselves  we must have someone who can change these wills of ours and make them love what they hate by nature and make them hate what they love by nature  for by nature we are selfish  by nature we are inclined to love ourselves rather than anyone else to take care of ourselves rather than anyone else  by nature we are inclined to follow our own will rather than gods will to do our own pleasure rather than follow gods commandments and therefore by nature our spirits are dead for selfishness and selfwill are spiritual death spiritual life is love pity patience courage honesty truth justice humbleness industry selfsacrifice obedience to god and therefore to those whom god sends to teach and guide us  that is spiritual life  that is the life of jesus christ his character his conduct was like thatto love to help to pity all aroundto give up himself even to deathto do his fathers will and not his own  that was his life  because he was the son of god he did it in proportion as we live like him we shall he living like sons of god  in proportion as we live like jesus christ the son of god our spirits will be alive  for he that hath jesus christ the son of god in him hath life and he that hath not the son of god hath not life says st john  but who can raise us from the death of sin and selfishness to the life of righteousness and love  who can change us into the likeness of jesus christ  who can even show us what jesus christs likeness is and take the things of christ and show them to us so that by seeing what he was we may see what we should be  and who if we have this life in us will keep it alive in us and be with us to strengthen us  who will give us strength to force the foul and fierce and false thoughts out of our mind and say get thee behind me satan  who will give our spirits life and who will strengthen that life in us  can we do it for ourselves  oh my friends i pity the man who is so blind and ignorant who knows so little of himself upon whom the lessons which his own mistakes and sins and failings should have taught him have been so wasted that he fancies that he can teach and guide himself without any help and that he can raise his own soul to life or keep it alive without assistance  can his body do without its comforts  then how can his spirit  if he left his house and threw away his clothes and refused all help from his fellowmen and went and lived in the woods like a wild beast we should call him a madman because he refused the help and comfort to his body which god has made necessary for him  but just as great a madman is he who refuses the help and the strengthening which god has made necessary for his spiritjust as great a madman is he who fancies that his soul is any more able than his body is to live without continual help  it is just because man is nobler than the beast that he requires help  the fox in the wood needs no house no fire he needs no friends he needs no comforts and no comforters because he is a beastbecause he is meant to live and die selfish and alone therefore god has provided him in himself with all things necessary to keep the poor brutes selfish life in him for a few short years but just because man is nobler than that just because man is not intended to live selfish and alone just because his body and his mind and his spirit are beautifully and delicately made and intended for all sorts of wonderful purposes therefore god has appointed that from the moment he is born to all eternity he cannot live alone he cannot support himself he stands in continual need of the assistance of all around him for body and soul and spirit he needs clothes which other men must make houses which other man must build food which other men must produce he has to get his livelihood by working for others while others get their livelihood in return by working for him  as a child he needs his parents to be his comforters to take care of him in body and mind  as he grows up he needs the care of others he cannot exist a day without his fellowmen  he requires schoolmasters to educate him books and masters to teach him his trade and when he has learnt it and settled himself in life he requires laws made by other men perhaps by men who died hundreds of years before he was born to secure to him his rights and property to secure to him comforts and to make him feel comfortable in his station he needs friends and family to comfort him in sorrow and in joy to do for him the thousand things which he cannot do for himself  in proportion as he is alone and friendless he is pitiable and miserable let him be as rich as solomon himself  from the moment i say he is born he needs continual comforts and comforters for his body and mind and heart and then he fancies that though his body and his mind cannot exist safely or grow up healthily without the continual care and comforting of his fellowmen that yet his soul the part of him which is at once the most important and the most in danger the part of him of which he knows least the part of him which he understands least the part of him of which his body and mind cannot take care because it has to take care of them can live and grow and prosper without any help whatsoever  and if we cannot strengthen our own souls no man can strengthen them for us  no man can raise our bodies to life much less can he raise our souls  the physician himself cannot cure the sicknesses of our bodies he can only give us fit medicines and leave them to cure us by certain laws of nature which he did not make and which he cannot alter  and though the physician can by much learning understand mens bodies somewhat who can understand mens souls  we cannot understand our own souls we do not know what they are how they live whence they come or whither they go  we cannot cure them ourselves much less can anyone cure them for us  the only one who can cure our souls is he that made our souls the only one who can give life to our souls is he who gives life to everything  the only one who can cure and strengthen and comfort our spirits is he who understands our spirits because he himself is the spirit of all spirits the spirit who searcheth all things even the deep things of god because he is the spirit of god the father who made all heaven and earth and of jesus christ the son who understands the heart of man who can be touched with the feelings of our infirmities and hath been tempted in all things just as we are yet without sin  he is the comforter which god has promised to our spirits the only comforter who can strengthen our spirits and if we have him with us if he is strengthening us if he is leading us if he is abiding with us if he is changing us day by day more and more into the likeness of jesus christ are we not as i said at the beginning of my sermon richer than if we possessed all the land of england stronger than if we had all the armies of the world at our command  for what is more precious thangod himself  what is stronger thangod himself  the poorest man in whom gods spirit dwells is greater than the greatest king in whom gods spirit does not dwell  and so he will find in the day that he dies  then where will riches be and power  the rich man will take none of them away with him when he dieth neither shall his pomp follow him  naked came he into this world and naked shall he return out of it to go as he came and carry with him none of the comforts which he thought in this life the only ones worth having but the spirit of god remains with us for ever that treasure a man shall carry out of this world with him and keep to all eternity that friend will never forsake him for he is the spirit of love which abideth for ever  that comforter will never grow weak for he is himself the very eternal lord and giver of life and the soul that is possessed by him must live must grow must become nobler purer freer stronger more loving for ever and ever as the eternities roll by  that is what he will give you my friends that is his treasure that is the spiritlife the true and everlasting life which flows from him as the stream flows from the fountainhead    xwhitsunday    the fruit of the spirit is love joy peace longsuffering gentleness goodness faith meekness temperanceagainst such there is no lawgalatians v 22 23  in all countries and in all ages the world has been full of complaints of law and government  and one hears the same complaints in england now  you hear complaints that the laws favour one party and one rank more than another that they are expensive and harsh and unfair and what notbut i think my friends that for us and especially on this whitsunday it will be much wiser instead of complaining of the laws to complain of ourselves for needing those laws  for what is it that makes laws necessary at all except mans sinfulness  adam required no laws in the garden of eden  we should require no laws if we were what we ought to bewhat god has offered to make us  we may see this by looking at the laws themselves and considering the purposes for which they were made  we shall then see that like moses laws of old the greater part of them have been added because of transgressionsin plain englishto prevent men from doing things which they ought not to do and which if they were in a right state of mind they would not do  how many laws are passed simply to prevent one man or one class from oppressing or illusing some other man or class  what a vast number of them are passed simply to protect property or to protect the weak from the cruel the ignorant from the cunning  it is plain that if there was no cruelty no cunning no dishonesty these laws at all events would not be needed  again one of the great complaints against the laws and the government is that they are so expensive that rates and taxes are heavy burdensand doubtless they are  but what makes them necessary except mens sin  if the poor were more justly and mercifully treated and if they in their turn were more thrifty and provident there would be no need of the expenses of poor rates  if there was no love of war and plunder there would be no need of the expense of an army  if there was no crime there would be no need of the expense of police and prisons  the thing is so simple and self evident that it seems almost childish to mention it  and yet my friends we forget it daily  we complain of the laws and their harshness of taxes and their expensiveness and we forget all the while that it is our own selfishness and sinfulness which brings this expense upon us which makes it necessary for the law to interfere and protect us against others and others against us  and while we are complaining of the government for not doing its work somewhat more cheaply we are forgetting that if we chose we might leave government very little work to dothat every man if he chose might be his own lawmaker and his own policethat every man if he will may lead a life against which there is no law  i say again that it is our own fault the fault of our sinfulness that laws are necessary for us  in proportion as we are what scripture calls natural men that is savage selfish divided from each other and struggling against each other each for his own interest as long as we are not renewed and changed into new men so long will laws heavy severe and burdensome be necessary for us without them we should be torments to ourselves to our neighbours to our country  but these laws are only necessary as long as we are full of selfishness and ungodliness  the moment we yield ourselves up to gods law mans laws are ready enough to leave us alone take for instance a common example as long as anyone is a faithful husband and a good father the law does not interfere with his conduct towards his wife and children  but it is when he is unfaithful to them when he illtreats them or deserts them that the law interferes with its thou shalt not and compels him to behave against his will in the way in which he ought to have behaved of his own will  it was free to the man to have done his duty by his family without the lawthe moment he neglects his duty he becomes amenable to it  but the law can only force a mans actions  it cannot change his heart  in the instance which i have been just mentioning the law can say to a man you shall not illtreat your family you shall not leave them to starve  but the law cannot say to him you shall love your family  the law can only command from a man outward obedience the obedience of the heart it cannot enforce  the law may make a man do his duty it cannot make a man love his duty  and therefore laws will never set the world right  they can punish persons after the wrong is done and that not certainly nor always  but they cannot certainly prevent the wrongs being done  the law can punish a man for stealing  and yet as we see daily men steal in the face of punishment  or even if the law by its severity makes persons afraid to commit certain particular crimes yet still as long as the sinful heart is left in them unchanged the sin which is checked in one direction is sure to break out in another  sin like every other disease is sure when it is driven onwards to break out at a fresh point or fester within some still more deadly because more hidden and unsuspected shape  the man who dare not be an open sinner for fear of the law can be a hypocrite in spite of it  the man who dare not steal for fear of the law can cheat in spite of it  the selfish man will find fresh ways of being selfish the tyrannical man of being tyrannical however closely the law may watch him  he will discover some means of evading it and thus the law after all though it may keep down crime multiplies sin and by the law as st paul says is the knowledge of sin  what then will do that for this poor world which the law cannot do which as st paul tells us not even the law of god given on mount sinai holy just good as it was could do because no law can give life  what will give men a new heart and a new spirit which shall love its duty and do it willingly and not by compulsion everywhere and always and not merely just as far as it commanded  the text tells us that there is a spirit the fruit of which is love joy peace longsuffering gentleness goodness faith meekness temperance a character such as no laws can give to a man and which no law dare punish in a man  look at this character as st paul sets it forthand then think what need would there be of all these burdensome and expensive laws if all men were but full of the fruits of that spirit which st paul describes  i know what answer will be ready in some of your minds at least to all this  you will be ready to reply almost angrily of course if everyone was perfect we should need no laws  but people are not perfect and you cannot expect them to be  my friends whether or not we expect baptized people living in a christian country to be perfect god expects them to be perfect for he has said by the mouth of his son our lord jesus christ be ye therefore perfect as our father which is in heaven is perfect  and he has told us what being perfect is like you may read it for yourselves in his sermon on the mount and you may see also that what he commands us to do in that sermon from the beginning to the end is the exact opposite and contrary of the ways and rules of this world which as i have shown make burdensome laws necessary to prevent our devouring each other now do you think that god would have told us to be perfect if he knew that it was impossible for us  do you think that he the god of truth would have spoken such a cruel mockery against poor sinful creatures like us as to command us a duty without giving us the means of fulfilling it  do you think that he did not know ten thousand times better than i what i have been just telling you that laws could not change mens hearts and wills that commanding a man to love and like a thing will not make him love and like it that a mans heart and spirit must be changed in him from within and not merely laws and commandments laid on him from without  then why has he commanded us to love each other ay to love our enemies to bless those who curse us to pray for those who use us spitefully  do you think the lord meant to make hypocrites of us to tell us to go about as some who call themselves religious do go about with their lips full of meek and humble and simple and loving words while their hearts are full of pride and spite and cunning and hate and selfishness which are all the more deadly for being kept in and plastered over by a smooth outside  god forbid  he tells us to love each other only because he has promised us the spirit of love  he tells us to be humble because he can make us humblehearted  he tells us to be honest because he can make us love and delight in honesty  he tells us to refrain ourselves from foul thoughts as well as from foul actions because he can take the foul heart out of us and give us instead the spirit of purity and holiness  he tells us to lead new lives after the new pattern of himself because he can give us new hearts and a new spring of life within us in short he bids us behave as sons of god should behave because as he said himself if we being evil know how to give our children what is good for them much more will our heavenly father give his holy spirit to those who ask him  if you would be perfect ask your father in heaven to make you perfect  if you feel that your heart is wrong ask him to give you a new and a right heart  if you feel yourselvesas you are whether you feel it or nottoo weak too ignorant too selfish to guide yourselves ask him to send his spirit to guide you ask for the spirit from which comes all love all light all wisdom all strength of mind  ask for that spirit and you shall receive it seek for it and you shall find it knock at the gate of your fathers treasurehouse and it shall be surely opened to you  but some of you perhaps are saying to yourselves how will my being changed and renewed by the spirit of god render the laws less burdensome while the crime and sin around me remain unchanged  it is others who want to be improved as much and perhaps more than i do  it may be so my friends or again it may not those who fancy that others need gods spirit more than they do may be the very persons who need it really the most those who say they see may be only proving their blindness by so saying those who fancy that their souls are rich and are full of all knowledge and understand the whole bible and want no further teaching may be as they were in st johns time just the ones who are wretched and miserable and poor and blind and naked in soul and do not know it  but at all events if you think others need to be changed by gods spirit pray that gods spirit may change them  for believe me unless you pray for gods spirit for each other ay for the whole world there is no use asking for yourselves  this i believe is one of the reasons perhaps the chief reason why the fruits of gods spirit are so little seen among us in these days why our christianity is become more and more dead and hollow and barren while expensive and intricate laws and taxes are becoming more and more necessary every year because our religion has become so selfish because we have been praying for gods spirit too little for each other  our prayers have become too selfish  we have been looking for gods spirit not so much as a means to enable us to do good to others but as some sort of mysterious charm which was to keep us ourselves from the punishment of our sins in the next life or give us a higher place in heaven and therefore st jamess words have been fulfilled to us even in our very prayers for gods spirit ye ask and have not because ye ask amiss to consume it upon your lustssave our selfish souls from the pains of hell to give our selfish souls selfish pleasures and selfish glorification in the world to come but not to spread gods kingdom upon earth not to make us live on earth such lives as christ lived a life of love and selfsacrifice and continual labour for the souls of others  therefore it is that gods spirit is not poured out upon us in these days for gods spirit is the spirit of love and brotherhood which delivers a man from his selfishness and if we do not desire to be delivered from our selfishness we do not desire the spirit of god and the spirit of god will not be bestowed upon us  and no man desires to be delivered from his own selfishness who in his very prayers when he ought to be thinking least about himself alone is thinking about himself most of all and forgetting that he is the member of a familythat all mankind are his brethrenthat he can claim nothing for himself to which every sinner around him has an equal rightthat nothing is necessary for him which is not equally necessary for everyone around him that he has all the world besides himself to pray for and that his prayers for himself will be heard only according as he prays for all the world beside  baptism teaches us this when it tells us that our old selfish nature is to be washed away and a new character after the pattern of christ is to live and grow up in us that from the day we are baptized to the day of our death we should live not for ourselves but for jesus in whom was no selfishness when it teaches us that we are not only children of god but members of christs family and heirs of gods kingdom and therefore bound to make common cause with all other members of that family to live and labour for the common good of all our fellowcitizens in that kingdom  the lords prayer teaches us this when he tells us to pray not my father but our father not my soul be saved but thy kingdom come not give me but give us our daily bread not forgive me but forgive us our trespasses and that only as we forgive others not lead me not but lead us not into temptation not deliver me but deliver us from evil after that manner the lord told us to pray and in proportion as we pray in that manner asking for nothing for ourselves which we do not ask for everyone else in the whole world just so far and no farther will god hear our prayers  he who asks for gods spirit for himself only and forgets that all the world need it as much as he is not asking for gods spirit at all and does not know even what gods spirit is  the mystery of pentecost too which came to pass on this day 1818 years ago teaches us the same thing also  those cloven tongues of fire the tokens of gods spirit fell not upon one man but upon many not when they were apart from each other but when they were together and what were the fruits of that spirit in the apostles  did they remain within that upper room each priding himself upon his own gifts and trying merely to gain heaven for his own soul  if they had any such fancies as they very likely had before the spirit fell upon them they had none such afterwards  the spirit must have taken all such thoughts from them and given them a new notion of what it was to be devout and holy  for instead of staying in that upper room they went forth instantly into the public place to preach in foreign tongues to all the people  instead of keeping themselves apart from each other in silence and fancying as some have done and some do now that they pleased god by being solitary and melancholy and selfishwhat do we read the fruit of gods spirit was in them that they and the three thousand souls who were added to them on the first day of their preaching were all together and had all things common and sold their possessions and goods and parted them to all men as every man had need and continuing daily with one accord in the temple and breaking bread from house to house did eat their bread in gladness and singleness of heart praising god and having favour with all the people  those were the fruits of gods spirit in them  till we see more of that sort of life and society in england we shall not be able to pride ourselves on having much of gods spirit among us  but above all if anything will teach us that the strength of gods spirit is not a strength which we must ask for for ourselves alone that the blessings of gods kingdom are blessings which we cannot have in order to keep them to ourselves but can only enjoy in as far as we share them with those around us if anything i say ought to teach us that lesson it is the sacrament of the lords supper  just consider a moment my friends what a strange thing it is if we will think of it that the lords supper the most solemn and sacred thing with which a man can have to do upon earth is just a thing which he cannot transact for himself or by himself  not alone in secret in his chamber but whether he will or not in the company of others not merely in the company of his own private friends but in the company of any or everyone rich or poor who chooses to kneel beside him he goes with others rich and poor alike to the lords table and there the same bread and the same wine is shared among all by the same priest  if that means anything it means thisthat rich and poor alike draw life for their souls from the same well not for themselves only not apart from each other but all in common all together because they are brothers members of one family as the leaves are members of the same tree that as the same bread and the same wine are needed to nourish the bodies of all the same spirit of god is needed to nourish the souls of all and that we cannot have this spirit except as members of a body any more than a mans limb can have life when it is cut off and parted from him  this is the reason and the only reason why protestant clergymen are forbidden thank god to give the holy sacrament of the lords supper to any one person singly  if a clergyman were to administer the lords supper to himself in private without any congregation to partake with him it would not be the lords supper it would be nothing and worse than nothing it would be a sham and a mockery and i believe a sin  i do not believe that christ would be present that gods spirit would rest on that man  for our lord says that it is where two or three are gathered together in his name that he is in the midst of them  and it was at a supper at a feast where all the apostles were met together that our lord divided the bread amongst them and told them to share the cup amongst themselves just as a sign that they were all members of one bodythat the welfare of each of them was bound up in the welfare of all the rest that gods blessing did not rest upon each singly but upon all together  and it is just because we have forgotten this my friendsbecause we have forgotten that we are all brothers and sisters children of one family members of one bodybecause in short we have carried our selfishness into our very religion and up to the altar of god that we neglect the lords supper as we do  people neglect the lords supper because they either do not know or do not like that of which the lords supper is the token and warrant  it is not merely that they feel themselves unfit for the lords supper because they are not in love and charity with all men  oh my dear friends do not some of your hearts tell you that the reason why you stay away from the lords supper is because you do not wish to be fit for the lords supperbecause you do not like to be in love and charity with all menbecause you do not wish to be reminded that you are equals in gods sight all equally sinful all equally pardonedand to see people whom you dislike or despise kneeling by your side and partaking of the same bread and wine with you as a token that god sees no difference between you and them that god looks upon you all as brothers however little brotherly love or fellowfeeling there may be alas between you  or again do not some of you stay away from the lords supper because you see no good in going because it seems to make those who go no better than they were before  shall i tell you the reason of that  shall i tell you why as is too true too many do come to the lords supper and so far from being the better for it seem only the worse  because they come to it in selfishness  we have fallen into the same false and unscriptural way of looking at the lords supper into which the papists have  people go to the lords supper nowadays too much to get some private good for their own souls and it would not matter to many of them i am afraid if not another person in the parish received it provided they can get as they fancy the same blessing from it  thus they come to it in an utterly false and wrong temper of mind  instead of coming as members of christs body to get from him life and strength to work in their places as members of that body they come to get something for themselves as if there was nobody elses soul in the world to be saved but their own  instead of coming to ask for the spirit of god to deliver them from their selfishness and make them care less about themselves and more about all around them they come to ask for the spirit of god because they think it will make themselves higher and happier in heaven  and of course they do not get what they come for because they come for the wrong thing thus those who see them begin to fancy that the lords supper is not after all so very important for the salvation of their souls and not finding in the bible actually written these words thou shalt perish everlastingly unless thou take the lords supper they end by staying away from it and utterly neglecting it they and their children after them preferring their own selfishness to gods spirit of love and saying like esau of old i am hungry and i must live  i must get on in this selfish world by following its selfish ways what is the use of a spirit of love and brotherhood to me  if i were to obey the gospel and sacrifice my own interest for those around me i should starve what good will my birthright do me  oh my friends i pray god that some of you at least may change your mind  i pray god that some of you may see at last that all the misery and the burdens of this time spring from one root which is selfishness and that the reason why we are selfish is because we have not with us the spirit of god which is the spirit of brotherhood and love  let us pray god now and henceforth to take that selfishness out of all our hearts  let us pray god now and henceforth to pour upon us and upon all our countrymen ay and upon the whole world the spirit of friendship and fellowfeeling the spirit which when men have among them they need no laws to keep them from supplanting and oppressing and devouring each other because its fruits are love cheerfulness peace long suffering gentleness goodness honesty meekness temperance then there will be no need my friends for me to call you to the supper of the lord you will no more think of staying away from it than the apostles did when the spirit was poured out on them  for what do we read that they did after the first whitsunday  that altogether with one accord they broke bread daily that is partook of the lords supper every day from house to house  they did not need to be told to do it  they did it as i may say by instinct  there was no question or argument about it in their minds  they had found out that they were all brothers with one common cause in joy and sorrowthat they were all members of one bodythat the life of their souls came from one root and spring from one lord and saviour jesus christ the light and the life of men in whom they were all one members of each other and therefore they delighted in that lords supper just because it brought them together just because it was a sign and a token to them that they did belong to each other that they had one lord one faith one interest one common cause for this life and for all eternity  and therefore the blessing of that lords supper did come to them and in it they did receive strength to live like children of god and members of christ and brothers to each other and to all mankind  they proved by their actions what that communion feast that sacrament of brotherhood had done for them  they proved it by not counting their own lives dear to them but going forth in the face of poverty and persecution and death itself to preach to the whole world the good news that christ was their king  they proved it by their conduct to each other when they had all things in common and sold their possessions and goods and parted them to all as every man had need  they proved it by needing no laws to bind them to each other from without because they were bound to each other from within by the love which comes down from god and is the very bond of peace and of every virtue which becomes a man    xiascensionday    and jesus led them out as far as to bethany and he lifted up his hands and blessed them  and it came to pass while he blessed them he was parted from them and carried up into heaven  and they worshipped him and returned to jerusalem with great joy and were continually in the temple praising and blessing godluke xxiv 50 53  on this day it is fit and proper for usif we have understood and enjoyed and profited by the wonder of the lords ascension into heavento be in the same state of mind as the apostles were after his ascension  for what was right for them is right for us and for all men the same effects which it produced on them it ought to produce on us  and we may know whether we are in the state in which christian men ought to be by seeing how far we are in the same state of mind as the apostles were  now the text tells us in what state of mind they were how that after the lord jesus was parted from them and carried up into heaven they worshipped him and returned to jerusalem with great joy and were continually in the temple praising and blessing god  it seems at first sight certainly very strange that they should go back with great joy  they had just lost their teacher their masterone who had been more to them than all friends and fathers could be one who had taken them poor simple fishermen and changed the whole course of their lives and taught them things which he had taught to no one else and given them a great and awful work to dothe work of changing the ways and thoughts and doings of the whole world  he had sent them outeleven unlettered working mento fight against the sin and the misery of the whole world  and he had given them open warning of what they were to expect that by it they should win neither credit nor riches nor ease nor anything else that the world thinks worth having  he gave them fair warning that the world would hate them and try to crush them  he told them as the gospel for today says that they should be driven out of the churches that the religious people as well as the irreligious would be against them that the time would come when those who killed them would think that they did god service that nothing but labour and want and persecution and slander and torture and death was before themand now he had gone away and left them  he had vanished up into the empty air  they were to see his face and hear his voice no more  they were to have no more of his advice no more of his teaching no more of his tender comfortings they were to be alone in the worldeleven poor working men with the whole world against them and so great a business to do that they would not have time to get their bread by the labour of their hands  is it not wonderful that they did not sit down in despair and say what will become of us  is it not wonderful that they did not give themselves up to grief at losing the teacher who was worth all the rest of the world put together  is it not wonderful that they did not go back each one to his old trade to his fishing and to his daily labour saying at all events we must eat at all events we must get our livelihood and end as they had begun in being mere labouring men of whom the world would never have heard a word  and instead of that we read that they went back with great joy not to their homes but to jerusalem the capital city of their country and were continually in the temple blessing and praising god  well my friends and if it is possible for one man to judge what another man would have doneif it is possible to guess what we should have done in their casecommonsense must show us this that if he was merely their teacher they would have either given themselves up to despair or gone back some to their plough some to their fishingnets and some like matthew to their countinghouses and we should never have heard a word of them  but if you will look in your bibles you will find that they thought him much more than a teacherthat they thought him to be the lord and king of the whole world and you will find that the great joy with which the disciples went back after he ascended into heaven came from certain very strange words that he had been speaking to them just before he ascendedwords about which they could have but two opinions  either they must have thought that they were utter falsehood and selfconceit and blasphemy and that jesus who had been all along speaking to them such words of wisdom and holiness as never man spake before had suddenly changed his whole character at the last and become such a sort of person as it is neither fit for me to speak of or you to hear me speak of in gods church and in jesus christs hearing even though it be merely for the sake of argument or else they must have thought this about his words that they were the most joyful and blessed words that ever had been spoken on the earth that they were the best of all news the most complete of all gospels for this poor sinful world that what jesus had said about himself was true and that as long as it was true it did not matter in the least what became of them it did not matter in the least what difficulties stood in their way for they would be certain to conquer them all it did not matter in the least how men might persecute and slander them for they would be sure to get their reward it did not matter in the least how miserable and sinful the world might be just then for it was certain to be changed and converted and brought to god to righteousness to love to freedom to light at last  if you look at the various accounts in the four gospels of the lords last words on earth you will see surely what i mean  let us take them one by one  st matthew tells us that a few days before the lords ascension he met his disciples on a mountain in galilee where he had appointed them to await him and there told them that all power was given to him in heaven and earth  was not that blessed newswas not that a gospel  that all the power in heaven and earth belonged to him  to him who had all his life been doing good  to him in whom there had never been one single stain of tyranny or selfishness  to him who had been the friend of publicans and sinners  to him who had rebuked the very richest and loved the very poorest  to him who had shown that he had both the power and the will to heal every kind of sickness and disease  to him who had conquered and driven out wherever he met them all the evil spirits which enslave and torment poor sinful men  to him who had shown by rising from the dead that he was stronger than even death itself  to him who had declared that he was the son of god the father that the great god who had made heaven and earth and all therein was perfectly pleased and satisfied with him that he was come to do his fathers will and not his own that he was the ancient lord of the earth the i am who was before abraham  and he was now to have all power in heaven and earth  everything which was done right in the world henceforth was to be his doing  the kingdom and rule over the whole universe was to be his  so he said and his disciples believed him and if they believed him how could they but rejoice  how could they but rejoice at the glorious thought that he the son of the village maiden the champion of the poor and the suffering was to have the government of the world for ever  that he who all the while he had been on earth had showed that he was perfect justice perfect love perfect humanity was to reign till he had put all his enemies under his feet  how could the world but prosper under such a king as that how could wickedness triumph while he the perfectly righteous one was king  how could misery triumph while he the perfectly merciful one was king  how could ignorance triumph while he the perfectly wise one who had declared that god the father hid nothing from him was king  unless the disciples had been more dull and selfish than the dumb beasts around them what could they do but rejoice at that news  what matter to them if jesus were taken out of their sight as long as all power was given to him in heaven and earth  but he had told them more  he had told them that they were not to keep this glorious secret to themselves  no  they were to go forth and preach the gospel of it the good news of it to every creature to preach the gospel of the kingdom of god  the good news that god was the king of men after all that cruel tyrants and oppressors and conquerors were not their kings that neither the storms over their heads nor the earth under their feet nor the clouds and the rivers whom the heathens used to worship in the hope of persuading the earth and the weather to be favourable to them and bless their harvests were their kings that idols of wood and stone and evil spirits of lust and cruelty and covetousness were not their kings but that god was their king that he loved them he pitied them in spite of all their sins that he had sent his only begotten son into the world to teach them to live for themto die for themto claim them for his own  and therefore they were to go and baptize all nations as a sign that they were to repent and change and put away all their old false and evil heathen life and rise to a new life they and their children after them as gods children gods family brothers of the son of god  and they were to baptize them into a name showing that they belonged to those into whose name they were baptized into the name of the father and the son and the holy spirit  they were to be baptized into the name of the father as a sign that god was their father and they his children  they were to be baptized into the name of the son as a sign that the son jesus christ was their king and head and not merely their king and head but their saviour who had taken away the sin of the world and redeemed it for god with his own most precious blood and not merely their saviour but their pattern that they might know that they were bound to become as far as is possible for mortal man such sons of god as jesus himself had been like him obedient pure forgiving brotherly caring for each other and not for themselves doing their heavenly fathers will and not their own  and they were to baptize all nations into the name of the holy spirit for a sign that gods spirit the lord and giver of life would be with them to give them new life new holiness new manfulness to teach and guide and strengthen them for ever  that was the gospel which they had to preach  the good news that the son of god was the king of men  that was the name into which they were to baptize all nationsthe name of children of god members of christ heirs of a heavenly and spiritual kingdom which should go on age after age for ever growing and spreading men knew not how as the grains of mustardseed which at first the least of all seeds grows up into a great tree and the birds of the air come and lodge in the branches of itto go on i say from age to age improving cleansing and humanising and teaching the whole world till the kingdoms of the earth became the kingdoms of god and of his christ  that was the work which the apostles had given them to do  do you not see friends that unless those apostles had been the most selfish of men unless all they cared for was their own gain and comfort they must have rejoiced the whole world was to be set rightwhat matter what happened to them  and therefore i said at the beginning of my sermon that a sure way to know whether our minds were in a right state was to see whether we felt about it as the apostles felt  the bible tells us to rejoice always to praise and give thanks to god always  if we believe what the apostles believed we shall be joyful if we do not we shall not be joyful  if we believe in the words which the lord spoke before he ascended on high we shall be joyful  if we believe that all power in heaven and earth is his we shall be joyful  if we believe that the son of the village maiden has ascended up on high and received gifts for men we shall be joyful  if we believe that as our baptism told us god is our father the son of god our saviour the spirit of god ready to teach and guide us we shall be joyful  do you answer me but the world goes on so ill there is so much sin and misery and folly and cruelty in it how can we be joyful  i answer  there was a hundred times as much sin and misery and folly and cruelty in the apostles time and yet they were joyful and full of gladness blessing and praising god  if you answer but we are so slandered and neglected and misunderstood and hardworked and illtreated we have no time to enjoy ourselves or do the things which we should like best  how can we be joyful i answer  so were the apostles  they knew that they would be a hundred times as much slandered and neglected and misunderstood as you can ever be that they would have far less time to enjoy themselves far less opportunity of doing the things which they liked best than you can ever have they knew that misery and persecution and a shameful death were before them and yet they were joyful and full of gladness blessing and praising god  and why should you not be  for what was true for them is true for you  they had no blessing no hope but what you have just as good a right to as they had  they were joyful because god was their father and god is your father  they were joyful because they and all men belonged to gods family and you belong to it  they were joyful because gods spirit was promised to them to make them like god and gods spirit was promised to you  they were joyful because a poor man was king of heaven and earth and that poor man jesus christ who was born at bethlehem is as much your king now as he was theirs then  they were joyful because the whole world was going to improve under his rule and government and the whole world is improving and will go on improving for ever  they were joyful because jesus whom they had known as a poor despised crucified man on earth had ascended up to heaven in glory and if you believe the same you will be joyful too in proportion as you believe the mystery of ascensionday if you believe the words which the lord spoke before he ascended you will have cheerful joyful hopeful thoughts about yourselves and about the whole world if you do not you will be in continual danger of becoming suspicious and despairing fancying the world still worse than it is fancying that god has neglected and forgotten it fancying that the devil is stronger than god and mans sins wider than christs redemption till you will think it neither worth while to do right yourselves nor to make others do right towards you    xiithe fount of science    a sermon preached at st margarets church westminster may 4th 1851 in behalf of the westminster hospital  when he ascended up on high he led captivity captive and received gifts for men yea even for his enemies that the lord god might dwell among thempsalm lxviii 18 and ephesians iv 8  if a thousand years ago a congregation in this place had been addressed upon the text which i have chosen they would have had i think little difficulty in applying its meaning to themselves and in mentioning at once innumerable instances of those gifts which the king of men had received for men innumerable signs that the lord god was really dwelling amongst them  but amongst those signs i think they would have mentioned several which we are not now generally accustomed to consider in such a light  they would have pointed not merely to the building of churches the founding of schools the spread of peace the decay of slavery but to the importation of foreign literature the extension of the arts of reading writing painting architecture the improvement of agriculture and the introduction of new and more successful methods of the cure of diseases  they might have expressed themselves on these points in a way that we consider now puerile and superstitious  they might have attributed to the efficacy of prayer many cures which we now attributeshall i say to no cause whatsoever  they may have quoted as an instance of st cuthberts sanctity rather than of his shrewd observations his discovery of a spring of water in the rocky floor of his cell and his success in growing barley upon the barren island where wheat refused to germinate and we might have smiled at their superstition and smiled too at their seeing any consequence of christianity any token that the kingdom of god was among them in bishop wilfreds rescuing the hampshire saxons from the horrors of famine by teaching them the use of fishingnets  but still so they would have spokenmen of a turn of mind no less keen shrewd and practical than we their children and if we had objected to their socalled superstition that all these improvements in the physical state of england were only the natural consequences of the introduction of roman civilisation by french and italian missionaries they would have smiled at us in their turn not perhaps without some astonishment at our stupidity and asked  do you not see too that that is in itself a sign of the kingdom of godthat these nations who have been for ages selfishly isolated from each other except for purposes of conquest and desolation should be now teaching each other helping each other interchanging more and more generation by generation their arts their laws their learning becoming fused down under the influence of a common creed and loyalty to one common king in heaven from their state of savage jealousy and warfare into one great christendom and family of god and if my friends as i think those forefathers of ours could rise from their graves this day they would be inclined to see in our hospitals in our railroads in the achievements of our physical science confirmation of that old superstition of theirs proofs of the kingdom of god realisations of the gifts which christ received for men vaster than any of which they had ever dreamed  they might be startled at gods continuing those gifts to us who hold on many points a creed so different from theirs  they might be still more startled to see in the great exhibition of all nations which is our present ninedays wonder that those blessings were not restricted by god even to nominal christians but that his love his teaching with regard to matters of civilisation and physical science were extended though more slowly and partially to the mahometan and the heathen  and it would be a wholesome lesson to them to find that gods grace was wider than their narrow theories perhaps they may have learnt it already in the world of spirits  but of its being gods grace there would be no doubt in their minds  they would claim unhesitatingly and at once that great exhibition established in a christian country as a point of union and brotherhood for all people for a sign that god was indeed claiming all the nations of the world as his ownproving by the most enormous facts that he had sent down a pentecost gifts to men which would raise them not merely spiritually but physically and intellectually beyond anything which the world had ever seen and had poured out a spirit among them which would convert them in the course of ages gradually but most surely and really from a pandemonium of conquerors and conquered devourers and devoured into a family of fellowhelping brothers until the kingdoms of the world became the kingdoms of god and of his christ  but i think one thing if anything would stagger their simple old saxon faith one thing would make them fearful as indeed it makes the preacher this day that the time of real brotherhood and peace is still but too far off and that the achievements of our physical science the unity of this great exhibition noble as they are are still only dim forecastings and prophecies as it were of a higher nobler reality  and they would say sadly to us their children sons you ought to be so near to god he seems to have given you so much and to have worked among you as he never worked for any nation under heaven  how is it that you give the glory to yourselves and not to him  for do we give the glory of our scientific discoveries to god in any real honest and practical sense  there may be some official and perfunctory talk of gods blessing on our endeavours but there seems to be no real belief in us that god the inspiration of god is the very fount and root of the endeavours themselves that he teaches us these great discoveries that he gives us wisdom to get this wondrous wealth that he works in us to will and to do of his good pleasure true we keep up something of the form and tradition of the old talk about such things we join in prayer to god to bless our great exhibition but we do not believewe do not believe my friends that it was god who taught us to conceive build and arrange that great exhibition and our notion of gods blessing it seems to be gods absence from it a hope and trust that god will leave it and us alone and not visit it or us in it or interfere by any special providences by storms or lightning or sickness or panic or conspiracy a sort of dim feeling that we could manage it all perfectly well without god but that as he exists and has some power over natural phenomena which is not very exactly defined we must notice his existence over and above our work lest he should become angry and visit us    and this in spite of words which were spoken by one whose office it was to speak them as the representative of the highest and most sacred personage in these realms words which deserve to be written in letters of gold on the high places of this city in which he spoke of this exhibition as an approach to a more complete fulfilment of the great and sacred mission which man has to perform in the world when he told the english people that mans reason being created in the image of god he has to discover the laws by which almighty god governs his creations and by making these laws the standard of his action to conquer nature to his use himself a divine instrument when he spoke of thankfulness to almighty god for what he has already given as the first feeling which that exhibition ought to excite in us and as the second the deep conviction that those blessings can only be realised in proportion tonot as some would have it the rivalry and selfish competitionbut in proportion to the help which we are prepared to render to each other and therefore by peace love and ready assistance not only between individuals but between all nations of the earth  we read those great words but in the hearts of how few alas to judge from our modern creed on such matters must the really important and distinctive points of them find an echo  to how few does this whole exhibition seem to have been anything but a matter of personal gain or curiosity for national aggrandisement insular selfglorification and selfishi had almost said treacherousrivalry with the very foreigners whom we invited as our guests  and so too with our cures of diseases  we speak of gods blessing the means and gods blessing the cure  but all we really mean by blessing them is permitting them  do not our hearts confess that our notion of his blessing the means is his leaving the means to themselves and their own physical lawsleaving in short the cure to us and not preventing our science doing its work and asserting his own existence by bringing on some unexpected crisis or unfortunate relapseif indeed the old theory that he does bring on such be true  our old forefathers on the other hand used to believe that in medicine as in everything else god taught men all that they knew they believed the words of the wise man when he said that the spirit of god gives man understanding  the method by which solomon believed himself to have obtained all his physical science and knowledge of trees from the cedar of lebanon to the hyssop which groweth on the wall was in their eyes the only possible method they believed the words of isaiah when he said of the tillage and the rotation of crops in use among the peasants of his country that their god instructed them to discretion and taught them and that even the various methods of threshing out the various species of grain came forth from the lord of hosts who is excellent in counsel and wonderful in working  such a method you say seems to you now miraculous  it did not seem to our forefathers miraculous that god should teach man it seemed to them most simple most rational most natural an utterly everyday axiom  they thought it was because so few of the heathen were taught by god that they were no wiser than they were  they thought that since the son of god had come down and taken our nature upon him and ascended up on high and received gifts for men that it was now the right and privilege of every human being who was willing to be taught of god as the prophet foretold in those very words and that baptism was the very sign and seal of that facta sign that for every human being whatever his age sex rank intellect or race a certain measure of the teaching of god and of the spirit of god was ready promised sure as the oath of him that made heaven and the earth and all things therein  that was solomons belief  we do not find that it made him a fanatic and an idler waiting with folded hands for inspiration to come to him he knew not how nor whence  his belief that wisdom was the revelation and gift of god did not prevent him from seeking her as silver and searching for her as hid treasures from applying his heart to seek and search out by wisdom concerning all things that are done under heaven and we do not find that it prevented our forefathers  ceadmons belief that god inspired him with the poetic faculty did not make him the less laborious and careful versifier  bishop johns blessing the dumb boys tongue in the name of him whom he believed to be word of god and the master of that poor dumb boy did not prevent his anticipating some of the discoveries of our modern wise men in setting about a most practical and scientific cure  alfreds continual prayers for light and inspiration made him no less a laborious and thoughtful student of war and law of physics language and geography  these old teutons for all these superstitions of theirs were perhaps as businesslike and practical in those days as we their children are in these  but that did not prevent their believing that unless god showed them a thing they could not see it and thanking him honestly enough for the comparative little which he did show them  but we who enjoy the accumulated teaching of ageswe to whose researches he is revealing year by year almost week by weeks wonders of which they never dreamedwe whom he has taught to make the lame to walk the dumb to speak the blind to see to exterminate the pestilence and defy the thunderbolt to multiply millionfold the fruits of learning to annihilate time and space to span the heavens and to weigh the sun what madness is this which has come upon us in these last days to make us fancy that we insects of a day have found out these things for ourselves and talk big about the progress of the species and the triumphs of intellect and the allconquering powers of the human mind and give the glory of all this inspiration and revelation not to god but to ourselves  let us beware bewarelest our boundless pride and selfsatisfaction by some mysterious yet most certain law avenge itselflest like the assyrian conqueror of old while we stand and cry is not this great babylon which i have built our reason like his should reel and fall beneath the narcotic of our own maddening selfconceit and while attempting to scale the heavens we overlook some pitfall at our feet and fall as learned idiots suicidal pedants to be a degradation and a hissing and a shame  however strongly you may differ from these opinions of our own forefathers with regard to the ground and cause of physical science and the arts of healing i am sure that the recollection of the thrice holy ground upon which we stand beneath the shadow of venerable piles witnesses for the creeds the laws the liberties which those our ancestors have handed down to us will preserve you from the temptation of dismissing with hasty contempt their thoughts upon any subject so important will make you inclined to listen to their opinion with affection if not with reverence and save perhaps the preacher from a sneer when he declares that the doctrine of those old saxon men is in his belief not only the most scriptural but the most rational and scientific explanation of the grounds of all human knowledge  at least i shall be able to quote in support of my own opinion a name from which there can be no appeal in the minds of a congregation of educated englishmeni mean francis bacon lord verulam the spiritual father of the modern science and therefore of the chemistry and the medicine of the whole civilised world  if there is one thing which more than another ought to impress itself on the mind of a careful student of his works it is thisthat he considered science as the inspiration of god and every separate act of induction by which man arrives at a physical law as a revelation from the maker of those laws and that the faith which gave him daring to face the mystery of the universe and proclaim to men that they could conquer nature by obeying her was his deep living practical belief that there was one who had ascended up on high and led captive in the flesh and spirit of a man those very idols of sense which had been themselves leading mens minds captive enslaving them to the illusions of their own senses forcing them to bow down in vague awe and terror before those powers of nature which god had appointed not to be their tyrants but their slaves  i will not specialplead particulars from his works wherein i may consider that he asserts this  i will rather say boldly that the idea runs through every line he ever wrote that unless seen in the light of that faith the grounds of his philosophy ought to be as inexplicable to us as they would without it have been impossible to himself as has been well said of him  faith in god as the absolute ground of all human as well as of all natural laws the belief that he had actually made himself known to his creatures and that it was possible for them to have a knowledge of him cleared from the phantasies and idols of their own imaginations and understandings this was the necessary foundation of all that great mans mind and speculations to whatever point they were tending and however at times they might be darkened by too close a familiarity with the corruptions and meannesses of man or too passionate an addiction to the contemplation of nature  nor should it ever be forgotten that he owed all the clearness and distinctness of his mind to his freedom from that pantheism which naturally disposes to a vague admiration and adoration of nature to the belief that it is stronger and nobler than ourselves that we are servants and puppets and portions of it and not its lords and rulers  if bacon had in anywise confounded nature with godif he had not entertained the strongest practical feeling that men were connected with god through one who had taken upon him their nature it is impossible that he could have discovered that method of dealing with physics which has made a physical science possible  no really careful student of his works but must have perceived this however glad alas he may have felt at times to thrust the thought of it from him and try to think that francis bacons christianity was something over and above his philosophya religion which he left behind him at the churchdooror only sprinkled up and down his works so much of it as should shield him in a bigoted age from the suspicion of materialism  a strange theory and yet one which so determined is man to see nothing whether it be in the bible or in the novum organum but what each wishes to see has been deliberately put forth again and again by men who fancy forsooth that the greatest of english heroes was even such an one as themselves  one does not wonder to find among the general characteristics of those writers who admire bacon as a materialist the most utter incapacity of philosophising on bacons method the very restless conceit the hasty generalisation the hankering after cosmogonic theories which bacon anathematises in every page  yes i repeat it we owe our medical and sanitary science to bacons philosophy and bacon owed his philosophy to his christianity  oh it is easy for us amid the marvels of our great hospitals now grown commonplace in our eyes from very custom to talk of the empire of mind over matter for uswho reap the harvest whereof bacon sowed the seed  but consider how great the faith of that man must have been who died in hope not having received the promises but seeing them afar off and haunted to his dying day with glorious visions of a time when famine and pestilence should vanish before a scientific obedienceto use his own expressionto the will of god revealed in natural facts  thus we can understand how he dared to denounce all that had gone before him as blind and worthless guides and to proclaim himself to the world as the one restorer of true physical philosophy  thus we can understand how he the cautious and patient man of the world dared indulge in those vast dreams of the scientific triumphs of the future  thus we can understand how he dared hint at the expectation that men would some day even conquer death itself because he believed that man had conquered death already in the person of its king and lordin the flesh of him who ascended up on high and led captivity captive and received gifts for men  the empire of mind over matter  what practical proof had he of it amid the miserable alternations of empiricism and magic which made up the pseudoscience of his time amid the theories and speculations of mankind which as he said were but a sort of madnessuseless alike for discovery or for operation  what right had he more than any other man who had gone before him to believe that man could conquer and mould to his will the unseen and tremendous powers which work in every cloud and every flower that he could dive into the secret mysteries of his own body and renew his youth like the eagles  this ground he had for that faiththat he believed as he says himself that he must begin from god and that the pursuit of physical science clearly proceeds from him the author of good and father of light  this gave him faith to say that in this as in all other divine works the smallest beginnings lead assuredly to some result and that the remark in spiritual matters that the kingdom of god cometh without observation is also found to be true in every great work of divine providence so that everything glides on quietly without confusion or noise and the matter is achieved before men either think or perceive that it is commenced this it was which gave him courage to believe that his own philosophy might be the actual fulfilment of the prophecy that in the last days many should run to and fro and knowledge should be increasedwords which like hundreds of others in his works sound like the outpourings of an almost blasphemous selfconceit till we recollect that he looked on science only as the inspiration of god and mans empire over nature only as the consequence of the redemption worked out for him by christ and begin to see in them the expressions of the deepest and most divine humility  i doubt not that many here will be far more able than i am practically to apply the facts which i have been adducing to the cause of the hospital for which i am pleading  but there is one consequence of them to which i must beg leave to draw attention more particularly especially at the present era of our nation  if then these discoveries of science be indeed revelations and inspirations from god does it not follow that all classes even the poorest and the most ignorant the most brutal have an equal right to enjoy the fruits of them  does it not follow that to give to the poor their share in the blessings which chemical and medical science are working out for us is not a matter of charity or benevolence but of duty of indefeasible peremptory immediate duty  for consider my friends the son of god descends on earth and takes on him not only the form but the very nature affections trials and sorrows of a man  he proclaims himself as the person who has been all along ruling guiding teaching improving men the light who lighteth every man who cometh into the world  he proclaims himself by acts of wondrous power to be the internecine foe and conqueror of every form of sorrow slavery barbarism weakness sickness death itself  he proclaims himself as one who is come to give his life for his sheep one who is come to restore to men the likeness in which they were originally created the likeness of their father in heaven who accepteth the person of no manwho causeth his sun to shine on the evil and on the good who sendeth his rain on the just and on the unjust in whose sight the meanest publican if his only consciousness be that of his own baseness and worthlessness is more righteous than the most learned respectable and selfsatisfied pharisee  he proclaims himself the setterup of a kingdom into which the publican and the harlot will pass sooner than the rich the mighty and the noble a kingdom in which all men are to be brothers and their bond of union loyalty to one who spared not his own life for the sheep who came not to do his own but the will of the father who had sent him and who showed by his toil among the poor the outcast the ignorant and the brutal what that same will was like with his own lifeblood he seals this covenant between god and man he offers up his own body as the firstfruits of this great kingdom of selfsacrifice  he takes poor fishermen and mechanics and sends them forth to acquaint all men with the good news that god is their king and to baptize them as subjects of that kingdom bound to rise in baptism to a new life a life of love and brotherhood and self sacrifice like his own  he commands them to call all nations to that sacred feast wherein there is neither rich nor poor but the same bread and the same wine are offered to the monarch and to the slave as signs of their common humanity their common redemption their common interestsigns that they derive their life their health their reason their every faculty of body soul and spirit from one who walked the earth as the son of a poor carpenter who ate and drank with publicans and sinners  he sends down his spirit on them with gifts of language eloquence wisdom and healing as mere earnests and firstfruits so they said of that prophecy that he would pour out his spirit upon all flesh even upon slaves and handmaids  and these poor fishermen feel themselves impelled by a divine and irresistible impulse to go forth to the ends of the world and face persecution insult torture and deathnot in order that they may make themselves lords over mankind but that they may tell them that one is their master even jesus christ both god and man that he rules the world and will rule it and can rule it that in his sight there is no distinction of race or rank or riches neither jew nor greek barbarian scythian bond or free  and as a fact their message has prevailed and been believed and in proportion as it has prevailed not merely individual sanctity or piety but liberty law peace civilisation learning art science the gifts which he bought for men with his blood have followed in its train  while the nations who have not received that message that god was their king or having received it have forgotten it or perverted it into a superstition and an hypocrisy have in exactly that proportion fallen back into barbarism and bloodshed slavery and misery  my friends if this philosophy of history this theory of human progress or as i should call it this gospel of the kingdom of god mean anythingdoes it not mean this this which our forefathers believed dimly and inconsistently perhaps but still believed it else we had not been here this daythat we are not our own but the servants of jesus christ and brothers of each otherthat the very constitution and groundlaw of this human species which has been redeemed by christ is the selfsacrifice which christ displayed as the one perfection of humanitythat all rank property learning science are only held by their possessors in trust from that king who has distributed them to each according as he will that each might use them for the good of all certainas certain as gods promise can make manthat if by giving up our own interest for the interest of others we seek first the kingdom of god and the righteousness between man and man which we call mercy according to which it is constituted all other things health wealth peace and every other blessing which humanity can desire shall be added unto us over and above as the natural and necessary fruits of a society founded according to the will of god and declared in his son jesus christ and therefore according to those physical laws whereof he is at once the creator the director and the revealer  this was the faith of our forefathers both laity and clergythat the lord was king be the people never so unquiet that men were his stewards and his pupils only and not his vicars that they were equal in his sight and not the slaves and tyrants of each other and that the help that was done upon earth he did it all himself dimly doubtless they saw it and inconsistently  but they saw it and to their faith in that great truth we owe all that has made england really noble among the nations  of the fruits of that faith every venerable building around us should remind us  to that faith in the laity we owe the abolition of serfdom the freedom of our institutions the laws which provide equal justice between man and man to that faith in the clergy and especially in the monastic orders we owe the endowment of our schools and universities the improvement of agriculture the preservation and the spread of all the liberal arts and sciences as far as they were then discovered so that every one of those abbeys which we now revile so ignorantly became a centre of freedom protection healing and civilisation a refuge for the oppressed a wellspring of mercy for the afflicted a practical witness to the nation that property and science were not the private and absolute possession of men but only held in trust from god for the benefit of the common weal  and just in proportion as in the 14th and 15th centuries those institutions fell from their first estate and began to fancy that their wealth and wisdom was their own acquired by their own cunning to be used for their own aggrandizement they became an imposture and imbecility an abomination and a ruin  and it was this faith too in a still nobler and clearer form which at the reformation inspired the age which could produce a ridley a latimer an elizabeth a shakspeare a spenser a raleigh a bacon and a milton which knit together in spite of religious feuds and social wrongs the nation of england with a bond which all the powers of hell endeavoured in vain to break  doubtless there too there was inconsistency enough elizabeth may have mixed up ambitious dynastic dreams with her intense belief that god had given her her wisdom her learning her mighty will only to be the servant of his servants and defender of the faith  men like drake and raleigh while they were believing that god had sent them forth to smite with the sword of the lord the devourers of the earth the destroyers of religion freedom civilisation and national life may have been unfaithful to what they believed their divine mission and fancied that they might use their wisdom and valour that god gave them for their selfish ends till they committed as some say acts of rapacity and cruelty worthy of the merest buccaneer  but that was not what made them conquer that was not what made the wealth and the might of spain melt away before their little bands of heroes but the same old faith shining out in all their noblest acts and words that the lord was king and that the help that was done upon earth he did it all himself  so again bacon may have fancied and did fancy in his old age that he might use his deep knowledge of mankind for his own selfish ends that he might indulge himself in building himself up a name that might fill all the earth that he who had done so much for god and for mankind might be allowed to do at last somewhat for himself and tempted by a paltry bribe fall for awhile as david did before him that god and not he might have the glory of all his wisdom  but then he was less than himself then he had but lost sight of his lodestar  then he had forgotten but only for awhile that he owed all to the teaching of that god who had given to the young and obscure advocate the mission of affecting the destinies of nations yet unborn  and believe me my friends even as it has been with our forefathers so it will be with us  according to our faith will it be unto us now as it was of old  in proportion as we believe that wealth science and civilisation are the work and property of man in just that proportion we shall be tempted to keep them selfishly and exclusively to ourselves  the man of science will be tempted to hide his discoveries though men may be perishing for lack of them till he can sell them to the highest bidder the rich man will be tempted to purchase them for himself in order that he may increase his own comfort and luxury and feel comparatively lazy and careless about their application to the welfare of the masses he will be tempted to pay an exorbitant price for anything that can increase his personal convenience and yet when the question is about improving the supply of necessaries to the poor stand haggling about considerations of profitable investment excuse himself from doing the duty which lies nearest to him by visions of distant profit of which a thousand unexpected accidents may deprive him after all and make his boasted scientific care for the wealth of the nation an excuse for leaving tens of thousands worse housed and worse fed than his own beasts of burden  the poor man will be tempted franctically to oppose his selfishness and unbelief to the selfishness and unbelief of the rich and clutch from him by force the comfort which really belong to neither of them in order that he may pride himself in them and misuse them in his turn and the clergy will be tempted as they have too often been tempted already to fancy that reason is the enemy and not the twin sister of faith to oppose revelation to science as if gods two messages could contradict each other to widen the manichaean distinction between secular and spiritual matters so pleasant to the natural atheism of fallen man to fancy that they honour god by limiting as much as possible his teaching his providence his wisdom his love and his kingdom and to pretend that they are defending the creeds of the catholic church by denying to them any practical or real influence on the economic political and physical welfare of mankind  but in proportion as we hold to the old faith of our forefathers concerning science and civilisation we shall feel it not only a duty but a glory and a delight to make all men sharers in them to go out into the streets and lanes of the city and call in the maimed and the halt and the blind that they may sit down and take their share of the good things which god has provided in his kingdom for those who obey him  every new discovery will be hailed by us as a fresh boon from god to be bestowed by the rain and the sunshine freely upon us all  the sight of every sufferer will make us ready to suspect and to examine ourselves lest we should be in some indirect way the victim of some neglect or selfishness of our own  every disease will be a sign to us that in some respect or other the physical or moral laws of human nature have been overlooked or broken  the existence of an unhealthy locality the recurrence of an epidemic will be to us a subject of public shame and selfreproach  men of science will no longer go up and down entreating mankind in vain to make use of their discoveries the sanitary reformer will be no longer like wisdom crying in the streets and no man regarding her and in every ill to which flesh is heir we shall see an enemy of our king and lord and an intruder into his kingdom against which we swore at our baptism to fight with an inspiring and delicious certainty that god will prosper the right that his laws cannot change that nature and the disturbances and poisons and brute powers thereof were meant to be the slaves and not the tyrants of a race whose head has conquered the grave itself  this is no speculative dream  the progress of science is daily proving it to be an actual truth proving to us that a large proportion of diseaseshow large a proportion no man yet dare say are preventible by science under the direction of that common justice and mercy which man owes to man  the proper cultivation of the soil it is now clearly seen will exterminate fevers and agues and all the frightful consequences of malaria  an attention to those simple decencies and cleanlinesses of life of which even the wild animals feel the necessity will prevent the epidemics of our cities and all the frightful train of secondary diseases which follow them or supply their place  the question which is generally more and more forcing itself on the minds of scientific men is not how many diseases are but how few are not the consequences of mans ignorance barbarism and folly  the medical man is felt more and more to be as necessary in health as he is in sickness to be the fellowworkman not merely of the clergyman but of the social reformer the political economist and the statesman and the first object of his science to be prevention and not cure  but if all this be true as true it is we ought to begin to look on hospitals as many medical men i doubt not do already in a sadder though in a no less important light  when we remember that the majority of cases which fill their wards are cases of more or less directly preventible diseases the fruits of our social neglect too often of our neglect of the sufferers themselves too often also our neglect of their parents and forefathers when we think how many a bitter pang is engendered and propagated from generation to generation in the noisome alleys and courts of this metropolis by foul food foul bedrooms foul air foul water by intemperance the natural and almost pardonable consequence of want of water depressing and degrading employments and lives spent in such an atmosphere of filth as our daintier nostrils could not endure a day  then we should learn to look upon these hospitals not as acts of charity supererogatory benevolences of ours towards those to whom we owe nothing but as confessions of sin and worthy fruits of penitence as poor and late and partial compensation for misery which we might have prevented  and when again taking up scientific works we find how vast a proportion of the remaining cases of disease are produced directly or indirectly by the unhealthiness of certain occupations so certainly that the scientific man can almost prophesy the average shortening of life and the peculiar form of disease incident to any given form of city labourwhen we find to quote a single instance that a large proportionone half as i am informedof the female cases in certain hospitals are those of womenservants suffering from diseases produced by overwork in household labour especially by carrying heavy weights up the steep stairs of our london houseswhen we consider the large proportion of accident cases which are the result if not always of neglect in our social arrangements still of danger incurred in labouring for us we shall begin to feel that our debts towards the poorer classes for whom this and other hospitals are instituted swells and mounts up to a burden which ought to be and would be intolerable to us if we had not some such means as this hospital affords of testifying our contrition for neglect for which we cannot atone and of practically claiming in the hospital our brotherhood with those masses whom we pass by so carelessly in the workshop and the street  what matters it that they have undertaken a life of labour from necessity and with a full consciousness of the dangers they incur in it  for whom have they been labouring but for us  their handiwork renders our houses luxurious  we wear the clothes they make  we eat the food they produce  they sit in darkness and the shadow of death that we may enjoy light and life and luxury and civilisation  true they are free men in name not free though from the iron necessity of crushing toil  shall we make their liberty a cloak for our licentiousness and because they are our brothers and not our slaves answer with cain am i my brothers keeper  what if we have paid them the wages which they ask  we do not feed our beasts of burden only as long as they are in health and when they fall sick leave them to cure themselves and starveand these are not our beasts of burden they are members of christ children of god inheritors of the kingdom of heaven  prove it to them then for they are in bitter danger of forgetting it in these days  prove to them by helping to cure their maladies that they are members of christ that they do indeed belong to him who without fee or payment freely cured the sick of judaea in old time  prove to them that they are children of god by treating them as suchas children of him without whom not a sparrow falls to the ground children of him whose love is over all his works children of him who defends the widow and the fatherless and sees that those who are in need or necessity have right and who maketh inquiry for the blood of the innocent  prove to them that they are inheritors of the kingdom of heaven by proving to them first of all that the kingdom of heaven exists that all rich and poor alike are brothers and one their master he who ascended up on high and led captivity captive and received gifts for men the gifts of healing the gifts of science the gifts of civilisation the gifts of law the gifts of order the gifts of liberty the gifts of the spirit of love and brotherhood of fellowfeeling and selfsacrifice of justice and humility a spirit fit for a world of redeemed and pardoned men in which mercy is but justice and selfsacrifice the truest selfinterest a world the king and master of which is one who poured out his own lifeblood for the sake of those who hated him that men should henceforth live not for themselves but for him who died and rose again and ascended up on high and received gifts for men that the lord god might dwell among them  and because all general truths can only be verified in particular instances verify your general faith in that christianity which you profess in this particular instance by doing the duty which lies nearest to you and giving as it is called to this hospital for which i now plead  thanks to the spirit and the attainments of the average of english medical men and chaplains to praise the management of any hospital which is under their care is a needless impertinence  do you find funds there will be no fear as to their being well employed and no fear alas either of their services being in full demand while the sanitary state of vast streets of south london lying close to this hospital are in a state in which they are and in which private cupidity and neglect seem willing to compel them to remain  it is on account of its contiguity to these neglected destitute and poisonous localities that this hospital seems to me especially valuable  but though situated in a part of london where its presence is especially needed it has not from various causes which have arisen from no fault of its own attracted as much public notice as some other more magnificent foundations while it possesses one feature peculiar i believe to it among our london hospitals which seems to me to render it especially deserving of support  i speak of the ward for incurable patients in which instead of ending their days in the melancholy wards of a workhouse or amid those pestilential and crowded dwellings which have perhaps produced their maladies and which certainly will aggravate them they may have their heavy years of hopeless suffering softened by a continued supply of constant comforts and constant medical solicitude such as the bestconducted workhouse or the most laborious staff of parish surgeons and district visitors ay not even the benevolence and selfsacrifice of friends and relations can possibly provide  i beseech you picture to yourselves the amount of mere physical comfort not to mention the higher blessings of spiritual teaching and consolation accruing to some poor tortured cripple in the wards of this hospital compare it with the very brightest lot possible for him in the dwellings of the lower or even of the middle classes of the metropolis then recollect that these hospital luxuries which would be unattainable by him elsewhere are but a tithe of those which you in his situation would consider absolute necessaries without which a life of suffering ay even of health were intolerableand do unto others this day as you would that others should do unto you  i might have taken some other and more popular method of drawing your attention to this institution  i might have tried to excite your feelings and sympathies by attempts at pathetic or picturesque descriptions of suffering  but the minister of a just god is bound to proclaim that god demands not sentiment but justice  the bible knows nothing of the religious sentiments and emotions whereof we hear so much talk nowadays  it speaks of duty  beloved if god so loved us we ought to love one another  i might also have attempted to flatter you into giving by representing this as a good work a work of charity and piety well pleasing to god a sort of work of protestant supererogation fruits of faith which we may show if we like up to a certain not very clearly defined point of benevolence but the absence of which probably will not seriously affect our eternal salvation still less our right to call ourselves orthodox protestants churchmen worthy kindhearted respectable blameless  the bible knows nothing of such a religion it neither coaxes nor flatters it commands  it demands mercy because mercy is justice and declares with what measure we mete to others it shall be surely measured to us again if therefore my words shall seem to some here to be not so much a humble request as a peremptory demand i cannot help it  i have pleaded the cause of this hospital on the only solid ground of which i am aware for doing anything but evil to everyone around us who is not a private friend or a member of ones own family  i ask you to help the poor to their share in the gifts which christ received for men because they are his gifts and neither ours nor any mans among these venerable buildings the signs and witnesses of the kingdom of god and the blessings of that kingdom which for a thousand years have been spreading and growing among usi ask it of you as citizens of that kingdom  prove your brotherhood to the poor by restoring to them a portion of that wealth which without their labour you could never have possessed  prove your brotherhood to them in a thousand waysin every wayin this way because at this moment it happens to be the nearest and the most immediate and because the necessity for it is nearer more immediate to judge by the signs of the times and most of all by their selfsatisfied unconsciousness of danger their loud and shallow selfglorification than ever it was before  work while it is called today lest the night come wherein no man can work but only take his wages  again i say i may seem to some here to have pleaded the cause of this hospital in too harsh and peremptory a tone     and yet i have a ground of hope in the english love of simple justice in the noble instances of benevolence and selfsacrifice among the wealthy and educated which are thank god increasing in number daily as the need of them increasesin these i say i have a ground of hope that there are many here today who would sooner hear the language of truth than of flattery who will be more strongly moved toward a righteous deed by being told that it is their duty toward god their country and their fellowcitizens than by any sentimental baits for personal sympathy or for the love of pharisaic ostentation    xiiifirst sermon on the cholera    sunday morning september 27th 1849  gods judgments are from above out of the sight of the wicked psalm x 5  we have just been praying to god to remove from us the cholera which we call a judgment of god a chastisement and god knows we have need enough to do so  but we can hardly expect god to withdraw his chastisement unless we correct the sins for which he chastised us and therefore unless we find out what particular sins have brought the evil on us  for it is mere cant and hypocrisy my friends to tell god in a general way that we believe he is punishing us for our sins and then to avoid carefully confessing any particular sin and to get angry with anyone who tells us boldly which sin god is punishing us for  but so goes the world  everyone is ready to say oh yes we are all great sinners miserable sinners and then if you charge them with any particular sin they bridle up and deny that sin fiercely enough and all sins one by one confessing themselves great sinners and yet saying that they dont know what sins they have committed  no man really believes himself a sinner no man really confesses his sins but the man who can honestly put his finger on this sin or that sin which he has committed and is not afraid to confess to god this sin and that sin have i donethis bad habit and that bad habit have i cherished within me  therefore i say it is no use for us englishmen to dream that we can flatter and persuade the great god of heaven and earth into taking away the cholera from us unless we find out and confess openly what we have done to bring on the cholera and unless we repent and bring forth fruits worthy of repentance by amending our habits on that point and doing everything for the future which shall not bring on the cholera but keep it off  do not let us believe this time my friends in the pitiable insincere way in which all england believed when the cholera was here sixteen years ago  when they saw human beings dying by thousands they all got frightened and proclaimed a fast and confessed their sins and promised repentance in a general way  but did they repent of and confess those sins which had caused the cholera  did they repent of and confess the covetousness the tyranny the carelessness which in most great towns and in too many villages also forces the poor to lodge in undrained stifling hovels unfit for hogs amid vapours and smells which send forth on every breath the seeds of rickets and consumption typhus and scarlet fever and worse and last of all the cholera  did they repent of their sin in that  not they  did they repent of the carelessness and laziness and covetousness which sends meat and fish up to all our large towns in a halfputrid state which fills every corner of london and the great cities with slaughterhouses overcrowded graveyards undrained sewers  not they  to confess their sins in a general way cost them a few words to confess and repent of the real particular sins in themselves was a very different matter to amend them would have touched vested interests would have cost money the englishmans god it would have required selfsacrifice of pocket as well as of time  it would have required manful fighting against the prejudices the ignorance the selfconceit the laziness the covetousness of the wicked world  so they could not afford to repent and amend of all that  and when those great and good men the sanitary commissioners proved to all england fifteen years ago that cholera always appeared where fever had appeared and that both fever and cholera always cling exclusively to those places where there was bad food bad air crowded bedrooms bad drainage and filththat such were the laws of god and nature and always had been they took no notice of it because it was the poor rather than the rich who suffered from those causes  so the filth of our great cities was left to ferment in poisonous cesspools foul ditches and marshes and muds such as those now killing people by hundreds in the neighbourhood of plymouth for one house or sewer that was improved a hundred more were left just as they were in the first cholera as soon as the panic of superstitious fear was past carelessness and indolence returned  men went back the covetous man to his covetousness and the idler to his idleness  and behold sixteen years are past and the cholera is as bad as ever among us  but you will say perhaps it is presumptuous to say that englishmen have brought the cholera on themselves that it is gods judgment and that we cannot explain his inscrutable providence  ah my friends that is a poor excuse and a common one for leaving a great many sins as they are  when people do not wish to do gods will it is a very pleasant thing to talk about gods will as something so very deep and unfathomable that poor human beings cannot be expected to find it out  it is an old excuse and a great favourite with satan i have no doubt  why cannot people find out gods will because they do not like to find it out lest it should shame them and condemn them and cost them pleasure or moneybecause their eyes are blinded with covetousness and selfishness so that they cannot see gods will even when they do look for it and then they go and cant about gods judgments while those judgments as the text says are far above out of their mammonblinded and prejudiceblinded sight  what do they mean by that word  come now my friends let us face the question like men  what do you mean really when you call the cholera or fever or affliction at all gods judgment  do you merely mean that god is punishing you you dont know for what and you cant find out for what but that all which he expects of you is to bear it patiently and then go and do afterwards just what you did before  dare anyone say that who believes that god is a god of justice much less a god of love  what would you think of a father who punished his children and then left them to find out as they could what they were punished for  and yet that is the way people talk of pestilence and of great afflictions public and private they are not ashamed to accuse god of a cruelty and an injustice which they would be ashamed to confess themselves  how can men even religious men often be so blasphemous  mainly i think because they do not really believe in god at all they only believe about himthey believe that they ought to believe in him  they have no living personal faith in god or christ they do not know god they do not know gods character and what to believe of him and what to expect of him or what they ought to say of him because they do not know they have not studied they have not loved the character of christ who is the express image and likeness of god  therefore gods judgments are far away out of their sight therefore they make themselves a god in their own image and after their own likeness lazy capricious revengeful therefore they are not afraid or ashamed to say that god sends pestilence into a country without showing that country why it is sent  but another great reason i believe why gods judgments in this and other matters are far above out of our sight is the careless insincere way of using words which we english have got into even on the most holy and awful matters  i suppose there never was a nation in the world so diseased through and through with the spirit of cant as we english are now  except perhaps the old jews at the time of our lords coming  you hear men talking as if they thought god did not understand english because they cling superstitiously to the letter of the bible in proportion as they lose its spirit  you hear men taking words into their mouths which might make angels weep and devils tremble with a coolness and oily smooth carelessness which shows you that they do not feel the force of what they are saying  you hear them using the words of scripture which are in themselves stricter and deeper than all the books of philosophy in the world in such a loose unscriptural way that they make them mean anything or nothing  they use the words like parrots by rote just because their forefathers used them before them  they will tell you that cholera is a judgment for our sins in a sense but if you ask them for what sins or in what sense they fly off from that home question and begin mumbling commonplaces about the inscrutable decrees of providence and so on it is most sad all this and most fearful also  therefore i asked you my friends what is the meaning of that word judgment  in common talk people use it rightly enough but when they begin to talk of gods judgments they speak as if it merely meant punishments  now judgment and punishment are two things  when a judge gives judgment he either acquits or condemns the accused person he gives the case for the plaintiff or for the defendant the punishment of the guilty person if he be guilty is a separate thing pronounced and inflicted afterwards  his judgment i say is his opinion about the persons guilt and even so gods judgments are the expression of his opinion about our guilt  but there is this difference between man and god in this mattera human judge gives his opinion in words god gives his in events  therefore there is no harm for a human judge when he has told a person why he must punish to punish him in some way that has nothing to do with his crimefor instance to send a man to prison because he steals though it would be far better if criminals could be punished in kind and if the man who stole could be forced either to make restitution or work out the price of what he stole in hard labour  for this is gods plangod always pays sinners back in kind that he may not merely punish them but correct them so that by the kind of their punishment they may know the kind of their sin  god punishes us as i have often told you not by his caprice but by his laws  he does not break his laws to harm us the laws themselves harm us when we break them and get in their way  it is always so you will find with great national afflictions  i believe when we know more of god and his laws we shall find it true even in our smallest private sorrows  god is unchangeable he does not lose his temper as heathens and superstitious men fancy to punish us  he does not change his order to punish us  we break his order and the order goes on in spite of us and crushes us  and so we get gods judgment gods opinion of our breaking his laws  you will find it so almost always in history if a nation is laid waste by war it is generally their own fault they have sinned against the law which god has appointed for nations they have lost courage and prudence and trust in god and fellow feeling and unity and they have become cowardly and selfish and split up into parties and so they are easily conquered by their own fault as the bible tells us the jews were by the chaldeans and their ruin is gods judgment gods opinion plainly expressed of what he thinks of them for having become cowardly and selfish and factious and disinterested  so it is with famine again  famines come by a nations own faultthey are gods plainly spoken opinion of what he thinks of breaking his laws of industry and thrift by improvidence and bad farming  so when a nation becomes poor and bankrupt it is its own fault that nation has broken the laws of political economy which god has appointed for nations and its ruin is gods judgment gods plainspoken opinion again of the sins of extravagance idleness and reckless speculation  so with pestilence and cholera  they come only because we break gods laws as the wise poet well says   voices from the depths of nature borne which vengeance on the guilty head proclaim   of nature of the order and constitution which god has made for this world we live in and which if we break them though god in his mercy so orders the world that punishment comes but seldom even to our worst offences yet surely do bring punishment sooner or later if broken in the common course of nature  yes my friends as surely and naturally as drunkenness punishes itself by a shaking hand and a bloated body so does filth avenge itself by pestilence  fever and cholera as you would expect them to be are the expression of gods judgment gods opinion gods handwriting on the wall against us for our sins of filth and laziness foul air foul food foul drains foul bedrooms  where they are there is cholera  where they are not there is none and will be none because they who do not break gods laws gods laws will not break them  oh do not think me harsh my friends god knows it is no pleasant thing to have to speak bitter and upbraiding words but when one travels about this noble land of england and sees what a blessed place it might be if we would only do gods will and what a miserable place it is just because we will not do gods will it is enough to make ones soul boil over with sorrow and indignation and then when one considers that other mens faults are ones own fault too that one has been adding to the heap of sins by ones own laziness cowardice ignorance it is enough to break ones heartto make one cry with st paul oh wretched man that i am who shall deliver me from the body of this death  ay my friends the state of things in england now is enough to drive an earnest man to despair if one did not know that all our distresses and this cholera like the rest are indeed gods judgments the judgments and expressed opinions not of a capricious tyrant but of a righteous and loving father who chastens us just because he loves us and afflicts us only to teach us his will which alone is life and happiness  therefore we may believe that this very cholera is meant to be a blessing that if we will take the lesson it brings it will be a blessing to england  god grant that all ranks may take the lessonthat the rich may amend their idleness and neglect and the poor amend their dirt and stupid ignorance then our children will have cause to thank god for the cholera if it teaches us that cleanliness is indeed next to holiness if it teaches us rich and poor to make the workmans home what it ought to be  and believe me my friends that day will surely come and these distresses sad as they are for the time are only helping to hasten itthe day when the words of the hebrew prophets shall be fulfilled where they speak of a state of comfort and prosperity and civilisation such as men had never reached in their timehow the wilderness shall blossom like the rose and there shall be heaps of corn high on the mountaintops and the cities shall be green as grass on the earth instead of being the smoky stifling hotbeds of disease which they are nowand how from the city of god streams shall flow for the healing of the nations strange words those and dim too deep to be explained by any one meaning or many meanings such as our small minds can give them but full of blessed cheering hope  for of whatever they speak they speak at least of thisof a time when all sorrow and sighing shall be done away when science and civilisation shall go hand in hand with godlinesswhen god shall indeed dwell in the hearts of men and his kingdom shall be fulfilled among them when his ways shall be known upon earth at last and his saving health among all nations of a time when all shall know him from the least unto the greatest and be indeed his children doing no sin because they will have given up themselves their selfishness and cruelty and covetousness and stupidity and laziness to be changed and renewed into gods likeness  then all these distresses and pestilences which as i have shown you come from breaking the will of god will have passed away like ugly dreams and all the earth shall be blessed because all the earth shall at last be fulfilling the words of the lords prayer and gods will shall be done on earth even as it is done in heaven  oh my friends have hope  do you think christ would have bid us pray for what would never happen  would he have bid us all to pray that gods will might be done unless he had known surely that gods will would one day be done by men on earth below even as it is done in heaven    xivsecond sermon on the cholera    visiting the sins of the fathers upon the childrenexodus xx 5  in my sermon last sunday i said plainly that cholera fever and many more diseases were mans own fault and that they were gods judgments just because they were mans own fault because they were gods plainspoken opinion of the sin of filth and of habits of living unfit for civilised christian men  but there is an objection which may arise in some of your minds and if it has not risen in your minds still it has in other peoples often enough and therefore i will state it plainly and answer it as far as god shall give me wisdom  for it is well to get to the root of all matters and of this matter of pestilence among others for if we do believe this pestilence to be gods judgment then it is a spiritual matter most proper to be spoken of in a place like this church where men come as spiritual beings to hear that which is profitable for their souls  and it is profitable for their souls to consider this matter for it has to do as i see more and more daily with the very deepest truths of the gospel and accordingly as we believe the gospel and believe really that jesus christ is our saviour and our king the new adam the firstborn among many brethren who has come down to proclaim to us that we are all brothers in himin proportion as we believe that i say shall we act upon this very matter of public cleanliness  the objection which i mean is this  people say it is very hard and unfair to talk of cholera or fever being peoples own fault when you see persons who are not themselves dirty and innocent little children who if they are dirty are only so because they are brought up so catch the infection and die of it  you cannot say it is their fault  very true  i did not say it was their fault  i did not say that each particular person takes the infection by his own fault though i do say that nine out of ten do  and as for little children of course it is not their fault  but my friends it must be someones fault  no one will say that the world is so ill made that these horrible diseases must come in spite of all mans care  if it was so plagues pestilences and infectious fevers would be just as common now in england and just as deadly as they were in old times whereas there is not one infectious fever now in england for ten that there used to be five hundred years ago  in ancient times fevers agues plague smallpox and other diseases whose very names we cannot now understand so completely are they passed away swept england from one end to the other every few years killing five people where they now kill one  those diseases as i said have many of them now died out entirely and those which remain are becoming less and less dangerous every year  and why  simply because people are becoming more cleanly and civilised in their habits of living because they are tilling and draining the land every year more and more instead of leaving it to breed disease as all uncultivated land does  it is not merely that doctors are becoming wiser  we ourselves are becoming more reasonable in our way of living  for instance in large districts both of scotland and of the english fens where fever and ague filled the country and swept off hundreds every spring and fall thirty years ago fever and ague are now almost unknown simply because the marshes have all been drained in the meantime  so you see that people can prevent these disorders and therefore it must be someones fault if they come  now whose fault is it  you dare not lay the blame on god  and yet you do lay the fault on god if you say that it is no mans fault that children die of fever  but i know what the answer to that will be  we do not accuse godit is the fault of the fall adams curse which brought death and disease into the world  that is a common answer and the very one i want to hear  what is it just to say as many do that all the diseases which ever tormented poor little innocent children all over the world came from adams sinning six thousand years ago and yet that it is unfair to say that one little childs fever came from his parents keeping a filthy house a month ago  that is swallowing a camel and straining at a gnatthat god should be just in punishing all mankind for adams sin and yet unjust in punishing one little child for its parents sin  if the one is just the other must be just too i think  if you believe the one why not believe the other  why  because adams curse and original sin as people call it is a good and pleasant excuse for laying our sins and miseries at adams door but the same rule is not so pleasant in the case of filth and fever when it lays other peoples miseries at our door  i believe that all the misery in the world sprung from adams disobedience and falling from god  by one man sin entered the world and death by sin and so death passed on all men even on those who had not sinned after the likeness of adams transgression so says the bible and i believe it says so truly  for this is the law of the earth gods law which he proclaimed in the text  he does visit the sins of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generation of those who hate him  it is so  you see it around you daily  no one can deny it  just as death and misery entered into the world by one man so we see death and misery entering into many a family  a man or woman is a drunkard or a rogue or a swearer  how often their children grow up like them  we have all seen that god knows in this very parish  how much more in great cities where boys and girls by thousandsoh shame that it should be so in a christian landgrow up thieves from the breast and harlots from the cradle  and why  why are there as they say and i am afraid say too truly in london alone upwards of 10000 children under sixteen who live by theft and harlotry  because the parents of these children are as bad as themselvesdrunkards thieves and worseand they bring up their children to follow their crimes  if that is not the fathers sins being visited on the children what is  how often again when we see a wild young man we say and justly poor fellow there are great excuses for him he has been so badly brought up  true but his wildness will ruin him all the same whether it be his fathers fault or his own that he became wild  if he drinks he will ruin his health if he squanders his money he will grow poor  gods laws cannot stop for him he is breaking them and they will avenge themselves on him  you see the same thing everywhere  a man fools away his money and his innocent children suffer for it  a man ruins his health by debauchery or a woman hers by laziness or vanity or selfindulgence and her children grow up weakly and inherit their parents unhealthiness  how often again do we see passionate parents have passionate children stupid parents stupid children mean and lying parents mean and lying children above all ignorant and dirty parents have ignorant and dirty children  how can they help being so  they cannot keep themselves clean by instinct they cannot learn without being taught  and so they suffer for their parents faults  but what is all this except gods visiting the sins of the fathers upon the children  look again at a whole parish how far the neglect or the wickedness of one man may make a whole estate miserable  there is one parish in this very union and the curse of the whole union it is which will show us that fearfully enough  see too how often when a good and generous young man comes into his estate he finds it so crippled with debts and mortgages by his forefathers extravagance that he cannot do the good he would to his tenants he cannot fulfil his duty as landlord where god has placed him and so he and the whole estate must suffer for the follies of generations past  if that is not god visiting the sins of the fathers on the children what is it  look again at a whole nation the rulers of two countries quarrel or pretend to quarrel and go to warand some here know what war is just because there is some old grudge of a hundred years standing between two countries or because rulers of whose names the country people perhaps never heard have chosen to fall out or because their forefathers by cowardice or laziness or division or some other sin have made the country too weak to defend itself and for that poor peoples property is destroyed and little infants butchered and innocent women suffer unspeakable shame  if that is not god visiting the sins of the fathers on the children what is it  it is very awful but so it is  it is the law of this earth the law of human kind that the innocent often suffer for others faults just as you see them doing in cholera fever ague smallpox and other diseases which man can prevent if he chooses to take the trouble  there it is  we cannot alter it  those who will may call god unjust for it  let them first see whether he is not only most just but most merciful in making the world so and no other way  i do not merely mean that whatever god does must be right  that is true but it is a poor way of getting over the difficulty  god has taught us what is right and wrong and he will be judged by his own rules  as abraham said to him when sodom was to be destroyed  that be far from thee to punish the righteous with the wicked  shall not the judge of all the earth do right  abraham knew what was right and he expected god not to break that law of right  and we may expect the same of god  and i may be able i hope in my sermon next sunday to show you that in this matter god does break the law of right  nevertheless in the meantime this is his way of dealing with men  when sodom was destroyed he brought righteous lot out of it  but sodom was destroyed and in it many a little infant who had never known sin  and just so when lisbon was swallowed up by an earthquake ninety years ago the little children perished as well as the grown peoplejust as in the irish famine fever last year many a doctor and roman catholic priest and protestant clergyman caught the fever and died while they were piously attending on the sick they were acting like righteous men doing their duty at their posts but gods laws could not turn aside for them  improvidence and misrule which had been working and growing for hundreds of years had at last brought the famine fever and even the righteous must perish by it  they had their sins no doubt as we all have but then they were doing gods work bravely and honestly enough yet the fever could not spare them any more than it could spare the children of the filthy parents though they had not kept pigsties under their windows nor cesspools at their doors  it could not spare them any more than it can spare the tenants of the negligent or covetous houseowner because it is his fault and not theirs that his houses are undrained overcrowded destituteas whole streets in many large towns areof the commonest decencies of life  it may be the landlords fault but the tenants suffer  god visits the sins of the fathers upon the children and landlords ought to be fathers to their tenants and must become fathers to them some day and that soon unless they intend that the lord should visit on them all their sins and their forefathers also even unto the third and fourth generation  for do not fancy that because the innocent suffer with the guilty that therefore the guilty escape  seldom do they escape in this world and in the world to come never  the landlord who as too many do neglects his cottages till they become mansties to breed pauperism and diseasethe parents whose carelessness and dirt poison their children and neighbours into typhus and choleratheir brothers blood will cry against them out of the ground  it will be required at their hands sooner or later by him who beholds iniquity and wrong and who will not be satisfied in the day of his vengeance by cains old answer am i my brothers keeper  we are every one of us our brothers keeper and if we do not choose to confess that god will prove it to us in a way that we cannot mistake  a wise man tells a story of a poor irish widow who came to liverpool and no one would take her in or have mercy on her till from starvation and bad lodging as the doctor said she caught typhus fever and not only died herself but gave the infection to the whole street and seventeen persons died of it  see says the wise man the poor irish widow was the liverpool peoples sister after all  she was of the same flesh and blood as they  the fever that killed her killed them but they would not confess that they were her brothers  they shut their doors upon her and so there was no way left for her to prove her relationship but by killing seventeen of them with fever  a grim jest that but a true one like elijahs jest to the baal priests on carmel  a true one i say and one that we have all need to lay to heart  and i do earnestly trust in you that you will lay it to heart  we have had our fair warning here  we have had gods judgment about our cleanliness his plain spoken opinion about the sanitary state of this parish  we deserve the fever i am afraid not a house in which it has appeared but has had some glaring neglect of common cleanliness about it and if we do not take the warning god will surely some day repeat it  it will repeat itself by the necessary laws of nature and we shall have the fever among us again just as the cholera has reappeared in the very towns and the very streets where it was seventeen years ago wherever they have not repented of and amended their filth and negligence  and i say openly that those who have escaped this time may not escape next  god has made examples and by no means always of the worst cottages  gods plan is to take one and leave another by way of warning  it is expedient that one man should die for the people and that the whole nation perish not is a great and a sound law and we must profit by it  so let not those who have escaped the fever fancy that they must needs be without fault  think ye that those sixteen on whom the tower of siloam fell and slew them were sinners above all those that dwelt at jerusalem  i say unto you nay but except ye repent ye shall all likewise perish  and i say again as i said last sunday that this is a spiritual question a gospel sermon for by your conduct in this matter will your faith in the gospel be proved  if you really believe that jesus christ came down from heaven and sacrificed himself for you you will be ready to sacrifice yourselves in this matter for those for whom he died to sacrifice without stint your thought your time your money and your labour  if you really believe that he is the sworn enemy of all misery and disease you will show yourselves too the sworn enemies of everything that causes misery and disease and work together like men to put all pestilential filth and damp out of this parish  if you really believe that you are all brothers equal in the sight of god and christ you will do all you can to save your brothers from sickness and the miseries which follow it  if you really believe that your children are gods children that at baptism god declares your little ones to be his you will be ready to take any care or trouble however new or strange it may seem to keep your children safe from all foul smells foul food foul water and foul air that they may grow up healthy hearty and cleanly fit to serve god as christened free and civilised englishmen should in this great and awful time the most wonderful time that the earth has ever seen into which it has pleased god of his great mercy to let us all be born    xvthird sermon on the cholera    i the lord thy god am a jealous god visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generation of them that hate meexodus xx 6  many of you were perhaps surprised and puzzled by my saying in my last sermon that gods visiting the sins of the fathers on the children and letting the innocent suffer for the guilty was a blessing and not a cursea sign of mans honour and redemption not of his shame and ruin  but the more i have thought of those words the more glad i am that i spoke them boldly the more true i find them to be  i say that there is in them the very deepest and surest ground for hope  yes some of you may say to be sure when we see the innocent suffering for the guilty it is a plain proof that another world must come some day in which all that unfairness shall be set right  well my friends it does prove that but i should be very sorry if it did not prove a great deal more than thatthis suffering of the innocent for the guilty  i have no heart to talk to you about the next life unless i can give you some comfort some reason for trusting in god in this life  i never saw much good come of it  i never found it do my own soul any good to be told  this life and this world in which you now live are given up irremediably to misrule and deceit poverty and pestilence death and the devil  you cannot expect to set this world rightyou must look to the next world everything will be set right there  that sounds fine and resigned and there seems to be a great deal of trust in god in it but as i think there is little or none and i say so from the fruits i see it bear  if people believe that this world is the devils world and only the next world gods they are easily tempted to say  very well then we must serve the devil in this world and god in the next  we must of course take great care to get our souls saved when we die that we may go to heaven and live for ever and ever but as to this world and this life why we must follow the ways of the world  it is not our fault that they have nothing to do with god it is not our fault that society and the world are all rotten and accursed we found them so when we were born and we must make the best of a bad matter and sail as the world does and be covetous and mean and anxioushow can we help itand stand on our own rights and take care of number one and even do what is not quite right now and thenfor how can we help itor how else shall we get on in this poor lost fallen sinful world  and so it comes my friends that you see people professingay and believing gospel doctrines and struggling and reading and as they fancy praying morning noon and night to get their own souls savedwho yet if you are to judge by their conduct are little better than rogues and heathens whose only law of life seems to be the fear of what people will say of them who like balaam the son of bosor are trying daily to serve the devil without god finding it out worshipping the evil spirit as that evil spirit wanted our blessed lord to do because they believed his lie which christ deniedthat the glory of this world belongs to the evil one and then comforting themselves like balaam their father in the hope that they shall die the death of the righteous and their last end be like his  now i say my friends that this is a lie and comes from the father of lies who tempts every man as he tempted our lord to believe that the power and glory of this world are his that mans flesh and body if not his soul belongs to him  i say it is no such thing  the world is gods world  man is gods creature made in gods image and not in that of a beast or a devil  the kingdom the power and the glory are gods now  you say so every day in the lords prayer believe it  st james tells you not to curse men because they are made in the likeness of god nownot will be made in gods likeness after they die  believe that do not be afraid of it strange as it may seem to understand  it is in the bible and you profess to believe that what is in the bible is true  and i say that this suffering of the innocent for the guilty is a proof of that  if man was not made so that the innocent could suffer for the guilty he could not have been redeemed at all for there would have been no use or meaning in christs dying for us the just for the unjust  and more if the innocent could not suffer for the guilty we should be like the beasts that perish  now why  because just in proportion as any creature is lowi mean in the scale of lifejust in that proportion it does without its fellowcreatures it lives by itself and cares for no other of its kind  a vegetable is a meaner thing than an animal and one great sign of its being meaner is that vegetables cannot do each other any goodcannot help each othercannot even hurt each other except in a mere mechanical way by overgrowing each other or robbing each others roots but what would it matter to a tree if all the other trees in the world were to die  so with wild animals  what matters it to a bird or a beast whether other birds and beasts are ill off or well off wise or stupid  each one takes care of itselfeach one shifts for itself  but you will say bees help each other and depend upon each other for life and death  true and for that very reason we look upon bees as being more wise and more wonderful than almost any animals just because they are so much like us human beings in depending on each other  you will say again that among dogs a riotous hound will lead a whole pack wronga staunch and wellbroken hound will keep a whole pack right and that dogs do depend upon each other in very wonderful ways  most true but that only proves more completely what i want to get at  it is the tame dog which man has taken and broken in and made to partake more or less of mans wisdom and cunning who depends on his fellowdogs  the wild dogs in foreign countries on the other hand are just as selfish living every one for himself as so many foxes might be  and you find this same rule holding as you rise  the more a man is like a wild animal the more of a savage he is so much more he depends on himself and not on othersin short the less civilised he is for civilised means being a citizen and learning to live in cities and to help and depend upon each other  and our common english word civil comes from the same root  a man is civil who feels that he depends upon his neighbours and his neighbours on him that they are his fellowcitizens and that he owes them a duty and a friendship  and therefore a man is truly and sincerely civil just in proportion as he is civilised in proportion as he is a good citizen a good christianin one word a good man  ay that is what i want to come to my friendsthat word man and what it means  the law of mans life the constitution and order on which and on no other god has made man is thisto depend upon his fellowmen to be their brothers in flesh and in spirit for we are brothers to each other  god made of one blood all nations to dwell on the face of the earth  the same food will feed us all alike  the same cholera will kill us all alike  and we can give the cholera to each other we can give each other the infection not merely by our touch and breath for diseased beasts can do that but by housing our families and our tenants badly feeding them badly draining the land around them badly  this is the secret of the innocent suffering for the guilty in pestilences and famines and disorders which are handed down from father to child that we are all of the same blood this is the reason why adams sin infected our whole race  adam died and through him all his children have received a certain property of sinfulness and of dying just as one bee transmits to all his children and future generations the property of making honey or a lion transmits to all its future generations the property of being a beast of prey  for by sinning and cutting himself off from god adam gave way to the lower part of him his flesh his animal nature and therefore he died as other animals do  and we his children who all of us give way to our flesh to our animal nature every hour alas we die too  and in proportion as we give way to our animal natures we are liable to die and the less we give way to our animal natures the less we are liable to die  we have all sinned we have all become fleshly animal creatures more or less and therefore we must all die sooner or later  but in proportion as we become christians in proportion as we become civilised in short in proportion as we become true men and conquer and keep in order this flesh of ours and this earth around us by the teaching of gods spirit as we were meant to do just so far will length of life increase and population increase  for while people are savages that is while they give themselves up utterly to their own fleshly lusts and become mere animals like the wild indians they cannot increase in number  they are exposed by their own lusts and ignorance and laziness to every sort of disease they turn themselves into beasts of prey and are continually fighting and destroying each other so that they seldom or never increase in numbers and by war drunkenness smallpox fevers and other diseases too horrible to mention the fruit of their own lusts whole tribes of them are swept utterly off the face of the earth  and why  they are like the beasts and like the beasts they perish  whereas just in proportion as any nation lives according to the spirit and not according to the flesh in proportion as it conquers its own fleshly appetites which tempt it to mere laziness pleasure and ignorance and lives according to the spirit in industry cleanliness chaste marriage and knowledge earthly and heavenly the length of life and the number of the population begin to increase at once just as they are doing thank god in england now because englishmen are learning more and more that this earth is gods earth and that he works it by righteous and infallible laws and has put them on it to till it and subdue it that civilisation and industry are the cause of christ and of god and that without them his kingdom will not come neither will his will be done on earth  but now comes a very important question  the beasts are none the worse for giving way to their flesh and being mere animals  they increase and multiply and are happy enough whereas men if they give way to their flesh and become animals become fewer and weaker and stupider and viler and more miserable generation after generation why  because the animals are meant to be animals and men are not men are meant to be men and conquer their animal nature by the strength which god gives to their spirits  and as long as they do not do so as long as they remain savage sottish ignorant they are living in a lie in a diseased wrong state just as god did not mean them to live and therefore they perish therefore these fevers and agues and choleras war starvation tyranny and all the ills which flesh is heir to crush them down  therefore they are at the mercy of the earth beneath their feet and the skies above their head at the mercy of rain and cold at the mercy of each others selfishness laziness stupidity cruelty in short at the mercy of the brute material earth and their own fleshly lusts and the fleshly lusts of others because they love to walk after the flesh and not after the spiritbecause they like the likeness of the old adam who is of the earth earthy better than that of the new adam who is the lord from heavenbecause they like to be animals when christ has made them in his own image and redeemed them with his own blood and taught them with his own example and made them men  he who will be a man let him believe that he is redeemed by christ and must be like christ in everything he says and does  if he would carry that out if he would live perfectly by faith in god if he would do gods will utterly and in all things he would soon find that those glorious old words still stood true  thou shalt not be afraid of the arrow by night nor of the pestilence which walketh in the noonday a thousand shall fall at thy side and ten thousand at thy right hand but it shall not come nigh thee  for such a man would know how to defend himself against evil god would teach him not only to defend himself but to defend those around him  he would be like his lord and master a fountain of wisdom and healing and safety to all his neighbours  we might any one of us be that  it is everyones fault more or less that he is not  each of us who is educated civilised converted to the knowledge and love of god it is his sin and shame that he is not that  above all it is the clergymans sin and shame that he is not ay believe me when i blame you i blame myself ten thousand times more  i believe there is many a sin and sorrow from which i might have saved you here if i had dealt with you more as a man should deal who believes that you and i are brothers made in the same image of god redeemed by the same blood of christ  and i believe that i shall be punished for every neglect of you for which i have been ever guilty  i believe it and i thank god for it for i do not see how a clergyman or anyone else can learn his duty except by gods judging him and punishing him and setting his sins before his face  yes my friends it is good for us to be afflicted good for us to suffer anything that will teach us this great truth that we are our brothers keepers that we are all one family and that where one of the members suffers all the other members suffer with it and that if one of the members has cause to rejoice all the others will have cause to rejoice with it  a blessed thing to know is thatthough whether we know it or not we shall find it true  if we give way to our animal nature and try to live as the beasts do each one caring for his own selfish pleasurestill we shall find out that we cannot do it  we shall find out as those liverpool people did with the irish widow that our fellowmen are our brothersthat what hurts them will be sure in some strange indirect way to hurt us  our brothers here have had the fever and we have escaped but we have felt the fruits of it in our pursesin fear and anxiety and distress and troublewe have found out that they could not have the fever without our suffering for it more or less  you see we are one family we men and women and our relationship will assert itself in spite of our forgetfulness and our selfishness  how much better to claim our brotherhood with each other and to act upon itto live as brothers indeed  that would be to make it a blessing and not a curse for as i said before just because it is in our power to injure each other therefore it is in our power to help each other god has bound us together for good and for evil for better for worse  oh let it be henceforward in this parish for better and not for worse  oh every one of you whether you be rich or poor farmer or labourer man or woman do not be ashamed to own yourselves to be brothers and sisters members of one family which as it all fell together in the old adam so it has all risen together in the new adam jesus christ  there is no respect of persons with god  we are all equal in his sight  he knows no difference among men except the difference which gods spirit gives in proportion as a man listens to the teaching of that spiritrank in godliness and true manhood oh believe thatbelieve that because you owe an infinite debt to christ and to godhis father and your fathertherefore you owe an infinite debt to your neighbours members of christ and children of god just as you area debt of love help care which you can pay just because you are members of one family for because you are members of one family for that very reason every good deed you do for a neighbour does not stop with that neighbour but goes on breeding and spreading and growing and growing for aught we know for ever  just as each selfish act we do each bitter word we speak each foul example we set may go on spreading from mouth to mouth from heart to heart from parent to child till we may injure generations yet unborn so each noble and selfsacrificing deed we do each wise and loving word we speak each example we set of industry and courage of faith in god and care for men may and will spread on from heart to heart and mouth to mouth and teach others to do and be the like till people miles away who never heard of our names may have cause to bless us for ever and ever  this is one and only one of the glorious fruits of our being one family  this is one and only one of the reasons which make me say that it was a good thing mankind was so made that the innocent suffer for the guilty for just as the innocent are injured by the guilty in this world even so are the guilty preserved and converted and brought back again by the innocent  just as the sins of the fathers are visited on the children so is the righteousness of the fathers a blessing to the children else says st paul our children would be unclean but now they are holy  for the promises of god are not only to us but to our children even to as many as the lord our god shall call  and thus each generation by growing in virtue and wisdom and the knowledge of god will help forward all the generations which follow it to fuller light and peace and safety and each parent in trying to live like a christian man himself will make it easier for his children to live like christians after him  and this rule applies even in the things which we are too apt to fancy unimportantevery house kept really clean every family brought up in habits of neatness and order every acre of foul land drained every new improvement in agriculture and manufactures or medicine is a clear gain to all mankind a good example set which is sure sooner or later to find followers perhaps among generations yet unborn and in countries of which we never heard the name  was i not right then in saying that this earth is not the devils earth at all but a right good earth of gods making and ruling wherein no good deed will perish fruitless but every mans works will follow hima right good earth governed by a righteous father who as the psalm says is merciful just because he rewards every man according to his work    xvion the day of thanksgiving    nov 15th 1849  god hath visited his peopleluke vii 16  we are assembled this day to thank god solemnly for the passing away of the cholera from england and we must surely not forget to thank him at the same time for the passing away of the fever which has caused so much expense sorrow and death among us  now i wish to say a very few words to you on this same matter to show you not only how to be thankful to god but what to be thankful for  you may say it is easy enough for us to know what to thank god for in this case we come to thank him as we have just said in the public prayers for having withdrawn this heavy visitation from us  if so my friends what we shall thank him for depends on what we mean by talking of a visitation from god  now i do not know what people may think in this parish but i suspect that very many all over england do not know what to thank god for just now and are altogether thanking him for the wrong thingfor a thing which very happily for them he has not done for them and which if he had done it for them would have been worse for them than all the evil which ever happened to them from their youth up until now  to be plain then many i am afraid are thanking god for having gone away and left them  while the cholera was here they said that god was visiting them and now that the cholera is over they consider that gods visit is over too and are joyful and light of heart thereat  if gods visit is over my friends and he is gone away from us if he is not just as near us now as he was in the height of the cholera the best thing we can do is to turn to him with fasting and weeping and mourning and roll ourselves in the dust and instead of thanking our father for going away pray to him of his infinite mercy to condescend to come back again and visit us even though as superstitious and ignorant men believe gods visiting us were sure to bring cholera or plague or pestilence or famine or some other misery  for i read that in his presence is life and not deathat his right hand is fulness of joy and not tribulation and mourning and woe but if not it were better to be with god in everlasting agony than to be in everlasting happiness without god  here is a strange confusionpeople talking one moment like st paul himself desiring to be with christ and god for ever and then in the same breath talking like the gadarenes of old when after christ had visited them and judged their sins by driving their unlawful herd of swine into the sea they answered by beseeching him to depart out of their coasts  why is this confusionbecause people do not take the trouble to read their bibles because they bring their own loose careless cant notions with them when they open their bibles and settle beforehand what the bible is to tell them and then pick and twist texts till they make them mean just what they like and no more  there is no folly or filth or tyranny or blasphemy which men have not defended out of the bible by twisting it in this way  the bible is better written than that my friends  he that runs may read if he has sense to read  the wayfaring man though simple shall make no such mistake therein if he has gods spirit in himthe spirit of faith which believes that the bible is gods message to menthe humble spirit which is willing to listen to that message however strange or new it may seem to himthe earnest spirit which reads the bible really to know what a man shall do to be saved  look at your bibles thus my friends about this matter  read all the texts which speak of gods visiting and gods visitation and you will find all the confusion and strangeness vanish away  for see  the bible talks of the lord visiting people in his wrathvisiting them for their sinsvisiting them with sore plagues and punishments about forty times  but the bible speaks very nearly as often of gods visiting people to bring them blessings and not punishments  the bible says god visited sarah and hannah to give them what they most desiredchildren  god visited the people of israel in egypt to deliver them out of slavery  in the book of ruth we read how the lord visited his people in giving them bread  the psalmist in the captivity at babylon prays god to visit him with his salvation  the prophet jeremiah says that it was a sign of gods anger against the jews that he had not visited them and the prophets promised again and again to their countrymen how after their seventy years captivity in babylon the lord would visit them and what forto bring them back into their own land with joy and heap them with every blessingpeace and wealth freedom and righteousness  so it is in the new testament too  zacharias praised god  blessed be the lord god of israel for he hath visited and redeemed his people through the tender mercy of our god whereby the dayspring from on high hath visited us  and that was the reason why i chose luke vii 16 for my textonly because it is an example of the same thing the people it says praised god saying  a great prophet is risen up among us and god hath visited his people  and in the 14th of acts we read how god visited the gentiles not to punish them but to take out of them a people for his name namely cornelius and his household  and lastly st peter tells christian people to glorify god in the day of visitation as i tell you nowwhether his visitation comes in the shape of cholera or fever or agricultural distress or whether it comes in the shape of sanitary reform and plenty of work and activity in commerce whether it seems to you good or evil glorify god for it  thank him for it  bless him for it  whether his visitation brings joy or sorrow it surely brings a blessing with it  whether god visits in wrath or in love still god visits  god shows that he lives god shows us that he has not forgotten us god shows us that he is near us  christ shows us that his words are true  lo i am with you alway even to the end of the world  that is a hard lesson to learn and practise though not a very difficult one to understand  i will try now to make you understand itgod alone can teach you to practise it  i pray and hope and i believe too that he willthat these very hard times are meant to teach people really to believe in god and jesus christ and that they will teach people  god knows we need and thanks be to him that he does know that we need to be taught to believe in him  nothing shows it to me more plainly than the way we talk about gods visitations as if god was usually away from us and came to us only just now and thenonly on extraordinary occasions  people have gross heathen fleshly materialist notions of gods visitations as if he was some great earthly king who now and then made a journey about his dominions from place to place rewarding some and punishing others  god is not in any place my friends  god is a spirit  the heaven and the heaven of heavens could not contain him if he wanted a place to be in as glory be to his name he does not  if he is near us or far from us it is not that he is near or far from our bodies as the queen might be nearer to us in london than in scotland which is most peoples notion of gods nearness  he is near not our bodies but our spirits our souls our hearts our thoughtsas it is written the kingdom of god is within you  do not fancy that when the cholera was in india god was nearer india than he was to england and that as the cholera crawled nearer and nearer god came nearer and nearer too and that now the cholera is gone away somewhere or other god is gone away somewhere or other too to leave us to our own inventions  god forbid a thousand times  as st paul says  he is not far from any one of us  in him we live and move and have our being cholera or none  do you think christ the king of the earth is gone away eitherthat while things go on rightly and governments and clergy and people do right christ is there then filling them all with his spirit and guiding them all to their duty but that when evil times come and rulers are idle and clergy dumb dogs and the rich tyrannous and the poor profligate and men are crying for work and cannot get it and every mans hand is against his fellow and no one knows what to do or think and on earth is distress of nations with perplexity mens hearts failing them for fear and for dread of those things which are coming on the earthdo you think that in such times as those christ is the least farther off from us than he was at the best of timesthe least farther off from us now than he was from the apostles at the first whitsuntide  god forbidgod forbid a thousand times  he has promised himself he that is faithful and true he that will never deny himself though men deny him and say he is not here because their eyes are blinded with love of the world and covetousness and bigotry and dread lest he their master should come and find them beating the menservants and maidservants and eating and drinking with the drunken in the high places of the earth and saying  tush god hath forgotten itay though men have forgotten him thus and worse than thus yet he hath said itlo i am with you alway even unto the end of the world  why evil times are the very times of which christ used to speak as the days of the lord and the days of the son of man  times when we hear of wars and rumours of wars and on earth distress of nations with perplexitywhat does he tell men to do in them  to go whining about and say that christ has left his church  no  then he says when all these things come to pass then rejoice and lift up your heads for your redemption draweth nigh  and yet the scripture does most certainly speak of the lords coming out of his place to visitof the son of man coming and not coming to menof his visiting us at one time and not at another  how does that agree with what i have just said  my dear friends we shall see that it agrees perfectly with what i have said if we will only just remember that we are not beasts but men  it may seem a strange thing to have to remind people of but it is just what they are always forgetting  my friends we are not animals we are not spiders to do nothing but spin or birds only to build nests for ourselves much less swine to do nothing but dig after roots and fruits and get what we can out of the clods of the ground  we are the children of the most high god we have immortal souls within us nay more we are our souls  our bodies are our huskour shellour clothesour housechanging day by day and year by year upon us one day to drop off us till the resurrection  but we are our souls and when god visits it is our souls he visits not merely our bodies  there is the whole secret  people forget god and therefore they are glad to fancy that he has forgotten them and has nothing to do with this world of his which they are misusing for their own selfish ends and then god in his mercy visits them  he knocks at the door of their hearts saying  see  i was close to you all the while  he forces them to see him and to confess that he is there whether they choose or not  god is not away from the world  he is away from peoples hearts because he has given people free wills and with free wills the power of keeping him out of their hearts or letting him in  and when god visits he forces himself on our attention  he knocks at the door of our hard hearts so loudly and sharply that he forces all to confess that he is thereall who are not utterly reprobate and spiritually dead  in blessings as well as in curses god knocks at our hearts  by sudden good fortune as well as by sudden mishap by a great deliverance from enemies by an abundant harvest as well as by famine and pestilence  therefore this cholera has been a true visitation of god  the poor had fancied that they might be as dirty the rich had fancied that they might be as careless as they chose in short that they might break gods laws of cleanliness and brotherly care without his troubling himself about the matter  and lo he has visited us and shown us that he does care about the matter by taking it into his own hands with a vengeance  he who cannot see gods hand in the cholera must be as blindas blind as whoas blind as he that cannot see gods hand when there is no cholera as blind as he who cannot see gods hand in every meal he eats and every breath he draws for that man is stone blindhe can be no blinder  the cholera came everyone ought to see that it did not come by blind chance but by the will of some wise and righteous person for in the first place god gave us fair warning  the cholera came from india at a steady pace  we knew to a month when it would arrive here  and it came too by no blind necessity as if it was forced to take people whether it liked or not  just as it was in the fever here so it was in the cholera one shall be taken and another left  it took one of a street and left another took one person in a family and left another  it took the rich man who fancied he was safe as well as the poor man who did not care whether he was safe or not  the respectable man walking home to his comfortable house passed by some untrapped drain and then poisonous gas struck him and he died  the rich physician who had been curing others could not save himself from the poison of the crowded graveyard which had been allowed to remain at the back of his house  by all sorts of strange and unfathomable judgments the cholera showed itself to be working not by a blind necessity but at the will of a thinking person of a living god whose ways are not as our own ways and his paths are in the great deep  and yet the cholera showedand this is what i want to make you feelthat it was working at the will of the same god in whom we live and move and have our being who sends the food we eat the water in which we wash the air we breathe and who has ordained for all these things natural laws according to which they work and which he never breaks nor allows us to break them  for every case of cholera could be traced to some breaking of these lawsfoul airfoul foodfoul water or careless and dirty contact with infected persons so that by this god showed that he and not chance ruled the world and that he was indeed the living and willing god  he showed at the same time that he was the wise god of order and of law and that gas and earth wind and vapour fulfil his word without his having to break his laws or visit us by moving as people fancy out of a heaven where he was down to an earth where he was not  but lastly remember what i told you before that the cholera being a visitation means that god by it has been visiting our hearts knocking loudly at them that he may awaken us and teach us a lesson and be sure that in the cholera and this our own parish fever there is a lesson for each and every one of us if we will learn it  to the simple poor man first and foremost god means by the cholera to teach the simple lesson of cleanliness to the houseowner he means to teach that each man is his brothers keeper and responsible for his property not being a nest of disease to rulers it is intended to teach the lesson that gods laws cannot be put off to suit their laziness cowardice or party squabbles  but beside that to each person be sure such a visitation as this brings some private lesson perhaps it has taught many a widow that she has a friend stronger and more loving than even the husband whom she has lost by the pestilencethe god of the widow and the fatherless  perhaps it has taught many a strong man not to trust in his strength and his youth but in the god who gave them to him  perhaps it has taught many a man too who has expected public authorities to do everything for him not to put his trust in princes nor in any child of man for there is no help in them but to hear gods advice help thyself and god will help thee  perhaps it has stirred up many a benevolent man to find out fresh means for rooting out the miseries of society perhaps it has taught many a philosopher new deep truths about the laws of gods world which may enable him to enlighten and comfort ages yet unborn  perhaps it has awakened many a slumbering heart and brought many a careless sinner for the first time in his life face to face with god and his own sins  gods judgments are manifold they are meant to work in different ways on different hearts  but oh believe and be sure that they are meant to work upon all heartsthat they are not the punishments of a capricious tyrant but the rod of a loving father who is trying to drive us home into his fold when gentle entreaties and kind deeds have failed to allure us home  oh my friends if you wish really to thank god for having preserved you from these pestilences show your thankfulness by learning the lesson which they bring  gods love has spoken of each and every one of us in the cholera  be sure he has spoken so harshly only because a gentler tone of voice would have had no effect upon us  thank him for his severity  thank him for the cholera the fever  thank him for anything which will awaken us to hear the word of the lord  but till you have learnt the lessons which these visitations are meant to teach you there is no use thanking him for taking them away  and therefore i beseech you solemnly each and all before you leave this church now to pray to god to show you what lesson he means to teach you by this past awful visitation and also by sparing you and me who are here present not merely from cholera and fever but from a thousand mishaps and evils which we have deserved and from which only his goodness has kept us  oh may god stir up your hearts to ask advice of him this day and may he in his great mercy so teach us all his will on this day of joy that we may not need to have it taught us hereafter on some day of sorrow    xviithe covenant    the lord hath chosen jacob unto himself and israel for his own possession  for i know that the lord is great and that our lord is above all gods  whatsoever the lord pleased that did he in heaven and earth and in the sea and in all deep placespsalm cxxxv 4 5 6  were you ever puzzled to find out why the psalms are read every sunday in church more read indeed than any other part of the bible  if any of you say no i shall not think you the wiser  it is very easy not to be puzzled with a deep matter if one never thinks about it at all  but when a man sets his mind to work seriously to try to understand what he hears and sees around him then he will be puzzled and no shame to him for he will find things every day of his life which will require years of thought to understand ay things which though we see and know that they are true and can use and profit by them we can never understand at all at least in this life  but i do not think that god meant it to be so with these psalms  he meant the bible for a poor mans book  and therefore the men who wrote the bible were almost all of them poor men at least at one time or other of their life and therefore we may expect that they would write as poor men would write and such things as poor men may understand if they are fairly and simply explained  therefore i do not think you need be puzzled long to find out why these psalms are read every sunday  for the men who wrote them had gods spirit with them and gods spirit is the spirit in which god made and governs this world and just as god cannot change so gods spirit cannot change and therefore the rules and laws according to which the world runs on cannot change and therefore these rules about gods government of the world which gods spirit taught the old hebrew psalmists are the very same rules by which he governs it now and therefore all the rules in these psalms making allowance for the difference of circumstances have just as much to do with france and germany and england now as they had with the jews and the canaanites and the babylonians then  st paul tells us so  he tells us that all that happened to the old jews was written as an example to christians to the intent that they might not sin as the jews did and so gods laws and ways being the same now as then be punished as the jews were  moreover st paul says that christians now are just as much gods chosen people as the jews were  god told the jews that they were to be a nation of kings and priests to him  and st john opens the revelations by saying unto him that loved us and washed us from our sins in his own blood and hath made us kings and priests unto god and his father to him be glory  st paul tells the ephesians who had not a drop of jewish blood in their veins that through jesus christ both jews and gentiles had access by one spirit unto the father  now therefore he goes on ye are no more strangers and foreigners but fellow citizens with the saints and of the household of god  in fact he tells the christians of every country to which he writes that all the promises which god made to the jews belonged to them just as much that there was no more any difference between jew and gentile that the lord jesus christ was just as really among them and with them ruling and helping each people in their own country as he was in jerusalem when isaiah saw his glory filling the temple and when zion was called the place of his inheritance  indeed the lord jesus said the same thing himself for he said that all power was given to him in heaven and earth that he was with his churches that is with all companies of christian people such as england even to the end of the world that wherever two or three were gathered together in his name he would be in the midst of them and if those blessed words and good news be true we englishmen have a right to believe firmly that we belong to him just as much as the old jews did and when we read these psalms to take every word of their good newsand their warnings alsoto ourselves and to our own land of england and when we read in the text that the lord chose jacob unto himself and israel for his own possession we have a right to say  and the lord has chosen also england unto himself and this favoured land of britain for his own possession  when we say in the psalm  the lord did what he pleased in heaven and earth and sea to educate and deliver the people of the jews we have a right to say just as boldly  and so he has done for england for us and for our forefathers  this then is the reason the chief reason why these psalms are appointed to be read every sunday in church and every morning and evening where there is daily serviceto teach us that the lord takes care not only of one mans soul here and another womans soul there but of the whole country of england of its wars and its peace of its laws and government its progress and its afflictions of all in short that happens to it as a nation as one body of men which it is  it must be so my good friends else we should be worse off than the old jews and not better off as all the new testament solemnly assures us a thousand times over that we are  for in the covenant which god made with the jews and in the strange events good and bad which he caused to happen to their nation not only the great saints among them were taken care of but all classes and all characters good and bad even those who had not wisdom or spiritual life enough to seek god for themselves still had their share in the good laws in the teaching and guiding and in the national blessings which he sent on the whole nation  they had a chance given them of rising and improving and prospering as the rest of their countrymen rose and improved and prospered  and when the lord came to visit judaea in flesh and blood we find that he went on the same method  he did not merely go to such men as philip and nathaniel to the holy and elect ones among the jews but to the whole people to the lost sheep as well as to those who were not lost  he did not part the good from the bad before he healed their sicknesses and fed them with the loaves and fishes  it was enough for him that they were jews citizens of the jewish nation  gods promises belonged not to one jew or another but to the jewish nation and even the ignorant and the sinful had a share in the blessings of the covenant great or small in proportion as they chose to live as jews ought or to forget and deny that they belonged to gods people  now surely the lord cannot be less merciful now than he was then he cannot care less for poor orphans and paupers and wild untaught creatures in england now than he cared for them in judaea of old and we see that in fact he does not  for as the wealth of england improves and the laws improve and the knowledge of god improves the condition of all sorts of poor creatures improves too though they had no share in bringing about the good change  but we are all members of one body from the queen on her throne to the tramper under the hedge and as st paul says  if one member suffers all the members suffer with it and if one member rejoices all the others sooner or later rejoice with it  for we too are one of the lords nations  he has made us one body with one common language common laws common interest common religion for all and what he does for one of us he does for all  he orders all that happens to us whether it be war or peace prosperity or dearth he orders it all and he orders things so that they shall work for the good not merely of a few but of as many as possiblenot merely for his elect but for those who know him not  as he has been from the beginning when he heaped blessings on the stiffnecked and backsliding israelitesas he was when he endured the cross for a world lying not in obedience but in wickedness so is he now the perfect likeness of his father who is no respecter of persons but causes his sun to shine alike on the evil on the good and his rain to fall on the just and on the unjust  but now there is one thing against which i have to warn you most solemnly and especially in such days as these  you may believe my words to your own ruin or to your own salvation  they are the gospel the good news of the kingdom of godthat is the good news that god has condescended to become our king to govern and guide us to order all things for our good  but as st paul says the gospel may be a savour of death unto death as well as a savour of life unto life  and i will tell you now that you have only to do what the jews just before the coming of our lord did and give way to the same thoughts as they and then like them it were better for you that you had never heard of god and been like the savages to whom little or no sin is imputed because they are all but without law  how is this  as i said beforetake your covenant privileges as the pharisees took theirs and they will turn you into devils while you are fancying yourselves gods especial favourites  now this was what happened to the pharisees  they could not help knowing that god had shown especial favour to them and that he had taught them more about god than he had taught the heathen  but instead of feeling all the more humble and thankful for this and of remembering day and night that because much had been given to them much would be required of them they thought more about the honour and glory which god had put on them  they forgot what god had declared namely that it was not for their own goodness that he had taught them for that they were in themselves not a whit better than the heathen around them  they forgot that the reason why he taught them was that they were to do his work on earth by witnessing for his name and telling the heathen that god was their lord as well as lord of the jews  now david and the old psalmists and prophets did not forget this their cry is  tell it out among the heathen that the lord is king worship the son of god ye kings of the earth and make your peace with him lest he be angry  it was in vain he told the heathen kings to try to cast away gods government from them and break his bonds from off them for the lord was king let the nations be never so unquiet  but the jews gradually forgot this and their daily boast was that god had nothing to do with the heathen that he did not care for them and actually hated them that they as it were had the true god all to themselves for their own private property and that he had neither love nor mercy except for them and their proselytes that is the few heathens whom they could persuade and entice not to worship the true god after the customs of their own countrythat would not have suited the jews bigotry and pridebut to turn jews and forget their own people among whom they were born and ape them in everything  and so as our lord told them after compassing sea and land to make one of these proselytes they only made him after all twice as much the child of hell as themselves  for they could not teach the heathen anything worth knowing about god when they had forgotten themselves what god was like  they could tell them that there was one god and not twobut what was the use of that  as st james says the devils believe as much as that and yet the knowledge does not make them holy but only increases their fear and despair and so with these pharisees  they had forgotten that god was love they had forgotten that god was merciful  they had forgotten that god was just  and therefore while they were talking of god and pretending to worship god they knew nothing of god and they did not do gods will and act like god for as we find from the gospels they were unjust tyrannous proud conceited covetous themselves and while they were looking down on the poor heathens these very heathens the lord told them would rise up in judgment against them for they knowing little acted up to the light which they had better than the pharisees who knew so much  and so it will be with us my friends if we fancy that gods great favours to us are a reason for our priding ourselves on them and despising papists and foreigners instead of remembering that just because god has given us so much he will require more of us  it is true we do know more of the gospel than the papists how though they believe in jesus christ worship the virgin mary and the saints and idols of wood and stone  but if they who know so little of gods will yet act faithfully up to what they do know will they not rise up in judgment against us who know so much more if we act worse than they instead of despising them we had better despise ourselves  instead of fancying that gods love is not over them and so sinning against gods holy spirit by denying and despising the fruits of gods holy spirit in them we had much better we protestants be repenting of our own sins  we had better pray god to open our eyes to our own want of faith and want of love and want of honesty and want of cleanly and chaste lives lest god in his anger should let us go on in our evil path till we fall into the deep darkness of mind of the pharisees of old  for then while we were boasting of england as the most christian nation in the world we might become the most unchristian because the most unlike christ the most wanting in love and fellowfeeling and selfsacrifice and honour and justice and honesty wanting in short in the fruits of the spirit  and without them there is no use crying  we are gods chosen people he has put his name among us we alone hate idols we alone have the pure word of god and the pure sacraments and the pure doctrine for god may answer us as he answered the jews of old  think not to say within yourselves we have abraham for our father  verily i say unto you god is able of these stones to raise up children to abraham     the kingdom of god shall be taken from you and given to a nation bringing forth the fruits thereof  oh my friends let us pray one and all that god will come and help us and with great might succour us that whereas through our sins and wickedness we are sore let and hindered in running the race set before us gods bountiful grace and mercy may speedily help and deliver us and enable us to live faithfully up to the glorious privileges which he has bestowed on us in calling us members of christ children of god and inheritors of the kingdom of heaven in giving us his bible in allowing us to be born into this favoured land of england in preserving us to this day in spite of all that we have thought and said and done unworthy of the name of christians and englishmen  and then we may be certain that god will also fulfil to us the glorious promises which we find in another psalm  if thy children will keep my covenant and my testimonies which i shall learn them this land shall be my rest for ever  here will i dwell for i have a delight therein  i will bless her victuals with increase and satisfy her poor with bread  i will deck her priests with health and her holy people shall rejoice and sing    xviiinational rewards and punishments    and that which cometh into your mind shall not be at all that ye say we will be as the heathen as the families of the countries to serve wood and stone  as i live saith the lord god surely with a mighty hand and with a stretched out arm and with fury poured out will i rule over you     and ye shall know that i am the lord ezekiel xx 32 33 38  a father has two ways of showing his love to his childby caressing it and by punishing it  his very anger may be a sign of his love and ought to be  just because he loves his child just because the thing he longs most to see is that his child should grow up good therefore he must be and ought to be angry with it when it does wrong  therefore anger against sin is a part of gods likeness in us and he who does not hate sin is not like god  for if sin is the worst evilperhaps the only real evil in the worldand the end of all sin is death and misery then to indulge people in sin is to show them the very worst of cruelty  to sit by and see iniquity going on without trying to stop it is mere laziness  the parent when his child does wrong does not show his love to the child by indulging it all he shows is that he himself is carnal and fleshly that he does not like to take the trouble of punishing it or does not like to give himself the pain of punishing it that in short he had sooner let his child grow up in bad habits which must lead to its misery and ruin for years and years if not for ever than make himself uncomfortable by seeing it uncomfortable for a few minutes  that is not love but selfishness true love is as determined to punish the sin as it is to forgive the sinner  therefore st paul tells us that we can be angry without sinning that is that there is an anger which comes from hatred of sin and love to the sinner  therefore solomon tells us to punish our children when they do wrong and not to hold our hands for their crying  it is better for them that they should cry a little now than have long years of shame and sorrow hereafter  therefore in all countries which are properly governed the law punishes in the name of god those who break the laws of god and punishes them even with death for certain crimes because it is expedient that one man die for the people and that the whole nation perish not  and this is gods way of dealing with each and every one of us  this is gods way of dealing with christian nations just as it was his way of dealing with the jews of old  he never allowed the jews to prosper in sin  he punished them at once and sternly whenever they rebelled against him not because he hated them but because he loved them  his love to them showed itself whenever they went well with him in triumphs and blessings and when they rebelled against him and broke his laws he showed that very same love to them in plague and war and famine and a mighty hand and fury poured out  his love had not changedthey had changed and now the best and only way of showing his love to them was by making them feel his anger and the best and only way of being merciful to them was to show them no indulgence  now the wish of the jews all along and especially in ezekiels time was to be like the heathenlike the nations round them  they said to themselves  these heathen worship idols and yet prosper very well  their having gods of wood and stone and their indulging their passions and being profligate and filthy covetous unjust and tyrannical does not prevent their being just as happy as we areay and a great deal happier  they have no strict law of moses as we have threatening us and keeping us in awe and making us uncomfortable and telling us at every turn thou shalt not do this pleasant thing and thou shalt not do that pleasant thing  and yet god does not punish them as moses law says he will punish us these assyrians and babylonians above allthey are stronger than we and richer and better clothed and cleverer they have horses and chariots and all sorts of luxuries and comforts which we jews cannot get  instead of being like us in continual trouble from earthquakes and drought and famine and war attacked plundered by all the nations round us one after another they go on conquering and spreading and succeeding in all they lay their hand to  look at babylon said these foolish jews perhaps to themselves a few generations ago it was nothing of a city and now it is the greatest richest and strongest nation in the whole world  god has not punished it for worshipping gods of wood and stone why should he punish us  these babylonians have prospered well enough with their gods why should not we  perhaps it is these very gods of wood and stone who have helped them to become so great  why should they not help us  we will worship them then and pray to them  we will not give up worshipping our own god of course lest we should offend him but we will worship him and the babylonian idols at the same time then we shall be sure to be right if we have jehovah and the idols both on our side  so said the jews to themselves  but what did ezekiel answer them  not so my foolish countrymen said he god will not have it so  he has taught you that these babylonian idols are nothing and cannot help you he has taught you that he can and will help you that he can and will be everything to you he has taught you that he alone is god who made heaven and earth who orders all things therein who alone gives any people power to get wealth and he will not have you go back and fall from that for any appearances or arguments whatsoever because it is true  he has chosen you to witness to these heathen about him to declare his name to them that they may give up their idols and serve the true god in whom alone is strength  he chose you to be these heathens teachers and he will not let you become their scholars  he meant the heathen to copy you and he will not let you copy them  if he does in his love and mercy let these poor heathen prosper in spite of their idols what is that to you  it is still the lord who makes them prosper and not the idols whether they know it or not  they know no better and he will not impute sin to them where he has given them no law  but you do know better by a thousand mighty signs and wonders and deliverances the lord has been teaching you ever since you came up through the red sea that he is allsufficient for you that all power is his in heaven and earth  he has promised to you and sworn to you by himself that if you keep his law and walk in his commandments you shall want no manner of good thing that you shall have no cause to envy these heathen their riches and prosperity for the lord will bless you in house and land by day and night at home and abroad with every blessing that a nation can desire  moses law tells you this gods prophets have been telling you this gods wonderful dealings with you have been telling you this that the lord god is enough for you  and if you who are meant to be a nation of kings and priests to god to teach all nations and serve solely him fancy that you will be allowed to throw away the high honour which god has put upon you and lower yourselves to the follies and sins of these heathen round you you are mistaken  you were meant to be above such folly you can be above it and you shall not prosper by serving god and idols at once you shall not even prosper by serving idols alone  god will visit you with a mighty hand and with fury poured out and you shall know that he is the lord  well my friends and what has this to do with us  this it has to do with usthat if god taught the jews about himself he has taught us still more  if he has shown signs and wonders of his love and wrought mightily for the jews he has wrought far more mightily for us for he spared not his own son but gave him freely for us  if he promised to teach the jews he has promised still more to teach us for he has promised his holy spirit freely to young and old rich and poor to as many as ask him to guide us into all truth  if he expected the jews to set an example to all the nations around he expects us to do so still more  and if he punished the jews and drove them back again by shame and affliction and disappointment whenever they went after other gods and tried to be like the heathen around and despised their high calling and their high privileges he will punish us and drive us back again still more fiercely and still more swiftly  god has called us to be a nation of christians and he will not let us be a nation of heathens  we are longing to do in these days very much as the jews did of old we are all too apt to say to ourselves  of course we must love god or he might be angry with us and besides how else should we get our souls saved  but the old heathen nations and a great many nations now and a great many rich and comfortable people in england now too get on very well without god by just worshipping selfishness and money and worldly cunning and why should not we do the samewhy should we not worship god and mammon at once and serve god on sundays and the selfish ways of the world all the week  surely then we should be doubly safe we should have god and the world on our side both at once  now my friends god will not allow us to succeed on that plan  we are members of his church whose head is jesus who gave himself for sinners whose members are all brothers of his church which is held together by selfsacrifice and fellowhelp  if we try to be like the heathens and fancy that we can succeed by selfishness and cunning and covetousness god will not let us fall from the honour which he has put on us and trample our blessings under foot  he will bring our plans to nought  whomsoever he may let prosper in sin he will not let those who have heard the message prosper in it  whatever nation he may let become great by covetousness and selfish competing and struggling of man against man he will not let england grow great by it  he loves her too well to let her fall so and cast away her high honour of being a christian nation  by great and sore afflictions by bringing our cleverest plans to nothing he will teach us that we cannot worship god and mammon at once that the sure riches either for a man or for a nation are not money but righteousness love justice wisdom that this new idol of selfish competition which men worship nowadays and fancy that it is the secret cause of all plenty and cheapness and civilisation has no place in the church of jesus christ who gave up his own life for those who hated him and came not to do his own will but the will of his father not to enable men to go to heaven after a life of selfishness here but by the power of his spiritthe spirit of love and fellowship to sweep all selfishness off the face of gods good earth  by sore trials and afflictions will god in his mercy teach this to england and to every man in england who is deluded into fancying that he can serve god and selfishness at once till we learn once more as our forefathers did of old that he is the lord because we are his children god will chasten us because he receives us he will scourge us back to him because he has prepared for us things such as eye hath not seen he will not let us fill our bellies with the husks which the swine eat and like the dumb beasts snarl and struggle one against the other for a place at his table as if it were not wide enough for all his creatures and for ten times as many more forgetting that he is the giver and fancying that we are to be the takers and spoiling the gift itself in our hurry to snatch it out of our neighbours hands  in one word god will not give us false prosperity as the children of the world the flesh and the devil because he wishes to give us real prosperity as the sons of god in the kingdom of his son jesus christ who died on the cross for us    xixthe deliverance of jerusalem    and it came to pass that the angel of the lord went out and smote in the camp of the assyrians an hundred and eighty five thousand  and when they arose in the morning behold they were all dead corpses 2 kings xix 35  you heard read in the first lesson last sunday afternoon the threats of the king of assyria against jerusalem and his defiance of the true lord whose temple stood there  in the first lesson for this mornings service you heard of king hezekiahs fear and perplexity of the lords answer to him by isaiah and of the great and wonderful destruction of the assyrian army of which my text tells you  of course you have a right to ask  this which happened in a foreign country more than two thousand years ago what has it to do with us and of course my preaching about it will be of no use whatsoever unless i can show you what it has to do with us what lesson we english here in the year 1851 are to draw from the help which god sent the jews  but to find out that we must hear the whole story  before we can find out why god drove the assyrians out of judaea we must find out it seems to me why he sent them or allowed them to come into judaea and to find out that we must first see how the jews were behaving in those times and what sort of state their country was in and we must find out too what sort of a man this great king of assyria was and what sort of thoughts were in his heart  now by the favour of god we can find out this  you will see in the first thirtyseven chapters of isaiahs prophecies a full account of the ways of the jews in that time and the reasons why god allowed so fearful a danger to come upon them  the whole first thirtyfive chapters belong to each other and are so to speak a spiritual history of the jews and the assyrians and all the nations round them for many years  a spiritual historythat is not merely a history of what they did but of what they were what was in their inmost hearts and thoughts and spirits a spiritual historythat is not merely of what they thought they were doing but of what god saw that they were doinga history of gods mind about them all isaiah had gods spirit on him and so he saw what was going on round him in the same light in which god saw it and hated it or praised it only according as it was good and according to the good spirit of god or bad and contrary to that spirit  so isaiahs history of his own nation and the nations around him was very unlike what they would have written for themselves just as i am afraid he would write a very different history of england now from what we should write if we were set to do it  now what isaiah thought of the doings of his countrymen the jews i must tell you in another sermon next sunday  it will be enough this morning to speak of the king of assyria  these kings of assyria thought themselves the greatest and strongest beings in the world they thought that their might was right and that they might conquer and ravage and plunder and oppress every country round them for thousands of miles without being punished they thought that they could overcome the true god of judaea as they had conquered the empty idols and false gods of sepharvaim hena and iva  but isaiah saw that they were wrong  he told his countrymen these assyrian kings are strong but there is a stronger king than they jehovah the lord of all the earth  it is he who sent them to punish nation after nation sennacherib is the rod of jehovahs anger but he is a fool after all for all his cunning for all his armies he is a fool rushing on his ruin  he may take tyre damascus babylon egypt itself and cast their gods into the fire for they are no gods but the work of mens hands wood and stone but let him once try his strength against the real living god let the axe once begin to boast itself against him that hews therewith and he will find out that there is one stronger than he one who has been using him as a tool and who will crush him like a moth the moment he rebels  his father destroyed samaria and her idols but he shall not destroy jerusalem  he may ravage ephraim and punish the gluttony and drunkenness and oppression of the great landlords of bashan he may bring misery and desolation through the length and breadth of the land  there is reason and reason but too good for that  but jerusalem the place where gods honour dwells the temple without idols which is the sign that jehovah is a living god against it he shall not cast up a bank or shoot an arrow into it i know said isaiah what he is saying of himself this proud king of assyria  but this is what god says of him that he is only a puppet a tool in the hand of god to punish these wicked nations whom he is conquering one by one and us jews among the rest  he this proud king of assyria thinks that he is the chosen favourite of the sun and the moon and the stars whom in his folly he worships as gods  he will find out who is the real lord of the earth he will find out that this great world is ruled by that very god of israel whom he despises  he will find that there is something in this earth of which he fancies himself lord and master which is too strong for him which will obey god and not him  god rules the earth and god rules tophet and the great firekingdoms which boil and blaze for ever in the bowels of the earth and burst up from time to time in earthquakes and burning mountains and god has ordained that they shall conquer this proud king of assyria though we jews are too weak and cowardly and split up into parties by our wickedness to make a stand against him     this great eruption or breaking out of burning mountains which would destroy the king of assyrias army was to happen isaiah says close to jerusalem nay it was to shake jerusalem itself  jerusalem was to be brought to great misery by everlasting burnings as well as by being besieged by the assyrians and yet the very shaking of the earth and eruption of fire which was nearly to destroy it was to be the cause of its deliverance  so isaiah prophesied and we cannot doubt his words came true  for this may explain to us the way in which the king of assyrias army was destroyed  the text says that when they encamped near jerusalem the messenger of the lord went out and slew in one night one hundred and eighty thousand of them who were all found dead in the morning  how they were killed we cannot exactly tell most likely by a stream of poisonous vapour such as often comes forth out of the ground during earthquakes and eruptions of burning mountains and kills all men and animals who breathe it that this was the way that this great army was destroyed i have little doubt not only on account of what isaiah says in his prophecies of gods sending a blast upon the king of assyria but because it was just like the old lesson which god had been teaching the jews all along that the earth and all in it was his property and obeyed him  for what could teach them that more strongly than to see that the earthquakes and burning mountains of all things on earth the most awful and most murderous the very things against which man has no defence obeyed god burst forth when he chose and did his work as he willed  for man can conquer almost everything in the world except these burning mountains and earthquakes  he can sail over the raging sea in his ships he can till the most barren soils he can provide against famine rain and cold ay against the thunder itself  but the earthquakes alone are too strong for him against them no cunning or strength of man is of any use  without warning they make the solid ground under his feet heave and reel and sink hurling down whole towns in a moment and burying the inhabitants under the ruins as an earthquake did in italy only a month ago  or they pour forth streams of fire clouds of dust brimstone and poisonous vapour destroying for miles around the woods and crops farms and cities and burying them deep in ashes as they have done again and again both in italy and iceland and in south america even during the last few years  how can man stand against them  what greater warning or lesson to him than they that god is stronger than man that the earth is not mans property and will not obey him but only the god who made it  now that was just what god intended to teach the jews all along that the earth and heaven belonged to him and obeyed him that they were not to worship the sun and stars as the assyrians and canaanites did nor the earth and the rivers as the egyptians did  but to worship the god who made sun and stars earth and rivers and to put their trust in him to guide all heaven and earth aright and to make all things sun earth and weather ay and the very burning mountains and earthquakes work together for good for them if they loved god therefore it was that god gave his law to moses on the burning mountain of sinai amid thunders and lightnings and earthquakes to show them that the lightnings and the mountains obeyed him therefore it was that the earthquake opened the ground and swallowed up korah dathan and abiram who rebelled against moses  therefore it was that god once used an earthquake and eruption to preserve david from his enemies as we read in the eighteenth psalm  and all through davids psalms we find how well he had learnt this great lesson which god had taught him  again and again we find verses which show that he knew well enough who was the lord of all the earth  in isaiahs time it seems god taught the jews once more the same thing  he taught them and the proud king of assyria once and for all that he was indeed the lordlord of all nations and king of kings and also lord of the earth and all that therein is  he taught it to the poor oppressed jews by that miraculous deliverance he taught it to the cruel invading king by that miraculous destruction  just in the height of his glory after he had conquered almost every nation in the east and overcome the whole of judaea except that one small city of jerusalem sennacheribs great army was swept away he neither knew how nor why in a single night and utterly disheartened and abashed he returned to his own land and even there he found that the god of israel had followed himthat the idols whom he worshipped could not save him from the wrath of that god to whom assyria just as much as jerusalem belonged  for as he was worshipping in the house of nisroch his god his two sons smote him with the sword and there was an end of all his pride and conquests    now nisroch was the name of a starthe star which we call the planet saturn and the assyrians fancied in their folly that whosoever worshipped any particular star that star would protect and help him     but alas for the king of assyria there was one above who had made the stars and from whose vengeance the stars could not save him and so even while he was worshipping and praying to this favourite star of his which could not hear him he fell dead a murdered man and found out too late how true were the great words of isaiah when he prophesied against him  yes my friends this is the lesson which the jews had to learn and which the king of assyria had to learn and which we have to learn also and which god will in his great mercy teach us over and over again by bitter trials whensoever we forget it that the lord is king that he is near us living for ever allwise allpowerful allloving that those who really trust in him shall never be confounded that those who trust in themselves are trying their paltry strength against the god who made heaven and earth and will surely find out their own weakness just when they fancy themselves most successful  so it was in hezekiahs time so it is now hard as it may be to us to believe it  the lord jehovah jesus christ who saved jerusalem from the assyrians he still is king let the earth be never so unquiet  and all men or governments or doctrines or ways of thinking and behaving which are contrary to his will or even pretend that they can do without him will as surely come to nought as that great and terrible king of assyria  though man be too weak to put them down christ is not  though man neglect to put them down christ will not  if man dare not fight on the lords side against sin and evil the lords earth will fight for him  storm and tempest blight and famine earthquakes and burning mountains will do his work if nothing else will  as he said himself if man stops praising him the very stones will cry out and own him as their king  not that the blessed lord is proud or selfish or revengeful god forbid  he is boundless pity and love and mercy  but it is just because he is perfect love and pity that he hates sin which makes all the misery upon earth  he hates it and he fights against it for ever lovingly at first that he may lead sinners to repentance for he wills the death of none but rather that all should come to repentance  but if a man will not turn he will whet his sword and then woe to the sinner  let him be as great as the king of assyria he must down  for the lord will have none guide his world but himself because none but he will ever guide it on the right path  yesbut what a glorious thought that he will guide it and us on that right path  oh blessed news for all who are in sorrow and perplexity  whatsoever it is that ails youand who is there young or old rich or poor who has not their secret ailments at heartwhatsoever ails you whatsoever terrifies you whatsoever tempts you trust in the same lord who delivered jerusalem from the assyrians and he will deliver you  he will never suffer you to be tempted above that you are able but will with the temptation also make a way for you to escape that you may be able to bear it  this has been his loving way from the beginning and this will be his way until the day when he wipes away tears from all eyes    xxprofession and practice    though they say the lord liveth surely they swear falsely jeremiah v 2  i spoke last sunday morning of the wonderful way in which the lord delivered the jews from the assyrian army and i promised to try and explain to you this morning the reason why the lord allowed the assyrians to come into judaea and ravage the whole country except the one small city of jerusalem  my text is taken from the first lesson from the book of the prophet jeremiah  and it i think will explain the reason to us  for though jeremiah lived more than a hundred years after isaiah yet he had much the same message from god to give and much the same sins round him to rebuke  for the jews were always as the bible calls them a backsliding people and as the years ran on and they began to forget their great deliverance from the assyrians they slid back into the very same wrong state of mind in which they were in isaiahs time and for which god punished them by that terrible invasion  now what was this  one very remarkable thing strikes us at once  that when the assyrians came into judaea the jews were not given up to worshipping false gods  on the contrary we find both from the book of kings and the book of chronicles that a great reform in religion had taken place among them a few years before  their king hezekiah in the very first year of his reign removed the high places and cut down the groves which are said to have been carved idols meant to represent the stars of heaven and even broke in pieces the brazen serpent which moses had made because the jews had begun to worship it for an idol  he trusted in the lord god and obeyed him more than any king of judah  he restored the worship of the true god in the temple according to the law of moses with such pomp and glory as had never been seen since solomons time  and not only did he turn to the true god but his people also  from the account which we find in chronicles they seemed to have joined him in the good work they offered sinofferings as a token of the wickedness of which they have been guilty in leaving the true god for idols and all other kinds of offerings freely and willingly  and hezekiah rejoiced and all the people that god had prepared the people  moreover hezekiah called all the men in judaea up to jerusalem to keep the passover according to the law of moses which they had neglected to do for many years and the people answered his call and came and kept the feast at jerusalem seven days with joy and great gladness offering peaceofferings and making confession to the god of their fathers so there was great joy in jerusalem for since the time of solomon there was not the like in jerusalem  then the priests and the levites arose and blessed the people and their voice was heard and their prayer came up to the lords holy dwelling even to heaven and when it was all finished the people went out of their own accord and destroyed utterly all the idols and high places and altars throughout the land and returned to their houses in peace  now does not all this sound very satisfactory and excellent  what better state of mind could people be in  what a wonderful reform and spread of true religion  the only thing like it that we know is the wonderful reform and spread of religion in england in the last sixty years after all the ungodliness and wickedness that went on from the year 1660 to the time of the french war the building of churches the founding of schools the spread of bibles and tracts and the wonderful increase of gospel preachers so that every old man will tell you that religion is talked about and written about now a thousand times more than when he was a boy  indeed unless a man makes a profession of some sort of religion or other nowadays he can hardly hope to rise in the world so religious are we english become  now let us hear what isaiah thought of all that wonderful spread of true religion in his time and then perhaps we may see what he would think of ours now if he were alive  his opinion is sure to be the right one  his rules can never fail for he was an inspired prophet and saw things as they are as god sees them and therefore his rules will hold good for ever  let us see what they were  the first chapter of the book of the prophet isaiah is called the vision of isaiah the son of amoz which he saw concerning judah and jerusalem in the days of uzziah jotham ahaz and hezekiah  now this is one prophecy by itself in the shape of a poem for in the old hebrew it is written in regular verses  the second chapter begins with another heading and is the beginning of a different poem so that this first chapter is as it were a summing up of all that he is going to say afterwards a short account of the state of the jews for more than forty years  and what is more this first chapter of isaiah must have been written in the reign of hezekiah in those very religious days of which i was just speaking for it says that the country was desolate and jerusalem alone left  and this never happened during isaiahs lifetime till the fourteenth year of hezekiah that is till this great spread of the true religion had been going on for thirteen years  now what was isaiahs vision what did he being taught by gods spirit see was gods opinion of these religious jews  listen my friends and take it solemnly to heart  hear the word of the lord ye rulers of sodom give ear unto the law of our god ye people of gomorrah  to what purpose is the multitude of your sacrifices unto me saith the lord  i am full of the burnt offerings of rams and the fat of fed beasts  and i delight not in the blood of bullocks or of lambs or of hegoats  when ye come to appear before me who hath required this at your hand to tread my courts  bring no more vain oblations incense is an abomination unto me the new moons and sabbaths the calling of assemblies i cannot away with it is iniquity even the solemn meeting  your new moons and your appointed feasts my soul hateth  they are a trouble unto me i am weary to bear them  and when ye spread forth your hands i will hide my eyes from you yea when ye make many prayers i will not hear  your hands are full of blood  wash you make you clean put away the evil of your doings from before mine eyes cease to do evil learn to do well seek judgment relieve the oppressed judge the fatherless plead for the widow     how is the faithful city become an harlot it was full of judgment righteousness lodged in it but now murderers  thy silver is become dross thy wine mixed with water thy princes are rebellious and companions of thieves every one loveth gifts and followeth after rewards  they judge not the fatherless neither doth the cause of the widow come unto them therefore saith the lord the lord of hosts the mighty one of israel ah i will ease me of mine adversaries and avenge me of mine enemies     again i say my friends listen to it and take it solemnly to heart  that is gods opinion of religion even the truest and soundest in worship and doctrine when it is without godliness without holiness when it goes in hand with injustice and covetousness and falsehood and cheating and oppression and neglect of the poor and keeping company with the wicked because it is profitable in short when it is like too much of the religion which we see around us in the world at this day  yesit was of no use holding to the letter of the law while they forgot its spirit  god had commanded churchgoing and woe to those then or now who neglect it  yet the lord asks who hath required this at your hands to tread my courts    he had commanded the sabbathday to be kept holy and woe to those then or now who neglect it  yet he says your sabbaths i cannot away with it is iniquity even the solemn meeting  the lord had appointed feasts and yet he says that his soul hated them they were a trouble to him he was weary to bear them  the lord had commanded prayer and woe to those then or now in england as in judaea who neglect to pray and yet he says  when ye spread forth your hands i will hide mine eyes from you yea when ye make many prayers i will not hear  and whyhe himself condescends to tell them the reason which they ought to have known for themselves  because he says your hands are full of blood  this was the reason why all their religiousness and orthodoxy and churchgoing and praying was only disgusting to god because there was no righteousness with it  their faith was only a dead rotten sham faith for it brought forth no fruits of justice and love and their religion was only hypocrisy for it did not make them holy  no doubt they thought themselves pious and sincere enough no doubt they thought that they were pleasing god perfectly and giving him all that he could fairly ask of them no doubt they were fiercely offended at isaiahs message to them no doubt they could not understand what he meant by calling them a hypocritical nation a second sodom and gomorrah while they were destroying idols and keeping the law of moses and worshipping god more earnestly than he had been worshipped since solomons time  but so it was  that was the message of god to them that was the vision of isaiah concerning them that there was no soundness in the whole of the nation from the sole of the foot to the crown of the head nothing but wounds and bruises and putrefying soresthat is that the whole heart and conscience and ways of thinking were utterly rotten and abominable in the sight of god even while they were holding the true doctrines about them and keeping up the pure worship of him  this says the lord is not the way to please me he hath showed thee oh man what is good  and what doth the lord require of thee but to do justly and to love mercy and to walk humbly with thy god  to do justly to love mercy and then to walk humbly sure that when you seem to have done all your duty you have left only too much of it undone even as st paul felt when he said that though he knew nothing against himself though he could not recollect a single thing in which he had failed of his duty to the corinthians yet that did not justify him  for he that judgeth me he says is the lord  he sees deeper than i can and he alas may take a very different view of my conduct from what i do and this life of mine which looks to me from my ignorance so spotless and perfect may be in his eyes full of sins and weakness and neglects and shameful follies  to walk humbly with god  not to believe that because you read the bible and have heard the gospel and are sharp at finding out false doctrine in preachers and belong to the church of england that therefore you know all about god and can look down upon poor papists and heathens and say  this people which knoweth not the law is accursed  but we are enlightened we understand the whole bible we know everything about gods will and mans duty and whosoever differs from us or pretends to teach us anything new about god must be wrong  not to do so my friends but to believe what st paul tells us solemnly that if any man think that he knows anything he knows nothing yet as he ought to knowto believe that the great god and the will of god and the love of god and the mystery of redemption and the treasures of wisdom which are in his bible are as st paul told you boundless like a living well which can never be fathomed or drawn dry but fills again with fresh water as fast as you draw from it  that is walking humbly with god and those who do not do so but like the pharisees of old believe that they have all knowledge and can understand all the mysteries of the bible and go through the world despising and cursing all parties but their ownlet them beware lest the lord be saying of them as he said of the church of sardis of old  thou sayest i am rich and increased with goods and have need of nothing and knowest not that thou art wretched and miserable and poor and blind and naked  how is this  what is this strange thing without which even the true knowledge of doctrine is of no use which if a man or a nation has not he is poor and blind and wretched and naked in soul in spite of all his religion  isaiah will tell uswhat did he say to the jews in his day  wash you make you clean put away the evil of your doings from before my eyes  do justice to the fatherless and relieve the widow  do that says the lord and then your repentance will be sincere  church building and church going are wellbut they are not repentancechurches are not souls  i ask you for your hearts and you give me fine stones and fine words  i want soulsi want your soulsi want you to turn to me  and what am i saith the lord  i am justice i am love i am the god of the oppressed the fatherless the widowthat is my character  turn to justice turn to love turn to mercy long to be made just and loving and merciful see that your sin has been just this and nothing else that you have been unjust unloving unmerciful  repent for your neglect and cruelty and repent in dust and ashes when you see what wretched hypocrites you really are  and then my boundless mercy and pardon shall be open to you  as you wish to be to me so will i be to you if you wish to become merciful you shall taste my mercy if you wish to become loving to others you shall find that i love you if you wish to become just you shall find that i am just just to deal by you as you deal by others faithful and just to forgive you your sins and to cleanse you from all unrighteousness  and then all shall be forgiven and forgotten though your sins be as scarlet they shall be white as snow  though they be red like crimson they shall be as wool  surely my friends these things are worth taking to heart for this is the sin which most destroys all men and nationshigh religious profession with an ungodly covetous and selfish life  it is the worst and most dangerous of all sins for it is like a disease which eats out the heart and life without giving pain so that the sick man never suspects that anything is the matter with him till he finds himself to his astonishment at the point of death  so it was with the jews three times in their history  in the time of isaiah under king hezekiah in the time of jeremiah under king josiah and last and worst of all in the time of jesus christ  at each of these three times the jews were high religious professors and yet at each of these three times they were abominable before god and on the brink of ruin  in isaiahs time their eyes seemed to have been opened at last to their own sins  their fearful danger and wonderful deliverance from the assyrians of which you heard last sunday seem to have done that for them as god intended it should during the latter part of hezekiahs reign they seemed to have turned to god with their hearts and not with their lips only and isaiah can find no words to express the delight which the blessed change gives him  nevertheless they soon fell back again into idolatry and then there was another outward lipreformation under the good king josiah and jeremiah had to give them exactly the same warning which isaiah had given them nearly a hundred years before  but that time alas they would not take the warning and then all the evil which had been prophesied against them came on them  from hypocritical profession they fell back again into their old idolatry their covetousness selfishness partyquarrels and profligate lives made them too weak and rotten to stand against nebuchadnezzar king of babylon when he attacked them and jerusalem was miserably destroyed the temple burnt and the jews carried captives to babylon  there they repented in bitter sorrow and slavery and god allowed them after seventy years to return to their own land  then at first they seemed to be a really converted people and to be worshipping god in spirit and in truth  they never again fell back into the idolatry of the heathen  so far from it they became the greatest possible haters of it they went on keeping the law of god with the utmost possible strictness even to the day when the lord jesus appeared among them  their religious people the scribes and pharisees were the most strict moral devout people of the whole world  they worshipped the very words and letters of the bible their thoughts seemed filled with nothing but god and the service of god  and yet the lord jesus told them that they were in a worse state greater sinners in the sight of god than they had ever been that they who hated idolatry were filling up the measure of their idolatrous forefathers iniquity that the guilt of all the righteous blood shed on earth was to fall on them that they were a race of serpents a generation of vipers and that even he did not see how they could escape the damnation of hell  and they proved how true his words were by crucifying the very lord of whom their much prized scriptures bore witness whom they pretended to worship day and night continually and received the just reward of their deeds in forty years of sedition bloodshed and misery which ended by the romans coming and sweeping the nation of the jews from off the face of the earth  so much for profession without practice  so much for true doctrine with dishonest and unholy lives  so much for outward respectability with inward sinfulness  so much for hating idolatry while all the while mens hearts are far from god  oh my friends let us all search our hearts carefully in these times of high profession and low practice lest we be adding our drop of hypocrisy to the great flood of it which now stifles this land of england and so fall into the same condemnation as the jews of old in spite of far nobler examples brighter and wider light and more wonderful and bounteous blessings    xxithe unfaithful servant    but and if that servant say in his heart my lord delayeth his coming and shall begin to beat the men servants and the maid servants and to eat and drink and to be drunken the lord of that servant will come in a day when he looketh not for him and in an hour when he is not aware and will cut him asunder and will appoint him his portion with the unbelieversluke xii 45 46  but why with the unbelievers  the man had not disbelieved that he had any lord at all he had only believed that his lord delayed his coming  and why was he to be put with those who do not believe in him at all  this is a very fearful question friends for us when we think how it is the fashion among us now to believe that our lord delays his comingand surely most of us do believe that  for is it not our notion that when the lord jesus ascended up to heaven he went away a great distance off perhaps millions of miles beyond the stars and that he will not come back again till the lastwhich for aught we know and as we rather expect may not happen for hundreds or thousands of years to come  is not that most peoples notion rich as well as poor  and if that is not believing that our lord delays his coming what is  but you may answer the creed says plainly that he ascended into heaven and sits at the right hand of god  ah my friends those great words of the creed which you take into your lips every sunday mean the very opposite to what most people fancy  they do not say the lord jesus has left this poor earth to itself and its misery but they say lo he is with you even to the end of the world true he is ascended into heaven  and how far off is heavenfor so far off is the lord jesus and no farther  not so far off my friends after all if you knew where to find it  truly said the great and good poet now gone home to his reward   heaven lies about us in our infancy   and if we lose sight of it as we grow up to be men and women it is not because heaven goes farther off but because we grow less heavenly  even now so close is heaven to us that any one of us might enter into heaven this moment without stirring from his seat one real cry from the depths of your heartfather forgive thy sinful childone real feeling of your own worthlessness and weakness and emptiness and of gods righteousness and love and mercy ready for youand you are in heaven there and then as near the feet of the blessed lord jesus as mary magdalen was when she tried to clasp them in the garden  i am serious my friends i am not given to talk fine figures of poetry i am talking sober straightforward literal truth  and the lord sits at gods right hand too you believe that  then how far off is godfor as far off as god is so far off is the lord jesus and no farther  what says st paul  that god is not far off from any one of usfor in him we live and move and have our being    in him      how far off is that  and is not god everywhere if indeed we can say that he is any where  then the lord jesus who is at gods right hand is everywhere alsohere now with us this day  one would have thought that there was no need to prove that by argument considering that his own blessed lips told us  lo i am with you even to the end of the world and again  wheresoever two or three are gathered together in my name there am i in the midst of them  and this is the lord whom people fancy is gone away far above the stars till the end of time  oh my friends rather bow your heads before him here this moment  for here he is among us now listening to every thought of our poor sinful hearts     he is where god isgod in whom we live and move and have our beingand that is everywhere  do you wish him to be any nearer my friends  or do youdo youtake care what your hearts answer for he is watching themdo you in the depth of your hearts wish that he were a little farther off  does the notion of his being here on this earth watching and interfering as we call it nowadays in our atheism with us and everything seem unpleasant and burdensome  is it more comfortable to you to think that he is away far up beyond the stars  do you feel the lighter and freer for fancying that he will not visit the earth for many a year to come  in short is it in your hearts that you are saying the lord delays his coming  that is a very important question  for mind a pious man might be as many a pious man has been in these days deceived by bad teaching into the notion that jesus christ was gone far away  but if he were a truly pious man if he truly loved the lord that would be a painful thoughtas i should have fancied an unbearable thoughtto him when he looked out upon this poor miserable confused world  he would be crying night and day  oh that thou wouldest rend the heavens and come down  he would be in an agony of pity for this poor deserted earth and of longing for the saviour of it to come back and save it  he would never have a moments peace of mind till he had either seen the lord come back again in his glory or till he had found outwhat i am sure the blessed lord would teach him as a reward for his lovethat it was all a dream and a nightmare and that the lord of the earth was in the earth and close to him all along only that his weak eyes were held so that he did not know the lord and the lords works when he saw them  but that was not the temper of this servant in the lords parable  i am afraid it is by no means the temper of many of us nowadays  the servant said in his heart that his master would be long away  it was his heart put the thought into his head  he took to the notion heartily as we say because he was glad to believe it was true glad to think that his master would not come to interfere with him and that in the meantime he might be lord and master himself and treat everyone in the house as if he himself was the owner of it and tyrannise over his fellowservants and enjoy himself in luxury and good living  so says david of the fool  the fool hath said in his heart there is no god his heart puts that thought into his head he wishes to believe that there is no god and when there is a will there is a way and he soon finds out reasons and arguments enough to prove what he is so very anxious to prove  now my friends i am afraid that there is not so much difference as people fancy between the fool who says in his heart there is no god and the fool who says in his heart my master delays his cominggod has left the world to us and we must shift for ourselves in it  the man who likes to be what st paul calls without god in the world is he so very much wiser than the man who likes to have no god at all  st james did not think so for what does he say  thou believest that there is one god  thou doest wellthe devils also believe and tremble  they know as much as that but it does them no goodonly increases their fear  but wilt thou know oh vain man that faith without works believing without doing is dead  and are not too many as i said just now afraid of the thought of god so afraid of it that they wish to allow the son of god as little share as possible in the management of this world  have not too many a belief without works a mere belief that there is one god and not two which hardly from one years end to another makes them do one single thing which they would not have done if they had believed that there was no god at all  fear of the law fear of the policeman fear of losing their work or their custom fear of losing their neighbours good wordthat is what keeps most people from breaking loose  there is not much of the fear of god in that or the love of god either as far as i can see  they go through life as if they had made a covenant with god that he should have his own way in the world to come if he would only let them have their way in this world  oh my friends my friends do you think god is god of the next world and not of this also  do you think the kingdom and the power and the glory will be his a great many hundreds of years hence in what you call heaven and will not see what every page of scripture tells you what you yourself say every time you repeat the lords prayer that the kingdom and the power and the glory are his now here in this life and that he has committed all things to his son jesus christ and given the power into his hand that he may rule this earth in righteousness now here in this life and conquer back for god one by one if it be possible every creature upon earth  so says the bibleand people profess nowadays to believe their bibles  my friends too many nowadays while they profess very loudly to believe what the bible says only believe what their favourite teachers tell them that the bible says if they really read their bibles for themselves and took god at his word there would be less tyrannising of one man over another less grinding down of men by masters and of men by each otherfor the poor are often very hard on each other in england now my friends very envious and spiteful and slanderous about each other  they say that dog wont eat dogyet how many a poor man grudges and supplants his neighbour and tries to get into his place and beat him down in his wages  and there are those who call themselves learned men who tell the poor that that is gods will and the way by which god intends them to prosper  if those men believed their bibles they would be repenting in sackcloth and ashes for having preached such a devils sermon to gods children  if men really read their bibles there would be less eating and drinking with the drunken less idleness and luxury among the rich less fancying that a man has a right to do what he likes with his own because all men would know that they were only the lords stewards bound to give an account to him of the good which they had done with what he has lent them there would be fewer parents fancying that they can tyrannise over their children bringing them up as heathens for the sake of the few pence they earn using bad language and doing shameful things before them which they dared not do if they recollected that the lord was looking on beating and scolding them as if they were brutes or slaves to save themselves the trouble of teaching them gently what the poor little creatures cannot know without being taught  and most shameful of all robbing the poor children of their little earnings to spend it themselves in drunkenness  ah blessed lord if people did but know how near thou wert to them all that would vanish out of england as the night clouds vanish away before the sun  and he is near my friends  he is watching he is governing he is at hand  and in this life or in the life to come forget him as we choose he will make us know plain enough and without any doubt whatsoever that he is the lord  he has fulfilled this awful parable of his about the unfaithful servant already many a time against many a man many a great king and prince and nation and he will fulfil it against each and every man from the nobleman in his castle to the labourer in his cottage who says in his heart my lord delays his coming and begins to tyrannise over those who are weaker than himself and to enjoy himself as he likes and forget that he is not his own but bought with the price of christs blood and bound to work for christs kingdom and glory  so he punished the popes of rome three hundred years ago  when all the nations in europe were listening to them and obeying them and they had put into their hands by god a greater power of doing good than he ever gave to any human being before or since what did they do  instead of using their power for christ they used it for themselves  instead of preaching to all nations the good news that christ the son of god was their king they said  i the pope am your king  christ is gone far away into heaven and has committed all power on earth to us we are christs vicars we are in christs place he has entrusted to our keeping all the treasures of his merits and his grace and no one can get any blessing from christ unless we choose to give it him  so they said in their hearts just what the foolish servant in the parable said  and fancying that they were lords and masters naturally enough went on to behave as such to beat the menservants and maidservants that is to oppress and tyrannise over the bodies and minds and consciences of men and women too god knows and to eat and drink with the drunken to live in riot and debauchery  but the lord was not so far off as those foolish popes fancied  and in an hour when they were not aware he came and cut them asunder  he snatched from them onehalf of the nations of europe and england among the rest he punished them by doubt ignorance confusion and utter blindness and appointed them their portion among the unbelievers in such terrible earnest that to this very day to judge by the things which they say and do it is difficult to persuade ourselves that the popes really believe in any god at all  so he did only three years ago to many kings and princes on the continent 217  they professed to be christians but they had forgotten that they were christs stewards that all their power came from him and that he had given it them only to use for the good of their subjects  and they too went on saying   the lord delays his coming we are rulers in this world and god is ruler in the world to come  so they too oppressed their subjects and lived in ease on what they wrung out of the poor wretches below them  but the lord was nearer them too than they fancied and all at onceas they were fancying themselves all safe and prosperous and saying we are those who ought to speak who is lord over ustheir fools paradise crumbled from under their feet  a few paltry mobs of foolish starving people without weapons without leaders without good counsel to guide them rose against them  and what did they do they might have crushed down the rebels most of them in a week if they had had courage  and in the only country where the rebels were really strong that is in austria all might have been quiet again at once if the king had only had the heart to do common justice and keep his own solemn oaths  but nothe terror of the lord came upon them  he most truly cut them in sunder  they were every man of a different mind and none of them in the same mind a day together they became utterly consciencestricken terrified perplexed at their wits end not having courage or determination to do anything or even to do nothing and fled shamefully away one after another to their everlasting disgrace  and those of them who have got back their power since are showing sadly enough by their obstinate folly and wickedness that the lord has appointed them their portion with the unbelievers and left them to fill up the measure of their iniquity and drink deep the cup of wrath which is in his hand full and mixed for those who forget god  oh my friends let us lay these things solemnly to heart  do not fancy that the lord will punish the wicked great and forget the wicked small  in his sight there is neither great nor small all are small enough for him to crush like the moth and all are too great to be overlooked or forgotten by him without whom not a sparrow falls to the ground  again i say my friends let us lay his parable to heart  let us who have property and station and education never forget who has given it us and for whom we must use it  let us never forget that to whom much is given of them will much be required  let us pray to the lord daily to write upon our inmost hearts those solemn words  who made thee to differ from another and what hast thou which thou didst not receive  let us look on our servants our labourers on every human being over whom we have any influence as weaker brothers whom god has commanded us to help teach and guide in body mind and spirit not that we may make them our slaves but make them free manful selfhelping and in due time independent of us and of everyone except god  and you young people who have no authority over anyone but over your own bodies to whom the lord has given little or nothing to manage and take care of except your own health and strengthdo not let the devil tempt you to believe that that health and strength is your own property to do what you like with  it belongs to the lord who died for you and he will require an account from you how you have used it  do not let the devil tempt you to believe that the lord delays his coming to youthat you may do what you like now in the prime of your years and that it will be time enough to think about god and religion when god visits you with cares and sickness and old age  that is the fancy of too many but it will surely turn out to be a mistake  those who misuse their youth and health and strength in tyrannising over those who are weaker than themselves and laughing at those who are not as clever as themselves and eating and drinking with the drunkenthe lord will come to them in an hour when they are not aware and cut them asunder in some way or other by loss of work or poverty or sickness or doubt and confusion and bitter shame and perplexity of mind till they find out poor things that they have been living like the unbelievers all their youth without god in the world while gods love and gods teaching and gods happiness was ready for them and have to go back again to their father and their lord and cry  father we have sinned against heaven and before thee and are no more worthy to be called thy children  oh you who have been fancying that the lord was gone far away and that you had a right to do what you liked with the powers which he has given you go back to him now at once and confess that you and all belonging to you belong to him and ask him to teach you how to use it aright  ask him to teach you how to please him with it and not yourselves only  ask him to teach you how to do good to all around you and not merely to do what you like ask him to show you how to do your duty to him and to your neighbours for whom he died on the cross in that station of life to which he has called you  ask him to show you how to use your property your knowledge your business your strength your health so that you may be a blessing and a help to those whom he blesses and helps and who he wishes should bless and help each other  go back to him at once my friends  you will not have far to go seeing that he is now even among us here hearing my clumsy words and i do hope and trust and pray bringing them home to some of your hearts with that spirit and power of his which is like a twoedged sword piercing to the very depths of a mans heart and showing him how ugly it isand how noble the lord will make it if he will but repent and pray to him who never cast out any that came to him    xxiithe way to wealth    seek ye the lord while he may be found call ye upon him while he is near  let the wicked forsake his way and the unrighteous man his thoughts and let him return unto the lord and he will have mercy upon him and to our god for he will abundantly pardonisaiah lv 6 7  some of you surely while the first lesson was being read this morning must have felt the beauty of it and if you were thoughtful perplexed weary sad at heart perhaps you felt that it was more than beautifulthat it was full of comfort  and so it should be full of comfort to you my friends  god meant it to give you comfort  for though it was written and spoken by a man of like passions with ourselves it was just as truly written and spoken by god who made heaven and earth  it is true and everlasting the message which it brings and like all true and everlasting words it is the voice of god who cannot change who makes no difference between jew and gentile between us in england here and nations which perished hundreds of years ago  and what is its message  what was gods word to the old jews among all their sin and sorrow and labour  is it the message of a stern judge saying  pay me that thou owest to the uttermost farthing and if you cannot do that fret and torment yourselves in shame and terror here on earth for all your sins if possibly you may chance to change my mind and find forgiveness at the last day  is it the message of a proud tyrant saying  if you are miserable and fallen and sinful what is that to me  i am perfect blest contented with myself alone in my glory far away beyond the sight of men beyond the sun and starswhat are you worms of earth to me  or is it the voice of a loving father calling to his selfwilled children who have gone proudly and boldly away from their fathers house and thrown off their fathers government and said in their conceit  we are men  do not we know good and evil  do we not know what is our interest  cannot we judge for ourselves and shift for ourselves and take care of ourselves  why are we to be barred from pleasant things here and profitable things there  we will be our own masters  to selfwilled children who have said thus and done thus in their foolish hearts and have found all their conceit and shrewdness only lead them into sorrow and perplexity and distresswho have found that with all their cleverness they could not get the very good things for which they left their fathers house or if they get them find no enjoyment in them but only discontent and shame and danger and a sad selfaccusing heartspending their money for that which does not feed them after all and labouring hard for things which do not satisfy them always longing for something morealways finding the pleasure or the profit or the honour which a little way off looked so fine looked quite ugly and worthless when they come up to it and get hold of itfinding all things full of labour the eye never satisfied with seeing or the ear with hearing the same thing coming over and over again  each young man starting with gay hopes as if he were the first man that ever was born and he was going to do out of hand such fine things as man never did before and make his own fortune and set the world to right at once and then as he grows older falling into the same weary ruts as his forefathers went dragging on it every fresh year bringing its own labour and its own sorrow and dying like them taking nothing away with him of all he has earned and crying with his last breath  that which is crooked cannot be made straight and that which is wanting cannot be numbered  what profit hath a man of all his labour which he taketh under the sun for all is vanity and vexation of spirit  to selfwilled children who have tried their own way ever since they were born they and their fathers before them and found it go round in a ring and leave them just where they started in heart and soul and on their deathbeds in purse and power also  to such struggling dissatisfied beingssuch as ninetenths of the men and women on this earth alas are stillcomes the word of this loving father  ho every one that thirsteth come ye to the waters and he that hath no money come buy and eat  yea come buy wine and milk without money and without price  why do you fancy that money can give you all you want  why this labouring and straining after money as if it was god as if it made heaven and earth and all therein is money a god or moneys worth i am god saith the lord and beside me there is none else  it is i who give and not money  it is i who save men and not money  and i do save and i do give freely to all  come and try my mercy and see if my word be not true  this struggling and snarling like dogs over a bonewhat profit comes of it are you happier are you wiser are you better are you more at peace with your neighbours more at peace with your own hearts and consciences  if you are money has not made you so nor plotting and scraping and struggling and pushing your neighbour down that you may rise a few inches on his shoulders  no  hear what the voice of your father says is the true way to wealth and comfort after which you all struggle and labour so hard in vain hearken diligently unto me and you shall eat that which is good and your soul shall delight itself in fatness  incline your ear and come unto me  hear and your soul shall live  and i will make an everlasting covenant with you even the sure mercies or rather the faithful oath which i sware unto david  and what is this faithful oath which god sware to davidof the fruit of thy body i will set on thy seat  a promise of a righteous king who should arise in davids family  how far david understood the full meaning of that glorious promise we cannot tell  he thought most probably at first that solomon his son was to be the king who would fulfil it  but all through many of his psalms there are deep and great words about some nobler and more perfect king than solomonabout one who as isaiah says here would perfectly witness to the people that god was their king one who would be a perfect leader and commander of the people a holy one of israel who would sit on gods right hand to hear the good news of whom the jews would call nations whom they then did not know of and for whose sake nations who did not know them would run to them  and dimly david did see this that god would raise up a true christ that is one truly anointed by god chosen and sent out by god to sit on his throne and be perfectly what david was only in part a king made perfect by suffering a king of poor men a king who bore the sins and carried the iniquities of all his people from the highest to the lowest  we know who that was we know clearly what david only knew dimly what isaiah only knew a little more clearly  we know who was born of the virgin mary crucified under pontius pilate ascended into heaven and now sits at the right hand of god ever praying for us ruling the world in righteousness jesus the lord the holy one of israel to whom all power is given in heaven and earth  but isaiah though he knew him only dimly still knew him  he did not know that the lord the holy one of israel would take on himself the form of a poor man and be called the son of the carpenter  such boundless love and condescension in the son of god he never could have fancied for himself and god had not chosen to reveal it to him or to anyone else in those days  but this he did see that the lord jesus he whom he calls the holy one of israel was near the jews in his time that he was watching over them mourning over their sins arguing with them and calling them to return to him with most human love and tenderness as a husband to the woman whom he loves in spite of her unfaithfulness to him  as he says to his sinful and distressed country in the chapter before this  thy maker is thy husband  the lord of hosts is his name and thy redeemer is the holy one of israel the lord of the whole earth shall he be called  for the lord hath called thee as a woman forsaken and grieved in spirit for a small moment have i forsaken thee but with great mercies will i gather thee  in a little anger i hid my face from thee for a moment but with everlasting kindness will i have mercy on thee saith the lord thy redeemer  this then isaiah knewthat the heart of the holy lord pitied and yearned after those poor sinful jews as a husbands after a foolish and sinful wife  and how much more should we believe the same how much more should we believe that his heart pities and yearns for all foolish and sinful people here in england now  we who know a thousand times more than isaiah knew of his love his pity his condescension which led him to sacrifice himself upon the cross for us  surely surely if isaiah had a right to say to those jews seek the lord while he may be found i have a thousand times as much right to say it to you  if isaiah had a right to say to those jews let the wicked forsake his ways and the unrighteous man his thoughts and let him return unto the lord and he will have mercy upon him and to our god for he will abundantly pardon then i have a right to say it to you  free mercy utter pardon pardon for all even for the worst  and what is the argument which isaiah uses to make his countrymen repent is it repent or you shall be damned  repent because gods wrath and curse is against you  the lord hates you and despises you and you must crawl to his feet like beaten hounds and entreat him not to strike you into hell as he intends  not so it was because god loved the jews that they were to repent  it is because god loves you that you must repent  incline your ear saith the lord and come unto me hear and your soul shall live and you shall eat that which is good and your soul shall delight itself in fatness  yes god is love  gods delight and glory is to give in spite of all our sins he gives and gives sending rain and fruitful seasons to just and unjust to fill their hearts with joy and gladness and all the while men fancy that it is not god that gives but they who take god has not left himself as st paul says without a witness every fruitful shower and quickening gleam of sunshine cries to ussee god is love  he is the giver  and men will not hear that voice they say in their hearts the lord is far away above the skies he does not care for us  we must help ourselves each man to what he can get off this earth nay even when we are hard put to it for a living we must break gods laws to keep ourselves alive and so steal from gods table the very good things which he offers us freely  but some will say  he does not give freely we must work and struggle  why do you mock poor hardworked creatures with such words as these  ask that question of god my friends and not of me  isaiah said that those who hearkened to god diligently should eat what is good the lord jesus christ himself said the samethat if we seek first the kingdom of god and his justice all other things should be added to them  he did not mean us to be idle god forbid but this he meant that if we each in his business and calling put steadily before ourselves what is right what god would wish us his subjects to be in his kingdomif instead of making our first thought in every business we take in hand what will suit my interest best what will raise most money what will give me most pleasure we said to ourselves all day long what will be most right and just and merciful for us to do what will be most pleasing to a god who is love and justice itself what will do most good to my neighbour as well as myself then all things would go well with us  then we should be prosperous and joyful  then our plans would succeed and our labour bring forth real profit to us because they would be according to the will of god  we should be fellowworkers with jesus christ in the great work of doing good to this poor distracted world and his help and blessing would be with us  and if you ask me how can this come to pass i must answer as isaiah does in this same chapter  the lords ways are not as our ways nor his thoughts as our thoughts but higher than ours as the heavens are above the earth  but if we do turn to god and repent each man of us of his selfishness his unfaithfulness his hard heartedness his covetousness his selfwill his ungodlinessthen gods blessing as isaiah says will come down on us and spring up among us we know not how or whence like the rain and snow which comes down from heaven and waters the earth and makes it bud and bring forth to give seed to the sower and bread to the eater  so shall be the lords word which goes out of his mouth it will not return to him void but will accomplish what he pleases and prosper in that whereto he sends it  he will teach us and guide us in the right way  he will put his word into the mouths of true teachers to show us our duty  he will pour out his spirit upon us to make us love our duty  in one way and another we know not how we shall be taught what is good for england good for each parish good for each family  and wealth peace and prosperity for rich and poor will be the fruit of obeying the word of god and giving up our hearts to be led by his spirit  as it was to be in judaea of old if they repented so will it be with us  they should go forth with joy and do their work in peace  the hills should break before them into singing and all the trees of the field should clap their hands instead of thorns should come up timbertrees  instead of briers gardenshrubs  the whole cultivation of the country was to improve and be to the lord for a name and a sign for ever that the true way to wealth and prosperity is the way of god justice mercy to each other and obedience to the will of him who made heaven and earth trees and fruitful fields rain and sunshine and gives the blessings of them freely to his children of mankind in proportion as they look up to him as a loving father and return to him day by day with childlike repentance and full desire to amend their lives according to his holy word    xxiiithe love of christ    for the love of christ constraineth us because we thus judge that if one died for all then were all dead  and that he died for all that they which live should not henceforth live unto themselves but unto him which died for them and rose again2 cor v 14 15  what is the use of sermonswhat is the use of books  here are hundreds and thousands of people hearing weekly and daily what is right and how many do what is rightmuch less love what is right what can be the reason of this that men should know the better and choose the worse  what motive can one find outwhat reason or argument can one put before people to make them do their duty  how can one stir them up to conquer themselves to conquer their own love of pleasure laziness cowardice conceit above all their own selfishness and do simply what is right morning noon and night that is a question worth asking and considering for there ought to be some use in sermons and in books and there ought to be some use in every one of us too  woe to the man who is of no use  the lord have mercy on his soul for he needs it  it is indeed worth his while to take any trouble which will teach him a motive for being useful in plain words stir him up to do his duty to do his rights for a mans rights are not as the world thinks what is right others should do to him but what is right he should do to others  our duty is our right the only thing which is right for us  what motive will constrain us that is bind us and force us to do that  will selfinterest  will a man do right because you tell him it is his interest it will pay him to do it  look round you and seethe drunkard knows that drinking will ruin him and yet he gets drunk the spendthrift knows that extravagance will ruin him and yet he throws away his money still  the idler knows that he is wasting his only chance for all eternity and yet he puts the thought out of his head and goes on idling  the cheat knows that he is in danger of being almost certainly found out sooner or later he knows too that he is burdening his own conscience with the curse of inward shame and selfcontempt and yet he goes on cheating  the hard master knows or ought to know for there is quite enough to prove it to him that it would pay him better in the long run to be more merciful and less covetous that by grinding those whom he employs down to the last farthing he degrades them till they become burdens on him and curses to him that what he gains by high prices he will lose in the long run by bad debts that what he saves in low wages he will pay in extra poorrates and that even if he does make money out of the flesh and bones of those beneath him that money ill gotten is sure to be ill spent that there is a curse on it that it brings a curse in the gnawing of a mans own conscience and a curse too in the way it flows away from his family as fast as it flowed to them  he that by usury and unjust gain increases his wealth shall gather for him that will pity the poor  so said solomon of old  and men who worship mammon find it come true daily and see that taking all things together a mans life does not consist in the abundance of the things which he possesses and that those who make such haste to be rich fall as the apostle says into temptation and a snare and pierce themselves through with many sorrows  such a man sees his neighbours making money and making themselves more unhappy anxious discontented by it he sees in short that it is not his interest to do nothing but make money and save money  and yet in spite of that he thinks of nothing else  selfinterest cannot keep him from that sin  i do not believe that selfinterest ever kept any man from any sin though it may keep him from many an imprudence  selfinterest may make many a man respectable but whom did it ever make good  you may as well make housewalls of paper or take a rush for a walking stick as take selfinterest to keep you upright or even prudent the first shakeand the rush bends and the paper wall breaks and a mans selfish prudence is blown to the winds  let pleasure tempt him or ambition or the lust of making money by speculation let him take a spite against anyone let him get into a passion let his pride be hurt and he will do the maddest things which he knows to be entirely contrary to his own interest just to gratify the fancy of the moment  those who call themselves philosophers and fancy that mens selfinterest if they can only feel it strong enough would make all men just and merciful to each other know as little of human nature as they do of god or the devil  what will make a man to do his duty  will the hope of heaven  that depends very much upon what you mean by heaven  but what people commonly mean by going to heaven isnot going to hell  they believe that they must go to either one place or the other  they would much sooner of course stay on earth for ever because their treasure is here and their heart too  but that cannot be and as they have no wish to go to hell they take up with heaven instead by way of making the best of a bad matter  i ask you solemnly my friends each one of you which would you sooner dostay here on earth or go to heaven  you need not answer me  i am afraid many of you would not dare answer me as you really felt because you would be ashamed of not liking to go to heaven but answer god  answer yourselves in the sight of god  when you keep yourselves back from doing a wrong thing because you know it is wrong is it for love of heaven or for mere fear of being punished in hell  some of you will answer boldly at once  for neither one nor the other when we keep from wrong it is because we hate and despise what is wrong  when we do right it is because it is right and we ought to do it  we cant explain it but there is something in us which tells us we ought to do right  very good my friends i shall have a word to say to you presently but in the meantime there are some others who have been saying to themselves  well i know we do right because we are afraid of being punished if we do not do it but what of that at all events we get the right thing done and leave the wrong thing undone and what more do you want  why torment us with disagreeable questions as to why we do it  now my friends to make the matter simpler i will take you at your words for the sake of argument  suppose you do avoid sin from the fear of hell does that make what you do right  does that make you right  does that make your heart right  it is a great blessing to a mans neighbours certainly if he is kept from doing wrong any how by the fear of hell or fear of jail or fear of shame or fear of ghosts if you like or any other cowardly and foolish motivea great blessing to a mans neighbours  but no blessing that i can see to the man himself  he is just the same his heart is not changed his heart is no more right in the sight of god or in the sight of any man of common sense either than it would be if he did the wrong thing which he loves and dare not do  you feel that yourselves about other people  you will say that man has a bad heart for all his respectable outside  he would be a rogue if he dared and therefore he is a rogue  just so i say my friends take care lest god should say of you he would be a sinner if he dared and therefore he is a sinner  how can the hope of heaven or the fear of hell make a man do right the right thing the true thing for a man is to be loving and do loving things and can fear of hell do that or hope of heaven either  can a man make himself affectionate to his children because he fancies he shall be punished if he is not so and rewarded if he is so  will the hope of heaven send men out to feed the hungry to clothe the naked visit the sick preach the gospel to the poorthe papists say it will  i say it will not  i believe that even in those who do these things from hope of heaven and fear of hell there is some holier nobler more spiritual motive than such everlasting selfishness such perfect hypocrisy as to do loving works for others for the sake of ones own selflove  what feeling then is there left which will bind a man to do good not once in a way but always and habitually to do good not only to himself but to all around him  i know but of one my friends and that is love  there are many sides to loveadmiration reverence gratitude pity affectionthey are all different shapes of that one great spirit of love  surely all of you have felt its power more or less how wonderfully it can conquer a mans whole heart change his whole conduct  for love of a woman for pity to those in distress for admiration for anyone who is nobler and wiser than himself for gratitude to one who has done him kindness for loyalty to one to whom he feels he owes a servicea man will dare to do things and suffer things which no selfinterest or fear in the world could have brought him to  do you not know it yourselves  is it not fondness for your wives and children that will make you slave and stint yourselves of pleasure more than any hope of gain could ever do  but there is no one human being my friends whom we can meet among us now for whom we can feel all these different sorts of love  surely not  and yet there must be one person somewhere for whom god intends us to feel them all at once or else he would not have given all these powers to us and made them all different branches of one great root of love  there must be one person somewhere who can call out the whole love in usall our gratitude all our pity all our admiration all our loyalty all our brotherly affection  and there is one my friends  one who has done for us more than ever husband or father wife or brother can do to call out our gratitude  one who has suffered for us more than the saddest wretch upon this earth can suffer to call out our pity  one who is nobler purer more lovely in character than all others who ever trod this earth to call out our admiration  one who is wiser mightier than all rulers and philosophers to call out all our reverence  one who is tenderer more gentle more feelinghearted than the kindest woman who ever sat by a sick bed to call out all our love  of whom can i be speaking  of whom but of jesus he who for us stooped out of the heaven of heavens for us left his eternal glory in the bosom of the father for us took upon him the form of a servant and was born of a village maiden and was called the son of a carpenter for us wandered this earth for thirty years in sorrow and shame for us gave his back to the scourge and his face to shameful spitting for us hung upon the cross and died the death of the felon and the slave oh my friends if that story will not call out our love what will if we cannot admire christ whom can we admire  if we cannot be grateful to christ to whom can we be grateful  if we cannot pity christ whom can we pity  if we cannot feel bound in honour to live for christ to work for christ to delight in talking of christ thinking of christ to glory in doing christs commandments to the very smallest point to feel no sacrifice too great no trouble too petty if we can please christ by it and help forward christs kingdom upon earthif we cannot feel bound in honour to do that for christ what honour is there in us  again i say if we cannot love christ whom can we love  if the remembrance of what he has worked for us will not stir us up to work for him what will stir us up  i say it again we are bound by every tie by every feeling that can bind man to man to devote ourselves to christ the man of all men i say this is no dream or fancy it is an actual fact which thousands and hundreds of thousands on this earth have felt  nothing but love to christ nothing but loving him because he first loved us can constrain and force a man as with a mighty feeling which he cannot resist to labour day and night for christs sake and therefore for the sake of god the father of christ  what else do you suppose it was which could have stirred up the apostlesabove all that wise learned highborn prosperous man st paul to leave house and home and wander in daily danger of his life  what does st paul say himself  the love of christ constraineth us because we thus judge and if one died for all then were all dead and that he died for all that they which live should not henceforth live unto themselves but unto him who died for them  and what else could have kept st paul through all that labour and sorrow of his own choosing of which he speaks in the chapter beforewe are troubled on every side yet not distressed we are perplexed but not in despair persecuted but not forsaken cast down but not destroyed always bearing about in the body the dying of the lord jesus that the life also of jesus might be made manifest in our body for we which live are alway delivered unto death for jesus sake that the life also of jesus might be made manifest in our body  we may say that st paul was an exceedingly benevolent man and that made him do it or that he had found out certain new truths and opinions which delighted him very much and therefore he did it  but st paul gives no such account of himself  and we have no right to take anyones account but his own  he knew his own heart best  he does not say that he came to preach a scheme of redemption or opinions about christ  he says he came to preach nothing but christ himselfchrist crucifiedto tell people about the lord he loved about the lord who loved him certain that when they had heard the plain story of him their hearts if they were simple and true and loving would leap up in answer to his words and find out as by instinct what christ had done for them what they were to do for christ  ay i believe my friendsindeed i am certainfrom my own reading that in every age and country just in proportion as men have loved christ personally as a man would love another man just in that proportion have they loved their neighbours worked for their neighbours sacrificed their time their pleasure their money to do good to all for the sake of him who commanded  if ye love me keep my commandments and my commandment is this that ye should love one another as i have loved you  that is the only sure motive  all other motives for doing good or being good will fail in one case or another case because they do not take possession of a mans whole heart but only of some part of his heart  lovelove to christ can alone sweep away a mans whole heart and soul with it and renew it and transfigure it and make it strong instead of weak pure instead of foul gentle instead of fierce brave instead of being vain and cowardly and fearing what everyone will say of him  only love for christ who loved all men unto the death will make us love all men too  not only one here and there who may agree with us or help us but those who hate us those who misunderstand us those who thwart us ay even those who disobey and slight not only us but jesus christ himself  that is the hardest lesson of all to learn but thousands have learnt it everyone ought to learn it  in proportion as a man loves christ he will learn to love those who do not love christ  for christ loves them whether they know it or not christ died for them whether they believe it or not and we must love them because our saviour loves them  oh my friends why do so few love christ  why do so few live as those who are not their own but bought with the price of his precious blood and bound to devote themselves body and soul to his cause  why do so many struggle against their sins while yet they cannot break off those sins but go struggling and sinning on hating their sins and yet unable to break through their sins like birds beating themselves to death against the wires of their cage  why because they do not know christ  and how can they know him unless they read their bibles with simple childlike hearts determined to let the bible tell its own story  believing that those who walked with christ on earth must know best what he was like  why  because they will not ask christ to come and show himself to them and make them see him and love him and admire him whether they will or not oh remember if christ be the son of god the lord of heaven and earth we cannot go to him poor weak ignorant creatures as we are we cannot ascend up into heaven to bring christ down  he must come down out of his own great love and condescension and dwell in our hearts as he has promised to do if we do but love him  he must come down and show himself to us  oh read your biblesread the story of christ and if that does not stir up in you some love for him you must have hearts of stone not flesh and blood  and then go to him pray to him whether you believe in him altogether or not upon the mere chance of his being able to hear you and help you  you would not throw away a chance on earth will you throw away such a chance in heaven as having the son of god to help you  oh cry to him say out of the depths of your heart  thou most blessed and glorious being who ever walked this earth who hast gone blameless through all sorrow and temptation that man can feel if thou dost love anyone if thou canst hear anyone hear me  if thou canst not help me no one can  i have a hundred puzzling questions which i cannot answer for myself a hundred temptations which i cannot conquer for myself a hundred bad habits which i cannot shake off of myself and they tell me that thou canst teach me thou canst guide me thou canst strengthen me thou canst take out of my heart this shame and gnawing of an evil conscience  if thou be the son of god make me clean  if it be true that thou lovest all men show thy love to me  if it be true that thou canst teach all men teach me  if it be true that thou canst help all men help my unbelief for if thou dost not there is no help for me in heaven or earth  you who are sinful distracted puzzled brokenhearted cry to christ in that way if you have no better way and see if he does not hear you  he is not one to break the bruised reed or quench the smoking flax  he will hear you for he has heard all who have ever called on him  cry to him from the bottom of your hearts  tell him that you do not love him and that yet you long to love him  and see if you do not find it true that those who come to christ he will in no wise cast out he may not seem to answer you the first time or the tenth time or for years for christ has his own deep loving wise ways of teaching each man and for each man a different way  but try to learn all you can of him  try to know him  pray to know and understand him and love him  and sooner or later you will find his words come true if a man love me i and my father will come to him and take up our abode with him  and then you will feel arise in you a hungering and a thirsting after righteousness a spirit of love and a desire of doing good which will carry you up and on above all that man can say or do against youabove all the laziness and wilfulness and selfishness and cowardice which dwells in the heart of everyone you will be able to trample it all under foot for the sake of being good and doing good in the strength of that one glorious thought christ lived and died for me and so help me god i will live and die for christ    xxivdavids victory    thou comest to me with a sword and with a spear and with a shield but i come to thee in the name of the lord of armies the god of israel whom thou hast defied1 samuel xvii 45  we have been reading today the story of davids victory over the philistine giant goliath  now i think the whole history of david may teach us more about the meaning of the old testament and how it applies to us than the history of any other single character  david was the great hero of the jews the greatest in spite of great sins and follies that has ever been among them in every point the king after gods own heart  our lord jesus christ himself did not disdain to be called especially the son of david  david was the author too of those wonderful psalms which are now in the mouths and the hearts of christian people all over the world and will last as i believe till the worlds end giving out fresh depths of meaning and spiritual experience  but to understand davids history we must go back a little through the lessons which have been read in church the last few sundays  we find in the eighth and in the twelfth chapters of this same book of samuel that the jews asked samuel for a kingfor a king like the nations round them  samuel consulted god and by gods command chose saul to be their king at the same time warning them that in asking for a king they had committed a great and fearful sin for the lord their god was their king  and the lord said unto samuel that in asking for a king they had rejected god from reigning over them  now what was this sin which the jews committed for the mere having a king cannot be wrong in itself else god would not have anointed saul and david kings and blessed david and solomon much less would he have allowed the greater number of christian nations to remain governed by kings unto this day if a king had been a wrong thing in itself  i think if we look carefully at the words of the story we shall see what this great sin of the jews was  in the first place they asked samuel to give them a kingnot god  this was a sin i think but it was only the fruit of a deeper sina wrong way of looking at the whole question of kings and government  and that deeper sin was this  they were a free people and they wanted to become slaves  god had made them a free people he had brought them up out of the land of egypt out of slavery to pharaoh  he had given them a free constitution  he had given them laws to secure safety and liberty and equal justice to rich and poor for themselves their property their children to defend them from oppression and overtaxation and all the miseries of misgovernment  and now they were going to trample under foot gods inestimable gift of liberty they wanted a king like the nations round them they said  they did not see that it was just their glory not to be like the nations round them in that  we who live in a free country do not see the vast and inestimable difference between the jews and the other nations  the jews were then perhaps so far as i can make out the only free people on the face of the earth  the nations round them were like the nations in the east now governed by tyrants without law or parliament at the mercy of the will the fancy the lust the ambition and the cruelty of their despotic kings  in fact they were as the eastern people now areslaves governed by tyrants samuel warned the jews that it would be just the same with them that neither their property their families nor their liberty would be safe under the despots for whom they wished  and yet in spite of that warning they would have a king  and why  because they did not like the trouble of being free  they did not like the responsibility and the labour of taking care of themselves and asking counsel of god as to how they were to govern themselves  so they were ready to sell themselves to a tyrant that he might fight for them and judge for them and take care of them while they just ate and drank and made money and lived like slaves careless of what happened to them or their country provided they could get food and clothes and money enough  and as long as they got that if you will remark they were utterly careless as to what sort of king they had  they said not one word to samuel about how much power their king was to have they made not the slightest inquiry as to whether saul was wise or foolish good or bad  they did not ask gods counsel or trouble themselves about god so they proved themselves unworthy of being free  they turned like a dog to his vomit and the sow to her wallowing in the mire cowardly back again into slavery and god gave them what they asked for  he gave them the sort of king they wanted and bitterly they found out their mistake during several hundred years of continually increasing slavery and misery  there is a deep lesson for us my friends in all this  and that is that gods gifts are not fit for us unless we are more or less fit for them  that to him that makes use of what he has more shall be given but from him who does not will be taken away even what he has  and so even the inestimable gift of freedom is no use unless men have free hearts in them  god sets a man free from his sins by faith in jesus christ but unless that man uses his grace unless he desires to be free inwardly as well as outwardlyto be free not only from the punishment of his sins but from the sins themselves unless he is willing to accept gods offer of freedom and go boldly to the throne of grace and there plead his cause with his heavenly father face to face without looking to any priest or saint or other third person to plead for him if in short a man has not a free spirit in him the grace of god will become of no effect in him and he will receive the spirit of bondage of slavery that is again to fear perhaps he will fall back more or less into popery and halfpopish superstitions perhaps as we see daily round us he will fall back again into antinomianism into the slavery of those very sins from which god once delivered him  and just the same is it with a nation when god has given a nation freedom then unless there be a free heart in the people and true independence which is dependence on god and not on man unless there be a spirit of justice mercy truth trust of god in them their freedom will be of no effect they will only fall back into slavery to be oppressed by fresh tyrants  so it was with the great spanish colonies in south america a few years ago  god gave them freedom from the tyranny of spain but what advantage was it to them  because there was no righteousness in them because they were a cowardly profligate false and cruel people therefore they only became the slaves of their own lusts they turned gods great grace of freedom into licentiousness and have been ever since doing nothing but cutting each others throats every mans hand against his own brother the slaves of tyrants far more cruel than those from whom they had escaped  look at the french people too  three times in the last sixty years has god delivered them from evil rulers and given them a chance of freedom and three times have they fallen back into fresh slavery and why  because they will not be righteous because they will be proud boastful lustful godless cruel making a lie and loving it god help them  we are not here to judge them but to take warning ourselves  now there is no use in boasting of our english freedom unless we have free and righteous hearts in us for it is not constitutions and parliaments and charters which make a nation free they are only the shell the outside of freedom  true freedom is of the heart and spirit and comes down from above from the spirit of god for where the spirit of god is there is liberty and there only  oh every one of you high and low rich and poor pray and struggle to get your own hearts free free from the sins which beset us englishmen in these days free from pride prejudice and envy free from selfishness and covetousness free from unchastity and drunkenness free from the conceit that england is safe while all the rest of the world is shaking  be sure that the spirit of freedom like every other good and perfect gift is from above and comes down from god the father of lights and that to keep that spirit with us we must keep ourselves worthy of it and not expect to remain free if we indulge ourselves in mean and slavish sins  so the jews got the king they wanteda king to look at and be proud of  saul was we read a head taller than all the rest of the people and very handsome to look at  and he was brave enough too in mere fighting when he was awakened and stirred up to act now and then but there was no wisdom in him no real trust in god in him he took god for an idol like the heathens false gods which had to be pleased and kept in good humour by the smell of burnt sacrifices and not for a living righteous person who had to be obeyed  we read of sauls misconduct in these respects in the thirteenth and fifteenth chapters of the first book of samuel  that was only the beginning of his wickedness  the worst points in his character as i shall show in my next sermon came out afterwards  but still his disobedience was enough to make god cast him off and leave him to go his own way to ruin  but god was not going to cast off his people whom he loved  he deals not with mankind after their sins neither rewards them according to their iniquities and so he chose out for them a king after his own hearta true king of gods making not a mere sham one of mans making  you may think it strange why god should have given them a second king why as soon as saul died he did not let them return back to their old freedom  but that is not gods way  he brings good out of evil in his great mercy  but it is always by strange winding paths  his ways are not as our ways  first god gives man what is perfectly proper for him at that time sets man in his right place and then when man falls from that god brings him not back to the place from which he fell but on forward into something far higher and better than what he fell from  he put adam into paradise adam fell from it and god made use of the fall to bring him into a state far better than paradiseinto the kingdom of godinto everlasting lifeinto the likeness of christ the new adam who is a quickening lifegiving spirit while the old adam was at best only a living soul  so with the church of christian men  after the apostles time and even during the apostles time as we read from the epistle to the galatians they fell away step by step from the liberty of the gospel till they sunk entirely into popish superstition  and yet god brought good out of that evil  he made that very popery a means of bringing them back at the reformation into clearer light than any of the first christians ever had had  he is going on step by step still bringing christians into a clearer knowledge of the gospel than even the reformers had  and so with the jews  they fell from their liberty and chose a king and yet god made use of those kings of theirs of david of solomon of josiah and hezekiah to teach them more and more about himself and his law and to teach all nations by their example what a nation should be and how he deals with one  but now let us see what this true king david was like whom god chose that he might raise by his means the jews higher than they ever yet had been even in their days of freedom  now remark in the first place that david was not the son of any very great man  his father seems to have been only a yeoman  he was not bred up in courts  we find that when samuel was sent to anoint david king he was out keeping his fathers sheep in the field  and though no doubt he had shown signs of being a very remarkable youth from the first yet his father thought so little of him that he was going to pass him over and caused all his seven elder sons to pass before samuel for his choice first though there seems to have been nothing particular in them except that some of them were fine men and brave soldiers  so david seems to have been overlooked and thought but little of in his youthand a very good thing for him  it is a good thing for a young man to bear the yoke in his youth that he may be kept humble and low that he may learn to trust in god and not in his own wit  and even when samuel anointed david he anointed him privately  his brothers did not know what a great honour was in store for him for we find in the lesson which we have just read that when david came down to the camp his elder brother spoke contemptuously to him and treated him as a child  i know thy pride he said and the naughtiness of thy heart  thou art come down to see the battle  while david answers humbly enough  what have i done is there not a cause feeling that there was more in him than his brother gave him credit for though he dare not tell his brother hardly perhaps dare believe himself what great things god had prepared for him  so it is yeta prophet has no honour in his own country  how many a noblehearted man there is who is looked down upon by those round him  how many a one is despised for a dreamer or for a methodist by shallow worldly people who in gods sight is of very great price  but god sees not as man sees  he makes use of the weak people of this world to confound the strong he sends about his errands not many noble not many mighty but the poor man rich in faith like david  he puts down the mighty from their seat and exalts the humble and meek  he takes the beggar from the dunghill that he may set him among the princes of his people so he has been doing in all ages  so he will do even now in some measure with everyone like david let him be as low as he will in the opinion of this foolish world who yet puts his trust utterly in god and goes about all his work as david did in the name of the lord of hosts  oh if a poor man feels that god has given him wit and wisdomfeels in him the desire to rise and better himself in life let him be sure that the only way to rise is davids planto keep humble and quiet till god shall lift him up trusting in gods righteousness and love to raise him and deliver him and put him in that station be it high or low in which he will be best able to do gods work or serve gods glory  and now for the chapter from which the text is taken which relates to us davids first great public triumphhis victory over goliath the giant  i will not repeat it to you because everyone here who has ears to hear or a heart to feel ought to have been struck with every word in that glorious story  all i will try to do is to show you how the working of gods spirit comes out in david in every action of his on that glorious day  we saw just now davids humbleness and gentleness the fruits of gods spirit in him in his answer to his proud and harsh brother  look next at davids spirit of trust in god which indeed is the key to his whole life that is the reason why he was the man after gods own heartnot for any virtues of his own but for his unshaken continual faith in god david saw in an instant why the israelites were so afraid of the giant because they had no faith in god  they forgot that they were the armies of the living god  david did not  who is this uncircumcised that he shall defy the armies of the living god  and therefore when saul tried to dissuade him from attacking the philistine his answer is still the samefull of faith in god  he knew well enough what a fearful undertaking it was to fight with this giant nearly ten feet high armed from head to foot with mail which perhaps no sword or spear which he could use could pierce  it was no wonder humanly speaking that all the jews fled from himthat his being there stopped the whole battle  in these days fifty such men would make no difference in a battle bullets and cannonshot would mow down them like other men  but in those old times before firearms were invented when all battles were handtohand fights and depended so much on each mans strength and courage that one champion would often decide the victory for a whole army the amount of courage which was required in david is past our understanding at least we may say david would not have had it but for his trust in god but for his feeling that he was on gods side and goliath on the devils side unjustly invading his country in selfconceit and cruelty and lawlessness  therefore he tells saul of his victory over the lion and the bear  you see again here the spirit of god showing in his modesty  he does not boast or talk of his strength and courage in killing the lion and the bear for he knew that that strength and courage came from god not from himself therefore he says that the lord delivered him from them  he knew that he had been only doing his duty in facing them when they attacked his fathers sheep and that it was gods mercy which had protected him in doing his duty  he felt now that if no one else would face this brutal giant it was his duty poor simple weak youth as he was and therefore he trusted in god to bring him safe through this danger also  but look again how the spirit of god shows in his prudence he would not use sauls armour good as it might be because he was not accustomed to it  he would use his own experience and fight with the weapons to which he had been accustomeda sling and stone you see he was none of those presumptuous and fanatical dreamers who tempt god by fancying that he is to go out of his way to work miracles for them  he used all the proper and prudent means to kill the giant and trusted to god to bless them  if he had been presumptuous he might have taken the first stone that came to hand or taken only one or taken none at all and expected the giant to fall down dead by a miracle  but no he chooses five smooth stones out of the brook  he tried to get the best that he could and have more ready if his first shot failed  he showed no distrust of god in that for he trusted in god to keep him cool and steady and courageous in the fight and that he knew god alone could do  the only place perhaps where he could strike goliath to hurt him was on the face because every other part of him was covered in metal armour  and he knew that in such danger as he was gods spirit only could keep his eye clear and his hand steady for such a desperate chance as hitting that one place  so he went and as he went his courage rose higher and higher for unto him that hath shall more be given and so he began to boast too but not of himself like the giant  he boasted of the living god who was with him  he ran boldly up to the philistine and at the first throw struck on the forehead and felled him dead  so it is many a time the very blessing which we expect to get only with great difficulty god gives us at our first trial to show that he is the giver to cheer up our poor doubting hearts and show us that he is able and willing too to give exceeding abundantly more than we can ask or think  so david triumphed  and yet that triumph was only the beginning of his troubles  sad and weary years had he to struggle on before he gained the kingdom which god had promised him  so it is often with gods elect  he gives them blessings at first to show them that he is really with them and then he lets them be evilentreated by tyrants and suffer persecution and wander out of the way in the wilderness that they may be made perfect by suffering and purified as gold is in the refiners fire from all selfishness conceit ambition cowardliness till they learn to trust god utterly to know their own weakness and his strength and to work only for him careless what becomes of their own poor worthless selves provided they can help his kingdom to come and get his will to be done on earth as it is in heaven  and now my friends surely there is a lesson in all this for you do you wish to rise like david  of course not one in ten thousand can rise as high but we may all rise somewhat if not in rank yet still what is far better in spirit in wisdom in usefulness in manfulness  do you wish to rise so then follow davids example  be truly brave be truly modest and in order to be truly brave and truly modest that is be truly manly be truly godly  trust in god trust in god that is the key to all greatness  courage modesty truth honesty and gentleness all things which are noble lovely and of good report all things in short which will make you men after gods own heart are all only the different fruits of that one blessed lifegiving rootfaith in god    xxvdavids education    made perfect through sufferingshebrews ii 10  that is my text and a very fit one for another sermon about david the king after gods own heart  and a very fit one too for any sermon preached to people living in this world now or at any time a melancholy text you will say  but what if it be melancholy that is not the fault of me the preacher  the preacher did not make suffering did not make disappointment doubt ignorance mistakes oppression poverty sickness  there they are whether we like it or not  you have only to go on to the common here or any other common or town in england to see too much of themenough to break ones heart if but i will not hurry on too fast in what i have to say what i want to make you recollect is that misery is here round us in us  a great deal which we bring on ourselves and a great deal more misery which we do not as far as we can see bring on ourselves but which comes nevertheless and lets us know plainly enough that it is close to us  every man and woman of us have their sorrows  there is no use shutting our eyes just when we ourselves happen to feel tolerably easy and saying as too many do i dont see so very much sorrow i am happy enough  are you friend happy enough  so much the worse for you perhaps  but at all events your neighbours are not happy enough most of them are only too miserable it is a sad world  a sad world and full of tears  it is  and you must not be angry with the preacher for reminding you of what is  true you would have a right to quarrel with the preacher or anyone else who made you sorrowful with the thoughts of the sorrow round you and then gave you no explanation of ittold you of no use no blessing in it no deliverance from it  that would be enough to break any mans heart if all the preacher could say was  this wretchedness and sickness and death must go on as long as the world lasts and yet it does no good for god or man  that thought would drive any feeling man to despair tempt him to lie down and die tempt him to fancy that god was not god at all not the god whose name is love not the god who is our father but only a cruel taskmaster and lord of a miserable hell on earth where men and women and worst of all little children were tortured daily by tens of thousands without reason or use or hope of deliverance except in a future world where not one in ten of them will be saved and happy  that is many peoples notion of the worldreligious peoples even  how they can believe in the face of such notions that god is love how they can help going mad with pity if that is all the hope they have for poor human beings is more than i can tell  not that i judge themto their own master they stand or fall  but this i do say that if the preacher has no better hope to give you about this poor earth then i cannot tell what right he has to call himself a preacher of the gospelthat is a preacher of good news then i do not know what jesus christs dying to take away the sins of the world means then i do not know what the kingdom of god means then i do not know why the lord taught us to pray thy kingdom come thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven if the only way in which that can be brought about is by his sending ninetynine hundredths of mankind to endless torture over and above all the lesser misery which they have suffered in this life  what will be the end of the greater part of mankind we do not know we were not intended to know god is love and god is justice and his justice is utterly loving as well as his love utterly just so we may very safely leave the world in the hands of him who made the world and be sure that the judge of all the earth will do right and that what is right is certain never to be cruel but rather merciful  but to every one of you who are here now a preacher has a right ay and a bounden duty to say much more than that  he is bound to tell you good news because god has called you into his church and sent you here this day to hear good news  he has a right to tell you as i tell you now that strange as it may seem whatsoever sufferings you endure are sent to make you perfect even as your father in heaven is perfect even as the blessed lord whom may you all love and trust and worship for ever and ever was made perfect by sufferings even though he was the sinless son of god  consider that  it behoved him says st paul the captain of our salvation to be made perfect through sufferings  and why  because answers st paul it was proper for him to be made in all things like his brothers like us the children of godthat he might be a faithful and merciful high priest for just because he has suffered being tempted he is able to succour us who are tempted  a strange text but one which i think this very history of davids troubles will help us to understand  for it was by suffering long and bitter that god trained up david to be a true king a king over the jews after gods own heart  you all know i hope something at least of davids psalms  many of them seven of them at least were written during davids wanderings in the mountains when saul was persecuting him to kill him day after day month after month as you may read in the first book of samuel from chapters xix to xxviii  bitter enough these troubles of david would have been to any man but what must have made them especially bitter and confusing to him was that they all arose out of his righteousness  because he had conquered the giant saul envied himbroke his promise of giving david his daughter merabput his life into extreme danger from the philistines before he would give him his second daughter michal the more he saw that the lord was with david and that the young man won respect and admiration by behaving himself wisely the more afraid of him saul was again and again he tried to kill him as david was sitting harmless in sauls house soothing the poor madman by the music of his harp saul tries to stab him unawares and not content with that proceeds deliberately to hunt him down from town to town and wilderness to wilderness sends soldiers after him to murder him at last goes out after him himself with his guards  was not all this enough to try davids faith  hardly any man i suppose since the world was made had found righteousness pay him less no man was ever more tempted to turn round and do evil since doing good only brought him deeper and deeper into the mire  but no we know that he did not lose his trust in god for we have seven psalms at least which he wrote during these very wanderings of his the fiftysecond when doeg had betrayed him to saul the fiftyfourth when ziphim betrayed him the fiftysixth when the philistines took him in gath the fifty seventh when he fled from saul in the cave the fiftyninth when they watched the house to kill him the sixtythird when he was in the wilderness of judah the thirtyfourth when he was driven away by abimelech and several more which appear to have been written about the same time  now what strikes us first or ought to strike us in these psalms is davids utter faith in god  i do not mean to say that david had not his sad days when he gave himself up for lost and when god seemed to have forsaken him and forgotten his promise  he was a man of like passions with ourselves and therefore he was as we should have been terrified and fainthearted at times  but exactly what god was teaching and training him to be was not to be fainthearted not to be terrified  he began in his youth by trusting god  that made him the man after gods own heart just as it was the want of trust in god which made saul not the man after gods own heart and lost him his kingdom  in all those wanderings and dangers of davids in the wilderness god was training and educating and strengthening davids faith according to his great law  to whomsoever hath shall be given and he shall have more abundantly but from him that hath not shall be taken away even that which he seems to have  and the first great fruit of davids firm trust in god was his patience  he learned to wait gods time and take gods way and be sure that the same god who had promised that he should be king would make him king when he saw fit  he knew as he says himself that the strength of israel could not lie or repent  he had sworn that he would not fail david  and he learned that god had sworn by his holiness  he was a holy just righteous god and david and davids country now were safe in his hands  it was his firm trust in god which gave him strength of mind to use no unfair means to right himself  twice saul his enemy was in his power  what a temptation to him to kill saul rid himself of his tormentor and perhaps get the kingdom at once  but no  he felt  this saul is a wicked deviltormented murderer a cruel tyrant and oppressor but the same god who chose me to be king next chose him to be king now  he is the lords anointed  god put him where he is and leaves him there for some good purpose and when god has done with him god will take him away and free this poor oppressed people and in the meantime i as a private man have no right to touch him  i must not do evil that good may come  if i am to be a true king a true man at all hereafter i must keep true now if i am to be a righteous lawgiver hereafter i must respect and obey law myself now  the lord be judge between me and saul for he is judge and he will right me better than i can ever right myself  and thus did trust in god bring out in david that true respect for law without which a king let him be as kindhearted as he will is but too likely to become at last a tyrant and an oppressor  but another thing which strikes any thinking man in davids psalms is his strong feeling for the poor and the afflicted and the oppressed  that is what makes the psalms above all the poor mans book the afflicted mans book  but how did he get that fellow feeling for the fallen  by having fallen himself and tasted affliction and oppression  that was how he was educated to be a true king  that was how he became a picture and patterna type as some call it of jesus christ the man of sorrows  that is why so many of davids psalms apply so well to the lord why the lord fulfilled those psalms when he was on earth  david was truly a man of sorrows for he had not only the burden of his own sorrows to bear but that of many others  his parents had to escape and to be placed in safety at the court of a heathen prince  his friend abimelech the priest because he gave david bread when he was starving and goliaths swordwhich after all was davids ownwas murdered by sauls hired ruffians at sauls command and with him his whole family and all the priests of the town with their wives and children even to the baby at the breast  and when david was in the mountains everyone who was distressed and in debt and discontented gathered themselves to him and he became their captain so that he had on him all the responsibility care and anxiety of managing all those wild starving men many of them perhaps reckless and wicked men ready every day to quarrel among themselves or to break out in open riot and robbery against the people who had oppressed them forand this too we may see from davids psalms was not the smallest part of his anxietythe nation of the jews seems to have been in a very wretched state in davids time  the poor seem in general to have lost their land and to have become all but slaves to rich nobles who were grinding them down not only by luxury and covetousness but often by open robbery and bloodshed  the sight of the misrule and misery as well as of the bloody and ruinous border inroads which were kept up by the philistines and other neighbouring tribes seems for years to have been the uppermost as well as the deepest thought in davids mind if we may judge from those psalms of his of which this is the key note and it was not likely to make him care and feel less about all that misery when he remembered as we see from his psalms he remembered daily that god had set him the wandering outlaw no less a task than to mend it all to put down all that oppression to raise up that degradation to train all that cowardice into selfrespect and valour to knit into one united nation bound together by fellow feeling and common faith in god that mob of fierce and greedy and hardest task of all as he himself felt utterly deceitful men  no wonder that his psalms begin often enough with sadness even though they may end in hope and trust  he had a work around him and before him which ought to have made his heart sad which was a great part of his appointed education and helped to make him perfect by sufferings  and so upon the bare hillside in woods and caves of the earth in cold and hunger in weariness and dread of death did david learn to be the poor mans king the poor mans poet the singer of those psalms which shall endure as long as the world endures and be the comfort and the utterance of all sad hearts for evermore  agony it was deep and bitter and for the moment more hopeless than the grave itself which crushed out of the very depths of his heart that most awful and yet most blessed psalm the twentysecond which we read in church every good friday  the hind of the morning is its title some mournful air to which david sang it giving perhaps the notion of a timorous deer roused in the morning by the hunters and the hounds  we read that psalm on good friday and all say that our lord jesus christ fulfilled it  what do we mean hereby  we mean hereby that we believe that our lord jesus christ fulfilled all sorrows which man can taste  he filled the cup of misery to the brim and drained it to the dregs  he was afflicted in all davids afflictions in the afflictions of all mankind  he bare all their sicknesses and carried all their infirmities and therefore we read this psalm upon good friday upon the day in which he tasted death for every man and went down into the lowest depths of terror and shame and agony and death and worst of all into the feeling that god had forsaken him that there was no help or hope for him in heaven as well as earthno care or love in the great god whose son he waswent down in a word into hell that hell whereof david and heman and hezekiah after them had said shall the dust give thanks unto thee and shall it declare thy truththou wilt not leave my soul in hell neither wilt thou suffer thy holy one to see corruptionmy life draweth nigh unto hell    i am like one stript among the dead like the slain that lie in the grave whom thou rememberest no more and they are cut off from thy hand    wilt thou show wonders to the dead and shall the dead arise and praise thee  shall thy wonders be known in the dark and thy righteousness in the land of destructionfor the grave cannot praise thee death cannot celebrate thee  they that go down to the pit cannot hope for thy truth  even into that lowest darkness where man feels even for one moment that god is nothing to him and he is nothing to godeven into that jesus condescended to go down for us  that worst of all temptations of which david only tasted a drop when he cried out my god my god why hast thou forsaken me  jesus drained to the very dregs for us he went down into hell for us and conquered hell and death and the darkness of the unknown world and rose again glorious from them that he might teach us not to fear death and hell that he might know how to comfort us in the hour of death  and in the day of judgment when on our sick bed or in some bitter shame and trouble the lying devil is telling us that we are damned and lost and forsaken by god and every sin we ever did rises up and stares us in the face  truly he is a kinga king for rich and poor young and old englishmen and negro all alike he knows them he feels for them he has tasted sorrow for them far more than david did for those poor oppressed sinful jews of his  read those psalms of david for they speak not only of david now long since dead and gone but of the blessed jesus who lives and reigns over us now at this very moment read them for they are inspired the honest words of a servant of god crying out to the same god the same saviour and deliverer as we have  and his love has not changed  his arm is not shortened that he cannot save  your words need not change  the words of those psalms in which david prayed in them you and i may pray  right out of the depths of his poor distracted heart they came  let them come out of our hearts too  they belong to us more than even they did to the jews for whom david wrote themmore than even they did to david himself for jesus has fulfilled themfilled them fullgiven them boundlessly more meaning than ever they had before and given us more hope in using them than ever david had  for now that love and righteousness of god in which david only trusted beforehand has come down and walked on this earth in the shape of a poor man jesus christ the son of the maiden of bethlehem  oh you who are afflicted pray to god in those psalms not merely in the words of them but in the spirit of them  and to do that you must get from god the spirit in which david wrote themthe spirit of god  pray for that spirit for the spirit of patience which made david wait gods good time to right him instead of trying as too many do to right himself by wrong means for the spirit of love which taught david to return good for evil for the spirit of fellow feeling which taught david to care for others as well as himself and in that spirit of love do you pray for others while you are praying for yourself  pray for that spirit which taught david to help and comfort those who were weaker than himself that you in your time may be able and willing to comfort and help those who are weaker than yourselves  and above all pray for the spirit of faith which made david certain that oppression and wrongdoing could not stand that the day must surely come when god would judge the world righteously and hear the cry of the afflicted and deliver the outcast and poor that the man of the world might be no more exalted against them  pray in short for the spirit of christ and then be sure he will hear your prayers and answer them and show himself a better friend and a truer king to you than ever david showed himself to those poor jews of old  he will deliver you out of all your troublesif not in this life yet surely in the life to come and though you walk through the valley of the shadow of death yet the peace of god shall keep your hearts and minds in him who loved you and gave himself for you that you might inherit all heaven and earth in him    xxvithe value of law    let every soul be subject unto the higher powers  for there is no power but of god  the powers that be are ordained of godromans xiii 1  what is the difference between a civilised man and a savage  you will say  a civilised man can read and write he has books and education he knows how to make numberless things which makes his life comfortable to him  he can get wealth and build great towns sink mines sail the sea in ships spread himself over the face of the earth or bring home all its treasures while the savages remain poor and naked and miserable and ignorant fixed to the land in which they chance to have been born  true  but we must go a little deeper still  why does the savage remain poor and wretched while the civilised people become richer and more prosperous  why for instance do the poor savage gipsies never grow more comfortable or wisereach generation of them remaining just as low as their forefathers were or indeed getting lower and fewer for the gipsies like all savages are becoming fewer and fewer year by year while on the other hand we english increase in numbers and in wealth and knowledge and fresh inventions are found out year by year which give fresh employment and make life more safe and more pleasant  this is the reason  that the english have laws and obey them and the gipsies have none  this is the whole secret  this is why savages remain poor and miserable that each man does what he likes without law  this is why civilised nations like england thrive and prosper because they have laws and obey them and every man does not do what he likes but what the law likes  laws are made not for the good of one person here or the other person there but for the good of all and therefore the very notion of a civilised country is a country in which people cannot do what they like with their own as the savages do  not do what he likes with his own  certainly not no one can or does  if you have property you cannot spend it all as you like  you have to pay a part of it to the government that is into the common stock for the common good in the shape of rates and taxes before you can spend any of it on yourself  if you take wages you cannot spend them all upon yourself and do what you like with them  if you do not support your wife and family out of them the law will punish you  you cannot do what you like with your own gun for you may not shoot your neighbours cattle or game with it you cannot do what you like with your own hands for the law forbids you to steal with them  you cannot do what you like with your own feet for the law will punish you for trespassing on your neighbours ground without his leave  in short you can only do with your own what will not hurt your neighbour in such matters as the law can take care of  and more in any great necessity the law may actually hurt you for the good of the nation at large  the law may compel you to sell your land to your own injury if it is wanted for a railroad  the law may compel you as it did fifty years ago to serve as a soldier in the militia to your own injury if there is a fear of foreign invasion so that the law is above each and all of us  our own wills are not our masters  no man is his own master the law is the master of each and all of us and if we will not obey it willingly it can make us obey unwillingly  can make us  ay but ought it to make us  is it right that the law should override our own free wills and prevent our doing what we like with our own  it is rightabsolutely right  st paul tells us what gives law this authority  there is no power but of god  the powers that be are ordained of god  and he tells us also why this authority is given to the law  rulers he says are not a terror to good works but to evil  wilt thou then not be afraid of those who administer the law  do that which is good and thou shalt have praise from them for they are gods ministers to thee for good  for good you see  for the good of mankind it was that god put into their hearts and reasons that notion of making laws and appointing kings and magistrates to see that those laws are obeyed  for our good  for without law no mans life or family or property would be safe  every mans private selfishness and greediness and anger would struggle without check to have its way and there would be no bar or curb to keep each and every man from injuring each and every man else so the strong would devour the weak and then tear each other in pieces afterwards  so it is among the savages  they have little or no property for they have no laws to protect property and therefore every man expects his neighbour to steal from him and finds it his shortest plan to steal from his neighbour instead of settling down to sow corn which he will have no chance of eating or build houses which may be taken from him at night by some more strong and cunning savage  there is no law among savages to protect women and children against the men and therefore the women are treated worse than beasts and the children murdered to save the trouble of rearing them  every mans hand is against his neighbour  no one feels himself safe and therefore no one thinks it worth while to lay up for the morrow  no one expects justice and mercy to be done to him and therefore no one thinks it worth while to do justice and mercy to others  and thus they live in continual fear and quarrelling feeding like wild animals on game or roots often when they have bad luck in their hunting on offal which our dogs would refuse and dwindle away and become fewer and wretcheder year by year in this way do the savages in new south wales live to this day for want of law  it is for our good then that god has put into the heart of man to make laws and to obey them as sacred and divine things  for our good in order to save us from sinking down into the same state of poverty and misery in which the savages are  for our good because we are fallen creatures with selfish and corrupt wills continually apt to break loose and please ourselves at the expense of our neighbours  for our good because however fallen we are we are still brothers members of gods family bound to each other by duty and relationship if not by love  just as in a family if parents brothers and sisters will not do their duty to each other lovingly and of their free will the law interferes and the custom of the country interferes and the opinion of neighbours interferes and says  you may not love your parents but you have no right to leave them to starve  you may not love your brothers  but if you try to injure and slander them you are doing an unnatural and hateful thing abhorred by god and man and you must expect us to treat you accordingly as a wild beast who does not feel the common laws of nature and right and wrong  so with the law of the land  the law is meant to remind us more or less that we are brothers members of one body that we owe a duty to each other that we are all equal in gods sight who is no respecter of persons or of rank or of riches any more than the law is when it punishes the greatest nobleman as severely as the poorest labourer  the law is meant to remind us that god is just that when we injure each other we sin against god that gods rule and law is that each transgression should receive its just reward and that therefore because man is made in the likeness of god man is bound as far as he can to visit every offence with due and proportionate punishment and the law punishes as st paul says in gods name and for gods sake  the magistrate is a witness for gods righteous government of the world the minister of gods vengeance against evildoers to remind all continually that evildoing has no place and cannot prosper and must not be allowed upon this gods earth whereon we live  but what if the laws are unfair and punish only some sorts of evil doers and not others  what if they are like spiders webs which catch the little flies and let the great wasps break through  what if they punish poor and weak offenders and let the rich and powerful sinners escape  obey them still says st paul  in his time and country the laws were as unfair in that way as laws ever were and yet he tells christians to obey them for consciences sake  thank god that they do punish weak offenders  pray god that the time may come when they may be strong enough to punish great offenders also but in the meantime see that they have not to punish you  as far as the laws go they are right and good  as far as they keep down any sort of wrongdoing whatsoever they are gods ordinances and you must obey them for gods sake  but what if the laws are not only unfair and partial but also unjust and wrong  are we to obey them then  obey them still says st paul  of course if they command you to do a clearly wrong thing if for instance the law commanded you to worship idols or to commit adultery there is no question then such laws cannot be gods ordinance  the laws can only be gods ordinance as far as they agree with what we know of gods will written in our hearts and written in his holy bible  then a man must resist the law to the death if need be as the old martyrs did dying as witnesses for gods righteous and eternal law against mans false and unrighteous law  it is a very difficult thing no doubt to tell where to draw the line in such matters  but we thank god here in england now have no need to puzzle our heads with such questions  every mans conscience is free here and he has full liberty to worship god as he thinks best provided that by so doing he does not interfere with his neighbours character or property or comfort  there is no single law in england now that i know of which a man has any need to refuse to obey let his conscience be as tender as it may  and as for laws which we think hurtful to the country or hurtful to any particular class in the country our thinking them hurtful is no reason that we should not obey them  as long as they are law they are gods ordinance and we have no right to break them  they may be useful after all  or even if they are hurtful in some way still god may be bringing good out of them in some other way of which we little dream as he has often done out of laws and customs which seem at first sight most foolish and hurtful and yet which he endured and winked at for the sake of bringing good out of evil  at all events whatsoever laws are here in england are made by the men whom we english have chosen as the men most fit and wise to make them and we are bound to abide by them  if parliament is not wise enough to make perfectly good laws that is no ones fault but our own for if we were wise we should choose wise lawmakers and we must be filled with the fruit of our own devices  as long as these laws have been made and passed by commons lords and queen according to the ancient forms and constitution which god has taught our forefathers from time to time for more than a thousand years and which have had gods blessing and favour on them and made us from the least of all nations the greatest nation on the earth in short as long as those laws are made according to law so long we are bound to believe them to be gods ordinance and obey them  but understand that is no reason why we should not try to get them improved for when they are changed and done away according to the same law which made them that will be a sign that they are gods ordinances no longer that god thinks we have no more need for them and does not require us to keep them  but as long as any law is what st paul calls the powers that be obeyed it must be not only for wrath but for consciences sake  that is a very important part of the matter  obey the law st paul says not only for wrath that is not only for fear of punishment but for consciences sake  even if you do not expect to be punished even if you think no one will ever find out that you have broken the law remember it is gods ordinance  he sees you  do not hurt your own conscience and deaden your own sense of right and wrong by breaking the least or the most unjust law in the slightest point  for instance  some people think the incometax is very unfair and therefore they think there is no harm in cheating the revenue a little by making out their income less than it is  others again think the laws against smuggling unjust and harsh and therefore they see no harm in trying to avoid paying duty on goods which they bring home whenever they have an opportunity or buying cheap goods which they must know from their price are smuggled  others again think the game laws are unfair and therefore see no harm in going out shooting on their own lands without a licence while many see no harm or say they see no harm in poaching on other peoples grounds and killing game contrary to law wherever they can  that it is wrong to break the law in these two first cases you all know in your own hearts  on the matter of poaching some of you i know have many very mistaken notions  but my friends i ask you only to look at the sin and misery which poaching causes if you want to see that those who break the law do indeed break the ordinance of god and that gods laws avenge themselves  look at the idleness the untidiness the deceit the bad company the drunkenness the misery and sin to man woman and child which that same poaching brings about and then see how one little sin brings on many great ones how a man by despising the authority of law and fancying that he does no harm in disobeying the laws from his own fancy about poaching being no harm falls into temptation and a snare and pierces himself through with many sorrows  my young friends believe my words avoid poaching even once in a way  the beginning of sin is like the letting out of water no one can tell where it will stop  he who breaks the law in little things will be tempted to go on and break it in greater and greater things  he who begins by breaking mans law which is the pattern of gods law will be tempted to go on and break gods law also  is it not so  there is no use telling me the game is no ones there is no harm in taking it  light words of that kind will not do to answer god with  you know there is harm in taking it for you know as well as i do that you cannot go after game without neglecting your work to get it or without going to the worst of publichouses among the worst of company to sell it  you know as well as i do that hand in hand with poaching go lying and idling and sneaking and fear and boasting and swearing and drinking and the company of bad men and bad women  and then you say there is no harm in poaching  do you suppose that i do not know as well as any one of you here what goes to the snaring of a hare and the selling of a hare and the spending of the illgot price of a hare  my dear young men i know that poaching like many other sins is tempting  but god has told us to flee from temptationto resist the devil and he will flee from us  if we are to give up ourselves without a struggle to every pleasant thing which tempts us we shall soon be at the devils door  we were sent into the world to fight against temptation and to conquer it  we were sent into the world to do what god likes not what we like and therefore we were sent into the world to obey the laws of the land wherein we live be they better or worse because if we break one law because we dont like it our neighbour may break another because he dont like that and so forth till there is neither law nor peace nor safety but every man doing what is right in his own eyes which is sure to end by every mans doing what is right in the devils eyes  we were sent into the world to live as brothers under laws which make us give up our own wills and selfish lusts for the common good  and if we find it difficult to keep the laws if we are tempted to break the laws god has promised his spirit to those who ask him  god has promised his spirit to us  if we pray for that spirit night and morning he will make it easy for us to keep the laws  he will make us what our lord was before us humble patient loving manful and strong enough to restrain our fancies and appetites and to give up our wills for the good of our neighbours anxious and careful to avoid all appearance of evil trusting that because god is just and god is king all laws which are not wicked are his ordinance and therefore being obedient to every ordinance of man for the lords sake even as jesus christ himself was who though he was lord of all paid taxes and tribute money to the roman government like the rest of the jews and kept the law of moses perfectly and was baptised with johns baptism to show that in all just and reasonable things we are to obey the laws and customs of our forefathers in the country to which it has pleased the lord that we should belong    xxviithe source of law    let every soul be subject unto the higher powers  for there is no power but of god  the powers that be are ordained of godromans xiii 1  in this chapter which we read for the second lesson for this afternoons service st paul gives good advice to the romans and equally good advice to us  of course what he says must be equally good for us and for all people at all times in all countries as long as time shall last because st paul spoke by the spirit of god who is god eternal and therefore cannot change his mind but lays down by the mouth of his apostles and prophets the everlasting laws of right and wrong which are always equally good for all  but there is something in this lesson which makes it especially useful to us because we english are in some very important matters very like the romans to whom st paul wrote though in others thanks to almighty god we are still very unlike them  now these old romans as i have often told you had risen to be the greatest and mightiest people in the world and to conquer many foreign countries and set up colonies of romans in them very much as the english have done in india and north america and australia so that the little country of italy with its one great city of rome was mistress of vast lands far beyond the seas ten times as large as itself just as this little england is  but it is not so much this which i have to speak to you about now as how this rome became so great for it was at first nothing but a poor little country town without money armies trade or any of those things which shallowminded people fancy are the great strength of a nation  true all those things are good but they are useless and hurtfuland what is more they cannot be gotwithout something better than them something which you cannot see nor handle something spiritual which is the life and heart of a country or nation and without which it can never become great  this the old romans had and it made them become great  this we english have had for now fifteen hundred years even when our forefathers were heathens like the romans before we came into this good land of england while we were poor and simple people living in the barren moors of germany and the snowy mountains of norway even then we had this wonderful charm by which nations are sure to become great and powerful at last and in proportion as we have remembered and acted upon it we english have thriven and spread and whenever we have forgotten it and broken it we have fallen into distress and poverty and shame over the whole land  now what is this wonderful charm which made the old romans and we english great which is stronger than money and armies and trade and all the things which we can see and handle  st paul tells us in the text  let every soul be subject to the higher powers  for there is no power but of god  the powers that be are ordained of god  to respect the law to believe that god wills men to live according to law and that he will teach men right and good laws that magistrates who enforce the laws are gods ministers gods officers and servants that to break the laws is to sin against godthat is the charm which worked such wonders and will work them to the end of time  so you see it was a very proper thing for st paul when he wrote to these romans after they became christians to speak to them as he does in this chapter  they might have fancied and many did fancy that because they were jesus christs servants now they need not obey their heathen rulers and laws any more  but st paul says no jesus christs being king of kings is only the strongest possible reason for your obeying these heathen rulers  for if he is king of all the earth he is king of rome also and of all her colonies and therefore you may be sure that he would not leave these roman rulers and laws here if he did not think it right and fitting if jesus christ is lord of lords he is lord of these roman rulers and they are his ministers and stewards and you must obey them and pay taxes to them for consciences sake as unto the lord and not unto man  so you see that st paul gave these roman christians no new commandment on these matters nothing different from what their old heathen forefathers had believed  for the law which he mentions in verse 9 thou shalt not kill thou shalt not steal etc had been for centuries past part of the old roman law as well as of moses law  those old heathen romans believed and rightly that all law and order came from the great god of gods whom they called in their tongue jupiter that is the heavenly father  they believed that he would bless those who kept the laws who kept their oaths and agreements and the laws about government about marriage about property about inheritance and that he would surely punish those who broke the laws who defrauded their neighbours of their rights who swore falsely against their neighbour or broke their agreements who were unfaithful to their wives and husbands or in any way offended against justice between man and man  and they believed too and rightly that as long as they kept the laws and lived justly and orderly by them the great heavenly father would protect and prosper their town of rome and make it grow great and powerful because they were living as he would have men live not doing each what was right in the sight of his own eyes but conquering their own selfish wills and private fancies for the sake of their neighbours good and the good of his country that they might all help and trust each other as fellowcitizens of one nation  only st paul had told them  your forefathers were right in fancying that law and right came from the great god of gods  but they knew hardly anything or rather in time they forgot almost everything about that heavenly father  in their ignorance they mixed up the belief in the one great almighty and good god which dwells in the hearts of all men with filthy fables and superstitions till they came to fancy that there were many gods and not one and that these many gods were sinful foul proud and cruel as fallen men  but you have been brought back to the knowledge of the one true and righteous and loving god which your forefathers lost  he has revealed and shown himself and what he is like in his son jesus christ  he is love and wisdom and justice and order itself and therefore you must be sure even more sure than your old heathen forefathers that he cares for a nation being at peace and unity within itself governed by wise laws doing justice between man and man and keeping order throughout all its business that every man may do his work and enjoy his wages without hindrance or confusion or fear or robbery and oppression from those who are stronger than he  and so st paul says to them  you must believe that power and law come from god far more firmly and clearly than ever your heathen forefathers did  now that st paul was right in this we may see from the old testament  in the first lesson for this afternoons service we read how jeremiah was sent with the most awful warnings to the king and the queen and the crown prince of his country  and why  because they had broken the laws because in a word they had been unfaithful stewards and ministers of the lord god who had given them their power and kingdom and would demand a strict account of all which he had committed to their charge  but in the same book of the prophet jeremiah we read more than this we read exactly what st paul says about the heathen roman governors  for the lord god who is the lord jesus christ sent jeremiah with a message to all the heathen kings round about to tell them that he was their lord and master that he had given them their power heathens as they were because it seemed fit to him and that now for their sins he was going to deliver them over into the hand of another heathen his servant nebuchadnezzar king of babylon and that whosoever would not serve nebuchadnezzar the lord god would punish him with sword and famine and pestilence till he had consumed them  and the first four chapters of the book of daniel noble and wonderful as they are seem to me to have been put into the bible simply to teach us this one thing that heathen rulers as well as christians are the lords servants and that their power is ordained by god  for these chapters are entirely made up of the history how god by his prophet daniel taught the heathen king nebuchadnezzar that he was gods minister and steward  and the latter part of the book of daniel is the account of his teaching the same thing to another heathen cyrus the great and good king of persia  and here st paul teaches the christian romans just the same thing about their heathen governors and heathen laws that they are the ministers and the ordinance of god  now our own english forefathers as i said before believed this same thing and if i had time i could show you i think plainly enough from gods dealings with england how he has blest and prospered us whensoever we have acted up to it  but whether we have believed it or not there is enough in our english laws and in our english prayer book too to witness for it and remind us of it  the very title which we give the queen queen by the grace of god the solemn prayers for her when she is crowned and anointed not in her own palace or in the house of parliament but in the church of god at westminster the prayers which we have just offered up for the queen for the government and for the magistratesthese are all so many signs and tokens to us that they are gods stewards called to do gods work and that we must pray for gods grace to help them to fulfil their calling  and are not those ten commandments which stand in every church a witness of the same thing  they are the very root of all law whatsoever  and more the solemn oath which a witness takes in the court of justice what is it but a sign of the same thing that our forefathers who appointed these forms believed that law and justice were holy things and that he who goes into a court of law goes into the presence of god himself and confesses when he promises to speak the truth so help him god that god is the protector and the avenger of law and justice  but some people and especially young and lighthearted persons are ready to say  obey the powers that be whosoever they may be good or bad and believe that to break their laws is to sin against god we might as well be slaves at once  a man has a right to his own opinion and if he does not think a law good how can he be bound to obey it  you will often hear such words as those when you go out into the world into great towns where men meet together much  let me give you young people a little advice about that beforehand for fine as it sounds it is hollow and false at root  if you wish to be really free and to do what you like like what is right and do that says st paul and then the law will not interfere with you  for rulers are not a terror to good works but to the evil  wilt thou then not be afraid of the power  do that which is good and thou shalt have praise of the same  for he is the minister of god to thee for good  but if thou do that which is evil be afraid for he beareth not the sword in vain  for he is the minister of god a revenger to execute wrath upon him that doeth evil  and then he sums up what doing right is in one short sentence  love thy neighbour as thyself for love is the fulfilling of the law  all that the laws want to make you do is to behave like men who do love their neighbours as themselves and therefore do them no harmto behave like men who are ready to give up their own private wills and pleasures and even their own private property if wanted for the good of their neighbours and their country therefore the law calls on you to pay rates and taxes which are to be spent for the good of the nation at large  and if you love your neighbour as yourself and have the good of everyone round you at heart you will no more grudge paying rates and taxes for their benefit than you will grudge spending money to support and educate your own children  and so you will be free free to do what you like because you like from the fear and love of god to do those right things which the law is set to make you do  but some may say  that is not what we mean by being free  we mean having a share in choosing members of parliament and so in making the laws and governing the country  when people can do that the country is a free country  well my friends and it is a strange thing or rather not a strange thing if we will but study our bibles that a country cannot be free in that way unless the people of it do really believe that the powers that be are ordained of god  instead of that faith making the old romans slavish or careless what laws were made or how they were governed as some fancy it would make a people they were as free a people and freer almost than we english now  they chose their own magistrates and they made their own laws and prospered by so doing and why  because they believed that laws came from god and therefore they not only obeyed the laws when they were made but they had heart and spirit to help to make them because they trusted that the heavenly father who loved justice would teach them to be just and that the god who protected laws and punished lawbreakers would put into their minds how to make the laws well and so they were not afraid to govern themselves because they believed that god would enable them to govern themselves well and therefore they were free  and so far from their having a slavish spirit in them they were the most bold and independent people of the whole earth  their soldiers conquered almost every nation against whom they fought because they always obeyed their officers dutifully and faithfully believing that it was their duty to god to obey and to die if need was for their country  old history is full of tales which will never be forgotten i trust till the worlds end of the noble deeds of their men ay and even of their women who counted their own lives worthless in comparison with the good of their country and died in torments rather than break the laws or do what they knew would injure the people to whom they belonged  and so with us english  for hundreds of years we have been growing more and more free and more and more wellgoverned simply because we have been acting on st pauls doctrineobeying the powers that be because they are ordained by god  it is the englishmans respect for law as a sacred thing which he dare not break which has made him sooner or later respected and powerful wherever he goes to settle in foreign lands because foreigners can trust us to be just and to keep our promises and to abide by the laws which we have laid down  it is the english respect for law as a sacred thing which has made our armies among the bravest and the most successful on earth because they know how to obey their officers and are therefore able to fight and to endure as men should do  and as long as we hold to that belief we shall prosper at home and abroad and become more and more free and more and more strong because we shall be united helping each other trusting each other knowing what to expect of each other because we all honour and obey the same laws  and on the other hand have we not close to us in france a fearful sign and proof from god that without the fear of god no people can be free  three times in the last sixty years have the french risen up against evil rulers and driven them out  and have they been the better for it  they are at this very moment in utter slavery to a ruler more lawless than ever oppressed them before  and why because they did not believe that law came from god and that the powers that be are ordained by him  therefore whenever they were oppressed they did not try to right themselves by lawful ways according to the old english godfearing custom but to break down the old law by riot and bloodshed and then to set up new laws of their own  but those new laws would never stand  they made them but they would not obey them when they were made and they could not make others obey them because they had no real reverence for law and did not believe that law came from god or that his spirit would give them understanding to make good laws  they talked loud about the power and rights of the people and that whatever the people willed was right  but they said nothing about the power and rights of the lord god they forgot that it is only what god has willed from everlasting that is right and so they made laws in the strength of their own hearts according to what was right in the sight of their own eyes to please themselves  how could they respect the laws when the laws were only copies of their own selfish fancies  so because they made them to please themselves they soon broke them to please themselves  and so came more lawlessness and riot and confusion worse confounded till of course the strongest and cunningest and most shameless got the upper hand and they were plunged poor creatures into the same pit of misery out of which they had been trying to deliver themselves in their own strength for a sign and an example that the lord is king and not man at all and that the fear of the lord is the only beginning of wisdom  and very much the same sad fate had happened to the romans a little before st pauls time  they gave up their ancient respect for law they broke the laws and ran into all kinds of violence and riot and filthy sin and therefore god took away their freedom from them because they were not fit for it and delivered them over into the hand of one cruel tyrant after another and perhaps the cruellest of them all was the man who was emperor of rome in st pauls time therefore it was that st paul says to them  love each other and obey the laws knowing the time that now it is high time to awake out of sleep  as much as to say  your souls have fallen asleep you have been in a dark night not seeing that god would avenge you of all these sins of yours that gods eye was on them  you have fallen asleep and forgotten your forefathers belief that god loves law and order and justice and will punish those who break through them  but now the lord jesus the light of the world is come to awaken you and to open your eyes to see the truth about this and to show you that you are in gods kingdom and that god commands you to repent and to obey him and do justly and righteously  therefore awake out of your sleep give up the works of darkness those mean and wicked habits which were contrary to the good old laws of your forefathers and which you were at heart ashamed of and tried to hide even while you indulged in them  open your eyes and see that god is near you your judge your king seeing through and through your souls keen and sharp to discern the secret thoughts and intents of the heart so that all things are naked and open in the sight of him with whom we have to do  and so i may say to you my friends it is high time for us to awake out of sleep  the people in england religious as well as others have fallen asleep of late years too much about this matter  they have forgotten that god is king that magistrates are gods ministers  they talk as if laws were meant to be only the device of mans will to serve mens private interests and selfishness and therefore they have lost very much of their respect for law and their care to make good laws for the future  and it is high time for us while all the nations of europe are tottering and crumbling round us to awake out of sleep on this matter  we must open our eyes and see where we are  for we are in gods kingdom  gods bible gods churches gods commandments and all the solemn old law forms of england witness to us that god is king set in the throne which judges right that order and justice fellowfeeling and public spirit are his gifts his likeness on which he looks down with loving care and protection and that if we forget that and begin to fancy that law stands merely by the will of the many or by the will of the stronger or even by the will of the wiserby any will of man in short we shall end by neither being able to make just laws any more nor to obey those which we have by the blessing of god already    xxviiithe education of a heathen    now i nebuchadnezzar praise and extol and honour the king of heaven all whose works are truth and his ways judgment and those that walk in pride he is able to abasedaniel iv 37  we read for the first lesson today two chapters out of the book of daniel  those who love to study their bibles have read often of course not only these two chapters but the whole book  and i would advise all of you who wish to understand gods dealings with mankind to study this book of daniel and especially at this present time  i do not wish you to study it merely on account of those prophecies in it which many wise and good men think foretell the dates of our lords first and second comings and of the end of the world  i am not skilled my friends in that kind of wisdom  i cannot tell you what god will do hereafter  but i think that the book of daniel like the other prophets tells us what god is always doing on earth and so gives us certain and eternal rules by which we may understand strange and terrible events wars distress of nations the fall of great men and the suffering of innocent men when we see them happen as we may see any dayperhaps very soon indeed  the great lesson i think that this book of daniel teaches us is that god is not the lord of the jews only or of christians only but of the whole earth that the heathens are under his moral law and government as well as we and that as st peter says god is no respecter of persons  but in every nation he that feareth god and worketh righteousness is accepted of him  for the history of nebuchadnezzar seems to me to be the history of gods educating a heathen and an idolater to know him  and we must always remember that as far as we can see it was because nebuchadnezzar was faithful to the light which he had that god gave him more  of course he had his sins the bible tells us what they were just the sins which one would expect of a man brought up a heathen and an idolater of one who was a great conqueror and had gained many bloody battles and learned to hold mens lives very cheap of one who was an absolute emperor with no law but his own will furious at any contradiction of a man of wonderful power of mindconfident in himself his own power his own cunning  but he seems not to have been a bad man considering his advantages  the bible never speaks harshly of him though he carried away the jews captive to babylon  in all that fearful war nebuchadnezzar was in the right and the jews in the wrong so at least jeremiah the prophet declared  nebuchadnezzar saved and respected jeremiah and daniel seems to have regarded the great conqueror with real respect and affection  when daniel says to him o king live for ever and tells him that he is the head of gold and prays that his fearful dream may come true of his enemies and not of him i cannot believe that the prophet was using mere empty phrases of courtflattery  he really felt i doubt not that nebuchadnezzar was a great and good king as kings went then and his government a gain as it easily might be to the nations whom he had conquered and that it was good that he should reign as long as possible  and we may well believe daniels interest in this great king when we consider how teachable nebuchadnezzar showed himself under gods education of him so proving that there was in him the honest and good heart which when the word is sown in it will bring forth fruit thirtyfold or a hundredfold according to the talents which god has bestowed on each man  this first lesson we read in the first chapter of daniel  he dreamt a dream  he felt that it was a very wonderful one  but he forgot what it was  none of the magicians of babylon could tell him  a young jew named daniel told him the dream and its meaning and declared at the same time that he had found it out by no wisdom of his own but god had revealed it to him  nebuchadnezzar learned his lesson and confessed daniels god to be a god of gods and a lord of kings and a revealer of secrets seeing that daniel could reveal that secret and forthwith like a wise prince advanced daniel and his companions to places of the highest authority and trust  but nebuchadnezzar required another lesson  he had learned that the god of the jews was wiser than all the planets and heavenly lords and gods whom the babylonian magicians consulted he had not learned that that same god of the jews was the creator and lord of heaven and earth  he had learned that the god of heaven favoured him and had helped him toward his power and glory but he thought that for that very reason the power and glory were his ownthat he had a right over the souls and consciences of his subjects and might make them worship what he liked and how he liked  three jews whom he had set over the affairs of babylon refused to worship the golden image which he had set up and were cast into a fiery furnace and forthwith miraculously delivered and beheld by nebuchadnezzar walking unhurt and loose in the midst of the furnace and with them a fourth whose form was like the form of the son of god  so nebuchadnezzar was taught that this god of the jews was the lord of mens souls and consciences that they were to obey god rather than man  so he was taught that the god of the jews was no mere star or heavenly influence who could help mens fortunes or bestow on them a certain fixed destiny but a living person the lord and master of the fire and of all the powers of the earth who could change and stop those powers at his will to deliver those who trusted in him and obeyed him  and this lesson too nebuchadnezzar learned  he confessed his mistake upon the spot just in the way in which we should have expected a great eastern king to do though not in the most enlightened or merciful way  he blessed the god of shadrach meshach and abednego who hath sent his angel and delivered his servants who trusted in him  therefore i make a decree that every people nation and language which speak anything amiss against the god of shadrach meshach and abednego shall be cut in pieces and their houses be made a dunghill  because there is no other god that can deliver after this sort  but there was still one deep mistake lying in the great kings heart which required to be rooted out  he had learnt that jehovah the god of the jews was a revealer of secrets a master of the fire a deliverer of those who trusted in him a living personal lord wise just and faithful very different from any of his star gods or idols  but he looked upon jehovah only as the god of the jews as daniels god  he had not yet learnt that god was his god as well as daniels that jehovah was very near his heart and mind and had been near him all his life that from jehovah came all his wisdom his strength of mind his success and all which made him differ not only from his fellowmen but from the beast that jehovah in a word was the light and the life of the world who fills all things and by whom all things consist deserted by whose inward light even for a moment man becomes as one of the beasts which perish  in his own eyes nebuchadnezzar was still the great selfdependent self sufficing conqueror wiser and stronger than all the men around him he thought most probably that on account of his wisdom and courage and royalty of soul the god of heaven had become fond of him and favoured him  in short he was swollen with pride  god sent him again a strange dream which made him troubled and afraid  he told it to his old counsellor daniel and daniel at the danger of his life interpreted it for him and a very awful meaning it had  a fearful and shameful downfall was to come upon the king no less than the loss of his reason and with it of his throne  but whether this came to pass or not depended like all gods everlasting promises and threats on nebuchadnezzars own behaviour if he repented and broke off his sins by righteousness and his iniquities by showing mercy to the poor there was good reason to hope that so his tranquillity might be lengthened  but the lesson was too hard for the proud conqueror he did not take the warning  he could not believe that the most high ruled in the kingdom of men and giveth it to whomsoever he will  he still fancied that he and such as he were the lords of the world and took from others by their own power and cunning whatsoever they would  he does not seem to have been angry however with daniel for his plain speaking  most eastern kings like nebuchadnezzar would have put daniel to a cruel death on the spot as the bearer of evil news speaking blasphemy against the king and no one in those times and countries would have considered him wicked and cruel for so doing but nebuchadnezzar seems to have learnt too much already so to give way to his passion  yet as i said before he had not learned enough to take gods warning  the lesson that he was nothing and that god is all in all was too hard for him  and alas my friends for whom of us is it not a hard lesson  and yet it is the golden lesson the first and the last which man has to learn on earth ay and through all eternity  i am nothing god is all in all  all in us which is worth calling anything all in us which is worth having or worth being all in us which is not disobedience and shortcoming failure and mistake ignorance and madness filthiness and fierceness as of the beasts which perish all strength in us all understanding all prudence all rightmindedness all purity all justice all love all in us which is worth living for all in us which is really alive and not mere death in life the death of sin and the darkness of the pitall is from god the father of lights and from jesus christ the life and the light who lighteth every man who cometh into the world shining for ever in the darkness of our spirits though that darkness alas too often cannot comprehend and embrace and confess him who is striving to awake it from the dead and give it light hardest of all lessons  most blessed of all lessons  so blessed that if we will not let god teach it us in any other way it would be good and advantageous to us for him to teach it us as he taught it to nebuchadnezzargood for us to become with him for awhile like the beasts that perish that we might learn with him to lift up our eyes to heaven and so have our understandings return to us and learn to bless the most high and not our own wit and cunning and prudence and praise and honour him that liveth for ever instead of praising and honouring our own pitiful paltry selves who are in death in the midst of life who come up and are cut down like the flower and never continue in one stay  all this came upon the king nebuchadnezzar  it seems that after he or his father had destroyed the old babylon the downfall of which isaiah had prophesied he built a great city after the fashion of eastern conquerors near the ruins of the old one and at the end of twelve months he walked in the palace of the kingdom of babylon  the king spake and said is not this great babylon that i have built for the house of the kingdom by the might of my power and for the honour of my majesty  while the word was in the kings mouth there fell a voice from heaven saying o king nebuchadnezzar to thee it is spoken the kingdom is departed from thee  and they shall drive thee from men and thy dwelling shall be with the beasts of the field  they shall make thee to eat grass as oxen and seven times shall pass over thee until thou know that the most high ruleth in the kingdom of men and giveth it to whomsoever he will  the same hour was the thing fulfilled upon nebuchadnezzar  what a lesson  the great conqueror of all the east now a brutal madman hateful and disgusting to all around hima beast feeding among the beasts  and yet a cheap pricea cheap priceto pay for this golden lesson  seven times past over him in his madness  what those seven times were we do not know  they may have been actual years  or they may have been as i am inclined to think changes in his own soul and state of mind  but at the end of the days the truth dawned on him he began to see what it all meant  he saw what he was and why he was so and he lifted up his eyes to heaven and from that moment his madness past  he lifted up his eyes to heaven  that is no mere figure of speech  it is an actual truth  most madmen if you watch them have that down look or rather that inward look as if their eyes were fixed only on their own fancies  they are thinking only of themselves poor creaturesof their own selfish and private suspicions and wrongsof their own selfish superstitious dreams about heaven or hellof their own selfish vanity and ambition sometimes of their own frantic selfconceit or of their selfish lusts and desiresof themselves in short  they have lost the one divine light of reason and conscience and love which binds men to each other and are parted for a while from god and from their kind alone in their own darkness  so was nebuchadnezzar  at last he looked up as men do when they pray up from himself to one greater than himself up from the earth to heaven up from the natural things which we do see which are temporal and born to die to moral and spiritual things which we do not see which are real and eternal in the heavens up from his own lonely darkness looking for the light and the guidance of god for now he began to see that all the light which he had ever had all his wisdom and understanding and strength of will had come from god however he might have misused them for his own selfish ambition that it was because god had taken from him his light who is the word of god that he had become a beast  and then his reason returned to him and he became again a man a rational being made howsoever fallen and sinful in the likeness of god then he blessed and praised god  it was not merely that he confessed that god was strong and he weak righteous and he sinful wise and he foolish but he blessed and praised god he felt and confessed that god had done him a great benefit and taught him a great lessonthat god had taught him what he was in himself and without god that he might see what he was with god in its true light and honour and obey him from whom his reason and understanding as well as his power and glory came that so it might be fulfilled which the prophet says  let not the wise man glory in his wisdom nor the mighty man in his might nor the rich man in his riches  but let him that glorieth glory in this that he understandeth and knoweth me that i am the lord which exercise lovingkindness judgment and righteousness in the earth for in these things i delight saith the lord  and so was nebuchadnezzars soul brought to utter in his own way the very same glorious song which or something like it is said to have been sung by the three men whom years before he had seen delivered from the fiery furnace which calls on all the works of the lord angels and heaven sun and stars seas and winds mountains and hills fowls and cattle priests and laymen spirits and souls of the righteous to bless the lord praise him and magnify him for ever  and so ends nebuchadnezzars history  we read no more of him  he had learnt the golden lesson  may god grant that we may learn it also  but who tells the story of his madness  he himself  the whole account is in the mans own words  it seems to be some public letter or proclamation which he either sent round his empire or commanded to be laid up among his records having as it seems set daniel to write it down from his mouth  this one fact i think justifies me in all that i have said about nebuchadnezzars nobleness and daniels affection for him  he does not try to smooth things over to pretend that he has not been mad to find excuses for himself to lay any blame on any human being  he repents openly confesses openly  shameful as it may be to him he tells the whole story  he confesses that he had fair warning that all was his own fault  he justifies god utterly  my friends we may read thank god many noble and brave and righteous speeches of kings and great men  but never have i read one so noble so brave so righteous as this of the great king of babylon  and therefore it is because this letter of his in the fourth chapter of the book of daniel is indeed full of the eternal holy spirit of god therefore it is i say that it forms part of the bible part of holy scripture to this daya greater honour to nebuchadnezzar than all his kingdom for what greater honour than to have been inspired to write one chapter yea one sentence of the book of books  my friends every one of you here is in gods schoolhouse under gods teaching far more than nebuchadnezzar was  you are baptised men knowing that blessed name of father son and holy spirit which nebuchadnezzar only saw dimly and afar off  jesus christ the word of god is striving with your hearts giving to them whatsoever light and life they have  you have been taught from childhood to look up to him as your king and deliverer to his father as your father to his holy spirit as your inspirer  take heed how you listen to his voice within your hearts  take heed how you learn gods lessons for god is surely educating you and teaching you far more than he taught the king of babylon in old time  as you learn or despise these lessons of gods will be your happiness or your misery now and for ever  unto the king of babylon little was given and of him was little required  to you and me much has been given of you and me will much be required    xxixjeremiahs calling    behold the days come saith the lord that i will raise unto david a righteous branch and a king shall reign and prosper and shall execute judgment and justice in the earthjeremiah xxiii 5  at the time when jeremiah the prophet spoke those words to the jews nothing seemed more unlikely than that they would ever come true the whole jewish nation was falling to pieces from its own sins brutish and filthy idolatry in high and lowoppression violence and luxury among the court and the nobilityshame and poverty and ignorance among the lower classesidleness and quackery among the priesthoodand as kings over all one fool and profligate after another set on the throne by a foreign conqueror and pulled down again by him at his pleasure  ten out of the twelve tribes of israel had been carried off captive young and old into a distant land the small portion of country which still remained inhabited round jerusalem had been overrun again and again by cruel armies of heathens  without jerusalem was waste and ruins bloodshed and wretchedness within every kind of iniquity and lies division and confusion  if ever there was a miserable and contemptible people upon the face of the earth it was the jewish nation in jeremiahs time  jeremiah makes no secret of it  his prophecies are full of itfull of lamentation and shame  oh that my head were a fountain of tears to weep for the sins of my people  he feels that god has sent him to rebuke those sins to warn and prophesy to his fellow countrymen the certain ruin into which they are rushing headlong and he speaks gods message boldly  from the poor idolridden labourer offering cakes to the queen of heaven to coax her into sending him a good harvest to the tyrant king who had built his palace of cedar and painted it with vermilion he had a bitter word for every man the lying priest tried to silence him and jeremiah answered him that his wife should be a harlot in the city and his children sold for slaves  the king tried to flatter him into being quiet and he told him in return that he should be buried with the burial of an ass dragged out and cast forth beyond the gates of jerusalem  the luxurious queen who made her nest in the cedars would be ashamed and confounded he said for her wickedness  the crown prince was a despised broken idola vessel in which was no pleasure he should be cast out he and his children into slavery in a land which he knew not  the whole royal family he said would perish none of them should ever again prosper or sit upon the throne of david  this was his message shame and confusion woe and ruin to high and low every human being he passed in the street was a doomed man  for the day of the lord was at hand and who should be able to escape it  a sad calling truly to have to work at and all the more sad because jeremiah had no pride no steadfast opinion of his own excellence to keep him up  he hates his calling of prophet  at the very moment he is foretelling woe he prays god that his prophecy may not come true he tries every method to prevent its coming true by entreating his countrymen to repent  there runs through all his awful words a vein of tenderness and pity and love unspeakable which to me is the one great mark of a true prophet a sign that jeremiah spoke by the spirit of god a sign that too many writers nowadays do not speak by the spirit of god  if they rebuke the rich and powerful they do it generally in a very different spirit from jeremiahsin a spirit of bitterness and insolence not very easy to describe but easy enough to perceive  they seem to rejoice in evil to delight in finding fault to be sorry and not glad when their prophecies of evil turn out false to try to set one class against another one party against another as if we were not miserably enough split up already by class interests and party spirit  they are glad enough to rebuke the wicked great but not to their face not to their own danger and hurt like jeremiah  their plan is to accuse the rich to the poor on their own platform or in their own newspaper where they are safe and moreover to make a very fair profit thereby to say behind the back of authorities that which they dare not say to their face and which they soon give up saying when they have worked their own way into office and meanwhile take mighty credit to themselves for seeing that there is wrong and misery in the world as if the spirits in hell should fancy themselves righteous because they hated the devil  no my friends jeremiah was of a very different spirit from that  if he ever was tempted to it when he was young and began to fancy himself a very grand person who had a right to look down on his neighbours because god had called him and set him apart to be a prophet from his mothers womb and revealed to him the doom of nations and the secrets of his providenceif he ever fancied that in his heart god led him through such an education as took all the pride out of him sternly and bitterly enough  he was commissioned to go and speak terrible words to curse kings and nobles in the name of the lord  but he was taught too that it was not a pleasant calling or one which was likely to pay him in this life  his fellowvillagers plotted against his life  his wife deserted him  the nobles threw him into a dungeon into a well full of mire whence he had to be drawn up again with ropes to save his life  he was beaten all but starved kept for years in prison  he had neither child nor friend  he had his share of all the miseries of the siege of jerusalem and all the horrors of its storm and when he was set free by nebuchadnezzar and clung to his ruined home to see if any good could still be done to the remnant of his countrymen he was violently carried off into a heathen land and at last stoned to death by those very countrymen of his whom he had been trying for years to save  in everything and by everything he was taught that he was still a jew a brother to his sinful brothers that their sorrows were his sorrows their shame his shame their ruin his ruin in all their afflictions he was afflicted even as his lord was after him  he struggled we find again and again against this strange and sad calling of a prophet  he cried out in bitter agony that god had deceived him had induced him to become a prophet and then repaid him for speaking gods message with nothing but disappointment and misery  and yet he felt he must speak god he said was stronger than he was and forced him to it  he said  i will speak no more words in his name but the word of the lord was as fire within his bones and would not let him rest and so in spite of himself he told the truth and suffered for it and hated to have to tell it and pitied and loved the very country which he rebuked till he cursed the day in which he saw the light and the hour in which it was said to his father there is a manchild born  you who fancy that it is a fine thing and a paying profession to be a preacher of righteousness and a rebuker of sin look at jeremiah and judge  for as surely as you or any other man is sent by god to do jeremiahs work so surely he must expect jeremiahs wages  do you think then that jeremiah was a man only to be pitied pitiable he was indeed and sad  there was one hung on a cross eighteen hundred years ago more pitiable still  and yet he is the lord of heaven and earth  yes jeremiah had a sad life to live and a sad task to work out and yet my friends was not that a cheap price to pay for the honour and glory of being taught by gods spirit and of speaking gods words  i do not mean the mere honour of having his fame and name spread over all christs kingdom the honour of having his writings read and respected by the wisest and the holiest to the end of time that mere earthly fame is but a slight matter  i mean the real honour the real glory of knowing what was utterly right and true and therefore of knowing him who is utterly right and true of knowing god of knowing what gods character is  that he is a living god and not a dead one a god who is near and not absent at all loving and merciful just and righteous strong and mighty to save  ay my friends this is the lesson which god taught jeremiah to know the lord of heaven and earth and to see his hand his rule in all that was happening to his fellowcountrymen and himself to know that from the beginning the lord the saviourgod jehovah the messenger of the covenant he who brought up the jews out of egypt was the wise and just and loving king of the jews and of all the nations upon earth and that some day or other he must and would conquer all the sinfulness and misery and tyranny and idolatry in the world and show himself openly to men and fulfil all the piteous longings after a just and good king which poor wretches had ever felt and all the glorious promises of a just and good king which god had made to the wise men of old time and therefore in the midst of shame and persecution despair and ruin jeremiah could rejoice  jehoiakim the wicked king and all his royal house might be driven out into slavery jerusalem might become a heap of ruins and corpses the fair land of judaea and the village where he was bred might become thorns and thistles and heaps of stones the vineyard which he loved the little estate at anathoth which had belonged to him might be trodden down by the stranger and he himself die in a foreign land around him might be nothing but sin and decay before him nothing but despair and ruin  yet still there was hope joy everlasting certainty for that poor childless captive old man for he had found out that the lord still lived the lord still reigned  he could not lie he could not forget his people  could a mother forget her sucking child  no  when the jews turned to him he would still have mercy  his punishment of them was a sign that he still cared for them  if he had forgotten them he would have let them go on triumphant in their iniquity  no  all these afflictions were meant to chasten them teach them bring them back to him  it would be good for them an actual blessing to them to be taken away into captivity in babylon  it might be hard to believe but it must be true  the lord of israel the saviourgod who had been caring for them so long rising up early and sending his prophets to them pleading with them as a father with his child he would have mercy he would teach them in sorrow and slavery the lesson they were too rebellious and hardhearted to learn in prosperity and freedom  that the lord was their righteousness and that there was no other name under heaven which could save them from the plague and from the famine from the swords of the chaldeans or from the division and oppression and brutishness and manifold wickedness which was their ruin  and then jeremiah saw and felthow we cannot tellbut there his words the words of this text stand to this day to show that he did see and feel it that some day or other in gods good time the jews would have a true kinga very different king from jehoiakim the tyranta son of david in a very different sense from what jehoiakim was that he would come and must come sooner or later the unseen king who had all along been governing jews and heathens and telling his prophets that nebuchadnezzar and cyrus the chaldee and the persian were his servants as well as they and that all the nations of the earth could do but what he chose  behold the days come saith the lord that i will raise unto david a righteous branch and a king shall reign and prosper and shall execute justice and judgment on the earth  this was the blessed knowledge which god gave jeremiah in return for all the misery he had to endure in warning his countrymen of their sins  and this same blessed knowledge the knowledge that the earth is the lords that to jesus christ is given as he said himself all power in heaven and earth and that he is reigning and must reign and conquer and triumph till he has put all his enemies under his feet god will surely give to everyone high or low who follows jeremiahs example who boldly and faithfully warns the sinner of his way who rebukes the wickedness which he sees around him  only he must do it in the spirit of jeremiah  he must not be insolent to the insolent or proud to the proud  he must not be puffed up and fancy that because he sees the evil of sin and the certain ruin which is the fruit of it that he is therefore to keep apart from his fellow countrymen and despise them in pharisaic pride  no  the truly christian man the man who like jeremiah has the spirit of god in him will feel the most intense pity and tenderness of sinners  he will not only rebuke the sins of his people but mourn for them he will be afflicted in all their affliction  however harshly he may have to speak he will never forget that they are his countrymen his brothers children of the same father to be judged by the same lord he will feel with shame and fear that he has in himself the root of the very same sins which he sees working death around himthat if others are covetous he might be so tooif they be profligate and deceitful and hypocritical without god in the world he might be so too  and he must feel not only that he might be as bad as his neighbours but that he actually would be if god withdrew his spirit from him for a moment and allowed him to forget the only faith which saves him from sin loyalty to his unseen saviour the righteous king of kings  therefore he will not only rebuke his sinful neighbours but he will tell them as jeremiah told his countrymen that all their sin and misery proceed from this one thing that they have forgotten that the lord is their king  he will pray daily for them that the lord their king may show himself to their hearts and thoughts and teach them all that he has done for them and is doing for them and may convert them to himself that they may be truly his people and his way may be known upon earth his saving health among all nations    xxxthe perfect king    tell ye the daughter of zion behold thy king cometh to thee meek and sitting upon an ass and a colt the foal of an assmatthew xxi 5  you all know that this sunday is called the first sunday in advent you all know i hope that advent means coming and that these four sundays before christmas as i have often told you are called advent sundays because upon them we are called to consider the coming of our king and saviour jesus christ  if you will look at the collects epistles and gospels for these next four sundays you will see at once that they all bear upon our lords coming  the gospels tell us of the prophecies about christ which he fulfilled when he came  the epistles tell us what sort of men we ought to be both clergy and people because he has come and will come again  the collects pray that the spirit of god would make us fit to live and die in a world into which christ has come and in which he is ruling now and to which he will come again  the text which i have taken this morning you just heard in this sundays gospel  st matthew tells you that jesus christ fulfilled it by riding into jerusalem in state upon an asss colt and st matthew surely speaks truth  let us consider what the prophecy is and how jesus christ fulfilled it  then we shall see and believe from the epistle what effect the knowledge of it ought to have upon our own souls and hearts and daily conduct  now this prophecy behold thy king cometh unto thee etc you will find in your bibles in the ninth verse of the ninth chapter of the book of zechariah  but i do not think that zechariah wrote it st matthew does not say he wrote it he merely calls it that which was spoken by the prophet without mentioning his name  provided it is an inspired word from god which it is it perhaps does not matter to us so much who wrote it  but i think it was written by the prophet jeremiah perhaps in the beginning of the reign of the good king josiah for the chapter in which this text is and the two or three chapters which follow are not at all like the rest of zechariahs writings but exactly like jeremiahs  they certainly seem to speak of things which did not happen in zechariahs time but in the time of jeremiah nearly ninety years before  and above all st matthew himself seems plainly to have thought that some part at least of those chapters was jeremiahs writing for in the twenty seventh chapter of st matthews gospel and in the ninth verse you will find a prophecy about the potters field which st matthew says was spoken by jeremiah the prophet  now those words are not in the book of jeremiah as it stands in our bibles  but they are in the book of zechariah in the eleventh chapter twelfth and thirteenth verses coming shortly after my text and making a part of the same prophecy  this has puzzled christians very much because it seemed as if st matthew has made a mistake and miscalled zechariah jeremiah  but i believe firmly that as we are bound to expect st matthew made no mistake whatsoever and that jeremiah did write that prophecy as st matthew said and the two chapters before it and perhaps the two after it and that they were probably kept and preserved by zechariah during the troublous times of the babylonish captivity and at last copied by nehemiah into zechariahs book of prophecy where they stand now and i think it is a comfort to know this and to find that the evangelist st matthew has not made a mistake but knew the scriptures better than we do  but i think jeremiah having written this prophecy in my text which i believe he did is also very important because it will show us what the prophet meant when he spoke it and how it was fulfilled in his time and the better we understand that the better we shall understand how our blessed lord fulfilled it afterwards  now when jeremiah was a young man the jews and their king amon were in a state of most abominable wickedness  they were worshipping every sort of idol and false god  and the bible the book of gods law was utterly unknown amongst them so that josiah the king who succeeded amon had never seen or heard the book of the law of moses which makes part of our old testament till he had reigned eighteen years as you will find if you refer to 2 kings xxii 3  but this josiah was a gentle and just prince and finding the book of the law of god and seeing the abominable forgetfulness and idolatry into which his people had fallen utterly breaking the covenant which god had made with their forefathers when he brought them up out of egypt when he found the book of the law i say and all that he and his people should have done and had not done and the awful curses which god threatened in that book against those who broke his law he humbled himself before god because his heart was tender and turned to the lord as no king before him had ever turned says the scripture with all his heart and with all his soul and with all his might so that there was no such king before him or either after him  the history of the great reformation which this great and good king worked you may read at length in 2 kings xxii xxiii and 2 chron xxxiv xxxv which i advise you all to read  and it appears to me that this prophecy in the text first applies to the gentle and holy king josiah the first true and good king the jews had had for years and the best they were ever to have till christ came himself and that it speaks of josiah coming to jerusalem to restore the worship of god not with pomp and show like the wicked kings both before and after him but in meekness and humbleness of heart for all the sins of his people as the prophetess said of him in 2 kings xxii 19 that his heart was tender and humble before the lord neither coming with chariots and guards like a king and conqueror but riding upon an asss colt for that was in those countries the ancient sign of a mans being a man of peace and not of war a magistrate and lawgiver and not a soldier and a conqueror  various places of holy scripture show us that this was the meaning of riding upon an ass in judaea just as it is in eastern countries now  but some may say how then is this a prophecy  it merely tells us what good king josiah was and what every king ought to be  well my friends that is just what makes it a prophecy  if it tells you what ought to be it tells you what will be  yes never forget that whatever ought to be surely will be as surely as this is gods earth and christs kingdom and not the devils  now it does not matter in the least whether the prophet when he spoke these words knew that they would apply to the lord jesus christ  we have no need whatsoever to suppose that he did  for scripture gives us no hint or warrant that he did and if we have any real or honest reverence for scripture we shall be careful to let it tell its own story and believe that it contains all things necessary for salvation without our patching our own notions into it over and above  wise men are generally agreed that those old prophets did not for the most part comprehend the full meaning of their own words  not that they were mere puppets and mouthpieces speaking what to them was nonsensegod forbidbut that just because they did thoroughly understand what was going on round them and see things as god saw them just because they had gods eternal spirit with them therefore they spoke great and eternal words which will be true for ever and will go on for ever fulfilling themselves for more and more  for in proportion as any mans words are true and wide and deep they are truer and wider and deeper than that man thinks and will apply to a thousand matters of which he never dreamt  and so in all true and righteous speech as in the speeches of the prophets of old the glory is not mans who speaks them but gods who reveals them and who fulfils them again and again  it is true then that this text describes what every king should be gentle and humble a merciful and righteous lawgiver not a self willed and capricious tyrant  but josiah could not fulfil that  he was a good king  but he could not be a perfect one for he was but a poor sinful weak and inconsistent man as we are  but those words being inspired by the holy spirit must be fulfilled  there ought to be a perfect king perfectly gentle and humble having a perfect salvation a perfect lawgiver and therefore there must be such a king and therefore st matthew tells us there came at last a perfect kingone who fulfilled perfectly the prophets wordsone who was not made king of jerusalem but was her king from the beginning for that is the full meaning of thy king cometh to thee  to jerusalem he came riding on the asss colt like the peaceful and fatherly judges of old time for a sign to the poor souls round him who had no lawgivers but the proud and fierce scribes and pharisees no king but the cruel and godless caesar and his oppressive and extortionate officers and troops  meek and lowly he came and for once the people saw that he was the true son of davida man and king like him after gods own heart  for once they felt that he had come in the name of the lord the old deliverer who brought them out of the land of egypt and made them into a nation and loved and pitied them still in spite of all their sins and remembered his covenant which they had forgotten  and before that humble man the son of the village maiden they cried  hosanna to the son of david  blessed is he that cometh in the name of the lord  hosanna in the highest  and do you think he came the true and perfect king only to go away again and leave this world as it was before without a law a ruler a heavenly kingdom  god forbid  jesus is the same yesterday to day and for ever  what he was then when he rode in triumph into jerusalem that is he now to us this daya king meek and lowly and having salvation the head and founder of a kingdom which can never be moved a city which has foundations whose builder and maker is god  to that kingdom this land of england now belongs  into it we as englishmen have been christened  and the unchristened though they know not of it belong to it as well  what gods will what christs mercies may be to them we know not  that he has mercy for them if their ignorance is not their own fault we doubt not perhaps even if their ignorance be their own fault we need not doubt that he has mercy for them considering the mercy which he has shown to us who deserved no more than they  but his will to us we do know and his will is thisour holiness  for he came not only to assert his own power to redeem his own world but to set his people the children of men an example that they should follow in his steps  herein too he is the perfect king  he leads his subjects he sets a perfect example to his subjects and more he inspires them with the power of following that example as if you will think a perfect ruler ought to be able to do  josiah set the jews an example but he could not make them follow it  they turned to god at the bidding of their good king with their lips in their outward conduct but their hearts were still far from him  jeremiah complains bitterly of this in the beginning of his prophecies  he complains that josiahs reformation was after all empty hollow hypocritical a change on the surface only while the wicked root was left  they had healed he said the hurt of the daughter of his people slightly crying peace peace when there was no peace but jesus the perfect king is king of mens spirits as well as of their bodies  he can turn the heart he can renew the soul  none so ignorant none so sinful none so crushed down with evil habits but the lord will and can forgive him raise him up enlighten him strengthen him if he will but claim his share in his kings mercy his citizenship in the heavenly kingdom and so put himself in tune again with himself and with heaven and earth and all therein  keeping in mind these things that jesus because he is our perfect king is both the example and the inspirer of our souls and characters we may look without fear at the epistle for the day where it calls on us to be very different persons from what we are and declares to us our duty as subjects of him who is meek and lowly just and having salvation  it is no superstitious slavish message saying  you have lost christs mercy and christs kingdom you must buy it back again by sacrifices and tears and hard penances or great almsdeeds and works of mercy  no  it simply says  you belong to christ already give up your hearts to him and follow his example  if he is perfect his is the example to follow if he is perfect his commandments must be perfect fit for all places all times all employments if he is the king of heaven and earth his commandments must be in tune with heaven and earth with the laws of nature the true laws of society and trade with the constitution and business and duty and happiness of all mankind and for ever obey him  owe no man anything save love for he owed no man anything  he gave up all even his own rights for a time for his subjects  will you pretend to follow him while you hold back from your brothers and fellowservants their just due  one debt you must always owe one debt will grow the more you pay it and become more delightful to owe the greater and heavier you feel it to be and that is love love to all around you for all around you are your brothers and sisters all around you are the beloved subjects of your king and saviour  love them as you love yourself and then you cannot harm them you cannot tyrannise over them you cannot wish to rise by scrambling up on their shoulders taking the bread out of their mouths making your profit out of their weakness and their need this st paul says was the duty of men in his time because the night of heathendom was far spent the day of christianity and the church was at hand  much more is it our duty nowour duty who have been born in the full sunshine of christianity christened into his church as children we and our fathers before us for generations of the kingdom of god  ay my friends these words that kingdom that king witness this day against this land of england  not merely against popery the mote which we are trying to take out of the foreigners eye but against mammon the beam which we are overlooking in our own  owe no man anything save love  thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself  that is the law of your king who loved not himself or his own profit his own glory but gave himself even to death for those who had forgotten him and rebelled against him  that law witnesses against selfishness and idleness in rich and poor  it witnesses against the employer who grinds down his workmen who as the world tells him he has a right to do takes advantage of their numbers their ignorance their low and reckless habits to rise upon their fall and grow rich out of their poverty  it witnesses against the tradesman who tries to draw away his neighbours custom  it witnesses against the working man who spends in the alehouse the wages which might support and raise his children and then falls back recklessly and dishonestly on the parish rates and the alms of the charitable  against them all this law witnesses these things are unfit for the kingdom of christ contrary to the laws and constitution thereof hateful to the king thereof and if a nation will not amend these abominations the king will arise out of his place and with sore judgments and terrible he will visit his land and purify his temple saying  my fathers house should be a house of prayer and ye have made it a den of thieves  ay woe to any soul or to any nation which instead of putting on the lord jesus christ copying his example obeying his laws and living worthy of his kingdom not only in the church but in the market the shop the senate or the palace give themselves up to covetousness which is idolatry and care only to make provision for the flesh to fulfil the lusts thereof  woe to them for let them be what they will their king cannot change  he is still meek and lowly he is still just and having salvation and he will purge out of his kingdom all that is not like himself the unchaste and the idle the unjust and the unmerciful and the covetous man who is an idolater says the scripture though he may call himself seven times a protestant and rail at the pope in public meetings while he justifies greediness and tyranny by glib words about the necessities of business and the laws of trade and by philosophy falsely so called which cometh not from above but is earthly sensual devilish  such a man loves and makes a lie and the lord of truth will surely send him to his own place    xxxigods warnings    it may be that the house of judah will hear all the evil which i purpose to do unto them that they may return every man from his evil way that i may forgive their iniquity and their sinjeremiah xxxvi 3  the first lesson for this evenings service tells us of the wickedness of jehoiakim king of judah  how when jeremiahs prophecies against the sins of jehoiakim and his people were read before him he cut the roll with a penknife and threw it into the fire  now we must not look on this story as one which because it happened among the jews many hundred years ago has nothing to do with us for as i continually remind you the history of the jews and the whole old testament is the history of gods dealings with manthe account of gods plan of governing this world  now god cannot change but is the same yesterday today and for ever and therefore his plan of government cannot change  but if men do as those did of whom we read in the old testament god will surely deal with them as he dealt with the men of the old testament  this st paul tells us most plainly in the tenth chapter of 1 corinthians where he says that the whole history of the jews was written for our examplethat is for the example of those christian corinthians who were not jews at all but gentiles as we are and therefore for our example also  he tells them that it was christ himself the lord jesus christ who fed and guided the old jews in the wilderness and that the lord will deal with us exactly as he dealt with the old jews  therefore it is a great and fearful mistake to suppose that because the jews were a peculiar people and gods chosen nation that therefore the lords way of governing them is in any wise different from his way of governing us english at this very day for that fancy is contrary to the express words of holy scripture in a hundred different places it is contrary to the whole spirit of our prayer book which is written all through on the belief that the lord deals with us just as he did with the jewish nation and which will not even make sense if it be understood in any other way and besides it is most dangerous to the souls and consciences of men  it is most dangerous for us to fancy that god can change for if god can change right and wrong can change for right is the will of god and wrong is what is against his will and if we once let into our hearts the notion that god can change his laws of right our consciences will become daily dimmer and more confused about right and wrong till we fall as too many do under the prophets curse woe to them who call good evil and evil good who put sweet for bitter and bitter for sweet and fancy like ezekiels jews that gods ways are unequal that is unlike each other changeable arbitrary and capricious doing one thing at one time and another at another  no it is sinful man who is changeable it is sinful man who is arbitrary  but the lord is not a man that he should lie or repent for he is the onlybegotten son and therefore the express likeness of the everlasting father in whom is no variableness nor shadow of turning  but some may say is not that a gloomy and terrible notion of god that he cannot change his purpose  is not that as much as to say that there is a dark necessity hanging over each of us that a man must just be what god chooses and do just what he has ordained to do and go to everlasting happiness or misery exactly as god has foreordained from all eternity so that there is no use trying to do right or not to do wrong  if i am to be saved say such people i shall be saved whether i try or not and if i am to be damned i shall be damned whether i try or not  i am in gods hands like clay in the hands of the potter and what i am like is therefore gods business and not mine  no my friends the very texts in the bible which tell us that god cannot change or repent tell us what it is that he cannot change in in showing lovingkindness and tender mercy longsuffering and repenting of the evil  whatsoever else he cannot repent of he cannot repent of repenting of the evil  it is true we are in his hand as clay in the hand of the potter but it is a sad misreading of scripture to make that mean that we are to sit with our hands folded careless about our own way and conduct still less that we are to give ourselves up to despair because we have sinned against god for what is the very verse which follows after that  listen  o house of israel cannot i do with you as this potter saith the lord  behold as the clay is in the hand of the potter so are ye in my hand o house of israel  at what instant i shall speak concerning a kingdom to pull down and destroy it if that nation against whom i have pronounced turn from their evil i will repent of the evil which i thought to do to them  and at what instant i shall speak concerning a nation and concerning a kingdom to build and to plant it if it do evil in my sight that it obey not my voice then i will repent of the good wherewith i said i would benefit them  so that the lesson which we are to draw from the parable of the potters clay is just the exact opposite which some men draw  not that gods decrees are absolute  but that they are conditional and depend on our good or evil conduct  not that his election or his reprobation are unalterable but that they alter at that instant at which man alters  not that his grace and will are irresistible as the foolish man against whom st paul argues fancies  but that we can resist gods will and that our destruction comes only by resisting his will in short that gods will is no brute material necessity and fate but the will of a living loving father  and the very same lesson is taught us in ezek xviii of which i spoke just now for if we read that chapter we shall find that the jews had a false notion of god that he had changed his character and had become in their time unmerciful and unjust  they fancied that god was if i may so speak obstinatethat if his anger had once arisen there was no turning it away but that he would go on without pity punishing the innocent children for their fathers sin and therefore they fancied gods ways were unfair selfwilled and arbitrary without any care of what sort of person he afflicted punishing the righteous as well as the wicked after he had promised in his law to reward the righteous and punish the wicked  they fancied that his way of governing the world had changed and that he did not in their days make a difference between the bad and the good therefore ezekiel says to them  when the righteous man turneth away from his righteousness he shall die  when the wicked man turneth away from his wickedness he shall live  have i any pleasure at all that the wicked should die saith the lord god and not that he should return from his ways and live  this then is the good news that god is love love when he punishes and love when he forgives very pitiful and full of long suffering and tender mercy and repenting him never of the good but only of the evil which he threatens  both jeremiah therefore and ezekiel give us the same lesson  god does not change and therefore he never changes his mercy and his justice  for he is merciful because he is just  if we confess our sins he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins  that is his everlasting law and has been from the beginning  punishment sure and certain for those who do not repent and free forgiveness sure and certain also for those who do repent  so he spoke to jeremiah in the time of jehoiakim  it may be that the house of judah will hear all the evil that i purpose to do to them that i may forgive them their iniquity and their sin  the lord you see wishes to forgivelongs to forgive  his heart yearns over sinful men as a fathers over his rebellious child  but if they will still rebel if they will still turn their wicked wills away from him he must punish  why we know not but he knows  punish he must unless we repentunless we turn our wills toward his will and woe to the stiffnecked and stouthearted man who like the wicked king jehoiakim sets his face like a flint against gods warnings  how many how many behave for years sunday after sunday just as king jehoiakim did  when he heard that god had threatened him with ruin for his sins he heard also that god offered him free pardon if he would repent  jeremiah gave him free choice to be saved or to be ruined but his heart and will were hardened  hearing that he was wrong only made him angry  his pride and selfwill were hurt by being told that he must change and alter his ways  he had chosen his way and he would keep to it and he cared nothing for gods offers of forgiveness because he could not be forgiven unless he did what he was too proud to do confess himself to be in the wrong and openly alter his conduct  and how many as i first said are like him  they come to church they hear gods warnings and threats against their evil ways they hear gods offers of free pardon and forgiveness but being told that they are in the wrong makes them too angry to care for gods offers of pardon  pride stops their cars they have chosen their own way and they will keep it  they would not object to be forgiven if they might be forgiven without repenting  but they do not like to confess themselves in the wrong they do not like to face their foolish companions remarks and sneers about their changed ways  they do not like even good people to say of them  you see now that you were in the wrong after all for you have altered your mind and your doings yourself as we told you you would have to do  no anything sooner than confess themselves in the wrong and so they turn their backs on gods mercy for the sake of their own carnal pride and selfwill  but of course they want an excuse for doing that and when a man wants an excuse the devil will soon fit him with a good one  then perhaps the foolish sinner behaves as jehoiakim did  he tries to forget gods message in the man who brings it  he grows angry with the preacher or goes out and laughs at the preacher when service is over as if it was the preachers fault that god had declared what he has as if it was the preachers doing that god has revealed his anger against all sin and unrighteousness  so he acts like jehoiakim who tried to take jeremiah the prophet and punish him for what not he but the lord god had declared  nay they will often peevishly hate the very sight of a good book because it reminds them of the sins of which they do not choose to be reminded just as the young king jehoiakim was childish enough to vent his spite on jeremiahs book of prophecies by cutting the roll on which it was written with a penknife and throwing it into the fire  so do sinners who are angry with the preacher who warns them or hate the sight of good books  but let such foolish and wilful sinners such fullgrown childrenfor after all they are no betterhear the word of the lord which came to jehoiakim  as it is written he that despiseth me shall be despised saith the lord  and let them not fancy that their shutting their ears will shut the preachers mouth still less shut up gods everlasting laws of punishment for sin  no gods word stands true and it will happen to them as it did to jehoiakim  his burning jeremiahs book did not rid him of the book or save him from the woe and ruin which was prophesied in it for we have jeremiahs book here in our bibles to this day as a sign and a warning of what happens to men be they young or old be they kings or labouring men who fight against god  jeremiahs words were not lost after all they were all rewritten and there were added to them also many more like words for jehoiakim by refusing the lords offer of pardon had added to his sins and therefore the lord added to his punishment  perhaps again the devil finds the wilful sinner another excuse and the man says to himself as the jews did in ezekiels time  the fathers have eaten sour grapes and the childrens teeth are set on edge  it is not my own fault that i am living a bad life but other peoples  my parents ought to have brought me up better  i have had no chance  my companions taught me too much harm  i have too much trouble to get my living or i was born with a bad temper or i cant help running after pleasure  why did god make me the sort of man i am and put me where i am  god is hard upon me he is unfair to me  his ways are unequal he expects as much of me as he does of people who have more opportunities  he threatens to punish me for other peoples sins  and then comes another and a darker temptation over the man and the devil whispers to him such thoughts as these  god does not care for me god hates me  luck and everything else is against me  there seems to be some curse upon me  why should i change  let god change first to me and then i will change toward him  but god will not change he is determined to have no mercy on me  i can see that for everything goes wrong with me  then what use in my repenting  i will just go my own way and what must be must  there is no resisting gods will  if i am to be saved i shall be if i am to be damned i shall be  i will put all melancholy thoughts out of my head and go and enjoy myself and forget all  at all events it wont last long  let me eat and drink for tomorrow i die  oh my dear friends have not some of you sometimes had such thoughts  then hear the word of the lord to you  whenwhensoever whensoever the wicked man turneth away from his wickedness which he hath committed and doeth that which is lawful and right he shall save his soul alive  have i any pleasure in the death of him that dieth saith the lord and not rather that he should be converted and live  true most true that the lord is unchangeable  but it is in love and mercy  true that gods will and law cannot alter but what is gods will and law  the soul that sinneth it shall die yes  but also the soul that turneth away from its sin it shall live  never believe the devil when he tells you that god hates you never believe him when he tells you that god has been too hard on you and put you into such temptation or ignorance or poverty or anything else that you cannot mend  no  that font there will give the devil the lie  that font says  be you poor tempted ignorant stupid be you what you will you are gods childyour fathers love is over you his mercy is ready for you  you feel too weak to change ask gods spirit and he will give you a strength of mind you never felt before  you feel too proud to change ask gods spirit and he will humble your proud heart and soften your hard heart and you will find to your surprise that when your pride is gone when you are utterly ashamed of yourself and see your sins in their true blackness and feel not worthy to look up to god that then instead of pride will come a nobler holier manlier feelingselfrespect and a clear conscience and the thought that weak and sinful as you are you are in the right way that god and the angels of god are smiling on you that you are in tune again with all heaven and earth because you are what god wills you to benot his proud peevish selfwilled child fancying yourself strong enough to go alone when in reality you are the slave of your own passions and appetites and the plaything of the devil  but his loving loyal son strong in the strength which god gives you and able to do what you will because what you will god wills also    xxxiipharaohs heart    and the heart of pharaoh was hardened and he did not let the people goexodus ix 17  what lesson now can we draw from this story  one at least and a very important one  what effect did all these signs and wonders of gods sending have upon pharaoh and his servants  did they make them better men or worse men  we read that they made them worse men that they helped to harden their hearts  we read that the lord hardened pharaohs heart so that he would not let the children of israel go  now how did the lord do that  he did not wish and mean to make pharaoh more hardhearted more wicked  that is impossible god who is all goodness and love never can wish to make any human being one atom worse than he is  he who so loved the world that he came down on earth to die for sinners and take away the sins of the world would never make any human being a greater sinner than he was before  that is impossible and horrible to think of  therefore when we read that the lord hardened pharaohs heart we must be certain that that was pharaohs own fault and so we read it was pharaohs own fault  the lord did not bring all these plagues on egypt without giving pharaoh fair warning  before each plague he sent moses to tell pharaoh that the plague was coming  the lord told pharaoh that he was his master and the master and lord of the whole earth that the children of israel belonged to him and the egyptians too that the river light and darkness the weather the crops and the insects and the locusts belonged to him that all diseases which afflict man and beast were in his power  and the lord proved that his words were true in a way pharaoh could not mistake by changing the river into blood and sending darkness and hailstones and plagues of lice and flies and at last by killing the firstborn of all the egyptians  the lord gave pharaoh every chance he condescended to argue with him as one man would with another and proved his word to be true and proved that he had a right to command pharaoh  and therefore i say if pharaohs heart was hardened it was his own fault for the lord was plainly trying to soften it and to bring him to reason  and the bible says distinctly that it was pharaohs own fault  for it says that pharaoh hardened his own heart he and his servants and therefore they would not let the children of israel go  now how could pharaoh harden his own heart and yet the lord harden it at the same time  just in the same way my friends as too many of us are apt to make the lord harden our hearts by hardening them ourselves and to make as pharaoh did the very things which the lord sends to soften us the causes of our becoming more stubborn the very things which the lord sends to bring us to reason the means of our becoming more mad and foolish  believe me my friends this is no old story with which we have nothing to do  what happened to pharaohs heart may happen to yours or mine or any mans  alas alas it does happen to many a mans and womans heart every dayand may the lord have mercy on them before it be too lateand yet how can the lord have mercy on those who will not let him have mercy on them  what do i mean  this is what i mean my friends oh listen to it and take it solemnly to heart you who are living still in sin take it to heart lest you like pharaoh die in your sins and your latter end will be worse than your beginning  suppose a man to be going on in some sinful habit cheating his neighbours grinding his labourers or getting tipsy or living with a woman without being married to her  he comes to church and there he hears the word of the lord by the bible or in sermons telling him that god commands him to give up his sin that god will certainly punish him if he does not repent and amend  god sends that message to him in love and mercy to soften his heart by the terrors of the law and turn him from his sin  but what does the man feel  he feels angry and provoked angry with the preacher ay angry with the bible itself with gods words  for he hates to hear the words which tell him of his sin he wishes they were not in the bible he longs to stop the preachers mouth and as he cannot do that he dislikes going to church  he says  i cannot and what is more i will not give up my sinful ways and therefore i shall not go to church to be told of them  so he stops away from church and goes on in his sins  so that mans heart is hardened just as pharaohs was  yet the lord has come and spoken to that sinful man in loving warnings though all the effect it has had is that the lords message has made him worse than he was before more stubborn more godless more unwilling to hear what is good  but men may fall into a still worse state of mind  they may determine to set the lord at naught to hear him speaking to their conscience and know that he is right and they wrong and yet quietly put the good thoughts and feelings out of their way and go in the course which they know to be the worst  how many a man in business or the world says to himself ay and in his better moments will say to his friend  ah yes if one could but be what one would wish to be     what ones mother used to say one might be     but for such a world as this the gospel ideal is somewhat too fine and unpractical  one has ones business to carry on or ones family to provide for or ones party in politics to serve one must obey the laws of trade the usages of society the interests of ones class and so forth  and so an excuse is found for every sin by those who know in their hearts that they are sinning for every sin and among others too often for that sin of pharaohs of not letting the people go  and how many my friends when they come to church harden their hearts in the same quiet almost goodhumoured way not caring enough for gods message to be even angry with it and take the preachers warnings as they would a shower of rain as something unpleasant which cannot be helped and which therefore they must sit out patiently and think about it as little as possible  and when the sermon is over they take their hats and go out into the churchyard and begin talking about something else as quickly as possible to drive the unpleasant thoughts if there are a few left out of their heads  and thus they let the lords message to them harden their hearts  for it does harden them my friends if it be taken in this temper  every time anyone sits through the service or the sermon in this stupid and careless mood he dulls and deadens his soul till at last he is able coolly to sit through the most awful warnings of gods judgment the most tender entreaties of gods love as if he were a brute animal without understanding  ay he is able to make the responses to the commandments and join in the psalms and so with his own mouth before the whole congregation confess that gods curse is on his doings with no more sense or care of what the words mean and of what a sentence he is pronouncing against himself than if he were a parrot taught to speak by rote words which he does not understand  and so that man by hardening his own heart makes the lord harden it for him  but there is a third way and a worse way still in which peoples hearts are hardened by the lords speaking to them  a man is warned of his sins by the preacher and he says to himself  if the minister thinks that he is going to frighten me away from church he is very much mistaken  he may go his way and i shall go mine  let him preach at me as much as he will i shall go to church all the more for that to show him that i am not afraid  and so the lords warnings harden his heart and provoke him to set his face like a flint and become all the more proud and stubborn  now young people i speak openly to you as man to man  will you tell me that this was not the very way in which some of you took my sermon last sunday afternoon in which i warned you of the misery which your sinful lives would bring upon you  was there not more than one of you who as soon as he got outside the church began laughing and swaggering and said to the lad next him  well he gave it us well in his sermon this afternoon did he not  but i dont care do you  to which the other foolish fellow answered  not i  it is his business to talk like that he is paid for it and i suppose he likes it  so if he does what he likes we shall do what we like  come along  and at that all the other foolish fellows round burst out laughing as if the poor lad had said a very clever thing and they all went off together having their hearts hardened by the lords warning to them as pharaohs was  and they showed i am afraid that very evening that their hearts were hardened  for out of a sort of spite and stubbornness they took a delight in doing what was wrong just because they had been told that it was wrong and because they were determined to show that they would not be frightened or turned from what they chose  and all the while they knew that it was wrong did those poor foolish lads  if you had asked one of them openly do you not know that god has forbidden you to do this they would have either been forced to say yes or else they would have tried to laugh the matter off or perhaps held their tongues and looked silly or perhaps again answered insolently showing by each and all of these ways of taking it that the lords message had come home to their consciences and convinced them of their sin though they were determined not to own it or obey it  and the way they would have put the matter by and excused themselves to themselves would have been just the way in which pharaoh did it  they would have tried to forget that the lord had warned them and tried to make out to themselves that it was all the preachers doing and to make it a personal quarrel between him and them  just so pharaoh did when he hardened his heart  he made the lords message a ground for hating and threatening moses and aaron as if it was any fault of theirs  he knew in his heart that the lord had sent them but he tried to forget that and drove them out from his presence and told them that if they dared to appear before him again they should surely die  and just so my friends people will be angry with the preacher for telling them unpleasant truths as if it was any more pleasure to him to speak than for them to hear  oh why will you forget that the words which i speak from this pulpit are not my words but gods  it is not i who warn you of what you are bringing on yourselves by your sins it is god himself there it is written in his biblejudge for yourselves  read your bibles for yourselves and you will see that i am not speaking my own thoughts and words  and as for being angry with me for telling you truth read the ordination service which is read whenever a clergyman is ordained and judge for yourselves  what is a clergyman sent into the world for at all but to say to you what i am saying now  what should i be but a hypocrite and a traitor to the blessed lord who died for me and saved me from my sins and ordained me to preach to sinners that they too may be saved from their sinswhat should i be but a traitor to him if i did not say to you whenever i see you going wrong  o come let us worship and fall down and kneel before the lord our maker  for he is the lord our god and we are the people of his pasture and the sheep of his hand  today if ye will hear his voice harden not your hearts  lest he sware in his wrath that you shall not enter into his rest  and now my friends i will tell you what will happen to you  you see that i know something without having been told of what has been going on in your hearts  i beseech you believe me when i tell you what will go on in them  god will chastise you for your sins  he will just because he loves you and does not hate you just because you are his children and not dumb animals born to perish  troubles will come upon you as you grow older  of what sort they will be i cannot tell but that they will come i can tell full well  and when the lord sends trouble to you shall it harden your hearts or soften them  it depends on you altogether on you whether the lord hardens your hearts by sending those sorrows or whether he softens and turns them and brings them back to the only right place for themhome to him  but your trouble may only harden your heart all the more  the sorrows and sore judgments which the lord sent pharaoh only hardened his heart  it all depends upon the way in which you take these troubles my friends  and that not so much when they come as after they come  almost all let their hearts be right with god or not seem to take sorrow as they ought while the sorrow is on them pharaoh did so too  he said to moses and aaron  i have sinned this time  the lord is righteous and i and my people are wicked entreat the lord that there be no more mighty thunderings and hail and i will let you go  what could be more right or better spoken was not pharaoh in a proper state of mind then  was not his heart humbled and his will resigned to god  moses thought not  for while he promised pharaoh to pray that the storm might pass over yet he warned him  but as for thee and thy servants i know that ye will not yet fear the lord your god  and so it happened for when pharaoh saw that the rain and hail and thunder had ceased he sinned yet more and hardened his heart he and his servants neither would he let the children of israel go     and so alas it happens to many a man and woman nowadays  they find themselves on a sickbed  they are in fear of death in fear of poverty in fear of shame and punishment for their misdeeds  and then they say  it is gods judgment  i have been very wicked  i know god is punishing me  oh if god will but raise me up off this sickbed if he will but help me out of this trouble i will give up all my wicked ways i will repent and amend  so said pharaoh and yet as soon as he was safe out of his distress he hardened his heart  and so does many a man and woman who when they get safe through their troubles never give up one of their sins any more than pharaoh did  they really believe that god has punished them  they really intend to amend while they are in the trouble  but as soon as they are out of it they try to persuade themselves that it was not god who sent the sorrow that it came by accident or that people must have trouble in this life or that if they had taken better care they might have prevented itall of them excuses to themselves for forgetting god in the matter and therefore for forgetting what they promised to god in trouble and so after all they go on just as they went on before  and yet not as they went on before  for every such sin hardens their hearts every such sin makes them less able to see gods hand in what happens to them every such sin makes them more bold and confident in disobeying god and saying to themselves after all why should i be so frightened when i am in trouble and make such promises to amend my life  for the trouble goes away whether i mend my life or not and nothing happens to me god does not punish me for not keeping my promises to him  i may as well go on in my own way for i seem not the worse off in body or in purse for so doing  thus do people harden their hearts after each trouble as pharaoh did so that you will see people by one affliction after another one loss after another all their lives through warned by god that sin will not prosper them and confessing that their sins have brought gods punishment on them  and yet going on steadily in the very sins which have brought on their troubles and gaining besides as time runs on a heart more and more hardened and why  because they like pharaoh love to have their own way  they will not submit to god and do what he bids them and believe that what he bids them must be rightgood for them and for all around them  they promised to mend  but they promised as pharaoh did  if god will take away this trouble then i will mendmeaning though they do not dare to say it  and if god will not take away this trouble of course he cannot expect me to mend  in plain englishif god will not act toward them as they like then they will not act toward him as he likes  my friends god does not need us to bargain with him  we must obey him whether we like it or not whether it seems to pay us or not whether he takes our trouble off us or not we must obey for he is the lord and if we will not obey he will prove his power on us as he did on pharaoh by showing plainly what is the end of those who resist his will  what then are we to do when our sins bring us as they certainly will some day bring us into trouble  what we ought to have done at first my friends  what we ought to have done in the wild days of youth and so have saved ourselves many a dark day many a sleepless night many a bitter shame and heartache  to open our eyes and see that the only thing for men and women whom god has made is to obey the god who has made them  he is the lord  he has made us  he will have us do one thing  how can we hope to prosper by doing anything else  it is ill fighting against god  which is the stronger my friends you or god  make up your minds on that  it surely will not take you long  but someone may say  i do wish and long to obey god but i am so weak and my sins have so entangled me with bad company or debts or or  we all know alas into what a net everyone who gives way to sin gets his feet  and therefore i cannot obey god  i long to do so  i feel i know when i look back that all my sin and shame and unhappiness come from being proud and selfwilled and determined to have my own way and do what i choose  but i cannot mend  do not despair poor soul  i had a thousand times sooner hear you say you cannot mend than that you can  for those who say they can mend are apt to say  i can mend and therefore i shall mend when i choose and no sooner  but those who really feel they cannot mendthose who are really weary and worn out with the burden of their sinsthose who are really tired out with their own wilfulness and feel ready to lie down and die like a spent horse and say  god take me away no matter to what place i am not fit to live here on earth a shame and a torment to myself day and nightthose who are in that state of mind are very nearvery near finding out glorious news  those who cannot mend themselves and know it god will mend  god will mend your lives for you  he knows as well as you what you have to struggle against ay a thousand times better  he knowswhat does he not know  pray to him and try what he does not know  cry to him to rid you of your bad companions he will find a way of doing it  cry to him to bring you out of the temptations you feel too strong for you he will find a way for doing it  cry to him to teach you what you ought to do and he will send someone and that the right person doubt it not to teach you in his own good time  above all cry and pray to him to conquer the pride and selfconceit and wilfulness in your heart to take the hard proud heart of stone out of you and give you instead a heart of flesh loving and tender and kindly to every human creature and he will do it  cry to him to make your will like his own will that you may love what he loves and hate what he hates and do what he wishes you to do  and then you will surely find my words come true  those who long to mend and yet know that they cannot mend themselves let them but pray and god will mend them    xxxiiithe red sea triumph    preached easterday morning 1852  this is a night to be much observed unto the lord for bringing the children of israel out of the land of egyptexodus xii 42  you all my friends know what is the meaning of easterdaythat it is the day on which the lord rose again from the dead  you must have seen that most of the special services for this day the collect epistle and gospel and the second lessons both morning and evening reminded you of christs rising again and so did the proper psalms for this day though it may seem at first sight more difficult to see what they have to do with the lords rising again  now the first lessons both for the morning and evening services were also meant to remind us of the very same thing though it may seem even more difficult still at first sight to understand how they do so  let us see what these two first lessons are about  the morning one was from the twelfth chapter of exodus and told us what the passover was and what it meant  the first lesson for this afternoon was the fourteenth chapter of exodus  surely you must remember it  surely the most careless of you must have listened to that glorious story how the jews went through the red sea as if it had been dry land while pharaoh and the egyptian army trying to follow them were overwhelmed in the water  surely you cannot have heard how the poor jews looked back from the farther shore and hardly believed their own eyes for joy and wonder when they saw their proud masters swept away for ever and themselves safe and free out of the hateful land where they had been slaves for hundreds of years  you cannot surely my friends have heard that glorious story and forgotten it again already  i hope not for god knows that tale of the jews coming safe through the red sea has a deep and blessed meaning enough for you if you could but see it  but some of you may be saying to yourselves  no doubt it is a very noble story and a man cannot help rejoicing at the poor jews escape and at the downfall of those cruel egyptians  it is a pleasant thought no doubt that if it were but for that once god interfered to help poor suffering creatures and rid them of their tyrants  but what has that to do with easter day and christs rising again  i will try to show you my friends  the jews passover is the same as our easterday as you know already  but they are not merely alike in being kept on the same day  they are alike because they are both of them remembrances and tokens of the lord jesus christs delivering men out of misery and slavery  for never forgetthough indeed in these strange times i ought rather to say i beseech you to read your bibles and seethat it was jesus christ himself who brought the jews out of egypt  st paul tells us so positively again and again  in 1 cor x 4 he tells us that it was christ who followed them through the wilderness  in verse 9 of the same chapter he says that it was christ himself whom they tempted in the wilderness  he was the angel of the covenant who went with them  he was the god of israel whom the elders of the jews saw a few weeks afterwards on mount sinai and under his feet a pavement like a sapphire stone  true the lord did not take flesh upon him till nearly two thousand years after  but from the very beginning of all things while he was in the bosom of the father he was the king of men  man was made in his image and therefore in the image of the father whose perfect likeness he isthe brightness of his glory and the express image of his person  it was he who took care of men guided and taught them and delivered them out of misery from the very beginning of the world  st paul says the same thing in many different ways all through the epistle to the hebrews  he says for instance that moses when he fled from pharaohs court in egypt esteemed the reproach of christ greater riches than the treasures of egypt for he endured as seeing him who is invisible the lord said the same thing of himself  he said openly that he was the person who is called all through the old testament the lord he asked the pharisees  what think ye of christ whose son is he they say unto him davids son  christ answered how then does david in spirit call him lord saying the lord said unto my lord sit thou on my right hand until i make thy foes thy footstool  so did christ declare that he himself who was standing there before them was the lord of david who had died hundreds of years before  he told them again that their father abraham rejoiced to see his day and saw it and was glad and when they answered in anger and astonishment thou art not yet fifty years old and hast thou seen abraham jesus said verily i say unto you before abraham was i am  i am the jews had no doubt whom he meant and we ought to have none either  for that was the very name by which god had told moses to call him when he was sent to the jews  thou shalt say unto them i am hath sent me to you  the jews i say had no doubt who jesus said that he was that he meant them to understand once and for all that he whom they called the carpenters son of nazareth was the lord god who brought their forefathers up out of the land of egypt on the night of the first passover  so they to show how reverent and orthodox they were and how they honoured the name of god took up stones to stone himas many a man who fancies himself orthodox and reverent would now if he dared stone the preachers who declare that the lord jesus christ is not changed since then that he is as able and as willing as ever to deliver the poor from those who grind them down and that he will deliver them whenever they cry to him with a mighty hand and a stretchedout arm and that easterday is as much a sign of that to us as the passover was for the jews of old  but my friends if christ the lord showed his love and power in behalf of poor oppressed wretches on that first passover surely he showed it a thousand times more on that first easterday  his great love helped the jews out of slavery and that same great love of his at this eastertide moved him to die and rise again for the sins of the whole world  in that first passover he delivered only one people  on the first easter he delivered all mankind  the jews were under cruel tyrants in the land of egypt  so were all mankind over the world when jesus came  the jews in egypt were slaves to worse things than the whip of their taskmasters they had slaves hearts as well as slaves bodies  they were kept down not only by the egyptians but by their own ignorance and idolatry and selfish division and foul sins  they were spiritually deadwithout a noble pure manful feeling left in them  their history makes no secret of that  the bible seems to take every care to let us see into what a miserable and brutal state they had fallen  christ sent moses to raise them out of that death to take them through the red sea as a sign that all that was washed away to be forgiven of god and forgotten by them and that from the moment they landed a free people on the farther shore they were to consider all their old life past and a new one begun  so they were baptized unto moses in the cloud and in the sea as st paul says  and now all was to be new  they had been fancying that they belonged to the egyptians now they had found out and had it proved to them by signs and wonders which they could not mistake that they belonged to the lord they had been brutal sinners  the lord began to teach them that they were to rise above their own appetites and passions  they had been worshipping only what they could see and handle  the lord began to teach them to worship hima person whom they could not see though he was always near them and watching over them  they had been living without independence fellowfeeling the sense of duty or love of order  the lord began to teach them to care for each other to help each other to know that they had a duty to perform towards each other for which they were accountable to him  they had owned no master except the egyptians whom they feared and obeyed unwillingly  the lord began to teach them to obey him loyally from trust and gratitude and love  they had been willing to remain sinners and brutes and slaves provided they could get enough to eat and drink  the lord began to teach them that his favour his protection were better than the fleshpots of egypt and that he was able to feed them where it seemed impossible to men to teach them that man does not live by bread alonecheap or dear my friends not by bread alone but by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of god does man live  that was the meaning of their being baptized in the cloud and in the sea  that was the meaning and only a very small part of the meaning of their passover  would you not think my friends that i had been speaking rather of our own baptism and of our own supper of the lord to which you have been all called to day and that i had been telling you the meaning of them  for when jesus the lord and king and head of mankind died and rose again he took away the sin of the world  he was the true passover the lamb without spot slain as the scripture tells us for the sins of the whole world  in the jews passover when the angel saw the lambs blood on the door of the house he passed by and spared everyone in it  so now  the blood of jesus the lamb of god is upon us and for his sake god is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness  but the lord rose again this day  and when he the lord the king and head of all men rose all men rose in him  as in adam all die says st paul even so in christ shall all be made alive  baptism is a sign of that to us as the going through the red sea and being baptized to moses in it was to the jews  the passing of the red sea said to the jews  you have passed now out of your old miserable state of slavery into freedom  the sins which you committed there are blotted out  you are taken into covenant with god  you are now gods people and nothing can lose you this love and care except your own sins your own unfaithfulness to him your own wilful falling back into the slavish and brutal state from which he has delivered you  and just so baptism says to us  your sins are forgiven you  you are taken into covenant with god  you are gods people gods family  you must forget and cast away the old adam the old slavish and savage pattern of man which your lord died to abolish the guilt of which he bore for you on his cross and you must rise to the new adam the new pattern of man which is created after god in righteousness and true holiness which the lord showed forth in his life and death and rising again  for now god looks on you not as a guilty and condemned race of beings but as a redeemed race his children for the sake of jesus christ the lamb of god who takes away the sins of the world  you have a right to believe that as human beings you are dead with christ to the old adam the old sinful brutal pattern of man  baptism is the sign of it to you every child let it or its parents be who they may is freely baptized as a sign that all that old pattern of man is washed away that they can and must have nothing to do with it henceforward that it is dead and buried and they must flee from it and forget it as they would a corpse  and the lords supper also is a sign to us that as human beings we are risen with christ to a new life  a new life is our birthright we have a right to live a new life  we have a duty to live a new life  we have a power if we will to live a new life such a life as we never could live if we were left to ourselves a noble just godly manful christlike godlike life bred and nourished in us by the spirit of christ  that is our right for we belong to him who lived that life himself and bought us our share in it with his own death and resurrection  that is our duty for if we share the lords blessings it can only be in order that we may become like the lord do you fancy that he died to leave us all no better than we are  his death would have had very little effect if that was all  no says st paul if you have a share in christ prove that you believe in your own share by becoming like christ  you belong to his kingdom and you must live as his subjects  he has bought for you a new and eternal life and you must use that life  if ye then be risen with christ seek those things that are above      and what are they love peace gentleness mercy pity truth faithfulness justice patience courage order industry duty obedience     all in short which is like jesus christ  for these are heavenly things these are above where christ sits at gods right hand  these are the likeness of god  that is gods character  let it be your character likewise  but again if it is our right and our duty to be like that it is also in our power  god would not have commanded us to be what he had not given us the power to be  he would not have told us to seek those things which are above if he had not intended us to find them wherefore it is written  ask and ye shall receive seek and ye shall find for if ye being evil know how to give good gifts to your children how much more shall your heavenly father give his holy spirit to those who ask him  this is the meaning of that text namely that god will give us the power of living this new and risen life which we are bound to live this is one of the gifts for men which the scripture tells us that christ received when he rose from the dead and ascended up on high this is one of the powers of which he spoke when after his resurrection he said that all power was given to him in heaven and earth  the lords supper is at once a sign of who will give us that gift and a sign that he will indeed give it us  the lords supper is the pledge and token to us that we all have a share in the likeness of christ the true pattern of man and that if we come and claim our share he will surely bestow it on us  he will renew and change and purify our hearts and characters in us day by day into the likeness of himself  he who is the eternal life of men will nourish us body soul and spirit with that everlasting life of his even as our bodies are nourished by that bread and wine  and if you ask me how  when you can tell me why a wheat grain cannot produce an oak or an acorn a wheat plant when you can tell me why our bodies are each of them the very same bodies which they were ten years ago though every atom of flesh and blood and bone in them has been changed when in short you or any other living man can tell me the meaning of those three words body life and growth then it will be time to ask that question  in the meantime let us believe that he who does such wonders in the life and growth of every blade of grass can and will do far greater wonders for the life and growth of us immortal beings made in his own likeness redeemed by his blood and so believe and thank and obey and wait till another and a nobler life to understand  and if we never understand at all what matter provided the thing be true   xxxivchristmasday    for unto us a child is born unto us a son is given and the government shall be on his shoulder  and his name shall be called wonderful counsellor the mighty god the father of an everlasting age the prince of peace  of the increase of his government and peace there shall be no end upon the throne of david and upon his kingdom to order it and to establish it with judgment and with justice henceforth even foreverisaiah ix 6 7  in the time when the prophet isaiah wrote this prophecy everything round him was exactly opposite to his words  the king of judaea the prophets country was not reigning in righteousness  he was an unrighteous and wicked governor  the princes and great men were not ruling in judgment  they were unjust and covetous they took bribes and sold justice for money  they were oppressors grinding down the poor and defrauding those below them  so that the weak and poor and needy had no one to right them no one to take their part  there was no man to feel for them and defend them and be a hidingplace and a covert for them from their cruel tyrants no man to comfort and refresh them as rivers of water refresh a dry place or the shadow of a great rock comforts the sunburnt traveller in the weary deserts  neither were these very poor oppressed people of the jews in a right state of mind  they were ignorant and stupid given to worship false gods  they had eyes and yet could not use them to see that as the psalm told us this morning the heavens declared the glory of god and the firmament showed his handiwork  they were worshipping the sun and moon and stars in stead of the lord god who made them they were brutish too and would not listen to teaching  they had ears and yet would not hearken with them to gods prophets  they were rash too living from hand to mouth discontented and violent as ignorant poor people will be in evil times  and they were stammerersnot with their tongue but with their minds and thoughts they were miserable but they could not tell why  they were full of discontent and longings but they could not put them into words they did not know how to pray how to open their hearts to god or to man  they knew of no one who could understand them and their sorrows they could not understand them themselves much less put them into words  they were altogether confused and stupefied just in the same state in a word as the poor negro slaves in america and the heathens ay and the christians too are in in all the countries of the world which do not know the good news of christmas day or have forgotten it and disobeyed it  but isaiah had gods spirit with him the holy spirit the spirit of holiness righteousness justice  and that holy spirit convinced him of sin and of righteousness and of judgment as he convinces every man who gives himself up humbly to gods teaching  first the spirit convinced isaiah of sin  he made him feel that the state of his country was wrong  and he made him feel why it was wrong namely because the men in it were wrong because they were thinking wrong notions feeling wrong feelings doing wrong things and that wrong was sin and that sin was falling short of being what a man was made and what every man ought to be namely the likeness and glory of god and that so his countrymen the jews one and all had sinned and come short of the glory of god  next he convinced isaiah of righteousness  he made isaiah feel and be sure that god was righteous that god was no unjust lord like the wicked king of the jews that such evil doings as are going on were hateful to him that all that covetousness oppression taking of bribes drunkenness deceit ignorance stupid rashness and folly of which the land was full were hateful to god  he must hate them for he was a righteous and a good god  they ought not to be there  for man every man from the king on his throne to the poor labourer in the field was meant to be righteous and good as god is  but how will it be altered thought isaiah to himself  what hope for this poor miserable sinful world  people are meant to be righteous and good  but who will make them so  the king and his princes are meant to be righteous and good but who will set them a pattern  when will there be a really good king who will be an example to all in authority who will teach men to do right and compel and force them not to do wrong  and then the holy spirit of god answered that anxious question of isaiahs and convinced him of judgment  yes he felt sure he did not know why he felt so sure  but he did feel sure gods spirit in his heart made him feel sure that in some way or other some day or other the lord god would come to judgment to judge the wicked princes and rulers of this world and cast them out  it must be so  god was a righteous god  he would not endure these unrighteous doings for ever  he was not careless about this poor sinful world and about all the sinful downtrodden ignorant men and women and children in it  he would take the matter into his own hands  he would show that he was lord and master  if kings would not reign in righteousness he would come and reign in righteousness himself  he would appoint princes under him who would rule in judgment  and he would show men what true righteousness was what the pattern of a true ruler was namely to be able to feel for the poor and the afflicted and the needy to understand the wants and sorrows and doubts and fears of the lowest and the meanest in short to be a man a true perfect man with a mans heart a mans pity a mans fellowfeeling in him  yes  the lord god would show himself  he would set his righteous king to govern  and yet isaiah did not know how but he saw plainly that it must be so that same righteous king who was to set the world right would be a man  it would be a man who was to be a hidingplace from the storm and a covert from the tempest  a man who would understand man and teach men their duty  then the eyes of the blind would see and the ears of those who heard should hearken for they would hear a loving human voice the voice of one who knew what was in man who could tell them just what they wanted to know and put his teaching into the shape in which it would sink most easily and deeply into their hearts  and then the hearts of the rash would understand knowledge and the tongue of the stammerers would speak plainly  there will be no more confused cries from poor ignorant brutish oppressed people like the cries of dumb beasts in pain for he who was coming would give them words to utter their sorrows in  he would teach them how to speak to man and god he would teach them how to pray and when they prayed to say our father which art in heaven  then the vile person would be no more called bountiful or the churl called liberal  flattery and cringing to the evil great would be at an end  the people would have sense to see the truth about right and wrong and courage to speak it  men would then be held for what they really were and honoured and despised according to their true merits  yes said isaiah we shall be delivered from our wicked king and princes from the heathen assyrian armies who fancy that they are going to sweep us out of our own land with fire and sword from our own sins and ignorance and infidelity and rashness  we shall be delivered from them all for the righteous king is coming  nay he is here already if we could but see  his goingsforth have been from everlasting  he is ruling us nowthis wondrous child this son of god  unto us a child is born already unto us a son is given already  but one day or other he will be revealed and made manifest and shown to men as a man and then all the people shall know who he is and his name shall be called wonderful counsellor the mighty god the everlasting father the prince of peace  ah my friends isaiah saw all this but dimly and afar off  he saw as through a glass darkly  he perhaps thought at timesindeed we can have little doubt that he thoughtthat the good young prince hezekiah the might of god as his name means who was growing up in his day to be a deliverer and a righteous king over the jews was to set the world right  no doubt he had hezekiah in his mind when he said that a child was born to the jews and a son given to them just as of course he meant his own son who was born to him by the virgin prophetess when he called his name emmanuel that is to say god with us  but he felt that there was more in both things than that  he felt that his young wifes conceiving and bearing a son was a sign to him that some day or other a more blessed virgin would conceive and bear a mightier son  and so he felt that whether or not hezekiah delivered the jews from their sin and misery and ignorance god himself would deliver them  he knew by the spirit of god that his prophecy would come true and remain true for ever and so he died in faith not having received the promises god having prepared some better king for us and having fulfilled the words of his prophet in a way of which as far as we can see he never dreamed  yes  hezekiah failed to save the nation of the jews  instead of being the father of an everlasting age and having no end of his family on the throne of david his greatgrandchildren and the whole nation of the jews were swept away into captivity by the babylonians and no man of his house as jeremiah prophesied has ever since prospered or sat on the throne of david  but still isaiahs prophecy was true  true for us who are assembled here this day  for unto us a child is born unto us a son is given even the babe of bethlehem jesus christ the lord  the government shall indeed be upon his shoulder for it has been there always  for the father has committed all things to the son that he may be king of kings and lord of lords for ever  his name is indeed wonderful for what more wondrous thing was ever seen in heaven or in earth than that great love with which he loved us  he is not merely called the might of god as hezekiah wasfor a sign and a prophecy for he is the mighty god himself  he is indeed the counsellor for he is the light who lighteth every man who comes into the world  he is the father of an everlasting age  there were hopes that hezekiah would be so that he would raise the nation of the jews again to a reform from which it would never fall away  but these hopes were disappointed and the only one who fulfilled the prophecy is he who has founded his church for ever on the rock of everlasting ages and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it  hezekiah was to be the prince of peace for a few short years only  but the child who is born to us the son who is given to us is he who gave eternal peace to all who will accept it peace which this world can neither give nor take away and who will make that peace grow and spread over the whole earth till men shall beat their swords into ploughshares and their spears into pruninghooks and the nations shall not learn war any more  of the increase of his government and of his peace there shall be no end till the earth be full of the knowledge of the lord as the waters cover the sea and the spirit of god be poured out on all flesh to teach kings to reign in righteousness after the pattern of the king of kings the babe of bethlehem to make the rich and powerful do justice to teach the ignorant to give the rich wisdom to free the oppressed to comfort the afflicted to proclaim to all mankind the good news of christmas day the good news that there was a man born into the world on this day who will be a hidingplace from the storm a covert from the tempest like rivers of water in a dry place like the shadow of a great rock in a weary land even the man christ jesus who is able and willing to save to the uttermost those who come to god through him seeing that he has been tempted in all things like as we are yet without sin  yes my friends on that holy table stands the everlasting sign that isaiahs prophecy has been fulfilled to the uttermost  that bread and that wine declare to us that to us a child is born to us a son is given  they declare to us in a word that on this blessed day god was made man and dwelt among men and we beheld his glory the glory as of the onlybegotten of the father full of grace and truth  oh come to that table this day and there claim your share in the most precious body and blood of the divine child of bethlehem  come and ask him to pour out on you his spirit the spirit which he poured on hezekiah of old that he might fulfil his own name and live in the might of god  so will you live in the might of god  so you will be able to govern yourselves and your own appetites in righteousness and freedom and rule your own households or whatsoever god has set you to do in judgment  so you will see things in their true light as god sees them and be ready and willing to hear good advice and understand your way in this life and be able to speak your hearts out in prayer to god as to a loving and merciful father  and in all your afflictions let them be what they will you will have a comfort and a sure hope and a wellspring of peace and a hidingplace from the tempest even the man christ jesus who said  peace i leave with you my peace i give unto you let not your heart be troubled neither be ye afraid  the man christ jesus at whose birth the angels sang  glory to god in the highest and on earth peace goodwill toward men  now to him who on this day was born of the blessed virgin man of the substance of his mother yet god the son of god be ascribed with the father and the spirit all power glory majesty and dominion both now and for ever  amen    xxxvnew years day    1853  but now thus saith the lord that created thee o jacob and he that formed thee o israel fear not  for i have redeemed thee i have called thee by thy name thou art mine  when thou passest through the waters i will be with thee and through the rivers they shall not overflow thee  when thou walkest through the fire thou shalt not be burnt neither shall the flame kindle upon thee  for i am the lord thy god the holy one of israel thy saviour  i gave egypt for thy ransom ethiopia and seba for thee  since thou wast precious in my sight thou hast been honourable and i have loved thee therefore will i give men for thee and peoples for thy lifeisaiah xliii 14  the new year has now begun and i am bound to wish you all a happy new year  but i am sent here to do more than that to teach you how you may make your own new year a happy one or if not altogether a happy onefor sorrows may and must come in their turnyet still something better than a happy year namely a blessed year a year on which you will be able to look back this day twelvemonths and thank god for it thank god for the tears which you have shed in it as well as for the joy which you have felt thank god for the dark days as well as for the light thank god for what you have lost as well as what you have found and be able to say well this last year if it has not been a happy year for me at least it has been a blessed one for me  it has left me a stronger soberer wiser godlier better man than it found me  how then can you make the new year a blessed one for yourselves  i know but one way my friends  the ancient way  the bible way  the way by which abraham and jacob and david and all the holy men of old and all the saints and martyrs and righteous and godly among men made their lives blessed among themselves in spite of sorrow and misfortune and distress and persecution and torture and death itself the one only old way of being blessed which was from the beginning and will last for ever and ever through all worlds and eternities the way of the old saints which st paul sets forth in the eleventh chapter of the hebrews and that is faith  faith which is the substance of what we hope for the evidence of things not seen  faith of which it is written that the just shall live by his faith  but how can faith give you a blessed new year  in the same way in which it gave the old saints blessed years all their lives through and is giving them a blessed eternity now and for ever before the face of the lord jesus christ to which may god in his mercy bring us all likewise  they trusted in god  they had faith not in themselves like too many not in their own good works like too many not in their own faith in their own frames and feelings and assurances like too many but they had faith in god  it was faith in god which made one of them the great prophet isaiah write the glorious words which i have chosen for my text this day to show his countrymen the jews even while they were in the very lowest depths of shame and poverty and misfortune that god had not forgotten them that for those who trusted in him a blessed time was surely coming  and it was faith in god too which put it into the minds of the good men who choose these sunday lessons out of the bible to appoint such chapters as these to be read year by year at the coming in of the new year for ever  faith in god i say put that into their minds for those good men trusted in god that he would not change that hundreds and thousands of years would make no difference in his love that the promises made by his holy spirit to isaiah the prophet would stand true for ever and ever  and they trusted in god too that what he had spoken by the mouth of his holy apostles was true that after the blessed lord came down on earth there was to be no difference between jews and gentiles that the great and precious promises made by god to the jews were made also to all the nations of the earth that all things written in the old testament from the first chapter of genesis to the last of malachi were written not for the jews only but for english french italians germans russians for all the nations of the world that we english were gods people now just as much ay far more than the old jews were and that therefore the old testament promises as well as the new testament ones were part of our inheritance as members of christs church and therefore they appointed old testament lessons to be read in church to show us english what our privileges were what gods covenant and promise to us were  we as much as the jews are called by the name of the lord who created us  were we not baptised into his name at that font  has he not loved us  has he not heaped us english for hundreds of years past with blessings such as he never bestowed on any nation  has he not given men for us and nations for our life  while all the nations of the world have been at war slaying and being slain has he not kept this fair land of england free and safe from foreign invaders for more than eight hundred years  since the world was made perhaps such a thing was never heard of such a mercy shown to any nation that a great and rich country like this should be preserved for eight hundred years from invasion of foreign armies and all the horrors and miseries of war which have swept from time to time every other nation in the world with the besom of desolation  ay and but sixty years ago in the time of the french war when almost every other nation in europe was made desolate with fire and sword and war did not god preserve this land of england as he never preserved country before from all the miseries which were sweeping over other nations  oh strange and wonderful mercy of god that at the very time that the gospel was dying out all over europe it was being lighted again in england and that while the knowledge of god was failing elsewhere it was increasing here  oh strange and wonderful mercy of god who has given to us english now for one hundred and sixty years and more those very equal laws and freedom and rights of conscience for which so many other nations of europe are still crying and struggling in vain amid slavery and oppression and injustice and heavy burdens such as we here in england should not endure a week  oh strange and wonderful mercy of god who but three years ago when all the other nations of europe were shaken with wars and riots and seditions every mans hand against his neighbour kept this land of england in perfect peace and quiet by those just laws and government proving to us the truth of his own promises that those who seek peace by righteous dealings shall find it and that as isaiah says the fruit of justice is quietness and assurance for ever  and last but not least my friends is it not a sign a sign not to be mistaken of gods good will and mercy to us that now at this very time of all others when almost every country in europe is going to wrack and ruin through the folly and wickedness of their kings and rulers he should have given us here in england a queen who is a pattern of goodness and purity in ruling not only the nation but her own household to every wife and mother from the highest to the lowest and a prince whose whole heart seems set on doing good and on helping the poor and improving the condition of the labourers  my friends i say that we are unthankful and unfaithful  we do not thank god a hundredth part enough for the blessings which he has given us  we do not trust him a hundredth part enough for the blessings which he has in store for us  if some of us here could but see and feel for a single month how people are off abroad if they could change places with a french an italian a russian labourer it would teach them a lesson about gods goodness to england which they would not soon forget  may god grant that we may never have to learn that lesson in that way  god grant that we may never to cure us of our unthankfulness and want of faith and godless and unmanly grumbling and complaining be brought for a single week into the same state as some hundred millions of our fellowcreatures are in foreign parts  oh my friends let us thank god for the mercies of the past year  most truly he has fulfilled to england his promise given by the mouth of the prophet isaiah  when thou passest through the waters i will be with thee and through the rivers they shall not overflow thee  for i am the lord thy god the holy one thy saviour  thou hast been precious in my sight and i have loved thee  therefore will i give men for thee and peoples for thy life  away then with discontent and anxiety for the coming year  or rather let us be only discontented with ourselves  let us only be anxious about our own conduct  god cannot change  if anything goes wrong it will be not because he has left us but because we have left him  is it not written that all things work together for good to those who love god  then if things do not work together for good in this coming year it will be because we do not love god  do not let us say i am righteous but my neighbours are wicked and therefore i must be miserable neither let us lay the blame of our misfortunes on our rulers let us lay it on ourselves  what was the word of the lord to the jews in a like case  what means this proverb which you take up saying the fathers have eaten sour grapes and the childrens teeth are set on edge  it is not so o house of israel  the son shall not die for the iniquity of his father nor the father for the iniquity of the son  the soul that sinneth it shall die saith the lord  oh my friends take this to heart solemnly in the year to come our troubles more of them at least than we fancy are our own fault and not our neighbours or the governments or anyones else  and those which are not our own fault directly are so in this way that they are sent as sharp and wholesome lessons to us and if we were what we ought to be we should not want those lessons  do not fancy that that is a sad and doleful thought to begin the new year with god forbid  it would be doleful and sad indeed if any one of us in spite of all his rightdoing might be plunged into any hopeless misery through the fault of other people over whom he has no control  but thanks be to the lord it is not so  we are his children and he cares for each and every one of us separately  each and every one of us has to answer for himself alone face to face with his god day by day every man must bear his own burden and to every one of us who love god all things will work together for good it is and was and always will be as abraham well knew far from god to punish the righteous with the wicked  the judge of all the earth will do right  none of us who repents and turns from the sins he sees round him and in him none of us who prays for the light and guiding of gods spirit none of us who struggles day by day to keep himself unspotted from this evil world and live as gods son without scandal or illname in the midst of a sinful and perverse generation none of us who does that but gods blessing will rest on him  what ruins others will only teach and strengthen him what brings others to shame will only bring him to honour and make his righteousness plain to be seen by all that god may be glorified in his people  let the coming year be what it may to the holy the humble the upright the godly it will be a blessed year fulfilling the blessed promises of the lord that those who trust in him shall never be confounded  oh my friends consider but this one thing that the almighty god who made all heaven and earth has bid us trust in him  and when he bids us is it not a sin an insult to him not to trust himnot to believe his words to us  put thou thy trust in the lord and be doing good dwell in the land working where he has set thee and verily thou shalt be fed  thou shalt not be afraid for the terror by night nor for the arrow that flieth by day  a thousand shall fall by thy side and ten thousand at thy right hand  but it shall not come nigh thee  only with thine eyes shalt thou behold and see the reward of the wicked  because thou hast made the lord thy refuge no plague shall come nigh thy dwelling  thou shalt call upon me i will answer thee  because thou hast set thy love on me i will deliver thee with long life will i satisfy thee and show thee my salvation  my friends these words are in the book of psalms  either they are the most cruel words that ever were spoken on earth to tempt poor wretches into vain security and fearful disappointment or they are what are theythe sure and everlasting promise of our father in heaven to us his children  we have only to ask for them and we shall receive them to claim them and they will be fulfilled to us for he who spared not his own son but freely gave him for us will he not with him likewise freely give us all things and make by his fatherly care and providence and education all our new years blessed new years whether or not they are happy ones    xxxvithe deluge    my spirit shall not always strive with mangenesis vi 3  last sunday we read in the first lesson of the fall  this sunday we read of the flood the firstfruits of the fall  it is an awful and a fearful story  and yet if we will look at it by faith in god it is a most cheerful and hopeful storya gospela good news of salvationlike every other word in the bible from beginning to end  ay and to my mind the most hopeful words of all in it are the very ones which at first sight look most terrible the words with which my text begins  and the lord said my spirit shall not always strive with man  for is it not good newsthe good news of all newsthe news which every poor soul who is hungering and thirsting after righteousness longs to hear and when they hear it feel it to be the good news the only news which can give comfort to fallen and sorrowful men tied and bound with the chain of their sins that gods spirit does strive at all with man  that god is looking after men  that god is yearning over sinners as the heart of a father yearns over his rebellious child as the heart of a faithful and loving husband yearns after an unfaithful wife  that god does not take a disgust at us for all our unworthiness but wills that none should perish but that all should come to repentance  oh joyful news  man may be as the text says that he was in the time of noah so low fallen that he is but flesh like the brutes that perish the imaginations of his heart may be only evil continually his spirit may be dead within him given up to all low and fleshly appetites and passions anger and greediness and filth and yet the pure and holy spirit of god condescends to strive and struggle with him to convince him of sin and make him discontented and ashamed at his own brutishness and shake and terrify his soul with the wholesome thought  i am a sinneri am wrongi am living such a life as god never meant me to livei am not what i ought to bei have fallen short of what god intended me to be  surely some evil will come to me from this then the holy spirit convinces man of righteousness  he shows man that what he has fallen short of is the glory of god that man was meant to be as st paul says the likeness and glory of god to show forth gods glory and beauty and righteousness and love in his own daily life as a lookingglass though it is not the sun still gives an image and likeness of the sun when the sun shines on it and shows forth the glory of the sunbeams which are reflected on it  and then the holy spirit convinces man of judgment  he shows man that god cannot suffer men or angels or any other rational spirits and immortal souls to be unlike himself that because he is the only and perfect good whatsoever is unlike him must be bad because he is the only and perfect love who wills blessings and good to all whatsoever is unlike him must be unloving hating and hatefula curse and evil to all around it because he is the only perfect maker and preserver whatsoever is unlike him must be in its very nature hurtful destroying deadlya disease which injures this good world and which he will therefore cut out burn up destroy in some way or other if it will not submit to be cured  for this my friends is the meaning of gods judgments on sinners this is why he sent a flood to drown the world of the ungodly this is why he destroyed sodom and gomorrah this is why he swept away the nations of canaan this is why he destroyed jerusalem his own beloved city and scattered the jews over the face of the whole earth unto this day this is why he destroyed heathen rome of old and why he has destroyed from time to time in every age and country great nations and mighty cities by earthquake and famine and pestilence and the sword because he knows that sin is ruin and misery to all that it is a disease which spreads by infection among fallen men and that he must cut off the corrupt nation for the sake of preserving mankind as the surgeon cuts off a diseased limb that his patients whole body may not die  but the surgeon will not cut off the limb as long as there is a chance of saving it  he will not cut it off till it is mortified and dead and certain to infect the whole body with the same death or till it is so inflamed that it will inflame the whole body also and burn up the patients life with fever  till then he tends it in hope tries by all means to cure it  and so does the lord the lord jesus the great physician whom his father has appointed to heal and cure this poor fallen world  as long as there is hope of curing any man any nation any generation of men so long will his spirit strive lovingly and hopefully with man  for see the blessed words of the text  my spirit shall not always strive with man  this must end  this must end at some time or other  this battle between my spirit and the wicked and perverse wills of these sinners this battle between the love and the justice and the purity which i am trying to teach them and the corruption and the violence with which they are filling the earth  but there is no passion in the lord no spite no sudden rage like the brute passionate anger of weak man  our anger if we are not under the guiding of gods spirit conquers our wills carries us away makes us say and do on the momentgod forgive us for itwhatsoever our passion prompts us the lords anger does not conquer him  it does not conquer his patience his love his steadfast will for the good of all  even when it shows itself in the flood and the earthquake even though it break up the fountains of the great deep and destroy from off the earth both man and beast yet it is and was and ever will be the anger of the lamba patient a merciful and a loving anger  therefore the lord says  yet his days shall be one hundred and twenty years  one hundred and twenty years more he would endure those corrupt and violent sinners in the hope of correcting them one hundred and twenty years more would gods spirit strive with men one hundred and twenty years more the longsuffering of god as st peter says would wait if by any means they would turn and repent oh wonderful love and condescension of god  god waits for man  the holy one waits for the unholy  the creator waits for the work of his own hands  the wrathful god who repents that he has made man upon the earth waits one hundred and twenty years for the very creatures whom he repents having made  does this seem strange to usunlike our notions of god  if it is strange to us my friends its being strange is only a proof of how far we have fallen from the likeness of god wherein man was originally created  if we were more like god then the accounts of gods longsuffering and mercy and repentance which we read in the bible would not be so strange to us  we should understand what god declares of himself by seeing the same feelings working in ourselves which he declares to be working in himself  and if we were more righteous and more loving we should understand more how gods will was a loving and a righteous will how his justice was his mercy and his mercy his justice instead of dividing his substance who is one god by fancying that his mercy and his justice are two different attributes which are at times contrary the one to the other  we read nothing here about gods absolute purposes and fixed decrees whereof men talk so often making a god in their own fallen image after their own fallen likeness  the lord the word of god of whom the bible tells us does not think it beneath his dignity to say  it repenteth me that i have made man  different truly from that false god which man makes in his own image  man is proud and he fancies that god is proud man is selfwilled and selfish and he fancies that god is selfwilled and selfish man is arbitrary and obstinate and determined to have his own way just because it is his own way and then he fancies that god is arbitrary and obstinate and determines to have his own way and will just because it is his own way and will  but wilt thou know oh vain man why god will have his own way and will  because his way is a good way and his will a loving will because the lord knows that his way is the only path of life and joy and blessing to man and beast yes and to the very hairs of our head which are all numbered and to the sparrows whereof not one falls to the ground without our fathers knowledge because his will is a loving will which wills that none should perish but that all should come and be saved in body soul and spirit  he will have his own will done not because it is his own will but because it is good good for men  and if men will change and repent then will he change and repent also  if man will resist the striving of gods spirit with him then will the lord say  it repenteth me that i have made that man  but if a man will repent him of the evil then god will repent him of the evil also  if a man will let gods spirit convince him and will open his ears and hear and open his eyes and see and open his heart to take in the loving thoughts and the right thoughts and the penitent and humble thoughts which do come to himyou know they do come to you all at timesthen the lord will repent also as he repents and repent concerning the evil which he has declared concerning that man  so said the lord who cannot change the same yesterday today and for ever the same now that he was in the days of the flood to jeremiah the prophet when he moved him to go down to the potters house and watch him there at his work  and the potter made a vesselsomething which would be useful and good for a certain purposebut the clay was marred in the hand of the potter  he was good and skilful but there was a fault in the clay  what did he do  throw the clay away as useless  no  he made it again another vessel  he was determined to make not anything but something useful and good  and if the clay being faulty failed him once he would try again  he would change his purpose and plan but not his right will to make good and useful vessels them he would make if not by one way then by another  and jeremiah watched him and as he watched the spirit of the lord came on him and taught him that that poor potters way of working with his clay was a pattern and likeness of the lords work on earth  oh shame that this great parable should have been twisted by men to make out that god is an arbitrary tyrant who works by a brute necessity  it taught jeremiah the very opposite  it taught him what it ought to teach us that god does change because man changes that gods steadfast will is the good of men and therefore because men change their weak selfwilled course and fall and seek out many inventions therefore god changes to follow them like a good shepherd tracking and following the lost and wandering sheep up and down right and left over hill and dale if by any means he may find him and bring him home on his shoulders to the fold calling upon the angels of god  rejoice with me for i have found my sheep which i had lost  this is the likeness of god  the good and loving will of a father following his wandering children  the likeness of a loving father repenting that he hath brought into the world sinful children to be a misery to themselves and all around them and yet for the same reason loving those children striving with their wicked wills to the very last giving them one last chance and time for repentance as the lord did to those evil men of the old world sending to them noah a preacher of righteousness if by any means they would turn from their sins and be saved  ay not only preaching to their ears by noah but to their hearts by his spirit as st peter tells us he himself christ the lord went himself by his spirit to those very sinners before the flood and strove to bring them to their reason again  by his spirit by the very same one and only holy spirit of god st peter says by which christ himself was raised from the dead did he try to raise the souls of those sinners before the flood from the death of sin to the life of righteousness  but they would not  they were disobedient  their wills resisted his will to the last and then the flood came and swept them all away  and so the first work of the heavenly workman was marred in the making by no fault of his but by the fault of what he made  he made men persons rational beings with wills that they might be willingly like him  but they used those wills to be unlike him to rebel against him and to fill the earth with violence and corruption  and so for the good of all mankind to come he had to sweep them all away  but of that same sinful clay he made another vessel as it seemed good to him even noah and his sons whom he saved that he might carry on the race of the sons of god unto this day  and after that again my friends in a day more dark and evil still when the earth was again corrupt before god and filled with violence when all flesh had corrupted his way upon the earth so that as st paul said of them there was none that did good no not one  then the same lord when he saw that all the world lay in wickedness and that the clay of humankind was marred in the hands of the potter then did he cast away that clay as reprobate and useless and destroy mankind off the face of the earth  not so then when there was none to help his own arm brought salvation and his own righteousness sustained him he trod the winepress alone and of the people there was none with him  his own righteousness sustained him  his perfectly good and righteous will never failed him for a moment man he would save and man he saved  if none else could do it he would do it himself  he would bring salvation with his own arm  he would fulfil his fathers will which is that none should perish he would be made flesh and dwell among men that man might behold the likeness of god the father full of grace and truth and see what they were meant to be  then in him in jesus who wept over jerusalem was fully revealed and shown the likeness and glory of the lord the lord in whose image man was made who walked and spoke with adam in the garden who was not ashamed to say that it repented him that he had made man whom ezekiel saw upon his throne and as it were upon the throne the appearance of the likeness of a man whom daniel saw and knew him to be the son of man  not a man then of flesh and blood but the eternal word of god in whose image man was made who could be loving and merciful longsuffering and repenting him of the evil but never of the good  he came and he swept away as he had told the apostles that he would do by such afflictions as man had never seen since the beginning of the world until then that roman world with all its devilish systems and maxims whereby the nations were kept down in slavery and sin and he founded a new heaven and a new earth wherein dwell righteousness even this holy catholic church to which we all belong this day  yes my friends this is our gospel our good news that there is a god whose spirit strives with sinners to change them into his own likeness  a god who is no dark obstinate inexorable fate whose arbitrary decrees must come to pass but a loving and merciful god longsuffering and who repenteth him of the evil who repents him of the evil which is in man and hates it and has sworn to himself to fight against it till he has put all enemies under his foot and cast out of his kingdom all things which offend  who repents him of the evil in man  but who will never again repent him of having made man for then he would repent of having become man he would repent of having been conceived of the holy ghost he would repent of having been born of the virgin mary he would repent of having been crucified dead and buried he would repent of having risen from the dead and ascended up into heaven in his mans body and soul and spirit he would repent of sitting on the right hand of god he would repent of coming to judge the quick and the dead he would repent of having done his fathers will on earth even as he did it from all eternity in the bosom of the father  for he is a man and even as the reasonable soul and body are one man so god and man are one christ  as man he did his fathers will in judaea of old as man he will judge the world as man he rules it now as man st john saw him fifty years after he ascended to heaven and his eyes were like a flame of fire and his hair like fine wool and he was girt under the bosom with a golden girdle and his voice was like the sound of many waters as man he said  fear not  i am the first and the last i am he that liveth and was dead and behold i am alive for evermore amen and have the keys of death and hell  yes  this is the gospel the good news for fallen man that there is a man in the midst of the throne of god to whom all power is given in heaven and earth that the fate of the world and all that is thereinthe fate of suns and starsthe fate of kings and nationsthe fate of every publican and harlot and heathen and outcastthe fate of all who are in death and hell depends alike upon the sacred heart of jesus the heart which groaned at the tomb of lazarus his friend the heart which wept over jerusalem the heart which said to the blessed magdalene the woman who was a sinner  go in peace thy sins are forgiven thee the heart which now yearns after every sinful and wandering soul in his church and all over the earth of god crying to you all  why will ye die  have i any pleasure in the death of him that dieth saith the lord and not rather that he should turn from his wickedness and live  come unto me all ye that are weary and heavyladen and i will give you rest  oh my friends wonderful as my words areas wonderful to me who speak them as they can be to you who hear themyet they are true  true for on that table stand the bread and wine whereof he himself said standing upon this very earth which he himself had made  this is my body which is given for you this cup is the new covenant in my blood which i will give for the life of the world    xxxviithe kingdom of god    the kingdom of god is within youluke xvii 21  these words are in the second lesson for this mornings service  let us think a little about them  what they mean must depend on what the kingdom of god means for that is the one thing about which they speak  now the kingdom of god is very often spoken of in the new testament indeed it is the thing it speaks of above all others  it was the thing which our lord went about preaching  it was the thing of which he spoke in his parables likening the kingdom of god first to one thing then to another that he might make men understand what it was like  now it is worth remarking that wei mean even religious people speak very little about the kingdom of god nowadays  one hears less about it than about any other words almost which stand in the new testament  both in sermons and in religious books and in the talk of godly people one hears the kingdom of god spoken of very seldom one hears words about the church which are very good and true but very little if anything about the kingdom of god though both st paul and st john and the blessed lord himself speak of the two together as if they could not be parted as if one could not think of the one without thinking of the other  and we hear words about the gospel too some of them very good and true and others i am sorry to say very bad and false  but true or false they are not often joined now in mens minds or mouths or books with the kingdom of god  but the new testament joins them almost always  it says that gospel must be good news  therefore the gospel must be good news about something  but about what  we hear all manner of answers nowadays but we hear the right one very seldom  people talk of the gospel as if it only meant the good news that one man can be saved here and another man can be saved there  and that is good news certainly  it is good and blessed news to hear that any one poor sinner can be saved from sin and from the wages of sin  but the holy scriptures when they talk of the gospel call it the gospel of the kingdom of god  and i think it best and wisest to call it oftenest what the holy scripture calls it oftenest and to try and understand first of all what that means what the good news of the kingdom of god is  and to understand that we must first understand what the kingdom of god is  but some may answer holy scripture speaks of the gospel of salvation  true it does once or twice  but what does that show is that a different gospel from the gospel of the kingdom of god are there two gospels  surely not  else why would holy scripture speak so often of the gospelthe good news by itself without any word after to show what it was about  it says often simply the gospel because there is but one gospel and as st paul says if any man or angel preach any other than that one let him be anathema  therefore the gospel of salvation must be the same as the gospel of the kingdom of god and therefore it seems to me that salvation and the kingdom of god must be one and the same thing  now do you think so  when i say the kingdom of god is salvation do you think it is  have you even any clear notion of what i mean when i say it  some of you have not i am afraid you cannot see at first sight what salvation and the kingdom of god have to do with each other  and why  you think salvation means being saved from hell and going to heaven when you die  and so it does  but i trust in god and in gods holy scripture that it means a great deal more for i think it means being unfit for hell and fit for heaven before we die  at least so says the church catechism which teaches every little child to thank his heavenly father for having brought him into such a state of salvation in this life even while he is young  thanks be to the spirit of god which taught our forefathers to put these precious words into the church catechism to guard us against falling into the very same mistake as the pharisees of old fell into when they asked our lord when the kingdom of god was to come  and believe me it is easy enough and common enough to fall into the same mistake  for what was their mistake  they fancied that the kingdom of god was not yet come  and do not most of you think the same  they did not deny of course that god was almighty and could rule and govern all mankind if he chose so to do  but they did not believe that he was ruling and governing all mankind then because they did not know what his rule and government were like  now st paul tells us what gods kingdom is like  the kingdom of god he says is righteousness and peace and joy in the holy spirit  so wherever there is righteousness and peace and joy in the holy spirit there the kingdom of god is  but his kingdom over what  over dumb animals or over men  over men certainly for dumb animals cannot have righteousness or joy in the holy spirit  but over what part of a man  over his body or over his spirit as we call it nowadays  over his spirit certainly for it is only our spirits which can be righteous or peaceful or joyful in gods spirit  therefore gods kingdom of which st paul speaks is a kingdom a government over the souls the spirits of men  now are our spirits the inward part of us or our bodies  our spirits certainly  we all say and say rightly that our bodies are the outward part of us and that our spirits are within us  now do you not see how that agrees exactly with the blessed lords saying in the text behold the kingdom of god is within youthat is in your spirits because it is righteousness and peace and joy in the holy spirit and these are things which only our souls not our bodies at all can have  but these pharisees were not righteous they were wicked and hypocritical men  was the kingdom of god within them  the blessed lord said plainly that it was  he said not the kingdom of god is within some peoples hearts or the kingdom of god is within the hearts of believers or the kingdom of god might be within you if you liked  but he said that the kingdom of god was then and there within the hearts of those wicked and unbelieving pharisees  now how could that be  in the same way that some time before that as st luke tells us the power of the lord was present to heal those same pharisees and they were for the time amazed and glorified god and were filled with fear at his mighty works but not healed  their souls were not cured of their sin and folly by any means for we find in the very next chapter that because jesus cured a palsied man on the sabbathday they were filled with madness and consulted together how to kill him  for my friends as it was with them so it is with us  gods kingdom is within every one of us but it may make us worse as well as make us better  it may fill us with righteousness and peace and joy in the holy spirit or it may fill us as it filled the pharisees with madness and hatred of religion and of goodness as it is written that the gospel may be a savour of death unto death to us as well as a savour of life unto life  and it depends on us which it shall be  this is what i mean  gods kingdom is within each of us  god is the king of our hearts and souls our baptism tells us so and it tells us truly  and because god is the king of each of our hearts he comes everlastingly to take possession of our hearts and continues claiming our souls for his own  he speaks in our hearts day and night whenever we have a good thought he speaks in our hearts and says to us  i am the king of your spirit  it must obey me  i put this good thought into your hearts and you are bound to follow that good thought because it is a law of my kingdom  or again god speaks in our hearts and says to us  you have done this wrong thing  you know that it is wrong  you know that it is an offence against my law  why have you rebelled against me  or again when we see anyone do a good a loving or a noble action or when we read of the lives of good and noble men and women above all when we read or hear of the character and doings of the blessed lord jesus then and there god speaks in our hearts and stirs us up to love and admire these noble and blessed examples and says to us  that is right  that is beautiful  that is what men should do  that is what you should do  why are you not like that man  why are you not like my saints  why are you not like me the lord jesus christ  you all surely know what i mean  you know that i do not mean that you hear a voice speaking to your ears but that thoughts and feelings come into your heart without you putting them there  ay often enough in spite of your trying to drive them away  now those right thoughts are the kingdom of god within you  they are the voice of the lord jesus christ speaking by his holy spirit to your spirit and telling you that he is your king and that you ought to obey him and that obeying him means being righteous and good as he is righteous and good and calling on you to give up your own wills and fancies and to do his will and let him make you holy even as he is holy  that i say is the kingdom of god showing itself within you telling you that god is your king and telling you how to obey him  but what if a man will not hear that voice  what if a man rebels proudly against the good thoughts that rise in his mind and tries to forget them and grows angry with them angry with the preacher the church service the bible itself because they will go on reminding him of what he knows in his heart to be right  what if those good thoughts only make him the more stubborn and determined to do his own pleasure and follow his own interests and do his own will  do you not see that to that man gods kingdom over his heart is a savour of death unto deaththat his finding out that god is his lord only makes him more rebelliousthat gods spirit striving with his heart to bring it right only stirs up his stubbornness and self will and makes him go the more obstinately wrong  oh my friends this is a fearful thought  that man can become worse by gods loving desire to make him better  but so it is  so it was with pharaoh of old  all gods pleading with him by the message of moses and aaron by the mighty plagues which god sent on egypt only hardened pharaohs heart  the lord god spoke to him and his message only lashed pharaohs proud and wicked will into greater fury and rebellion as a vicious horse becomes the more unmanageable the more you punish it  therefore it is said plainly in scripture that the lord hardened pharaohs heart not as some fancy that the lords will was to make pharaoh hardhearted and wicked  god forbid  the lord is the fountain of good only and not he but we and the devil make evil  but the more the lord pleaded with pharaoh and tried to bend his will the more selfwilled he became  the more the lord showed pharaoh that the lord was king the more he hated the kingdom and will of god the more he determined to be king himself and to obey no law but his own wicked fancies and pleasures and asked who is the lord that i should obey him  and so it was with the pharisees  when they found out that the kingdom of god was within them that god was the king of their hearts and minds and was trying to change their feelings and alter their opinions it only maddened them  they were determined not to change they were determined not to confess that they had been wrong and had mistaken the meaning of holy scripture  they were too proud to confess what jesus told them that they were no better than the poor ignorant common people whom they despised  and yet they knew in their hearts that he was right  when the lord told them the parable of the vineyard they answered god forbid they felt at once that the parable had to do with themthat they were the wicked husbandmen on whom he said their master would take vengeance  but that only maddened them the more till they ended by crucifying the lord of glory upon a pretence which they knew was a false and lying one and when judas iscariot said i have betrayed the innocent blood they did not deny that the lord jesus was innocent all they answered was what is that to us  they were determined to have their own way whether he was innocent or not  they had seen gods likeness  they had seen what god was like by seeing the conduct of his only begotten son jesus christ  and when they saw gods likeness they hated it because it was not like themselves  and the more god strove with their hearts and tried to make them obey him the more in short they felt his kingdom within them the more they hated that kingdom of god within them because it reproved them and convinced them of sin  oh my friends young people especially beware beware lest you fall into the same miserable state of mind  the kingdom of god is within you  the holy spirit by which you were regenerate in holy baptism is stirring and pleading with your hearts making you happy when you do right unhappy when you do wrong  oh listen to those good thoughts and feelings within you  never fancy that they are your own thoughts and feelings  else you will fancy that you can put them away and take them back again when you choose to change and become religious  do not let the devil deceive you into that notion these good thoughts and feelings are the spirit of god  they are the signs that the kingdom of god is within you that god is king and master of your hearts and minds and that you cannot keep him out of them  but that he can enter into them when he likes and put right thoughts into them  but though you cannot prevent god and his kingdom entering into you you can refuse to enter into it  alas alas how many of you shut your ears to gods voice  try to drive gods spirit out of your own hearts try to forget what is right because it is unpleasant to remember it and say to yourselves i will have my own way  i will try and forget what the clergyman said in his sermon or what i learnt at school  i am grown up now and i will do what i like  oh my friends is it a wise or a hopeful battle to fight against the living god  grieve not the holy spirit of god whereby ye are sealed to the day of redemption lest he go away from you and leave you to yourselves spiritually dead twice dead plucked up by the roots whose end is to be burned  grieve him not lest he depart and with him both the father and the son  and then you will not know right from wrong because god the holy spirit the spirit of right has left you  you will not know what a man ought to be or do because the son of man the perfect likeness of god and therefore the pattern of man has left you  you will not know that god the father is your father but only fancy him a stern taskmaster reaping where he has not sown and requiring of you more than you are bound to pay because god the father has left you  you may indeed keep out ugly thoughts for a time  you may go on wantonly in sin and worldliness and selfwill  and then by way of falling deeper still you may take up with some false sort of religion which makes people fancy that they know god and are one of his elect while in works they deny him and their sinful heart is unchanged  then your mouth indeed may be full of secondhand talk about the gospel  but what gospel  i call that a devils gospel and not gods gospel which makes men fancy that they may continue in sin that grace may abound  i call any grace which leaves men in their sins the devils grace and not gods grace  certainly it is not the gospel of the kingdom of god for if it was it would produce in men the fruits of that kingdom righteousness and peace and joy in the holy spirit instead of the fruits which we see too often bigotry and selfconceit bitterness evilspeaking and hard judgments and joy in a most unholy and damnable spirit not to mention covetousness and deceitfulness or even in some cases wantonness and lust  and yet such men will often fancy that they belong especially to god and doubt whether he will have mercy on any who do not exactly agree with them while in reality god and his kingdom have utterly left their hearts and they are as blind and dark as the beasts which perish  may god preserve us from that second death which comes on sinners when after a sinful youth their terrified souls begin to cry out in fear at the sight of their sins and they instead of casting away their sins keep their sins or change old sins for more respectable and safe new ones and drug their souls with false doctrines as foolish nurses quiet childrens crying by giving them poisonous medicines  i know men who have fallen i really fear at times into that state of mind and are like those pharisees of whom our lord said  ye serpents ye generation of vipers how can ye escape the damnation of hell  even for them it is not too late  but let them recollect if the kingdom of god is within them if they have any feelings of right and wrong left in them that their covetousness and lying and slandering and conceit is fighting against god that these are just what god desires to cast out of them and that unless they give up their hearts to god and let him cast out their sins and be converted and become like little children gentle humble teachable friendly and kindhearted obedient to their heavenly father god will cast them out of his kingdom among the things which offend and bring a bad name on religion among those very profligate and open sinners whom they are so ready to despise and curse    xxxviiithe light    but all things that are reproved are made manifest by the light  for whatsoever doth make manifest is light  wherefore he saith awake thou that sleepest and arise from the dead and christ shall give thee lightephesians v 13 14  st paul has been telling the ephesians who they are that they are gods dear children  to whom they belong to christ who has given himself for them  what they ought to do to follow gods likeness and live in love  that they are light in the lord and are to walk as children of the light and have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness but rather reprove them  as much as to say  do not believe those who tell you that there is no harm in young people going wrong together before marriage provided they intend to marry after all  do not believe those who tell you that there is no harm in filthy words provided you do not do filthy things and no harm in swearing provided you do not mean the curses which you speak  do not believe those who tell you there is no harm in poaching another mans game provided you do not steal his poultry or anything except his game  do not believe those who tell you that there is no harm in being covetous provided you do not actually cheat your neighbours and that the sin lies not in being covetous at all but in being more covetous than the law will let you be  do not believe those who say to you that you may keep dark thoughts spite suspicion envy cunning covetousness in your hearts day after day year after year provided you do not openly act on them so as to do your neighbours any great and notorious injury  plenty of people will tell you so and try to deceive you with vain words and give you arguments and texts of scripture perhaps to prove that sin is not sin and that the children of light may do the works of darkness  but do not believe them says st paul  they are deceivers and their words are vain  these are the very things which bring down gods wrath on his disobedient children  these are the bad ways which make young people when they are married despise and distrust and quarrel with each other and live miserable lives together as children of wrath peevish and wrathful and discontented with each other because they feel that god is angry with them just as adam in the garden when he felt that he had sinned and that god was wroth with him laid the blame on his wife and accused her whom he ought to have loved and protected and excused  these are the bad ways which make people ashamed when they meet a good and a respectable person make them afraid of being overheard afraid of being found out fond of haunting low and outoftheway places where they will not be seen fond of prowling and lurching out at night after their own sinful pleasures because the darkness hides them from their neighbours and seems to hide them from themselves though it cannot hide them from god  these are the sins which make men silent cunning dark sour doubletongued afraid to look anyone full in the face unwilling to make friends afraid of opening their minds to anyone because they have something on their minds which they dare not tell their neighbours which they dare not even tell themselves but think about as little as they can help  do you not know what i mean  do you not often see it in others  have you never felt it in yourselves when you have done wrong that dark feeling within which shows itself in dark looks  you talk of a darklooking man or a dark sort of person and you mean do you not a man whom you cannot make out who does not wish you to make him out who keeps his thoughts and his feelings to himself and is never frank or free except with bad companions when the world cannot see him who goes about hanging down his head and looking out of the corners of his eyes as if he were afraid of the very sunshineafraid of the light  we know that such a man has something dark on his mind  we call him a dark sort of man  and we are right  we say of him what st paul says of him in this very epistle when he says that sin is darkness and sinful works the deeds of darkness and that goodness and righteousness and truth are light the very light of god and the spirit of god  our reason our common sense which is given us by gods spirit the spirit of light makes us use the right words the same words as st paul does and call sin darkness  but rather reprove these dark works says st paul that is look at them and see that they are utterly worthless and damnable  and how all things that are reproved he says are made manifest by the light  for whatsoever makes manifest is light  whatsoever makes manifest that is makes plain and clear  whatsoever makes you see anything or person in heaven or earth as it really is whatsoever makes you understand more about anything whatsoever shows you more what you are where you are what you ought to do whatsoever teaches you any single hint about your duty to god or man or the dumb beasts which you tend or the soil which you till or the business and line of life which you ought to follow whatsoever shows you the right and the wrong in any matter the truth and the falsehood in any matter the prudent course and the imprudent course in any matter in a word whatsoever makes your mind more clear about any single thing in heaven or earth is light  for mind st paul does not say whatsoever is light makes things plain but whatsoever makes things plain is light  that is saying a great deal more thank god for if he had said whatsoever is light makes things clear we should have been puzzled to know what was light we should have been tempted to settle for ourselves what was light  and god knows people in all ages and people of all religions christians as well as heathens have been tempted to say so and to misread this text till they said  whatsoever agrees with our doctrine is light of course but all other teaching is darkness and comes from the devil and so they oftentimes blasphemed against gods holy spirit by calling good actions bad ones just because they were done by people who did not agree with them and fell into the same sin as the pharisees of old who said that the lord cast out devils by beelzebub the prince of the devils  but st paul says whatsoever makes anything clearer to you is light  there is the gospel and there is the good news of salvation again coming out as it does all through st pauls epistles at every turn just where poor sinful dark man least expects it  for what does st paul say in the very next verse  wherefore he says arise from the dead and christ shall give thee light  christ shall give thee light  oh blessed news  christ gives us the light and therefore we need not be afraid of it but trust it and welcome it  and christ gives us the light therefore we have not to hunt and search after it for he will give it us  let us think over these two matters and see whether there is not a gospel and good news in them for all wretched ignorant sinful dark souls just as much as for those who are learned and wise or bright and full of peace  christ gives us the light  this agrees with what st john says that he is the light who lights every man who comes into the world  and it agrees also with what st james says  be not deceived my beloved brethren  every good gift and every perfect gift is from above and cometh down from god the father of lights with whom is no variableness nor shadow of turning  and it agrees also with what the prophet says that it is the spirit of god which gives man understanding  and it agrees also with what the lord himself promised us when he was on earth that he would send down on us the spirit of godthe spirit which proceeds alike from him and from his father to guide us into all truth  ay my friends if we really believe this what a solemn and important thing education would seem to us  if we really believed that all light all true understanding of any matter came from the lord jesus christ  and if we remember what the lord jesus character was how he came to do good to all to teach not merely the rich and powerful but the poor the ignorant the outcast the sinful  should we not say to ourselves then  if knowledge comes from christ who never kept anything to himself how dare we keep knowledge to ourselves  if it comes from him who gave himself freely for all surely he means that knowledge should be given freely to all  if he and his father and our father will that all should come to the knowledge of the truth how dare we keep the truth from anyone  so we should feel it the will of our heavenly father the solemn command of our blessed saviour that our children and not only they but every soul around us young and old should be educated in the best possible way and in any way whatsoever rather than in none at all  the education of the poor would be in our eyes the most sacred duty  a school would be in our eyes as necessary and almost as sacred a thing as a church  and to neglect sending our children to school or to leave our servants or work people in ignorance would seem to us an awful sin against the father of lights a rebellion against the lord jesus who lights every man who comes into the world and against our father in heaven who willeth not that one of these little ones should perish  and this is made still more plain and certain by the next word in the text  christ shall give thee light not sell thee light or allow thee to find light after great struggles and weary years of study but give thee light  give it thee of his free grace and generosity we might have expected that merely from remembering to whom the light belongs  the mere fact that light belongs to the lord jesus christ who is the express likeness of his father might have made us sure that he would give his light freely to the unthankful and to the evil just as his father makes his sun to shine alike on the evil and on the good  therefore this text does not leave us to find out the good news for ourselves  it declares to us plainly that he will give it us as freely as he gives us all things richly to enjoy  but someone will say  you surely cannot mean that we shall have understanding without study  you cannot mean that we are to become wise without careful thought or that we are to understand books without learning to read  of course not my friends  the text does not say  christ will give thee eyes christ will give thee sense but christ will give thee light     do you not see the difference  of what use would your eyes be without light  and of what use would light be if your eyes were shut and you asleep  in darkness you cannot see  your eyes are there as good as ever the world is there as fair as ever  but you cannot see it because there is no light  you can only feel it by groping about with your hands and laying hold of whatsoever happens to be nearest you  and do you think that though your bodily eyes cannot see unless god puts his light in the sky to shine on everything and show it you yet your minds and souls can see without any light from god  not so my friends  what the sun is to this earth that the lord jesus christ the word of god is to the spirit that is the reason and conscienceof every man who comes into the world  now the good news of holy baptism is that the light is here that gods spirit is with us to teach us the truth about everything that we may see it in its true light as it is as god sees it that the dayspring from on high has visited us to give light to those who sit in darkness and in the shadow of death to guide our feet into the way of peace and that we are children of the light and of the day  but what if those who sit in darkness like the darkness and wilfully shut their eyes tight that they may not see the dayspring from on high and the light which god has sent into the world  then the light will not profit them but they will walk on still in darkness not knowing whither they are going  but some may say wicked men are very wise although they rebel against gods spirit and do not even believe in gods spirit but say that mans mind can find out everything for itself without gods help yet they are very wise  are they  the bible tells us again and again that the wisdom of such men is folly that god takes such wise men in their own craftiness  and the bible speaks truth  if there is one thing of which i am more certain than another my friends it is that just in proportion as a man is bad just in proportion as he does not believe in a good spirit of god who wills to teach him and gives him light he is a fool  if there is one thing more than another which such mens books have taught me it is that they are in darkness when they fancy they are in the brightest light that they make the greatest mistakes when they intend to say the cleverest things and when they least fancy it fall into nonsense and absurdities not merely on matters of religion but on points which they profess to have studied and in cases where by their own showing they ought to have known better  but our business is rather with ourselves  our business in this time of lent is to see whether we have been shutting our eyes whether we have been walking in darkness while gods light is all around us  and how shall we know that  let st john tell us  he that saith he is in the light and hateth his brother is in darkness until now and knoweth not whither he goeth because darkness has blinded his eyes hating our brother  covetousness which is indeed hating our brother for it teaches us to prefer our good to our neighbours good to fatten ourselves at our neighbours expense to get his work his custom his money away from him to ourselves bigotry which makes men hate and despise those who differ from them in religion spite and malice against those who have injured us suspicions and dark distrust of our neighbours and of mankind in general selfishness which sets us always standing on our own rights makes us always ready to take offence always ready to think that people mean to insult us or injure us and makes us moody dark peevish always thinking about ourselves and our plans or our own pleasures shut up as it were within ourselvesall these sins in proportion as anyone gives way to them darken the eyes of a mans soul  they really and actually make him more stupid less able to understand his neighbours hearts and minds less able to take a reasonable view of any matter or question whatsoever  you may not believe me  but so it is  i know it by experience to be true  i warn you that you will find it true one day that all spite passion prejudice suspicion hard judgments contempt selfconceit blind a mans reason and heart and soul and make him stumble and fall into mistakes even in worldly matters just as surely as shutting our eyes makes us stumble in broad daylight  he who gives way to such passions is asleep while he fancies himself broad awake  his life is a dream and like a dreamer he sees nothing really only appearances fancies pictures of things in his own selfish brain therefore it is written  awake thou that sleepest and arise from the dead and christ shall give thee life  you may say  can i awaken myself  perhaps not unless someone calls you  and therefore christ calls on you to awake  he says by my mouth  awake thou sleeper and i will give thee light awake thou dreamer who fanciest that the sinful works of darkness can give thee any real profit any real pleasure awake thou sleepwalker who art going about the world in a dream groping thy way on from day to day and year to year only kept from fall and ruin by gods guiding and preserving mercy  open thine eyes and let in the great eternal loving light wherein god beholds everything which he has made and behold it is very good  open thine eyes for it is day  the light is here if thou wilt but use it  i will guide thee saith the lord and inform thee with mine eye and teach thee in the way wherein thou shalt go  only believe in the light  believe that all knowledge comes from god  expect and trust that he will give thee knowledge  pray to him boldly to give thee knowledge because thou art sure that he wishes thee to have knowledge  he wishes thee to know thy duty  he wishes thee to see everything as he sees it  if any man lack wisdom let him ask of god who giveth to all liberally and upbraideth not and he shall receive it  and when thou hast prayed for knowledge expect it to come as it is written  when thou prayest for anything believe that thou wilt receive it and thou wilt receive it  if thou dost not believe that thou wilt have it of course thou wilt not have it  and why  because thou wilt pass by it without seeing it  it will be there ready for thee in thy daily walks wisdom will cry to thee at the head of every street god will not deny himself or break his promise  but thou wilt go past the place where wisdom is and miss the lessons which god is strewing in thy path because thou art not looking for them  wisdom is here my friends and understanding is here and the spirit of god is here if our eyes were but open to see them  oh my friends of all the sins of which we have to repent in this time of lent none ought to give us more solemn and bitter thoughts of shame than the way in which we overlook the teaching of gods spirit and shut our eyes to his light times without number every day of our lives  my friends if our hearts were what they ought to be if we had humble loving trustful hearts full of faith and hope in gods promise to lead us into all truth i believe that every joy and every sorrow which befell us every book which we opened every walk which we took upon the face of gods earth ay every human face into which we looked would teach us some lesson whereby we should be wiser better more aware of where we are and what god requires of us as human beings neighbours citizens subjects members of his church  all things would be clear to us for we should see them in the light of gods spirit  all things would look bright to us for we should see them in the light of gods love  all things would work together for good to us for we should understand each thing as it came before us and know what it was and what god meant it for and how we were to use it  and knowing and seeing what was right we should see how beautiful it was and love it and take delight in doing it and so we should walk in the light  dark thoughts would pass away from our minds dark feelings from our hearts dark looks from our faces  we should look our neighbours cheerfully and boldly in the face for our consciences would be clear of any illwill or meanness toward them we should look cheerfully and boldly up to god our father for we should know that he was with us guiding and teaching us well pleased with all our endeavours to see things as he sees them and to live and work on earth after his image and in his likeness  we should look out cheerfully and boldly on the world around us trying to get knowledge from everything we see expecting the light and welcoming it and trusting it because we know that it comes from him who is true and cannot lie him who is love and cannot injure him who is righteous and cannot lead us into temptation  jesus christ the light who lighteth every man that cometh into the world    xxxixthe unpardonable sin    wherefore i say unto you  all manner of sin and blasphemy shall be forgiven unto men but the blasphemy against the holy spirit shall not be forgiven unto men  and whosoever speaketh a word against the son of man it shall be forgiven him but whosoever speaketh a word against the holy ghost it shall not be forgiven him either in this world or in the world to comematthew xii 31 32  these awful words were the lords answer to the pharisees when they said of him  he casts out devils by beelzebub the prince of the devils  what was it now which made this speech of the pharisees so terrible a sin past all forgiveness  of course we all feel that they were very sinful we shrink with horror from their words as we read them  but why ought they to have done the same  we know thank god who jesus christ was  but they did not at that time when he was first beginning to preach they hardly could have known  and mind we must not say  they ought to have known that he was the son of god by his having the power of casting out devils for the lord himself says that the sons of these pharisees used to cast them out also or that the pharisees believed that they did and only asks them  why do you say of my casting out devils what you will not say of your sons casting them out  pray bear this in mind for if you do notif you keep in your mind the vulgar and unscriptural notion that the pharisees sin was not being convinced by the great power of christs miracles you will never understand this story and you will be very likely to get rid of it altogether as speaking of a sin which does not concern you and a sin which you cannot commit  now if the pharisees did not know that jesus was the son of god the maker and king of the world as we do why were they so awfully wicked in saying that he cast out devils by the prince of the devils  was it anything more than a mistake of theirs  was it as wicked as crucifying the lord  could it be a worse sin to make that one mistake than to murder the lord himself and yet it must have been a worse sin  for the lord prayed for his murderers  father forgive them for they know not what they do and these pharisees they knew not what they did  and yet the lord far from praying for them told them that even he did not see how such serpents such a generation of vipers could escape the damnation of hell  it is worth our while to think over this question and try and find out what made the pharisees sin so great  and to do that it will be wiser for us first to find out what the pharisees sin was lest we should sit here this morning and think them the most wicked wretches who ever trod the earth and then go away and before a week is over commit ourselves the very same sin or one so fearfully like it that if other people can see a difference between them i confess i cannot  and to commit such a sin my good friends is a far easier thing to do than some people fancy especially here in england now  now the worst part of the pharisees sin was not as we are too apt to fancy their insulting the lord  but their insulting the holy spirit  for what does the lord himself say  that all manner of blasphemy as well as sin should be forgiven that whosever spoke a word against him the son of man should be forgiven  but that the unpardonable part of their offence was that they had blasphemed the holy spirit  and who is the holy spirit  the spirit of holiness  and what is holiness  what are the fruits of holiness  for as the lord told the pharisees on this very occasion the tree is known by its fruit what says st paul  the fruit of the spirit is love joy peace longsuffering gentleness goodness meekness temperance  those who do not show these fruits have not gods spirit in them  those who are hard unloving proud quarrelsome peevish suspicious ready to impute bad motives to their neighbours have not gods spirit in them  those who do show these fruits who are gentle forgiving kindhearted ready to do good to others and believe good of others have gods spirit in them  for these are good fruits which as our lord tells us can only spring from a good root  those who have the fruit must have the root let their doctrines be what they may  those who have not the fruit cannot have the root let their doctrines be what they may  that is the plain truth and it is high time for preachers to proclaim it boldly and take the consequences from the scribes and pharisees of this generation  that is the plain truth  let doctrines be what they will the tree is known by its fruit  the man who does wrong things is bad and the man who does right things is good  it is a simple thing to have to say but very few believe it in these days  most fancy that the men who can talk most neatly and correctly about certain religious doctrines are good and that those who cannot are bad  that is no new notion  some people thought so in st johns time and what did he say of them  little children let no man deceive you it is he that doeth righteousness who is righteous even as god is righteous  and again  he who says i know god and keeps not his commandments is a liar and the truth is not in him  st john was the apostle of love  he was always preaching the love of god to men and entreating men to love one another  his own heart was overflowing with love  yet when it came to such a question as that when it came to peoples pretending to be religious and orthodox and yet neither obeying god nor loving their neighbours he could speak sternly and plainly enough  he does not say  my dear friends i am sorry to have to differ from you but i am afraid you are mistaken he says  you are liars and there is no truth in you  now this was just what the pharisees had forgotten  they had got to think as too many have nowadays that the sign of a mans having gods spirit in him was his agreeing with them in doctrine  but if he did not agree with them if he would not say the words which they said and did not belong to their party and side with them in despising every one who differed from them it was no matter to them as they proved by their opinion of jesus himself how good he might be or how much good he might do how loving gentle patient benevolent helping and caring for poor people in short how like god he was all that went for nothing if he was not of their party for they had forgotten what god was like  they forgot that god was love and mercy itself and that all love and mercy must come from god and that therefore no one let his creed or his doctrine be what it might could possibly do a loving or merciful thing but by the grace and inspiration of god the father of mercies  and yet their own prophets of the old testament had told them so when they ascribed the good deeds of heathens to the inspiration of god just as much as the good deeds of jews and agreed as they do in many a text with what st james himself a jew said afterwards  be not deceived every good gift and every perfect gift is from above and cometh down from the father of lights  but the pharisees like too many nowadays did not think so  they thought that good and perfect gifts might some of them very well come from below from the father of darkness and cruelty  they saw the lord jesus christ doing good things driving out evil and delivering men from the power of it healing the sick cleansing the leper curing the mad preaching the gospel to the poor  and yet they saw in that no proof that gods spirit was working in him  of course if he had been one of their own party and had held the same doctrines as they held they would have praised him loudly enough and held him up as a great saint of their school and boasted of all his good deeds as proofs of how good their party was and how its doctrines came from god  but as long as he was not one of them his good works went for nothing  they could not see gods likeness in that loving and merciful character  all his charity and benevolence made them only hate him the more because it made them the more afraid that he would draw the people away from them  and of course they said to themselves whosoever draws people away from us must be on the devils side  we know all gods law and will  no one on earth has anything to teach us  and therefore as for any one who differs from us if he cast out devils it must be because the devil is helping him for his own purposes to do it  in one word then the sin of these pharisees the unpardonable sin which ruins all who give themselves up to it was bigotry calling right wrong because it did not suit their party prejudices to call it right  they were fancying themselves very religious and pious and all the while they did not know right when they saw it and when the lord came doing right they called it wrong because he did not agree with their doctrines  they fancied they were the only people on earth who knew how to worship god perfectly and yet while they pretended to worship him they did not know what he was like  the lord jesus came down the perfect likeness of gods glory and the express pattern of his character helping and healing and delivering the souls and bodies of all poor wretches whom he met and these pharisees could not see gods spirit in that and because it was certainly not their own spirit called it the spirit of a devil and blasphemed against the holy spirit the spirit of right and love  this was bigotry the flower and crown of all sins into which man can fall the worst of all sins because a man may keep from every other sin with all his might and main as the pharisees did and yet be led by bigotry into almost every one of them without knowing it into harsh and uncharitable judgment into anger clamour and railing into misrepresentation and slander and fancying that the god of truth needs the help of their lying perhaps as has often happened alas already into devilish cruelty to the souls and bodies of men the worst of all sins because a man who has given up his heart to bigotry can have no forgiveness  he cannot for how can a man be forgiven unless he repent and how can a bigot repent how can he confess himself in the wrong while he fancies himself infallibly in the right  as the lord said to these very pharisees  if ye had been blind ye had had no sin  but now ye say we see therefore your sin remaineth  how can the bigot repent for repenting is turning to god and how can a man turn to god who does not know where to look for god who does not know who god is who mistakes the devil for god and fancies the allloving father to be a taskmaster and a tyrant and an accuser and a respecter of persons without mercy or care for ninetynine hundredths of the souls which he has made  how can he find god  he does not know whom to look for  how can the bigot repent for to repent means to turn from wrong to right and he has lost the very notion of right and wrong in the midst of all his religion and his fine doctrines  he fancies that right does not mean love mercy goodness patience but notions like his own and that wrong does not mean hatred and evilspeaking and suspicion and uncharitableness and slander and lying but notions unlike his own  what he agrees with he thinks is heavenly and what he disagrees with is of hell  he has made his own god for himself out of himself  his own prejudices are his god and he worships them right worthily and if the lord were to come down on earth again and would not say the words which he is accustomed to say it would go hard but he would crucify the lord again as the pharisees did of old  my friends there is too much of this bigotry this blasphemy against gods spirit abroad in england now  may god keep us all from it pray to him night and day to give you his spirit that you may not only be loving charitable full of good works yourselves but may be ready to praise and enjoy a good and loving and merciful action whosoever does it whether he be of your religion or not for nothing good is done by any living man without the grace of christ and the inspiration of the spirit of god the father of lights from whom comes down every good and perfect gift  and whosoever tries to escape from that great truth when he sees a man whose doctrines are wrong doing a right act by imputing bad motives to him or saying his actions must be evil however good they may look because his doctrines are wrongthat man is running the risk of committing the very same sin as the pharisees and blaspheming against the holy spirit by calling good evil  and be sure my friends that whosoever indulges even in little matters in hard judgments and suspicions and hasty sneers and loud railing against men who differ from him in religion or politics or in anything else is deadening his own sense of right and wrong and sowing the seeds of that same state of mind which as the lord told the pharisees is utterly the worst into which any human being can fall    xlthe spirit of bondage    for ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear but ye have received the spirit of adoption whereby we cry abba father romans viii 15  some of you here may not understand this text at all  some of you perhaps may misunderstand it for it is not an easy one  let us then begin by finding out the meaning of each word in it and let us first see what is the meaning of the spirit of bondage unto fear bondage means slavery and the spirit of bondage means the spirit which makes men look up to god as slaves do to their taskmaster now a slave obeys his master from fear only not from love or gratitude  he knows that his master is stronger than he is and he dreads being beaten and punished by him and therefore he obeys him only by compulsion not of his own good will  this is the spirit of bondage the slavish superstitious spirit in religion into which all men fall in proportion as they are mean and sinful and carnal fond of indulging themselves and bearing no love to god or right things  they know that god is stronger than they they are afraid that god will take away comforts from them if they offend him they have been taught that he will cast them into endless torment if they offend him and therefore they are afraid to do wrong  they love what is wrong and would like to do it but they dare not for fear of gods punishment  they do not really fear god they only fear punishment misfortune death and hell  that is better perhaps than no religion at all  but it is not the faith which we ought to have  in this way the old heathens lived  loving sin and not holiness and yet continually tormented with the fear of being punished for the very sins which they loved looking up to god as a stern taskmaster fancying him as proud and selfish and revengeful as themselves trying one day to quiet that wrath of his which they knew they deserved by all sorts of flatteries and sacrifices to him and the next day trying to fancy that he was as sinful as themselves and was wellpleased to see them sinful too  and yet they could not keep that lie in their hearts gods light which lights every man who comes into the world was too bright for them and shone into their consciences and showed them that the wages of sin was death  the law of god st paul tells us was written in their hearts and how much soever poor creatures they might try to blot it out and forget it yet it would rise up in judgment against them day by day night by night convincing them of sin  so they in their terror sold themselves to false priests who pretended to know of plans for helping them to escape from this angry god and gave themselves up to superstitions till they even sacrificed their sons and their daughters to devils in some sort of confused hope of buying themselves off from misery and ruin  and in the same way the jews lived for the most part before the lord jesus came in the flesh of man  not so viciously and wickedly of course because the law of moses was holy and just and good the law which the lord himself had given them because it was the best for them then because they were too sinful and slavish and stupid for anything better  but as st paul says mosess law could not give them life any more than any other law can  that is it could not make them righteous and good it could not change their hearts and lives it could only keep them from outward wrongdoing by threats and promises saying  thou shalt not  it could at best only show them how sinful their own hearts were how little they loved what god commanded how little they desired what he promised and so it made them feel more and more that they were guilty unworthy to look up to a holy god deserving his anger and punishment worthy to die for their sins and thus by the law came the knowledge of sin a deeper feeling of guilt and shame and slavish dread of god as st paul sets forth with wonderful wisdom in the seventh chapter of romans  now let us consider the latter half of the text  but ye have received the spirit of adoption whereby we cry abba father  what is this adoption  st paul tells us in the beginning of the fourth chapter of his epistle to the galatians  he says  as long as a mans heir is a child and under age there is no difference in law between him and a slave  he is his fathers property  he must obey his father whether he chooses or not and he is under tutors and governors until the time appointed by his father that is until he comes of age as we call it  then he becomes his own master  he can inherit and possess property of his own after that  and from that time forth the law does not bind him to obey his father if he obeys him it is of his own free will because he loves and trusts and reverences his father  now st paul says this is the case with us  when we were infants we were in bondage under the elements of the world kept straight as children are by rules which they cannot understand by the fear of punishment which they cannot escape with no more power to resist their father than slaves have to resist their master  but when the fulness of time was come god sent forth his son born of a woman born under a law that he might redeem those who were under a law that we might receive the adoption of sons  as much as to say  you were gods children all along  but now you are more you are gods sons  you have arrived at mans estate you are men in body and in mind you are to be men in spirit men in life  you are to look up to the great god who made heaven and earth and know glorious thought that he is as truly your father as the men whose earthly sons you call yourselves  and if you do this he will give you the spirit of adoption and you shall be able to call him father with your hearts as well as with your lips you shall know and feel that he is your father that he has been loving watching educating leading you home to him all the while that you were wandering in ignorance of him in childish selfwill and greediness after pleasure and amusement  he will give you his spirit to make you behave like his sons to obey him of your own free will from love and gratitude and honour and filial reverence  he will make you love what he loves and hate what he hates  he will give you clear consciences and free hearts to fear nothing on earth or in heaven but the shame and ingratitude of disobeying your father  the spirit of adoption by which you look up to god as your father is your right  he has given it to you and nothing but your own want of faith and wilful turning back to cowardly superstition and to the wilful sins which go before superstition and come after it can take it from you  so said st paul to the romans and the galatians and so i have a right ay and a bounden duty to say to every man and woman in this church this day  for my dear friends if you ask me what has this to do with us has it not everything to do with us  whether we are leading good lives or middling lives or utterly bad worthless lives has it not everything to do with us  who is there here who has not at times said to himself  god so holy and pure and glorious while i am so unjust and unclean and mean  and god so great and powerful while i am so small and weak  what shall i do  does not god hate and despise me  will he not take from me all which i love best  will he not hurl me into endless torment when i die  how can i escape from him  wretched man that i am i cannot escape from him  how then can i turn away his hate  how can i make him change his mind  how can i soothe him and appease him  what shall i do to escape hell fire  did you ever have such thoughts  but did you find those thoughts that slavish terror of gods wrath that dread of hell made you any better men  i never did  i never saw them make any human being better  unless you go beyond themas far beyond them as heaven is beyond hell as far above them as a free son is above a miserable crouching slave they will do you more harm than good  for this is all that i have seen come of them  that all this spirit of bondage this slavish terror instead of bringing a man nearer to god only drove him further from god  it did not make him hate what was wrong it only made him dread the punishment of it  and then when the first burst of fear cooled down he began to say to himself  i can never atone for my sins  i can never win back god to love me  what is done is done  if i cannot escape punishment let me be at least as happy as i can while it lasts  if it does not come today it will come tomorrow  let me alone thou tormenting conscience  let me eat and drink for tomorrow i die  and so back rushed the poor creature into all his wrongdoing again and fell most probably deeper than ever into the mire because a certain feeling of desperation and defiance rose up in him till he began to fancy that his terror was all a dreama foolish accidental rising up of old superstitious words which he learnt from his mother or his nurse and he tried to forget it all and did forget itgod help himand his latter end was worse than his first  how then shall a man escape shame and misery and an evil conscience and rise out of these sins of his  for do it he must  the wages of sin is deathdeath to body and soul and from sin he must escape  there is but one way my friends  there never was but one way believe the text and therefore believe the warrant of your baptism believe the message of your confirmation  your baptism says to you god does not hate you be you the greatest sinner on earth  he does not hate you  he loves you for you are his child  he hateth nothing that he hath made  he willeth not the death of a sinner but that all should come to be saved  and your baptism is the sign of that to you  but god hates everything that he has not made for everything which he has not made is bad and he has made all things but sin and therefore he hates sin and loving you wishes to raise you out of sin and baptism is the sign of that also man was made originally in the image and likeness of god and of jesus christ the son of man the express image of god the father and therefore everything which is sinful is unmanly and everything which is truly manful and worthy of a man is like jesus christ and gods will is that you should rise out of all these unmanly sins to a truly manful lifea life like the life of jesus christ the son of man  and baptism is gods sign of this also  that is the meaning of the words in the baptism service which tell you that you were baptised into jesus christ that you might put off the old manthe sinful slavish selfish unmanly pattern of life which we all lead by nature and put on the new manthe holy and noble righteous and loving pattern of life which is the likeness of the lord jesus that is the message of your baptism to you that you are gods children and that gods will and wish is that you should grow up to become his sons to serve him lovingly trustingly manfully and that he can and will give you power to do soay that he has given you that power already if you will but claim it and use it  but you must claim it and use it because you are meant not merely to be gods wilful ignorant selfish children obeying him from mere fear of the rod but to be his willing loving loyal sons  and that is the message which confirmation brings you  baptism says  you are gods child whether you know it or not  confirmation says  yes but now you are to know it and to claim your rights as his sons of full age reasonable and selfgoverning  baptism says  you are regenerated and born from above by water and the holy spirit  confirmation answers  true most true but there is no use in a childs being born if it never comes to mans estate but remains a stunted idiot  baptism says  you may and ought to become more or less such a man as the lord jesus was  confirmation says  you can become such for you are no longer children you are grown to mans estate in body you can grow to mans estate in soul if you will  gods spirit is with you to show you all things in their true light to teach you to value them or despise them as you ought to teach you to love what he loves and hate what he hates  god wishes you no longer to be merely his children obeying him you know not why still less his slaves obeying him from mere brute coward fear and then breaking loose the moment that you forget him and fancy that his eye is not on you but he wishes you to be his sons to claim the right and the power which he has given you to trample your sins under foot to rise up by the strength which god your father will surely give to those who ask him and so to be new men free men true men who do look boldly up to god knowing that however wicked they may have been and however weak they are still gods love belongs to them gods help belongs to them and that those who trust in him shall never be confounded but shall go on from strength to strength to the measure of the stature of a perfect man to the noble likeness of the lord jesus christ himself  for this is the message of the blessed sacrament of the body and blood of christ to which you have been all called this day  that sacrament tells you that in spite of all your daily sins and failings you can still look up to god as your father to the lord jesus christ as your life to the holy spirit as your guide and your inspirer that though you be prodigal sons your fathers house is still open to you your fathers eternal love ready to meet you afar off the moment that you cry from your heart  father i have sinned and that you must be converted and turn back to god your father not merely once for all at confirmation or at any other time but weekly daily hourly as often as you forget and disobey him and that he will receive you  this is the message of the blessed sacrament that though you cannot come there trusting in your own righteousness you can come trusting in his manifold and great mercies that though you are not worthy so much as to gather up the crumbs under his table yet he is the same lord whose property is ever to have mercy that he will as surely as he has appointed that sign of the bread and wine grant you so to eat and drink that spiritual flesh and blood of the lord jesus christ which is the life of the world that your sinful bodies may be made clean by his body and your souls washed in his most precious blood and that you may dwell in him and he in you for ever    xlithe fall    as by one man sin entered into the world and death by sin and so death passed on all men for that all have sinnedromans v 12  we have been reading the history of adams fall  with that fall we have all to do for we all feel the fruits of it in the sinful corruptions which we bring into the world with us  and more every fall which we have is like adams fall  every time we fall into wilful sin we do what adam did and act over again each of us many times in our lives that which he first acted in the garden of paradise  at least all mankind suffer for something  look at the sickness death bloodshed oppression spite and cruelty with which the world is so full now of which it has been full as we know but too well from history ever since adams time  the world is full of misery there is no denying that  how did that come  it must have come somehow  there must be some reason for all this sorrow the bible tells us a reason for it  if anyone does not like the bible reason he is bound to find a better reason  but what if the bible reason the story of adams fall be the only rational and sensible explanation which ever has been or ever will be given of the way in which death and misery came among men  some people will say  what puzzle is there in it  all animals die why should not man  all animals fight and devour each other why should not man do so too  but why need we suppose that man is fallen  why should he not have been meant by nature to be just what he is  some scholars who fancy themselves wise and think that they know better than the bible will say that now and pride themselves on having said a very fine thing ignorant men too often are led into the same mistake and are willing enough to say  what if we are brutish and savage and ignorant and spiteful indulging ourselves hating and quarrelling with each other  god made us what we are and we cannot help it  but there is a voice in the heart of every man and just in proportion as a man is a man and not a beast and a savage that voice cries in his heart more loudly  no god did not make you what you are  you are not meant to be what you are but something better  you are not meant to fight and devour each other as the animals do for you are meant to be better than they  you are not meant to die as the animals do for you feel something in you which cannot die which hates death  you may try to be a mere savage and a beast but you cannot be content to be so  and yet you feel ready to fall lower and get more and more brutish  what can be the reason  there must be something wrong about men something diseased and corrupt in them or they would not have this continual discontent with themselves for being no better than they are this continual hankering and longing after some happiness some knowledge some good and noble state which they do not see round them and never have felt in themselves  man must have fallen fallen from some good and right state into which he was put at first and for which he is hankering and craving now  there must be an original sin in him that is a sin belonging to his origin his race his breed as we say which has been handed down from father to son an original sin as the church calls it  and i believe firmly that the heart of man even among savages bears witness to the truth of that doctrine and confesses that we are fallen beings let false philosophers try as they will to persuade us that we are not  then again there are another set of people principally easy well todo respectable people who run into another mistake the same into which the pelagians did in old time  they think  man is not fallen  every man is born into the world quite good enough if he chose to remain good  every man can keep gods laws if he likes or at all events keep them well enough  as for his having a sinful nature which he got from adam they do not believe that really though often they might not like to say so openly  they think adam fell and he was punished and if i fall i shall be punished but adams sin is nothing to me and has not hurt me  i can be just as good and right as adam was if i like  that is a comfortable doctrine enough for easygoing welltodo folks who have but few trials and few temptations and who love little because little has been forgiven them  but what comfort is there in that for poor sinners who feel sinful and base passions dragging them down and making them brutish and miserable and yet feel that they cannot conquer their sins of themselves cannot help doing wrong all the while they know that it is wrong  they feel that they have something more in them than a will and power to do what they choose  they feel that they have a sinful nature which keeps their will and reason in slavery and makes sin a hard bondage a miserable prisonhouse from which they cannot escape  in short they feel and know that they are fallen  small comfort too to every thinking man who looks upon the great nations of savages which have lived and live still upon gods earth and sees how so far from being able to do right if they choose they go on from father to son generation after generation doing wrong more and more whether they like or not how they become more and more children of wrath given up to fierce wars and cruel revenge and violent passions all their thought and talk and study being to kill and to fight how they become more and more children of darkness forgetting more and more the laws of right and wrong becoming stupid and ignorant until they lose the very knowledge of how to provide themselves with houses clothes fire or even to till the ground and end in feeding on roots and garbage like the beasts which perish  and how too long before they fall into that state death works in them  how the lower they fall and the more they yield to their original sin and their corrupt nature they die out  by wars with each other by murdering their own children to avoid the trouble of rearing them by diseases which they know not how to cure and which they too often bring on themselves by their own brutishness by bad food and exposure to the weather they die out and perish off the face of the earth fulfilling the lords words to adam  thou shalt surely die  i do not say that their souls go to hell  the bible tells us nothing of where they go to  gods mercy is boundless  and the bible tells us that sin is not imputed where there is no law as there is none among them  so we may have hope for them and leave them in gods hand but what can we hope for them who are utterly dead in trespasses and sins  well for them if having fallen to the likeness of the brutes they perish with the brutes  i fancy if you as some may ever go to australia and there see the wretched black people who are dying out there faster and faster year by year after having fallen lower than the brutes then you will understand what original sin may bring a man to what it would have brought us to had not god in his mercy raised us and our forefathers up from that fearful down hill course when we were on it fifteen hundred years ago  and another thing which shows that these poor savages are not as god intended them to be but are falling generation after generation by the working of original sin is that they almost all of them show signs of having been better off long ago  many like the south sea islanders have curious arts remaining among them in spite of their brutish ignorance which they could only have learned when they were far more clever and civilised than they are now  and almost all of them have some sad remembrance handed down from father to son kept up in songs and foolish tales of having been richer and more prosperous and more numerous a long while ago  they will confess to you if you ask them that they are worse than their fathersthat they are going down dying outthat the gods are angry with them as they say  the lord have mercy upon them  but what is to my mind the most awful part of the matter remains yet to be toldand it is this  that man may actually fall by original sin too low to receive the gospel of jesus christ and be recovered again by it  for the negroes of africa and the west indies though they have fallen very low have not fallen too low for the gospel  they have still understanding left to take it in and conscience and sense of right and wrong enough left to embrace it thousands of them do embrace it and are received unto righteousness and lead such lives as would shame many a white englishman born and bred under the gospel  but the black people in australia who are exactly of the same race as the african negroes cannot take in the gospel  they seem to have become too stupid to understand it they seem to have lost the sense of sin and of righteousness too completely to care about it  all attempts to bring them to a knowledge of the true god have as yet failed utterly  gods grace is allpowerful he is no respecter of persons and he may yet by some great act of his wisdom quicken the dead souls of these poor brutes in human shape  but as far as we can see there is no hope for them  but like the canaanites of old they must perish off the face of the earth as brute beasts  i have said so much to show you that man is fallen that there is original sin an inclination to sin and fall sink down lower and lower in man  now comes the question  what is this fall of man  i said that the bible tells us rationally enough  and i have also made use several times of words which may have hinted to some of you already what adams fall was  i have spoken of the likeness of the beasts and of men becoming like beasts by original sin  and this is why i said it  if you want to understand what adams fall was you must understand what he fell from and what he fell to  that is plain  now the bible tells us that he fell from gods grace to nature  what is nature  nature means what is born and lives and dies and is parted and broken up that the parts of it may go into some new shape and be born and live and die again  so the plants trees beasts are a part of nature  they are born live die and then that which was them goes into the earth or into the stomachs of other animals and becomes in time part of that animal or part of the tree or flower which grows in the soil into which it has fallen so the flesh of a dead animal may become a grain of wheat and that grain of wheat again may become part of the body of an animal  you all see this every time you manure a field or grow a crop  nature is then that which lives to die and dies to live again in some fresh shape  and in the first chapter of genesis you read of god creating natureearth and water and light and the heavens and the plants and animals each after their kind born to die and change made of dust and returning to the dust again  but after that we read very different words we read that when god created man he said  let us make man in our image after our likeness and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the fowl of the air and over the cattle and over all the earth and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth  he was made in gods likeness therefore he could only be right in as far as he was like god  and he could not be like god if he did not will what god willed and wish what god wished  he was to live by faith in god he was justified by faith in god and by that only  never fancy that adam had any righteousness of his own any goodness of which he could say  this is mine part of me i may pride myself on it  god forbid  his righteousness consisted as ours must in looking up to god trusting him utterly believing that he was to do gods will and not his own  his spirit his soul as we call it was given to him for that purpose and for none other that it might trust in god and obey god as a child does his father  he had a free will but he was to use that will as we must use our wills by giving up our will to gods will by clinging with our whole hearts and souls to god  adam fell  he let himself be tempted by a beast by the serpent how we cannot tell  but so we read  he took the counsel of a brute animal and not of god  he chose between god and the serpent and he chose wrong  he wanted to be something in himself to have a knowledge and power of his own to use it as he chose  he was not content to be in gods likeness he wanted to be as a god himself and so he threw away his faith in god and disobeyed him  and instead of becoming a god as he expected he became an animal he put on the likeness of the brutes who cannot look up to god in trust and love who do not know god do not obey him but follow their own lusts and fancies as they may happen to take them  whether the change came on him all at once the bible does not say  but it did come on him for from him it has been handed down to all his children even to this day  then was fulfilled against him the sentence in the day thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die  not that he died that moment but death began to work in him  he became like the branch of a tree cut off from the stem which may not wither at the instant it is cut off but it is yet dead as we find out by its soon decaying  he had come down from being a son of god and he had taken his place in nature among the things which grow only to die and death began to work in him and in his children after him  he handed down his nature to his children as the animals do his children inherited his faults his weaknesses his diseases the seed of death which was in him just as the animals pass down to their breed their defects and diseases and certainty of dying after their appointed life is past  for this my friends is the lesson which adams fall teaches us that in god alone is the life of immortal souls whether of men or of angels or of archangels and in god alone is righteousness in god alone is every good thing and all good in men or angels comes from him and is only his pattern his likeness and that the moment either man or angel sets up his will against gods he falls into sin a lie and death  that he has given us reasonable souls for that one purpose that with our souls we may look up to him with our souls we may cling to him with our souls we may trust in him with our souls we may understand his will and see that it is a good and a right and a loving will and delight in it and obey it and find all our delight and glory even as the lord jesus the son of man the new adam did in doing not our own will but the will of our father  for as st augustine says man may live in two ways either according to himself or according to god by selfwill or by faith he may determine to do his own will or to do gods will to be his own master or to let god be his master to seek his own glory and try to be something fine and grand in himself  or he may seek gods glory and obey him believing that what god commands is the only good for him what makes god to be honoured in the eyes of his neighbours is the only real honour for him  but says st augustine if he tries to live according to himself he falls into misery because he was meant to live according to god  so he puts himself into a lie into a false and wrong state and because he has cut himself off from god he falls below what a man should be and puts on more and more of the likeness of the beast and is more and more the slave of his own lusts and passions and fancies as the dumb animals are  and as st paul says the animal man the carnal man understands not the things of god  and we need no one to tell us that this is the state of nature which we bring into the world with us  we feel it from our very childhood from the earliest time we can recollect have we not had the longing to do what we liked to please ourselves to pride ourselves on ourselves to set up our own wills against our parents against what we learnt out of the bible  ay has not this wilful will of ours been so strong that often we would long after a thing we would determine to have it only because we were forbidden to have it we might not care about the thing when we had it but we would have our own way just because it was our own way  in short like adam we would be as gods knowing good and evil and choosing for ourselves what we should call good and what we shall call evil  and my dear friends consider  did not every wrong that we ever did come from this one root of all sindetermining to have our own way  that rootsin of selfwill first brought death and misery among mankind that sin of selfwill keeps it up still  that sin of selfwill it is which hinders sinners from giving themselves up to god and that sin must be broken through or religion is a mockery and a dream  oh my friends say to yourselves once for all i was made in gods likeness and therefore his will and not my own i must do  i have no wisdom of my own no strength of mind of my own no goodness of my own no lovingness of my own  god has them all god who is wisdom strength goodness love and i have none  and then when the fearful thought comes over you  i have no goodness and i cannot have any  i cannot do right  there is no use struggling and trying to be better  my passions my lusts my fancies are too strong for me  if i am brutish and low brutish and low i must remain  if i have fallen in adam i must lie in the mire till i die  then then my friends answer yourselves  no  not so  man fell in the first adam  but man rose again in the second adam the lord jesus christ  i belong no more to the old adam who fell in paradise  i belong to the new adam who was conceived without sin and born of a pure virgin who lived by perfect faith in perfect obedience doing his fathers will only even to the death upon the cross wherein he took away the sins of the whole world  and now for his sake my original sin my fallen brutish nature is forgiven me god does not hate me for it  he loves me because i belong to his son  my baptism is a witness and a warrant a sign and a covenant between me and god that i belong not to old adam of paradise but to the lord jesus christ who sits at gods right hand  the cross which was signed on my forehead when i was baptised is gods sign to me that i am to sacrifice myself and give up my own will to do gods will even as the lord jesus did when he gave himself to die because it was his fathers will  and because i belong to jesus christ because god has called me to be his child therefore he will help me he will help me to conquer this low brutish nature of mine  he will put his spirit into me the spirit of his son jesus christ that i may trust him cry to him my father that i may love him understand his will and see how good and noble and beautiful and full of peace and comfort it is delight in obeying him glory in sacrificing my own fancies and pleasures for his sake and find my only honour my only happiness in doing his will on earth as saints and angels do it in heaven    xliigods covenants    i do set my bow in the cloud and it shall be for a token of a covenant between me and the earthgenesis ix 13  the text says that god made a covenant with noah and with his seed after himthat is with all mankind with us who sit here and our children after us and with all human beings who will ever live upon the face of the earth  god made a covenant with them  now what is a covenant  we say that two men make a covenant with each other when they make a bargain an agreement in this way  if you will do this thing then i will do that but if you will not do this thing i will not do that  if you do not keep to our agreement i am free of it if i do not do my part of the agreement you are free  is not that what we call a covenanta bargain between two parties which if either party breaks it becomes null and void and binds neither let us see whether gods covenants with man are of this kind  does god say to noah  if you and your children are righteous i will look upon the rainbow and remember my covenant  but if you and your children are unrighteous i will not look on the rainbow and i will break my covenant because you have broken it  we read no such words god made no conditions with noah and his sons  whether they forgot the covenant or not god would remember it  it was a covenant of free grace even as all gods covenants are  not a bargain but a promise  by myself have i sworn saith the lord that i will not fail david  by himself he sware to abraham  surely blessing i will bless thee and multiplying i will multiply thee  that is the form of gods covenants  god swears by himselfby god who cannot change  if god can change then his covenant can change  if god can fail himself then can he fail his covenant to which he has sworn by himself  if it had been a mere bargain like mens bargains and not a promise out of his absolute love his free grace his boundless mercy would he have sworn by himself  nay rather he would have sworn by abraham  by thy obedience or disobedience i swear to bless thee or curse thee  but he swore by himself the absolute the unchangeable the giver whose name is love  consider now the token of the covenant which god gave to noah  it was the rainbow  what is the rainbow  sunlight turned back to our eye through drops of falling rain  what sign could be more simple and yet what sign could be more perfect  noahs sons would fear that another flood was coming perhaps flood after flood  the token of the rainbow said to them no  floods and rain are not to be the custom of this earth  sunshine is to be the custom of it  do not fear the clouds and storm and rain look at the bow in the cloud in the very rain itself  that is a sign that the sun though you cannot see it is shining still  that up above beyond the cloud is still sunlight and warmth and cloudless blue sky  believe in gods covenant  believe that the sun will conquer the clouds warmth will conquer cold calm will conquer storm fair will conquer foul light will conquer darkness joy will conquer sorrow life conquer death love conquer destruction and the devouring floods because god is light god is love god is life god is peace and joy eternal and without change and labours to give life and joy and peace to man and beast and all created things  this was the meaning of the rainbow  not a sudden or strange token a miracle as men call it like as some voice out of the sky or fiery comet might have been but a regular orderly and natural sign to witness that god is a god of order  whenever there was a rainy day there might be a rainbow  it came by the same laws by which everything else comes in the world  it was a witness that god who made the world is the friend and preserver of man that his promises are like the everlasting sunshine which is above the clouds without spot or fading without variableness or shadow of turning  and do you fancy my friends that the new covenant the covenant which god made with all mankind in the blood of his onlybegotten son is narrower or weaker than the covenant which he made with noah abraham and david  he asked no conditions from them  do you think he asks them from us  he called them by free grace  do you think he calls us by anything less  he swore by himself to them  how much more has he sworn by himself to us  he who was born and died and rose again for us who now sits at the right hand of the father very man of the substance of a human mother yet very god of very god begotten  his covenants of old stood true and faithful however disobedient and unfaithful men might be as it is written  i have sworn once for all by my holiness that i will not fail david  and those words the new testament declares to us again and again are true of the new covenant and fulfilled in the lord jesus christ into whose name we are baptized  yes into whose name we are baptized  there is the sign of the new covenant of a covenant of free grace  therefore we can bring our children to be baptized as we were baptized ourselves before they have done either good or evil for a sign that gods love is over them gods kingdom is their inheritance gods love their everlasting portion  but we may fall from grace and then what good will our baptism be to us  we shall be lost just as if we had never been baptized  my friends if though the sun was shining in the sky you shut your eyes close and kept out the light what use would the sunlight be to you  you would stumble and fall and come to harm as certainly as in the darkest night  but would the sun go out of the sky my friends because you were unwise enough to shut your eyes to it  the sun would still be there shining as bright as ever  you would have only to be reasonable and to open your eyes and you would see your way again as well as ever  so it is with holy baptism  in it we were made members of christ children of god inheritors of the kingdom of heaven  gods love is above us and around us like a warm bright lifegiving sun  we may shut our eyes to it but it is there still  we may disbelieve our baptism covenant but it is true still  we are children of god and nothing that we can do no sin no unfaithfulness of ours can make us anything else  we can no more become not gods children than a child can become not his own fathers son  but this we can do by sinning by disbelieving that we are gods children by behaving as the devils children when we are gods we can believe ourselves not gods children when we are we can try to be what we are not we can enter into a lie and into the misery to which all lies lead we can walk in darkness and stumble and fall when all the while we are children of the light and have only to open our eyes to walk in the light  ay we can shut our eyes to the light so long that at last we forget that there is any light at all and that is the gate of hell  we may wrap ourselves up in our selfishness in selfish pleasures selfish cunning selfish covetousness and selfish pride till we forget that there is anything better for us than selfishness till we forget that god is love and that we his children are meant to be loving even as he is loving and that also is the gate of hell and worst and darkest of all when in that stupid sinful loveless state of mind gods loving spirit still strives and pleads with us and tries to awaken us and terrify us with the sight of the everlasting misery and ruin into which we have thrown ourselves we may turn those pleadings of gods spirit by our own evil wills into a darker curse than all which have gone before  we may refuse to believe that god is love and fancy him as hard and cruel and proud and spiteful and unloving as we ourselves are  we may refuse though scripture prayerbook sacraments preachers assure us of it that god is our father still and deny his covenant of baptism and blaspheme his holy name by fancying him our tyrant and taskmaster who hates us and willeth the death of a sinner and has pleasure in the death of him that dieth  and then we may behave according to the lie which we ourselves have invented and all sorts of inventions of our own to escape gods wrath when in reality it is he who is wishing to turn his wrath away from us and to win back his favour when in reality it is not we who are out of favour with him but he who is out of favour with us who dread him and shrink from him we may try to deliver ourselves from him when all the while it is he the very god whom we are dreading and flying from who alone is able and willing to deliver us and with all our fears and selftormentings and faithless terrors and blasphemings of god by fancying him the very opposite to what he has declared himself we shall get no peace of conscience no deliverance from sins or from the fear of punishment but only a fearful and fiery looking forward to judgment which is hell  that is superstition hell on earth when men have so utterly forgotten the likeness of god which he manifested in his son jesus christ that they look on him as a stern and dreadful taskmaster a tyrant and not a deliverer  hell on earth which may and must lead to hell hereafter a hell of fear and doubt and hatred of him who is all lovely the hell whereof it is written that its worst torment is being cast out from the sight of god  unless the hapless sinner opens his eye and believes the covenant of his baptism and sees that god cannot lie god cannot change cannot break his covenant cannot alter his love that though he have left his fathers house and wandered into far countries and wasted his fathers substance in riotous living he is still his fathers son his fathers house is still where it was from the beginning his fathers heart still what it was from the beginning and so arises and goes back to his fathers house confessing that he is no more worthy to be called his son willing to be only as one of his hired servants and thensees not the stern countenance the cruel punishments which he dreaded  butwhile he was yet afar off his father saw him and ran and fell on his neck and kissed him  and if in our sins our only hope of comfort and peace and strength lies in remembering our baptismal covenant and being sure and certain that though we have changed god has not that though we are dark gods love shines bright and clear for ever how much more when the dark day of affliction comes  why should i speak of this and that affliction  each heart knows its own bitterness each soul has its own sorrow each mans life has its dark days of storm and tempest when all his joys seem flown away by some sudden blast of illfortune and the desire of his eyes is taken from him and all his hopes and plans all which he intended to do or to enjoy are hid with blinding mist so that he cannot see his way before him and knows not whither to go and whither to flee for help when faith in god seems broken up for the moment when he feels no strength no will no purpose and knows not what to determine what to do what to believe what to care for when the very earth seems reeling under his feet and the fountains of the abyss are broken up  then let him think of gods covenant and take heart let him think of his baptism and be at peace  is the suns warmth perished out of the sky because the storm is cold with hail and bitter winds  is gods love changed because we cannot feel it in our trouble  is the suns light perished out of the sky because the world is black with cloud and mist  has god forgotten to give light to suffering souls because we cannot see our way for a few short days of perplexity  for this is the gospel this is the message which we have received from god to preach to every sad and desolate heart on earth that god is light and in him is no darkness at all  that god is love and in him there is no cruelty at all  that god is one and in him there is no change at all  and therefore we all the most ignorant of us as well as the wisest the most sinful of us as well as the holiest the saddest and most wretched of us as well as the happiest have a right to join in that litany which is offered up here thrice every week during the time of lent and to call upon god to deliver us and all mankind not merely because we wish to be delivered from evil but because god wishes to deliver us from evil  if we pray that litany in any dark dread of god in doubt of his love and goodwill towards us like terrified slaves crying out to a hard taskmaster and entreating him not to torment them we do not pray that litany aright we do not pray it at all  for it asks god not to leave us alone but to come to us not to stop punishing us but actually himself to deliver us to defend us to set us free therefore it begins by calling on god the father because he is our father on god the son because he has already redeemed and bought us for his own on god the holy spirit because he has been striving with our wilful hearts from our youth up till now lovingly desiring to teach us to change us to sanctify us  therefore it calls on the holy blessed and glorious trinity three persons and one god because the son does not love us better than the father does or than the holy spirit does but in the life and death of the man christ jesus whom we call on to deliver us by his birth his baptism his death his resurrection by all that his manhood did and suffered here on earth in his life and death i say were shown forth bodily the glory and condescension and love and goodwill of the fulness of the godhead of all three persons of the one and undivided trinity father son and holy ghost  therefore we may pray boldly to him to spare us because we know that we are already his people already redeemed with his most precious blood already declared by holy baptism to be bound to him in an everlasting covenant therefore we may pray boldly to him not to be angry with us for ever because we know that he desires to bless us for ever if we will only let him if we will only let his love have free course and not shut our hearts to it and turn our backs upon it  therefore we can ask him to deliver us in all time of our tribulation and misery in all time of the still more dangerous temptations which wealth and prosperity bring with them in the hour of death whether of our own death or the death of those we love in the day of judgment whereof it is written  it is god who justifieth us who is he that condemneth  it is christ who died yea rather who is risen again who even now maketh intercession for us  to that boundless love of god which he showed forth in the life of christ jesus to that utter and perfect will to deliver us which god showed forth in the death of christ jesus when the father spared not his onlybegotten son but freely gave him for us to that boundless love we may trust ourselves our fortunes our families our bodies our souls the souls of those we love  trusting in that great love we may pray in that litany for deliverance to be delivered from distress and accidents from all sins which drag us down and make us miserable ashamed confused terrified selfish hateful and hating each other  we may pray to be delivered from evil because god is righteousness and hates evil  we may pray to be delivered from our sins because god is righteousness and hates our sins  we may pray for the queen her ministers her parliament because gods love and care is over them for all orders and ranks of men whether laymen or clergymen high or low in gods holy church for all who are afflicted and desolate for all who are wandering in ignorance and mistakes and sin ay for all mankind for god loves them all the son of god has bought them all with his most precious blood  and however dark and sad and sinful the world may seem around us however dark and sad and sinful our own hearts may be within us we may find comfort in that litany and pour out in it our sorrows and our fears if we begin only as it begins with the thought of god who is righteousness god who is love god who is the deliverer  and then as the rainbow reflects the sunbeams for a sign and token that the sun is shining though we see it not so will that blessed litany with its sacred name of god its calls to him who was born of the virgin mary and crucified under pontius pilate its entreaties to god to deliver us because he is a deliverer to hear us and send us good because he is a good lord himself its remembrances of the noble works which god did in our fathers days and in the old time before them its noble declaration that god does not despise the sighing of a contrite heart nor the desire of a humble spirit and that it is the very glory of his name to turn from us those evils which we most justly have deservedthat litany i say will be like a rainbow declaring to our dark and stormy hearts that the sun is shining still above the clouds that over and above us and all mankind and all the changes and chances of this mortal life is the still bright sunshine the lifegiving warmth of the sun of righteousness the absolute eternal love of our father who is in heaven who as he has declared by the mouth of his onlybegotten son is perfect in this that he does not deal with us after our sins nor reward us according to our iniquities but is good to the unthankful and the evil sending his rain alike upon the just and on the unjust and making his sun to shine alike upon the evil and the good    xliiithe mystery of godliness    great is the mystery of godliness  god was manifest in the flesh justified in the spirit seen of angels preached to the gentiles believed on in the world received up into glory1 timothy iii 16  st paul here sums up in one verse the whole of christian truth  he gives us in a few words what he says is the great mystery of godliness  now men had been inventing for themselves all kinds of mysteries of godliness all sorts of mysterious and wonderful notions about god all sorts of mysterious and strange ceremonies and ways of pleasing god or turning away his anger  and christian men are apt to do so also as well as those old heathens  they feel that they are very mysterious and wonderful beings themselves simply because they are men  they say to themselves  how strange that i should have a body of flesh and blood and appetites and passions like the animals and yet that i should have an immortal spirit in me  how strange this notion of duty which i have and which the other animals have not this notion of its being right to do some things and wrong to do others  from whence did that notion come  and again this strange notion which i have and cannot help having that i ought to be like god  and yet i do not know what god is like  from whence did that notion come  again  i fancy that god ought to be good  but how do i know that he really is good  i see the world full of injustice and misery and death  how do i know that this is not gods doing gods fault in some way  again says a man to himself  i have a fair right to believe that mankind are not the only persons in the universethat there are other beings beside god whom i cannot see  i call them angels  i hardly know what i mean by that  the really important question about them to me is  will they do me harm  can they do me good  are they stronger than iought i not to fear them to try to please them to keep them favourable to me  again he asks  does god care whether i know what is right  does god care to teach me about himself  is god desirous that i should do my duty  for if he does not care about my being good why should i care about it  again he asks  but if i knew my duty might i not find it something too farfetched too difficult for poor simple folk to do so that i should be forced to leave a right life to great scholars and to rich people or to people of a very devout delicate temper of mind who have a natural turn that way  and last of all  even if i did struggle to do right even if i gave up everything for the sake of doing right how do i know that it will profit me to do so  i shall die as every man dies and then what will become of me  shall i be a man still or onlyhorrible thoughtsome sort of empty ghost a spirit without body of which i dream and shudder while i dream of it  men in all ages heathens and christians have been puzzled by such thoughts as these as soon as they began to feel that there was a world which they could not see as well as a world which they could see a spiritual world wherein god the spirit and their own spirits and spiritual things such as right wrong duty reason love dwell for ever and a strange hidden duty on all men to obey that unseen god and the laws of that spiritual world in short a mystery of godliness  then they have tried to answer these questions for themselves and have run thereby into all manner of follies and superstitions and often too into devilish cruelties in the hope of pleasing god according to some mystery of godliness of their own invention  but to each of these puzzles st paul gives an answer in the text let us take them each in its order and you will see what i mean  the first puzzle was  how is it that while i am like the animals in some things and yet feel as if i ought to be and can be like god in other things  how is it that i feel two powers in me one dragging me downward to make me lower than the beasts the other lifting me upwardsi dare not think whither  it seems to me to be my body my bodily appetites and tempers which drag me down  is my body me part of me or a thing i should be ashamed of and long to be rid of  i fancy that i can be like god  but can my body be like god  must i not crush it neglect it get rid of it before i can follow the good instinct which draws me upward  to which st paul told timothy to answer  god was manifest in the flesh  god sent down his onlybegotten son coequal and coeternal with himself very god of very god the very same person who had been putting into mens minds those two notions of which we spoke that there is a right and a wrong and that men ought to be like god him the father sent into the world that he might be born and live and die and rise again as a man that so men might see from his example manifestly and plainly what god was like and what man ought to be like  and so jesus christ was god manifested in the flesh  now we do know what god is like  we know that he is so like man that he can take upon him mans flesh and blood without changing or lowering or defiling himself  that proves that man must have been originally made in gods likeness that mans being fallen means mans falling from the likeness of god and taking up instead with the likeness of the brutes which perish that the fault cannot be in our bodies but in our spirits which have yielded to our bodies and become their slaves instead of their masters as christs spirit was master of his body  but the son of god by being born and living as a man showed us that we are not fallen past hope not fallen so low that we cannot rise again  he showed that though mankind are sinful yet they need not be sinful for he was a man as exactly and perfectly and entirely as we are and yet in him was no sin  so he showed that brutishness and sinfulness is not our proper state but our disease and our fall and a disease of which we can be cured a fall out of which we can rise and be renewed into the true and real pattern of mankind the new adam jesus the sinless son of man and son of god  the next question i said that rose in mens mind was  how do i know that god is good as i fancy sometimes that he must be  i see the world full of sin and injustice and misery and death  perhaps that is gods doing gods fault  that is a common puzzle enough and a sad and fearful one  the sin and the misery and the death are here  if god did not bring it here yet why did he let it come here he could have stopped if he would and kept out all this wretchedness  why did he not  was he just or loving in letting sin into the world  to all which st paul answers  god was justified in the spirit  you do not see what that has to do with it  then let me show you  to be justified means to be shown and proved to be just righteous now what justified god to man was the spirit of god as he showed himself in the lord jesus christ  for when god became man and dwelt among men what sort of works were his  what was his conduct his character of what sort of spirit did he show himself to be  he went we read doing good for god was with him  not of his own will but to do his fathers will and because he was filled without measure by the spirit of god he did good he healed the sick he rebuked the proud and selfconceited hypocrite he proclaimed pardon and mercy to the brokenhearted sinner wearied and worn out by the burden of his sins  thus in every action of his life he was fighting against evil and misery and conquering it and so showing that god hates evil and misery and that the evil and the misery in the world are here against gods will  strange as it may seem to have to say it so it is  jesus christ showed that howsoever sin and sorrow came into the world it is gods will and purpose to root them out of the world and that he is righteous he is loving he is merciful he does and will fight against evil for those who are crushed by it and help poor sufferers always when they call upon him and often often of his most undeserved condescension and free grace when they are forgetting and disobeying him  and so by the good and loving and just spirit which jesus showed god was justified before men and showed to be a god of goodness and justice  the next puzzle i said was about angels and spirits whether we need to pray to them to help us and not to hurt us  st paul answers  god when he was manifested in the flesh of a man was seen by these angels  and that is enough for us  they saw the lord god condescend to be born in a stable to live as a poor man to die on the cross  they saw that his will to man was love  and they do his will  and therefore they love men they help men they minister to men because they follow the lords example and do the will of their father in heaven even as we ought to do it on earth  therefore we have no need to fear them for they love us already  and on the other hand we have no need to pray to them to help us for they know already that it is their duty to help us  they know that the son of god has put on us a higher honour than he ever put on them for he took not on him the nature of angels he took on him the nature of man and thus though man was made a little lower than the angels yet by christs taking mans nature man is crowned with a glory and honour higher than the angels  know ye not says st paul that we shall judge angels  and the angels as they told st john are our fellowservants not our masters and they know that for they saw the son of god doing utterly his fathers will and therefore they know that their duty is to do their fathers will also not to do their own wills and set themselves up as our masters to be pleaded with by us  they saw the son of god take our nature on him when they sang to the shepherds on the first christmas night  peace on earth and goodwill toward men and therefore they look on us with love and honour because we wear the human nature which christ their master wore and are partakers of the holy spirit of god even as they are  for no angel or archangel could do a right thing any more than we except by the holy spirit of god  and that holy spirit is bestowed on the poorest man who asks for it as freely as upon the highest of the heavenly host  and this leads us on to the next puzzle of which i spoke  men were apt and are apt now to say to themselves  does god care whether i know what is right  does god care to teach me about himself  is god desirous that i should do my duty  for if he does not care about my being good why should i care about it  to this st paul answers  god who was manifest in the flesh was preached to the gentiles  god does care that men should know about god for he loves them  he yearns after them as a father after his children and he knows that to know god to know the truth about god is the beginning of all wisdom the root of all safety and honour and happiness  he willeth not that any should perish but that all should come to the knowledge of the truth  and therefore when the son of god died for our sins he did not stop at that great deed of love but he ordained apostles and put upon them especially and above all men his holy spirit that they might go and preach to all nations the good news that god had become flesh and dwelt among men and borne their sorrows and infirmities and to baptize them into the very name of god itself into the name of the father and of the son and of the holy ghost that so instead of fancying now that god did not care for them they might be sure that god so longed to teach them that he called every child even from its cradle to come into his kingdom and be taught the whole mystery of godliness  the next puzzle i mentioned was  but this right life this mystery of godliness is it not something very strange and difficult and past the understanding of simple men who are not extraordinarily clever and learned scholars or deep philosophers  to that st paul answers  no  it is not past any man  it is not too deep or too difficult for the simplest the most unlearned countryman  for says st paul in the text we apostles have had proof of that we have tried it we apostles preached the mystery of godliness and it was believed on in the world  people of the world plain working men and women going about their worldly business who had no time to be great readers or great thinkers or to shut themselves up in monasteries to meditate on heavenly things but had to live and work in the commonplace busy workday worldthey believed our message  we apostles told them that the son of god had showed himself in the likeness of man and called on every man to repent and to be such a man as he was  and worldly people believed us and tried and found that without giving up their worldly work or deserting the station in which god had put them they could live godlike lives and become the sons of god without rebuke  they saw that scholarship was not wanted leisure was not wanted but only the humble heart which hungers and thirsts after righteousness  about their daily work by their cottage firesides among their poor neighbours the spirit of almighty god gave them strength to live as jesus their pattern lived he filled them with all holy pure noble brave loving thoughts and feelings fit for angels and archangels  he enabled them to rise out of their sins to trample their temptations under foot to leave their old low brutish sinful way of life behind them and become new men and persevere in every word and thought and action in virtues such as the greatest heathen sages could not copy ay even to shed their lifeblood freely and boldly in martyrdom for the sake of god and the truth of god  they these plain simple people living in the world could still live the life of god and die like heroes for the sake of god  and this again brings us to the last puzzle of which i spoke  but what became of those holy and godlike people when they died  what reward did they receive for all they had done and given up and suffered  what will become of us after we die  what will the next world be like  what is heaven like  shall i be able to enjoy it shall i be a man there or only a ghost a spirit without a body  to this st paul answers  that christ the son of god after he was manifested in the flesh was received up into glory  he does not tell us what heaven is like for though he had been caught up into the third heaven yet what he saw there he says was unspeakable he neither ought to tell or could tell what he saw  neither does st paul tell us what the next life will be like for as far as we can find god had not told him  all he says is  the man christ jesus who walked this earth like other men was received up into glory and he did not leave his mans mind his mans heart even his mans body behind him  he carried up into heaven with him his whole manhood spirit soul and body even to the print of the nails in his hands and in his most holy feet and the wound of the spear in his most holy side  and that is enough for us  because the man christ jesus is in heaven we as men may ascend to heaven  where he is we shall be  and what he is in as far as he is man we shall be what we shall be we know not but this we know that we shall be like him for we shall see him as he is  and he is a man still for it is written  there is one mediator between god and man the man christ jesus  and he will be a man at the day of judgment for it is written that  god hath ordained a day in which he will judge the world by a man whom he hath chosen  and he will be a man for ever for it is written  this man abideth for ever  and he himself said to his disciples  i will not drink of this fruit of the vine till i drink it new with you in the kingdom of my father  and again he declared even when he was on earth that he was the son of man who is in heaven  and in heaven nothing can grow less  but if christ were not man for ever as well as god he would become less for he is now god and man also at once but if he laid down his manhood and so became not man any more but god only he would become less which is not to be believed of him of whom it is written  that jesus christ is the same yesterday today and for ever  for as the athanasian creed teaches us he is not god alone nor man alone but god and man is one christ and therefore when st john declares that christ shall reign for ever and ever he declares that he shall reign not only as god but as man also  therefore whatever we do not know about the next life we know this that we shall be men there not sinful weak and mortal as we are here but holy strong immortal after the likeness of our lord the firstborn from the dead who has ascended up on high and raised our human nature to the heaven of heavens and is gone to prepare a place for us into which we too shall enter in that day when he shall change these mortal and fallen bodies which we now wear the bodies of our humiliation the bodies by wearing which we are now a little lower than the angels them the lord will change that they may be made like unto his glorious body according to the mighty working whereby he subdueth all things unto himself that we may see him face to face and dwell with him in the glory of god the father for ever  oh my friends who is sufficient for these things  what shall we say of man  is he not indeed fearfully and wonderfully made  here we are weak creatures more liable to disease and death than the dumb beasts round us full of poverty and adversity and longings which are never satisfied our minds full of mistakes our hearts full of false conceit full of spite and folly struggles murmurings quarrellings our consciences full of the remembrance of sins without number  the greatest of all heathen poets said that there was not a more miserable and pitiable animal upon the earth than man  he knew no better  he could not know better  how could he when god had not yet been manifest in the flesh  how could he dream that the lord god would condescend to be made flesh and dwell among us and show man his glory the glory of the onlybegotten of the father full of grace and truthhow could he dream that  and more than all how could he dream that god instead of throwing away our human nature when he rose again as if it was too great a degradation for him to be a man one moment more should condescend to take up his human nature his mans body soul and spirit with him into everlasting glory that he might feed with it for ever the bodies and souls of those who trust in him so as to make them fit for us at the last day to share in his everlasting life  the old heathen poet knew as well as you or i that there was an everlasting life beyond the grave that mens souls were immortal and could not die  but the thought of it was all dark and dreary and uncertain to him and to all mankind till the son of god brought life and immortality to light when he was manifest in the flesh  wonderful mystery of godliness  wonderful love of god to man wonderful condescension of god to man  still more wonderful patience of god to man  oh you who live still in sin when the son of god died and rose again to make you righteous you who defile your bodies with sins worse than the brutes when the son of god offers to raise those bodies of yours to be equal with the angels how shall you escape if you neglect so great salvation if you despise this unspeakable love if you trample under foot like swine the everlasting glory and happiness which god offers you freely without fee or price for the sake of his onlybegotten son jesus christ who died to buy them for you    xlivthe work of gods spirit    if i go not away the comforter will not come unto you but if i depart i will send him unto you  and when he is come he will reprove the world of sin and of righteousness and of judgment  of sin because they believe not on me  of righteousness because i go to my father and ye see me no more  of judgment because the prince of this world is judgedjohn xvi 711  i no not pretend to be able to explain to you the whole meaning of this text or even more than a very small part of it  for it speaks of god of god the holy spirit  and god is boundless and therefore every text which speaks of god is boundless too as god is  no man can ever see the whole meaning of it or do more than understand dimly a little of its truth  but what we can see we must think over and make use of  what can we see now from this text first we may see that the holy spirit the holy ghost the comforter is a person  not a mere thing or a state of our own hearts or a feeling in us or a power like the powers and laws by which the trees and plants grow and the sun and moon move in their courses but a person just as each of us is a person  he the holy spirit gives life to trees and plants sun and moon  but he is not their life  he gives them their life and therefore that life of theirs is not he or he could not give it for you can only give something which is not you  the scripture speaks of the holy spirit not as it but as he as a person and not as a thing as a person who can speak to mens souls guide and teach them  when he the spirit of truth is come he will guide you into all truth for he shall not speak of himself  but we may see also that the holy spirit is neither god the father nor the lord jesus christ  for the lord speaks of him the holy spirit as a different person either from him or from the father the spirit he says shall glorify me for he shall receive of mine and shall show it unto you  but we may see also that there is no difference in will or opinion or love between the holy spirit and the father and the son  for the spirit does not speak of himself there is no selfwill in him there is not one will of the father and another of the son and another of the holy ghost or one love of the father another love of the son and another of the holy ghost or one righteousness of the father another of the son another of the holy ghost  or one mercy and grace of the father another of the son another of the holy ghost  for then there would be three gods and three lords and the substance of god would be divided  but they have all one will and one love and one righteousness and one mercy  and such as the father is such is the son and such is the holy ghost  and remember always that the holy spirit is very and indeed god for he is the spirit of holiness itself of righteousness itself of goodness itself of love itself of truth itself and therefore he is the spirit of god who is the perfect holiness and righteousness and truth and love  all other holiness and righteousness and truth and love are only pictures and patterns of god just as the suns reflection in water or in a glass is a picture and pattern of the sun  as the epistle for today tells us  every good gift and every perfect is from above and cometh down from the father of lights  but the spirit of god must be god  for else what do the words mean is not the spirit of a man a man  is not your spirit what you call your soul you  is not your soul you just as much as your body is you ay a hundred times more  just so the spirit of god is god god himself and the godhead of the father of the son of the holy ghost is all one the glory equal the majesty coeternal  this then is the glorious promise made to you and to me and to all who believe and are baptized into the name of the father the son and the holy spirit that that spirit will come to us and take charge of our spirits and work in them and teach them  we cannot see him with our eyes or hear him with our ears we cannot even feel him at work in our hearts and thoughts  for he is a spirit and his likeness the thing in this world which is a pattern of him is the wind as indeed the name spirit means  you cannot see the wind you cannot even really feel the wind or hear it  you only know it by its effects by what it does  by the noise among the branches the force against your faces the bending boughs and flying dust  the spirit bloweth where it listeth and thou hearest the sound thereof but canst not tell whence it cometh or whither it goeth even so is every one who is born of the spirit  on him the spirit of god will work unseen and unfelt only to be discovered by the change which he makes in the mans heart and thoughts and first by the way in which he convinces him of sin because men believe not on jesus christ  the holy spirit shows men that the sins of the world the sin of all sins the sin which is the root of all other sins is not believing on the lord jesus christ that it was because they would not believe on the lord jesus christ that they had been falling into every other sort of sin  but you may say  how could they believe on him before he came and was born in judaea of the virgin mary  how could they believe on him when he was not there  ah my friends who told you that the lord jesus christ was not there in the world all along  not the bible certainly  for the bible tells us that he is the light who lights every man who cometh into the world that from him came and have come all the right thoughts and feelings which ever arose in the heart of every human being  the bible tells us that when god created the world he was daily rejoicing in the habitable parts of the earth and his delights were with the sons of men  the bible tells us that he was in the world and the world knew him not that all along through the dark times of heathendom the lord jesus christ was a light shining in darkness which the darkness could not close round and hide and quench  not merely to the jews but to all heathens who hungered and thirsted after righteousness did the lord jesus show something of his truth as it is written god is no acceptor of persons that is no shower of partiality or unjust favour  but in every nation he that feareth god and worketh righteousness is accepted of him  but at the time that the lord jesus sent down his holy spirit men were not working righteousness  there was not one who did good no not one  for men had forgotten what righteousness was like what a righteous man ought to do and be  men are ready to forget it every day  you and i are ready to forget it and invent some false righteousness of our own not like jesus christ but like what we in our private fancies think is most graceful or most agreeable or most easy or most grand and farfetched and difficult  but the holy spirit came to convince men of righteousness to show them what true righteousness was like  and how  in the same way that he must convince us of righteousness if we are ever to know what righteousness is or are ever to be righteous ourselves  he must show us goodness or we shall never see it or receive it or copy it  and where is this righteousness this perfect goodness of which the holy spirit will convince us  where but in the lord jesus christ in the lord jesuss character the lord jesuss good works his love his patience his perfect obedience his life his death  the holy spirit if we give up our hearts to be taught by him will make us believe and be sure and feel in our very inmost hearts how noble how beautiful how holy how perfectly godlike was he who was born of a poor virgin who walked this earth for thirtythree years in toil and sorrow who gave his back to the smiters and his cheeks to them that plucked off the hair and hid not his face from shame and spitting who died upon a cross between two thieves  and the holy spirit will convince us of righteousness by making us feel what the lord jesuss righteousness consisted in what was the root of all his goodness and holiness namely his perfect obedience to his father and our father in heaven  that is the righteousness which is not our own but gods the righteousness which comes by faith not to trust in ourselves but in god not to please ourselves but god not to do our own will but gods will  that is the righteousness of jesus christ which god set his seal on and approved when he exalted him far above all principality and powers and set him at his own right hand for a sign to all men and angels and archangels that righteousness means to trust and to obey god even to the death  3  of judgment because the prince of this world is judged  this may seem a puzzling speech at first  we shall understand it best i think by considering who the prince of this world was in our lords time and what he was like  a little before our lords time the roman emperor had conquered almost the whole world which was then known and kept all nations in slavery careless about their doing right provided they obeyed him and paid him tribute nay forcing them and tempting them into all brutal and foul sin and ignorance that he might keep up his own power over man  but now the lord of all the earth and the prince of mens hearts and thoughts was come to visit that poor enslaved and sinful world  he came the princes of this world knew him not and crucified the lord of glory  they crucified the righteous and the just one and so they were judged  they judged themselves they condemned themselves  for they showed that what they admired and what they wanted was not righteousness and love but wealth and power  they showed that no doing of good no healing of the sick or giving of sight to the blind or preaching the gospel to the poor no holiness no love not the perfect likeness of gods own goodness which shone forth in the spotless jesus was anything to them was any reason why they should not put him to death with the most cruel torments because they were afraid of his taking away their power  he said he was a king and therefore they crucified him lest his kingdom should interfere with theirs and for the same reason these same roman emperors and their magistrates for hundreds of years afterwards persecuted the christians and hunted them down like wild beasts and put them to death by all horrible tortures for the same reason that cain slew abel became his brothers deeds were righteous and his own wicked  so these roman emperors and their magistrates and generals were judged  they had shown what was in their evil hearts  they had been tried in gods balances and found wanting  the sentence of the lord god had gone forth against them  the man christ jesus whom they rejected god accepted and raised to his own right hand  they crucified him but god gave him all power in heaven and earth  and the lord jesus used his power yea and uses it still  he gave his saints and martyrs strength to defy those roman tyrants and to witness to all the earth that the righteous son of god was the king of heaven and earth and that the princes of this world who wished to break his yoke off their necks and crush all nations to powder for their own pleasure and fatten themselves upon the plunder of all the earth would surely come to naught as it is written in the second psalm  the kings of the earth set themselves and the rulers take counsel together against the lord and his anointed  yet have i set my king upon my holy hill of zion  thou shalt break them with a rod of iron  thou shalt dash them in pieces like a potters vessel  and they did come to naught  that great roman empire rotted away miserably after years of such distress as had never been seen on the earth before and the emperors came one after another to shameful or dreadful deaths  and all the while the gospel spread and the church grew till all the kingdoms of the roman empire had become the kingdoms of god and of his christ by the power of the holy spirit working in mens hearts and showing them as our lord said he would that jesus of nazareth was both lord and king  and so was fulfilled the lords words in the gospel for today  the holy spirit shall glorify me for he shall receive of mine and shall show it unto you all things that the father hath are mine therefore said i that he should take of mine and show it unto you  oh my friends pray for yourselves and join me while i pray for you that the holy and righteous spirit of god may convince you and me and all mankind more and more day by day of sin of righteousness and of judgment  pray to that holy spirit to convince you of sin day by day whensoever you do the least wrong thing  pray to him to keep your consciences tender and quick that you may feel instantly and lament deeply every wrong thing you do  pray to him to give you every time you do wrong that godly sorrow which brings peace and health that heartrepentance never to be repented of  pray to him to convince you more and more as you grow older that all sin comes from not believing in jesus christ not believing that he is near you with you in you putting into your hearts all right thoughts and good desires and willing if you will to help you to put those thoughts and desires into good practice  pray to the holy spirit to convince you more and more of righteousness to make you see what righteousness is that it is the very character and likeness of god the father because it is the character and likeness of the lord jesus christ who was the brightness of the fathers glory and the express image of his person  pray to him to make you see the beauty of holiness  how fair and noble and glorious a thing goodness is how truly solomon says  that all the things that may be desired are not to be compared to it  pray to the holy spirit to convince you more and more of judgment and to make you sure that the lord is king a righteous judge of purer eyes than to behold iniquity whose fan is in his hand who thoroughly purges his floor who comes quickly and his reward is with him and who surely casts out of his kingdom sooner or later all things that offend and whosoever loveth and maketh a lie  pray to him to make you sure by faith though you cannot see it that the prince of this world is judged that evil doing oppression tyranny injustice cheating neglect of man by man cannot and will not prosper upon the face of gods earth for the everlasting sentence and wrath of god is revealed forth every moment against all unrighteousness of men which he will surely punish yea and does hourly punish by him by whom he judges the world jesus christ the lord who is exalted high above all principalities and powers and has all power given to him in heaven and earth which he uses as he used it in judaea of old utterly and always for the good of all mankind whom he hath redeemed with his most precious blood    xlvthe gospel    moreover brethren i declare unto you the gospel which i preached unto you which also ye have received and wherein ye stand by which also ye are saved if ye keep in memory what i preached unto you unless ye have believed in vain  for i delivered unto you first of all that which i also received how that christ died for our sins according to the scriptures and that he was buried and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures1 corinthians xv 14  this is st pauls account of the gospel the good news which he preached to the sinful and profligate corinthians when they were sunk lower than the beasts which perish  and because they believed this good news he said they were saved then and there and would be safe only as long as they believed that good news and kept it in their memories  now from what did this good news save them  from their sins  there was something in st pauls good news which made them hate their sins and repent of them and throw them away and rise up to be new men and women living new lives in godliness and purity and justice such as they had never lived before  now mind it was not bad news which made the corinthians repent of their sins it was good news  it was not that st paul told them that god was going to cast them into endless torment for their sins and that therefore they were terrified and afraid and so repented  doubtless st paul told them as he told other heathens that the wrath of god was revealed from heaven against all unrighteousness that tribulation and anguish was laid up in store for every soul of man who worketh evil  but still st paul says plainly here that what saved the corinthians was not that or any other fearful and terrifying news but a gospelgood news  and he says that this good news did not merely as some would wish it to do make them comfortable in their minds while they went on in their old wicked ways  no  he says that it made them stand  that is made them upright strongminded righteous selfrestraining people and that they were saved by it from those sins which had been dragging them down and keeping them diseased in soul weak miserable the slaves of their own passions and foul pleasures  what wonderful good news was this then which could work so strange a change in these poor heathens and how could it change them  let us see first what it was  that christ died for our sins according to the scriptures and that he was buried and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures and that he was seen of peter then of the twelve after that he was seen of above five hundred brethren at once of whom the greater part remained unto this day but some are fallen asleep after that he was seen of james then of all the apostles  and last of all he was seen of me also as of one born out of due time  you see here that st paul for some good reason says much more about the lords rising again than even about his most precious death and passion on the cross while about his ascending into heaven he says nothing  and you will find in the new testament that the apostles often did the same  they spoke of the lord rising again as if that was the great wonder the great glory the great good news and as if his most precious death was not perfect without that  they said that the especial office for which the lord had ordained them was to be witnesses of his resurrection  they said that the lord rose again for our justification  they said  if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the lord jesus and shalt believe in thy heart that god has raised him from the dead thou shalt be saved  here again just as in the text believing in the lords resurrection is made the great article of faith  why is this  because that last verse which i quoted may tell us if we consider it carefully  what does confessing the lord jesus with our mouth mean  it means what we ought to mean when we say in the apostles creed i believe in jesus christ his only son our lord  not merely i believe that there is an only son of god  but i believe in a certain man with a certain character who is that only son of god  and what you will ask does that mean  to know that i fear we must go back many many hundred years to the times when the old martyrs confessed the lord jesus christ before the heathen  those were times in which it was not enough to say the apostles creed in church  men ay and tender women and little children had to stand by it through terror and shame and to die in torments unspeakable because they chose to say  i believe in jesus christ our lord  now what was it which made the heathen hate and persecute and torture and murder them for saying that  what was there in those plain words of the apostles creed which made the great heathen emperors of rome and their officers and judges hunt the christians down like wild beasts for 300 years and declare that they were not fit to live  i will tell you  when the christians were brought before the emperors judges for being christians they did not merely say  i believe that jesus christs blood will save my soul after death  they said that  but they said a great deal more than that  if that had been all that the christians said the judge would have answered  what care i for your souls or for your notions about what will happen to them when you are dead  go your way  you may be of what religion you like and talk and think about your own souls as much as you like provided you do not trouble the roman emperors power  but the heathen judge did not make that answer because he knew well enough that what the christians believed was not a mere religion about what would happen to their souls after death but something which if it gained ground would utterly destroy the roman emperors power  he used generally to say to the christians only this  will you burn those few grains of incense in honour of the emperor of rome  and he knew and the christians knew well enough that those words meant  will you confess with your mouth the emperor of rome  will you confess that he is the only lord and king of this whole earth and of your bodies and souls and that there is no power or authority but of him for the gods have delivered all things into his hands  and then came out what confessing the lord jesus really means  for the christians used to answer  no  the emperor of rome is the lord and master of our bodies and we will obey his laws so far as we can without doing wrong  but we cannot obey them when they are contrary to the laws of our lord and master jesus christ  for the lord jesus christ who was crucified and rose again the third day he and not the emperor of rome at all is the lord and king of the whole earth and of our bodies and souls and we must obey him before we obey anyone else power and authority come not from the emperor of rome but from the lord jesus christ and the emperor is only his servant and steward and must obey him just as much as we or the lord will punish him as surely and easily as he will the meanest slave  for god has delivered all things and the emperor of rome among the rest into the hand of his son jesus christ who sits a king over all god blessed for ever  that was confessing christ  and to that the heathen judges used to make but one answerfor there was but one to make  those heathen judges guilty consciences as well as their worldly cunning told them plainly enough exactly what st paul told the christians that those christians by confessing christ were not fighting against flesh and blood and setting up their selfish interests against other peoples selfish interests but that the battle they were fighting was a much deeper and more terrible one that by saying that one who had walked the earth as a poor man and yet a perfectly righteous and loving man doing nothing but good and sacrificing himself utterly for poor fallen creatures they were fighting against the whole state of things all over the world against the government and principles and religion of that whole unjust and tyrannical roman empire and all its rulers and generals and judges against principalities against powers against the worldrulers of the darkness of those times against spiritual wickedness in heavenly things  for if jesus christs life was the right life those rulers must be utterly wrong for it was exactly opposite to his  if jesus christ was really the governor of the earth there was no hope for them for their way of governing was exactly opposite to his  so as i say they made but one answer because there was but one to make  you say that jesus christ is king of kings and lord of lords  i say the emperor of rome is  you say you must obey christ first and the emperor of rome afterwards  i say that you must obey the emperor first and christ afterwards  at all events if you do not you have no right on this earth of the emperors either the emperors power must fall or your notion about jesus christs power must  and we will see whether your heavenly king of whom you talk can deliver you out of the emperors hand  and then came the scourge and the redhot iron and the wild beasts and the cross and all devilish tortures which mans evil will could invent brought to bear without shame or mercy upon aged men and tender girls and even little children just to make them say that the earth belonged to the emperor and not to jesus christ  those who died bravely under those tortures without denying christ were called martyrs which means witnessespeople who bore witness before god and man that jesus christ was king and lord  those who did not die under the tortures but escaped after all were called confessorspeople who had confessed with their mouths that jesus christ was king and lord in spite of their terror and agony     that was what confessing jesus christ meant in the old times  and that was what it ought to mean now even though there is no persecution or torture for christians in these happier times  and now we may see perhaps why st paul spoke so much of our lords rising again as the most important part of the gospel  because he wanted christians to believe not merely in a christ who once died but in him who died and is alive for evermore in a christ who rose again body soul and spirit and sat at gods right hand praying for poor creatures when they were tempted and persecuted and tormented for righteousness sake  st paul knew well that such fearful times as those of which i have been speaking were coming on the people to whom he wrote  and he knew equally well that the only thought which could save them when the heathen judges commanded them to deny the lord jesus was the thought that he was really risen the only thought which could make them bold enough to face all the horrors of death was the thought that the lord jesus had not merely tasted death but conquered it and risen again from it  and therefore it is that st paul speaks so often of christs resurrection and that in the text he takes so much pains to prove that christ had really risen by telling them how many persons well known to him who wrote to them had seen the lord jesus christ after he rose and talked with him and were sure that he was the very same person still with the same countenance and body and soul and spirit as he had when he was nailed to the cross and laid in the sepulchre  what a thought for a poor creature in the last agony of fear and shame expecting presently to be torn in pieces or burnt alive death this horrible death cannot conquer me weak and fearful as i am for my lord and master for whom i am going to suffer has conquered death and he will not let it conquer me  he is stronger than death and hell and he will not suffer me at my last hour for any pains of death to fall from him  he is king of heaven and earth and he will take care of his own  what a comfortable thought to be able to say  ay i am torn from wife and child and all which i love on earth  but not for ever not for ever  for christ rose from the dead  and i who belong to christ shall rise as he did  this poor flesh of mine may be burnt in flames devoured by ravenous beasts  what matter  christ the king of men has risen from the dead and become the firstfruits of them that slept  that same spirit of his which brought back his body from the grave and hell will bring our bodies also from the grave and hell to a nobler happier life with him in glory unspeakable  christ is risen and i shall rise with him at the last day  christ sits at gods right hand watching me pitying me and blessing me holding out to me a crown of glory which shall never fade away  that was the thought which gave stephen courage to confess the lord jesus christ amid to die in peace and the murderous blows of the jews  for by faith he saw as he said the heavens opened and jesus sitting at the right hand of god  he knew that his lord was risen and that he would hear his dying cry  lord jesus receive my spirit  and so with us my friends we have no martyrdom to go through thank god but it is just as true of us as it was of the blessed martyrs and confessors that there is no other name under heaven by which we can be saved but the name of the lord jesus christ  saved not only from hell but from sin from giving way to temptation from denying christ  oh pray for faith  pray for faith  pray to be able really to confess with your mouth the lord jesus  pray to believe with your hearts that god has raised him from the dead  then when you are tempted to do wrong you like stephen will see not with your bodily eyes but by faith the lord jesus sitting at gods right hand and be able to say to him  lord jesus who hast conquered all temptation help me to conquer this  thine eye is on me how can i do this great wickedness and sin against thee  when you are in terror and trouble and affliction and know not where to turn that same blessed thoughtchrist is risen from the deadwill be a shield and a strength to you which no other thought can give  my lord is risen he is here stilla man with his mans body and his mans spirithis mans love and tenderness he has taken them all up to heaven with him  he is a man still though he is very god of very god  he rose from the dead as a man and therefore he can understand me and feel for me still now here in england in this very year 1852 just as much as he could when he was walking upon earth in judaea of old  ay and in the black jaws of death when this world is vanishing from our eyes and we are going we know not whither leaving behind us all we know and love and understand then that thought of all thoughts christ is risen from the deadis the only one which will save us from dark sad thoughts from fear and despair or from stupid carelessness and the death of a brute beast such as too many die christ is risen and i shall rise  christ has conquered death for himself and he will conquer it for me  christ took his mans body and soul with him from the tomb to gods right hand and he will raise my mans body and soul at the last day that i may be with him for ever and see him where he is  in life and in death this is the only thing which shall save us from sin from terror and from the dread of death the same good news which st paul preached to the corinthians the same good news which made st stephen and the martyrs and confessors of old brave to endure all misery for the sake of the good and blessed news that god had raised his son jesus from the dead    xlvigods way with man    and ye shall know that i am the lord when i have wrought with you for my names sake not according to your wicked ways nor according to your corrupt doings o ye house of israel saith the lord god ezekiel xx 44  in this chapter the prophet ezekiel argues with his sinful and rebellious countrymen and puts them in mind of all that god has done for them and with them from the time when he brought them out of egypt to that day  and now comes the old question what has this to do with us  st paul tells us that all things which happened to the old jews happened for our example  what example can we learn from this chapter  this i think we may learn  is not the way in which god taught these jews the same way in which he teaches many a manperhaps every man  which of us when we were young has not had his teaching from god  the old catechism which our mothers taught us was not that a word from god himself to us  the voice of conscience which made us happy when we had done right and uneasy and ashamed when we had gone wrong was not that a word from god to us  yes my friends those childs feelings of ours about right and wrong were none other than the voice of the lord jesus christ the word of god the light which lightens every man who comes into the world  i tell you every right thought and wish every longing to be better than you were which ever came into any one of your hearts came from him the lord jesus it was his word his voice his spirit speaking to your spirit just as really as he spoke to his prophet ezekiel of whom we have been reading  think of that  recollect never never forget that all your good thoughts and feelings are not your own not your own at all but the lords that without his light your hearts are nothing but darkness blind ignorance and blind selfishness and blind passions and lusts that it is he he himself who has been fighting against the darkness in you all your life long  oh think then what your sin has been in putting aside those good thoughts and longings you were turning your back you were shutting your doors to the lord god himself very god of very god begotten by whom all things were made  the creator came to visit his creature and his creature shut him out  the almighty god pleaded with mortal man and mortal man bade god go and come back at a more convenient season  a voice in your heart seemed to say  oh if i could but be a better man  how i wish that i could but give up these bad habits and mend  i hate and despise myself for being so bad  and then you fancied that that voice was your own voice that those good thoughts were your own thoughts  if you had really known whose they were if you had really known as the bible tells you that they were the word of the lord the onlybegotten son of the father speaking to your heart i hardly think that you would have been so ready to say yourself  well then i will mend but not just now  some day or other somehow or other i hope i shall be a better man  it will be time enough to make my peace with god when i am growing old  you would not have dared to thrust away the good thoughts and keep them waiting while you took your pleasure in a few more years sin if you had guessed whom you were thrusting away if you had guessed whom you were keeping waiting  and my good friends has not god been saying to us many a time from our youth up as he did to the jews of old  do not walk in the statutes of your fathers nor defile yourselves with their idols do you ask me how  why thus  have you never said to yourself how ill my father prospered because he would do wrong  or again see how evil doing brings its own punishment  there is so and so growing rich by his cheating and his covetousness and yet for all his money i would not change places with him  god forbid that i should have on my mind what he has on his mind why should i make a long story of so simple a matter  which of us has not felt at times that thought  how much misery has come in this very parish from the illdoing of the generation who are gone to their account and from the illtraining which they gave their children  and what was that but the word of the lord himself speaking to our hearts and saying to us  do not defile yourselves with their idols do not hurt your souls by hunting after the things which they loved better than they loved me  money pleasure drink fighting smuggling poaching wantonness and lust i am the lord your god  and yet young people will not listen to that warning voice of god they see other people even their own fathers and mothers punished for their sins perhaps made poor by their sins perhaps made unhealthy by their sins perhaps made miserable and illtempered by their sins  and yet they go and fall into or rather walk openeyed into the very same sins which made their parents wretched  oh how many a young person sees their home made a complete hell on earth by ungodliness and the illtemper and selfishness which come from ungodliness and then as soon as they have a home of their own set to work to make their own family as miserable as their fathers was before them  but people say often  how could we help it  we had no chance we were brought up in bad ways we had a bad example set us how can you expect us to be better than our fathers and mothers and our elder brothers and sisters  if we had had a fair chance we might have been different  but we had none and we could not help going the bad way for we were set in it the day we were born  well my dear friends god shall judge you not i  if little is given to a man little is required of him  but not nothing at all because more than nothing was given him  a little is given to every man and therefore a little is required of every man  and so he who knew not his masters will shall be beaten with few stripes  but he will be beaten with some stripes because he ought to have known something at least of his masters will  if you were dumb animals which can only follow their own lusts and passions and must be what nature has made them then your excuse would be good enough but your excuse is not good now just because you are men and women and not dumb beasts and therefore can rise above your natures and conquer your lusts and passions as they cannot and can do what you do not like because though you dislike it you know that it is right and therefore god does not take that excuse which sinners make that they have had no teaching  but what does he do to them  suppose now that you had a dog which would not be taught or broken in or cured of biting or made useful or bearable in any way what would you do to that dog  i suppose that you would kill it you would say  it is an illconditioned animal and there is no making it any better so the only thing is to put it out of the way and not let it eat food which might be better spent  now does god deal so with sinners  when young people rush headlong into sin and become a nuisance to themselves and their neighbours does god kill them at once that better men may step into their place  no  and why  just because they are not dumb animals which cannot be made better but gods children who can be made better  if there were really no hope of a sinner repenting and amending i think god would not leave him long alive to cumber the ground  but there is hope for every one because god the father loves all the loving heart of the lord jesus christ yearns after all the holy spirit which proceeds from the father and the son strives with the hearts of all therefore god in his patience and tender mercy tries to bring his foolish children to their senses  and how  often in the very same way in which ezekiel says he tried to bring the jews to their senses by letting them go on in the road of sin till they see what an ugly pit that same road ends in  if your child would not believe you when you warned and assured him that the fire would burn him would it not be the very best way of bringing him to his senses to tell him  very well go your own way put your hand into the fire and see what comes of it you will not believe me you will believe your own feelings when your hand is burnt  so did the lord to those rebellious jews when they would go after their fathers sins  he gave them statutes which were not good and judgments by which they could not live to the end that they might know that he was the lord  god did not make them commit any sins  god forbid  he only took away his spirit his light and teaching from them and let them go on in the light of their own foolish and bewildered hearts till their sin bred misery and shame to them and they were filled with the fruit of their own devices  then after all their wealth was gone and their land was wasted by cruel enemies and they themselves were carried away captive into babylon they began to awake and say to themselves we were wrong after all and the lord was right  he knew what was really good for us better than we did  we thought that we could do without him disobey him  but he is the lord after all  he has been too strong for us he has punished us  if we had listened to his warnings years ago we might have been saved all this misery  ah how many a poor foolish creature in misery and shame with a guilty conscience and a sad heart sits down like the prodigal son among the swinish bad company into which his sins have brought him longing to fill his belly with the husks which the swine eat but he cannot  he tries to forget his sorrow by drinking by bad company by gambling by gossiping like the fools around him  but he cannot he finds no more pleasure in sin  he is sick and tired of it  he has had enough of it and too much  he is miserable and he hardly knows why  but miserable he is  there is a longing and craving and hunger at his heart after something better at least after something different  then he begins to remember his heavenly fathers house  old words which he learnt at his mothers knee good old words out of his catechism and his bible start up strangely in his mind  he had forgotten them laughed at them perhaps in his wild days  but now they come up he does not know where from like beautiful ghosts gliding in  and he is ashamed of them they reproach him the dear old lessons and yet they seem pleasant to him though they make him blush  and at last he says to himself would god that i were a little child again once more an innocent little child at my mothers knee  i thought myself clever and cunning  i thought i could go my own way and enjoy myself  but i cannot  perhaps i have been a fool and the old sunday books were right after all  at least i am miserable  i thought i was my own master  but perhaps he about whom i used to read in the sunday books is my master after all  at least i am not my own master i am a slave  perhaps i have been fighting against him against the lord god all this time and now he has shown me that he is the stronger of the two     and so the poor man learns in trouble and shame to know like the jews of old who is the lord  and when the lord has drawn a man thus far does he stop  not so he does not leave his work half done  if the work is half done it is that we stop not that he stops  whosoever comes to him howsoever confusedly or clumsily or even lazily they may come he will in no wise cast out  he may afflict them still more to cure that confusion and laziness but he is a physician who never sends a willing patient away or keeps him waiting for a single hour  how then does the lord deal with such a man  does he drive him further  not if he will go without being driven  you would call it cruel to drive a beast on with blows when it was willing to be led peaceably  and be sure god is not more cruel than man  as soon as we are willing to be led he will take his rod off from us and lead us tenderly enough  for i have known god do this to a man and a sinful man as ever trod this earth  i have known such a man brought into utter misery and shame of heart and heavy affliction in outward matters till his spirit was utterly broken and he was ready to say i am a beast and a fool  i am not worth the bread i eat  let me lie down and die  and then when the lord had driven that man so far i have seen i who speak to you now how the lord turned and looked on that man as he turned and looked on peter and brought his poor soul to life again as he brought peters by a loving smile and not an angry frown  i have seen the lord heap that man with all manner of unexpected blessings and pay him back sevenfold for all his affliction and raise him up body and soul and satisfy him with good things so that his youth was renewed like the eagles  and so the mans conversion to god though it was begun by gods chastisements and afflictions was brought to perfection by gods mercy and bounty and it happened to that man as ezekiel prophesied that it would happen to the jews that not fear and dread but honour gratitude and that noble shame of which no man need be ashamed brought him home to god at last  and you shall remember your ways and all your doings wherein ye have been defiled  and you shall loathe yourselves in your own sight for all the evils which you have committed  and you shall know that i am the lord when i have wrought with you for my names sake not according to your wicked ways nor according to your corrupt doings o house of israel saith the lord god  you see that gods mercy to them would not make them conceited or careless  it would increase their shame and confusion when they found out what sort of a lord he was against whom they had been rebellious longsuffering and of tender mercy returning good for evil to his disobedient children  that feeling would awake in them more shame and more confusion than ever  but it would be a noble shame a happy confusion and tears of joy and gratitude not of bitterness  such a shame such a confusion such tears as the blessed magdalenes when she knelt at the lords feet and found that instead of bating her and thrusting her away for all her sins he told her to go in peace pardoned and happy  then she knew the lord she found out his characterhis name for she found out that his name was love  oh my friends this is the great secret the only knowledge worth living for because it is the only knowledge which will enable you to live worthilyto know the lord  that knowledge will enable you to live a life which will last and grow and prosper for ever beyond the grave and death and judgment and eternities of eternities  as the lord himself said when he was upon earth this is eternal life to know thee the only true god and jesus christ whom thou hast sent  therefore there is no use my warning you against sin and telling you do not do this and do not do that unless i tell you at the same time who is the lord  for till you know that the good god is the lord you will have no real sound heartfelt reason for giving up your sins and what is more you will not be able to give them up  you may alter your sort of sins from fear of this and that but the root of sin will be there still and if it cannot bear one sort of fruit it will bear another if you dare not drink or riot you may become covetous and griping if you dare not give way to young mens sins you will take to old mens sins instead if you dare not commit open sins you will commit secret ones in your thoughts  sin is much too stout a plant to be kept from bearing some sort of fruit  as long as it is not rooted up the root will breed death in you of some sort or other and the only feeling which can root up sin is to know that jesus christ the son of god is your lord and that your lord condescended to die upon the cross for you that you must be the lords and are not your own but bought with the price of his most precious blood that you may glorify god with your body and your soul which are his  just so the blessed st augustine found that he could never conquer his own sins by arguing with himself or by any other means till he got to know god and to see that god was the lord  and when his spirit was utterly broken when he saw himself in spite of all his wonderful cleverness and learning to have been a fool and blind all along though people round him were flattering him and running after him to hear his learning then the old words which he learnt at his mothers knee came up in his mind and he knew that god was the lord after all and that god had been watching him guiding him letting him go wrong only to show him the folly of going wrong caring for him even when he left him to himself and his sins and the sad ways of his sins bearing with him pleading with his conscience alluring him back to the only true happiness as a loving father with a rebellious and selfwilled child  and then when st augustine had found out at last that god was his lord who had been taking the charge of him all through his heathen youth he became a changed man he was able to conquer his sins for god conquered them for him  he was able to give up the profligate life which he had been leading not from fear of punishment but from the spirit of godthe spirit of gratitude honour trust and love toward god which made him abide in god and god abide in him  to that blessed state may god of his great mercy bring us all  to it he will bring us all unless we rebel and set up our foolish and selfish will against his loving and wise will  and if he does bring us to it it is little matter whether he brings us to it through joy or through sorrow through honour or through shame through the garden of eden or through the valley of the shadow of death  for my dear friends what matter how bitter the medicine is if it does but save our lives    xlviithe marriage at cana    there was a marriage in cana of galilee and the mother of jesus was there  and both jesus was called and his disciples to the marriagejohn ii 1 2  it is i think in the first place an important as well as a pleasant thing to know that the lords glory as st paul says was first shown forth at a wedding at a feast  not at a time of sorrow but of joy  not about some strange affliction or disease such as is the lot of very few but about a marriage that which happens in the ordinary lot of all mankind  not in any fearful judgment or destruction of sinners but in blessing wedlock by which whether among saints or sinners mankind is increased  not by helping some great philosopher to think more deeply or some great saint to perform more wonderful acts of holiness but in giving the simple pleasure of wine to simple commonplace people of whom we neither read that they were rich or righteous  we do not even read whether the master of the feast ever found out that jesus had worked a miracle or whether any of the company ever believed in him on the strength of that miracle except his mother and the disciples and the servants who were probably the poor slaves of people in a low or middling class of life  but that is the way of the lord  he is no respecter of persons  rich and poor are alike in his sight and the poor need him most and therefore he began his work with the poor in cana as he did in st jamess time when the poor of this world were rich in faith and the rich of this world were oppressors and taskmasters  so he does in every age  though no one else cares for the poor he cares for them  with their hearts he begins his work even as he did in england sixty years ago by the preaching of whitfield and wesley  do you wish to know if anything is the lords work  see if it is a work among the poor  do you wish to know whether any preaching is the true gospel of the lord  see whether it is a gospel a good news to the poor  i know no other test than that  by doing that by preaching the gospel to the poor by working miracles for the poor he has showed forth his glory and proved himself the true and just and loving lord of all  but again the lord is a giver and not a taskmaster  he does not demand from us  he gives to us  he had been giving from the foundation of the world  corn and wine rain and sunshine and fruitful seasons had been his sending  and now he was come to show it  he was come to show men who it was who had been filling their heart with joy and gladness who had been bringing out of the earth and air by his unseen chemistry the wine which maketh glad the heart of man  in every grape that hangs upon the vine water is changed into wine as the sap ripens into rich juice  he had been doing that all along in every vineyard and orchard and that was his glory  now he was come to prove that to draw back the veil of custom and carnal sense and manifest himself  men had seen the grapes ripen on the tree and they were tempted to say as every one of us is tempted now  it is the sun and the air the nature of the vine and the nature of the climate which makes the wine  jesus comes and answers  not so  i make the wine i have been making it all along  the vines the sun the weather are only my tools wherewith i worked turning rain and sap into wine and i am greater than they i made them i do not depend on them i can make wine from water without vines or sunshine  behold and drink and see my glory without the vineyard since you had forgotten how to see it in the vineyard  for i am now even as i was in paradise the word of the lord god and now even as in paradise i walk among the trees of the garden and they know me and obey me though the world knows me not i have been all along in the world and the world knows me not  know me now lest you lose the knowledge of me for ever  those of the jews who received that message as the disciples did found out their ancient lord and clung to him and know now in the world of spirits that his message was indeed a true one  those who did not lost sight of him to this day their eyes are blinded to this day they have utterly forgotten that they have a lord and ruler who is the word and son of god  their faith is no more like the faith of david than their understanding of the scriptures is like his  the bible is a dead letter to them  the kingdom and government of god is forgotten by them  of all godworshipping people in the world the jews are the least godly the most given up to the worship of this world and the things which they can see and taste and handle and therefore to covetousness cheating lying tyranny and all the sins which spring from forgetting that this world belongs to the lord and that he rules and guides it that its blessings are his gifts and we his stewards to use them for the good of all  may god help and forgive and convert them  doubt not that he will do so in his good time  but let us beware my friends lest we fall into the same sin  do not fancy that we are not in just the same danger  it would be a cowardly thing of a preacher to call jews or heathens or any other absent persons hard names unless their mistakes and their sins were such as his own people wanted warnings against ay perhaps had the very root of them in their hearts already  and we have the root of the jews sin in our own hearts why is this one miracle read in our churches to this day if we do not stand just as much in need of the lesson as those for whom it was first worked  we as well as they are in danger of forgetting who it is that sends us corn and wine and fruitful seasons love and marriage and all the blessings of this life  we as well as the jews are continually fancying that these outward earthly things as we call them in our shallow carnal conceits have nothing to do with jesus or his kingdom but that we may compete and scrape even cheat and lie to get them and when we have them misuse them selfishly as if they belonged to no one but ourselves as if we had no duty to perform about them as if we owed god no service for them  and again we are just as much as the jews were in danger of spiritual pride in danger of fancying that because we are religious and have or fancy we have deep experiences and beautiful thoughts about god and christ and our own souls therefore we can afford to despise those who do not know as much as ourselves to despise the common pleasures and petty sorrows of poor creatures whose souls and bodies are grovelling in the dust busied with the cares of this world at their wits end to get their daily bread to despise the merriment of young people the play of children and all those everyday happinesses which though we may turn from them with a sneer are precious in the sight of him who made heaven and earth all such proud thoughts all such contempt of those who do not seem as spiritual as we fancy ourselves is evil  it is from the devil and not from god  it is the same vile spirit which made the pharisees of old say  this peoplethese poor worldly drudging wretcheswho know not the law are accursed  and mind this is not a sin of rich and learned and highborn men only  they may be more tempted to it than others but poor men when they become by the grace of god wiser more spiritual more holy than others are tempted just as much as the rich to despise their poor neighbours to whom god has not given the same light as themselves and surely in them it shows ugliest of all  a learned and highborn man may be excused for looking down upon the sinful poor because he does not understand their temptations because he never has been ignorant and struggling as they are  but a poor man who despises the poorhe has no excuse  he ought above all men to feel for them for he has been tempted even as they are  he knows their sorrows he has been through their dark valley of bad food bad lodging want of work want of teaching low cares which drag the soul to earth  surely a poor man who has tasted gods love and christs light ought above all others instead of turning his back on his class to pity them to make common cause with them to teach them guide them comfort them in a way no rich man can  yes after all it is the poor must help the poor the poor must comfort the poor the poor must teach and convert the poor  see in the epistle for this day st paul makes no distinction between rich and poor  this epistle is joined with the gospel for the day to show us what ought to be the conduct of christians who believe in the miracle of cana what men should do who believe that they have a lord in heaven by whose command suns shine fruits ripen men enjoy the blessings of harvest of marriage of the comforts which the heathen and the savage as well as the christian man partake what men should do who believe that they have a lord in heaven who entered into the common joys and sorrows of lowly men who was once himself a poor villager who ate with publicans and sinners who condescended to join in a wedding feast and increase the mere animal enjoyment of the guests  and what is st pauls command to poor as well as rich  read the epistle for this day and see  you see at once that this epistle is written in the same spirit as our lords words  by gods spirit in short the spirit which brought the lord jesus so condescendingly to the wedding feast the spirit which made him care so heartily for the common pleasures of those around him  my friends these are not commands to one class but to all  poor as well as rich may show mercy with cheerfulness and love without dissimulation  poor as well as rich may minister to others with earnestness and condescend to those of low estate  not a word in this whole epistle which does not apply equally to every rank and sex and age  neither are these commands to each of us by ourselves but to all of us together as members of a family  if you will look through them they are not things to be done to ourselves but to our neighbours not experiences to be felt about our own souls  but rules of conduct to our fellowmen  they are all different branches and flowers from that one root  thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself  do we live thus rich or poor  can we look each other in the face this afternoon and say each man to his neighbour  i have behaved like a brother to you  i have rejoiced at your good fortune and grieved at your sorrow  i have preferred you to myself  i have loved you without dissimulation  i have been earnest in my place and duty in the parish for the sake of the common good of all  i have condescended to those of lower rank than myself  i have  ah my dear friends i had better not go on with the list  god forgive us all  the less we try to justify ourselves on this score the better some of us do indeed try to behave like brothers and sisters to their neighbours but how few of us and those few how little  and yet we are brothers  we are members of one family sons of one father jointheirs with one lord the poor man who sat eating and drinking at the wedding feast in cana of galilee and mixed freely in the joys and the sorrows of the poorest and meanest  jointheirs with christ yet how unlike him  my friends we need to repent and amend our ways we need to confess every one of us rich and poor the pride the selfishness the carelessness about each other which keeps us so much apart knowing so little of each other feeling so little for each other  oh confess this sin to god every one of you  those who have behaved most like brothers will be most ready to confess how little they have behaved like brothers  confess  father i have sinned against heaven and before thee and am no more worthy to be called thy son for i have not loved cared for helped my brothers and sisters round who are just as much thy children as i am  pray for the spirit of jesus the spirit of condescension love fellow feeling that spirit which rejoices simply and heartily with those who are happy and feels for anothers sorrows as if they were its own  pray for it for till it comes there will be no peace on earth  pray for it for when it comes and takes possession of your hearts and you all really love and live like brothers children of one father the kingdom of god will be come indeed and his will be done on earth as it is in heaven    xlviiiparable of the lowest place    and he put forth a parable to those which were bidden when he marked how they chose out the chief rooms saying unto them when thou art bidden of any man to a wedding sit not down in the highest room lest a more honourable man than thou be bidden of him and he that bade thee and him come and say to thee give this man place and thou begin with shame to take the lowest room  but when thou art bidden go and sit down in the lowest room that when he that bade thee cometh he may say unto thee friend go up higher  then shalt thou have worship in the presence of them that sit at meat with thee  for whosoever exalteth himself shall be abased and he that humbleth himself shall be exaltedluke xiv 711  we heard in the gospel for today how the lord jesus put forth a parable to those who were invited to a dinner with him at the pharisees house  a parable means an example of any rules or laws a story about some rule by hearing which people may see how the rule works in practice and understand it  now our lords parables were about the kingdom of god  they were examples of the rules and laws by which the kingdom of god is governed and carried on  therefore he begins many of his parables by saying the kingdom of god is like somethingsomething which people see daily and understand more or less  the kingdom of god is like a field the kingdom of god is like a net the kingdom of god is like a grain of mustard seed and so forth  and even where he did not begin one of his parables by speaking of the kingdom of god we may be still certain that it has to do with the kingdom of god  for the one great reason why the lord was made flesh and dwelt among us was to preach the kingdom of god his father and our father and to prove to men that god was their king even at the price of his most precious blood  and therefore everything which he ever did and everything which he ever spoke had to do with this one great work of his  this parable therefore which you heard read in the gospel for today has to do with the kingdom of god and is an example of the laws of it  now what is the kingdom of god  it is worth our while to consider for at baptism we were declared members of the kingdom of god we were to renounce the world and to live according to the kingdom of god  the kingdom of god is simply the way in which god governs men and the world is the way in which men try to manage without gods help or leave  that is the difference between them and a most awful difference it is  men fancy that they can get on well enough without god that the ways of the world are very reasonable and useful and profitable and quite good enough to live by if not to die by  but all the while god is king let them fancy what they like and this earth and everything on it from the king on his throne to the gnat in the sunbeam is under his government and must obey his laws or die  we are in gods kingdom my good friends every one of us whether we like it or not and we shall be there for ever and ever and our business is therefore simply to find out what are the laws of that kingdom and obey those laws as speedily as possible and live for ever thereby lest if we break them and get in their way they should grind us to powder  now here is one of the laws of gods kingdom  whosoever exalteth himself shall be abased and whosoever abaseth himself shall be exalted  that is whosoever in any way whatsoever sets himself up will be pulled down again  while he who is contented to keep low and think little of himself will be raised up and set on high now the worlds rule is the exact opposite of this  the world says every man for himself  the way of the world is to struggle and strive for the highest place to be a pushing man and a rising man and a man who will stand stiffly by his rights and give his enemy as good as he brings and beat his neighbour out of the market and show off himself to the best advantage and try to make the most of whatever wit or money he has to look well in the world that people may look up to him and flatter him and obey him and so the world has no objection to peoples pretending to be better than they are every man must do the best he can for himself the world says and never mind his neighbours  they must take care of themselves and if they are foolish enough to be taken in so much the worse for them so the world thinks that there is no harm in a man when he has anything to sell making it out better than it really is and hiding the fault in it as far as he can  when a tradesman or manufacturer sends about puffs of his goods and pretends that they are better and cheaper than other peoples just to get custom by it the world does not call that what it isboasting and lying  it says  of course a man must do the best he can for himself  if a man does not praise himself nobody else will praise him he cannot expect his neighbours to take him for better than his own words  so again if a man wants a place or situation the world thinks it no harm if he gives the most showy character of himself and gets his friends to say all the good of him they can and a great deal more and to say none of the harmin short to make himself out a much better or shrewder or worthier man than he really is  the world does not call that either what it isboasting and lying and thrusting oneself into callings to which god has not called us  the world says  of course a man must turn his best side outwards  you cannot expect a man to tell tales on himself  and my friends the world would be quite right and reasonable and prudent in telling us to push and boast and lie and puff ourselves and our goods if it were not for one thing which the foolish blind world is always forgetting and that is that there is a god who judges the earth  if god were not our king if he took no care of us men and our doings if mankind had it all their own way on earth and were forced to shift for themselves without any laws of god to guide them then the best thing every man could do would be to fight for himself to get all he could for himself and leave as little as he could for his neighbours to make himself out as great and wise and strong as he could and try to make his neighbours buy him at his own price  that would be the best plan for every man if god was not king and therefore the world says that that is the best plan for every man because the world does not believe that god is king and hates the notion that god is king and laughs at and persecutes as jesus christ said it would those who preach the kingdom of god and tell men as i tell you in gods name  you were not made to be selfish you were not meant to rise in the world by boasting and pushing down and deceiving your neighbours  for you are subjects of gods kingdom and to do so is to break his laws and to put yourselves under his curse and however worldlywise all this selfishness and boasting may seem it is sin whose wages are death and ruin  for my friends let the world try to forget god as it will he does not forget the world  let men try to make rules and laws for themselves rules about religion rules about government rules about trade rules about morals and what they fancy is just and fair let them make as many rules as they like they are only wasting their time for god has made his rules already and revealed them to us in the bible and told us that the earth and mankind are governed in his way and not in ours and that he will not alter his everlasting rules to suit our new ones  as david says  let the people be never so unquiet still the lord is king  ah my friends it is very easy to say all this but it is not so easy to believe it  every one every respectable person at least is ready enough to talk about god and gods will and so forth  but when it comes to practice when it comes to doing gods will and not our own when it comes to obeying his direct and plain commands and not the fashions and maxims which men have invented for themselves when it comes to giving up what we long for because he has said that if we try after it in our own way and not in his we shall never have it at all then comes the trial then comes the time to see whether we believe that god is the king of the earth or not then comes the time to see whether we have renounced the world and determined to live as gods sons in gods kingdom or whether our religion is some form of words or way of thinking and feeling which we hope may save our souls from hell but which has nothing to do with our daily life and conduct and leaves us just as worldly as any heathen in all our dealings with our fellowmen from monday morning to saturday night  then comes the time to try our faith in god  and then alas it comes out in these evil and godless and hypocritical times in which we live that many a man who fancies himself religious and respectable and blameless and what not no more really believes that he is living in gods kingdom than the heathen do  and if you ask him you will find out most probably that he fancies that gods kingdom is not on earth now but that it will be on earth some day  a cunning delusion of the devil that my friends  to make us go his way while we fancy that we are going our own way  to make us say to ourselves  ah it is very unfortunate that god is not king of the earth now  of course he will be after the resurrection in the new heaven and the new earth where there will be no sin  but he is not king now this world is given over to sin and the devil so fallen and ruined and corrupt thatthatthat in short we cannot be expected to behave like gods children in it but must just follow the ways of the world and live by ambition and selfishness and cunning and boasting and competing in this life a life of love and justice and humbleness and fellowhelp and mercy and selfsacrifice is impossible in such a world as this we cannot live like angels till we get to heaven  so say nine people out of ten the devil deceiving them and their own hearts alas being but too glad to catch at the excuse for sin which the devil gives them when he tells them that this present earth is not gods kingdom and so they go and act accordingly selfish grudging pushing boastful every mans hand against his neighbour and for himself till they succeed too often in making this earth as fearfully like the devils kingdom as it is possible for gods kingdom to be made  but what some may ask has all this to do with the text that he who sets himself up shall be brought low he who keeps himself low shall be set up  what has it to do with the text  it has everything to do with the text  if people really believed that they were gods subjects and children in gods kingdom they would not need to ask that question long  if god is really the king of the earth there can be no use in anyone setting up himself  if god is really the king of the earth those who set up themselves must be certain to be brought down from their high thoughts and high assumptions sooner or later  for if god is really the king of the earth he must be the one to set people up and not they themselves  look again at the parable  the man who asks the guests to dine with him has surely a right to place each of them where he likes  the house is his the dinner is his  he has a right to invite whom he likes and he has a right to settle where they shall sit  if they choose their own placesif any guest takes upon himself to seat himself at the head of the table because he thinks it his right he offends against all rules of right feeling and propriety toward the man who has invited him  all he has a right to expect is that his host will not put him in the wrong place that he will settle all places at his table according to peoples real rank and deserts and as our testaments say put the worthiest man in the highest room  and if people really believed in god which very few do they would surely expect no less of god  what gentleman farmer or labourer is there with common sense and good feeling who would not show most respect to the most respectable persons who came into his house and send his best and trustiest workmen about his most important errands  true he might make mistakes and worse  being a weak man he might be tempted to put the rich sinner in a higher place than the poor saint  or he might from private fancy be blinded about his workmens characters and so send a worse man because he was his favourite to do what another man whom he did not fancy as well might do a great deal better  but you cannot suspect god of that  he is no respecter of persons whether a man be rich or poor no matter to god  all which he inquires into isis he righteous or unrighteous wise or foolish able to do his work or unable  and god can make no mistakes about peoples characters  as st paul says of the lord jesus  the word of god is sharper than a twoedged sword piercing through to the dividing of the very joints and marrow so that all things are naked and open in the sight of him with whom we have to do  there is no blinding god no hiding from god no cheating god just as there is no flattering god  he knows what each and every one of us is fit for  he knows what each and every one of us is worth and what is more he knows what we ought to know that each and every one of us is worth nothing without him  therefore there is no use pretending to be better than we are  god knows just how good we are and will reward us even in this life only according as we deserve in spite of all our boasting  there is no use pretending to be wiser than we are  for all the wisdom we have comes from god and if we pretend to have more than we have and by that greatest act of folly show that we have no wisdom at all he will take from us even what we have and make all our cunning plans come to nothing and prove us fools just when we fancy ourselves most clever  there is no use being ambitious and pushing and trying to scramble up on our neighbours shoulders for we were not sent into this world to do what we like but what god likes not to work for ourselves but to work for god and god knows exactly how much good each of us can do and what is the best place for us to do it in and how to teach and enable us to do it and if we choose to be taught he will teach us and if we choose to go his way and do his work he will help us to it  but if we will not have his way he will not let us have our own waynot at first at least he will bring our plans to nothing and let us make fools of ourselves and bring in sudden accidents of which we never dreamed just to show us that we are not our own masters and cannot cut out our own roads through life  and if we take his lesson and go to him to teach and strengthen uswell  and if notthen perhapswhich is the most awful misery which can happen to any man in earthgod may give up teaching us during this life and let us have our own way and be filled with the fruit of our own devices from which worst of punishments may he in his mercy save you and me and all belonging to us in this life and in the life to come  but some of you may say  we understand the first half of the text very well and like it very well we all think it just that those who set themselves up should have a fall and we are very glad to see them have a fall  but we do not see why he who abases himself should have any right to be exalted  ah my friends it is much easier and needs much less knowledge of god and much less of the likeness of christ to see what is wrong than to see what is right  every man knows when a bone is broken but it is not every one who can set it again  nevertheless there is a sort of lefthanded reason in that argument  for a man has no more right to make himself out worse than he is than he has to make himself out better than he is  a man should confess to being just what he is neither more nor less nevertheless he who humbles himself shall be exalted  of course i do not mean those who like some i know make a fawning humble way of talking a cloak for their own selfconceit who call themselves miserable sinners all the time that they are fancying that they are almost the only people in the world who are sure of being saved whatever they do who as some do actually pride themselves on their own convictions of sin and glory in their own shame and despise those who will not slander themselves as they do  they are equally hateful to god and to gods enemies  if you and i are disgusted at such hypocritical selfconceit be sure the lord jesus is far more pained at it than we are for as a wise man says the devils darling sin is the pride that apes humility  but let a man really be convinced of sin let a man really believe in the lord jesus christs atonement let a man really believe in the holy spirit and that man will have little need to ask why he should humble himself more than he deserves and little wish to boast of himself and push himself forward and get praise or riches or power in the world  for that man would say to himself  i sinner as i am i who know that i do so many wrong things daily things so wrong that it required the blood of the son of god to wash out the guilt of themwho am i to set myself up  i cannot be faithful in a littlewhy should i try to be ruler over much  i cannot use properly the blessings and the power which god does give memust i not take for granted that if i had more riches more power i should use them still worse  i know well enough of a thousand sins and weaknesses and ignorances in myself which my neighbours never see  i believe therefore my neighbours have much too good an opinion of me and not too bad a one and therefore i am not going to boast or puff myself to them  i can only thank god they do not see the inside of this foolish heart of mine as well as he does  in short i am not going to set myself up and try to get a higher place among men than i have already because i am certain that i have already a ten times better one than i deserve  or again if a man really believed in the holy ghost which is much the same as really believing in the kingdom of god if he really believed that god was the king and master of his heart and soul if he really believed that everything good and right and wise in him came from gods holy spirit and that everything wrong and foolish in him came from himself and the devil then he would surely say to himself  who am i to try to set myself up above my neighbours and get power over them what have i that i did not receive  whatever money or station or cleverness or power of mind i have god has given me and without him i should be nothing  therefore he only gave me these talents to use for him and if i use them for my own ends i shall be misusing them and trying to rob god of his own  i am his child his subject his steward he has put me just in that place in his earth which is most fit for me and my business is not to try to desert my post and to wander out of the place here he has put me but to see that i do the duty which lies nearest me so that i shall be able to give an account to him  it is only if i am faithful in a few things that i can expect god to make me ruler over many things  ah my friends if we could but see ourselves not as we fancy we are nor as others fancy we are but just as we really are then instead of pushing and boasting and standing stiffly by our rights and fancying that god and man are unjust to us we should be crying out all day long with the prodigal son  father i have sinned against heaven and before thee and am no more worthy to be called thy son  we should say with st paulwho after all remember was the wisest and most learned and noblesthearted of all the apostlesthat we are at best the chief of sinners  we should feel like the dear and blessed magdalene of old the pattern for ever of all true penitents that it was quite honour enough to be allowed to wash christs feet with our tears while every one round us sneered at us and looked down upon usas after all we deserve and so believe me we should be exalted  it would pay us if payment is what we want  for so we should be in a more right more true more healthy more wise more powerful state of mind more like jesus christ and therefore more likely to be sent to do christs work and share christs reward  for this is the great law of the kingdom of god in which we live that man is nothing and god is everything and that we are strong and wise and something only when we find out that we are weak and foolish and nothing and go to our father in heaven for strength and wisdom and spiritual eternal life  and then we find out how true it is that he who humbles himself as he deserves will be raised up how he who loses his life will save it how blessed are the poor in spirit those who feel that they have nothing but what god chooses to give them for theirs is the kingdom of heaven  how blessed are those who hunger and thirst after righteousness who feel that they are not doing right and yet cannot rest till they do right for they shall be filled  how blessed are the meek who do not set up themselves or try to fight their own battles and compete with their neighbours in the great scramble and struggle of this world for theyjust the last persons whom the world would expect to do itshall inherit the earth choose my friends choose  the world says  push upwards praise yourself help yourself put your best side outwards  the great god who made heaven and earth says  know that you are weak and foolish and sinful in yourself  know that whatever wisdom you have i the lord lent you and i the lord expect the interest of my loan know that you are my child in my kingdom  stay where i have put you and when i want you for something better i will call you and if you try to rise without my calling you i will only drive you back again so the only way to be ruler over much is first to be faithful in a little  my friends which of the two do you think is likely to know best man or god    footnotes  217  in 184849
