washington in the west lost on the orinoco two young lumbermen american boys life of william mckinley old glory series ship and shore series etc  illustrated by a b shute     preface   on the trail of pontiac is a complete story in itself but forms the fourth volume of a line known by the general title of colonial series  the first volume entitled with washington in the west related the adventures of dave morris a young pioneer of wills creek now cumberland va dave became acquainted with george washington at the time the latter was a surveyor and served under the youthful officer during the fateful braddock expedition against fort duquesne  the braddock defeat left the frontier at the mercy of the french and the indians and in the second volume of the series called marching on niagara are given the particulars of general forbes campaign against fort duquesne and the advance of generals prideaux and johnson against fort niagara in which not only dave morris but likewise his cousin henry do their duty well as young soldiers  the signal victory at niagara gave to the english control of all that vast territory lying between the great lakes and what was called the louisiana territory but war with france was not yet at an end and in the third volume of the series entitled at the fall of montreal i have related the particulars of the last campaign against the french including general wolfes memorable scaling of the heights of quebec the battle on the plains of abraham and lastly the fall of montreal itself which brought this longdrawn war to a conclusion and was the means of placing canada where it remains today in the hands of england  with the conclusion of the war with france the settlers in america imagined that they would be able to go back unmolested to their homesteads on the frontier but such was not to be the indians who had assisted france during the war were enraged to see the english occupying what they considered their own personal hunting grounds and aroused by the cunning and eloquence of the great chief pontiac and other leaders they concocted more than one plot to fall upon the settlements and the forts of the frontier and massacre all who opposed them the beginning of this fearful uprising of the red men is given in the pages which follow  as in my previous books i have tried to be as accurate historically as possible the best american english and french authorities have been consulted i trust that all who read the present volume may find it both entertaining and instructive  edward stratemeyer  july 1 1904     contents

illustrations  the dance of the magicians lasted fully a quarter of an hour frontispiece  the report was followed by a mad yelp of pain  henry  rolled over and over down a long hill  let go cried dave let go i say  where are your furs asked james morris  he let the animal have a bullet directly in the head  tis one of the english said the taller of the indians  the white young man is sorry to be a prisoner he said slowly     chapter i  a glimpse at the past   two wild turkeys and seven rabbits not such a bad haul after all henry  that is true dave but somehow i wanted to get a deer if i could  oh i reckon almost any hunter would like to bring down a deer went on dave morris but they are not so plentiful as they were before the war  that is true henry morris placed the last rabbit he had brought down in his gamebag i can remember the time when the deer would come up to within a hundred yards of the house but you have got to take a long tramp to find one now  and yet game ought to be plentiful went on his younger cousin there wasnt much hunting in this vicinity during the war nearly everybody who could go to the front went  there were plenty who couldnt be hired to go you know that as well as i do some were afraid they wouldnt get their pay and others were afraid the french or the indians would knock em over henry morris took a deep breath beats me how they could stay homewith the enemy doing their best to wipe us out  i cant understand it either but now the war is over do you think well have any more trouble with the indians continued dave morris as he and his cousin started forward through the deep snow that lay in the woods which had been their hunting ground for the best part of the day  its really hard to tell dave father thinks well have no more trouble but sam barringford says we wont have real peace until the redskins have had one whipping they wont forget as long as they live  well sam knows the indians pretty thoroughly   no one knows them better and why shouldnt he know em hes been among them since he was a small boy and he must be fifty now if hes a day  i can tell you one thing henry continued dave warmly i was mighty glad to see sam recover from that wound he received at quebec at first i thought he would either die or be crazy for the rest of his life  its his iron constitution that pulled him through many another soldier would have caved in clean and clear but hurry up if you want to get home before dark and so speaking henry morris set off through the woods at a faster pace than ever with his cousin close at his heels each carried his gamebag on his back and a flintlock musket over his shoulder  the time was early in the year 1761 but a few months after the fall of montreal had brought the war between france and england in america to a close canada was now in the possession of the british and the settlers in our colonies along the great atlantic seacoast and on the frontier westward were looking for a long spell of peace in which they might regain that which had been lost or establish themselves in new localities which promised well  as already mentioned dave and henry morris were cousins henry being the older by several years they lived in the little settlement of wills creek virginia close to where the town of cumberland stands today the morris household consisted of daves father mr james morris who was a widower and mr joseph morris his wife lucy and their children rodney several years older than henry who came next and nell a girl of about six who was the household pet in years gone by rodney had been a good deal of a cripple but a surgical operation had done wonders for him and now he was almost as strong as any of the others  james morris was a natural born trapper and fur trader and when his wife died he left his son dave in the care of his brother joseph and wandered to the west where he established a tradingpost on the kinotah a small stream flowing into the ohio river this was at the time that george washington the future president of our country was a young surveyor and in the first volume of this series entitled with washington in the west i related how dave fell in with washington and became his assistant and how later on dave became a soldier to march under washington during the disastrous braddock campaign against fort duquesne  general braddocks failure to bring the french to submission cost james morris dearly his tradingpost was attacked and he barely escaped with his life dave likewise became a prisoner of the enemy and it was only through the efforts of a friendly indian named white buffalo and an old frontier acquaintance named sam barringford that the pair escaped to a place of safety  war between france and england had then become a certainty france was aided greatly by the indians and it was felt by the colonists that a strong blow must be struck and without delay expeditions against the french were organized and in the second volume of the series called marching on niagara are given the particulars of another campaign against fort duquesne located where the city of pittsburg penn now stands and then of the long and hard campaign against fort niagara dave and henry were both in the contest for they had joined the ranks of the royal americans as the colonial troops were called  with the fall of fort niagara the english came once again into possession of all the territory lying between the great lakes and the lower mississippi but canada was not yet taken and there followed more campaigns which have been described in the third volume of the series called at the fall of montreal in these campaigns both dave and henry fought well and with them was sam barringford who had promised the parents that he would keep an eye on the youths henry had been taken prisoner and barringford had been shot but in the end all had been reunited and as soon as the old frontiersman was well enough to do so the three had left the army and gone back to the homestead at wills creek  it had been a great family reunion and neighbors from miles around had come in to hear what the young soldiers and their sturdy old friend might have to tell because of the ending of the terrible war there was general rejoicing everywhere  i never wish to see the like of it again mrs morris had said not once but many times think of those who have been slain and who are wounded  you are right lucy her husband had returned there is nothing worse than war unless it be a pestilence i too want nothing but peace hereafter  and i agree most heartily had come from james morris one cannot till the soil nor hunt unless we are at peace with both the french and the indians  be thankful that jean bevoir has been removed from your path had come from his brother  and from our path too joseph mrs morris had put in quickly  jean bevoir had been a rascally french trader who owned a tradingpost but a few miles from that established by james morris on the kinotah bevoir had claimed the morris post for his own and had aided the indians in an attack which had all but ruined the buildings later on the frenchman had helped in the abduction of little nell but the girl had been rescued by dave and her brother henry then jean bevoir drifted to montreal and while trying to loot some houses there during the siege was shot down in a skirmish between the looters on one side and the french and the english soldiers on the other the morrises firmly believed that jean bevoir was dead but such was not a fact a wound thought to be fatal had taken a turn for the better and the fellow was now lying in a french farmhouse on the st lawrence where two or three of his old companions in crime were doing their best to nurse him back to health and strength jean bevoir had not forgotten the morrises nor what they had done to drag him down as he expressed it and although the war was at an end he was determined to make dave henry and the others pay dearly for the ruin they had brought to his plans in the past  i shall show them that though france is beaten jean bevoir still lives he told himself boastingly the tradingpost on the kinotah with its beautiful lands shall still be minethe morrises shall never possess it sometimes he spoke to his companions of these things but they merely smiled at him thinking that what he had in mind to do would prove impossible of accomplishment     chapter ii  the cabin in the clearing   it was already four oclock and the short winter day was drawing to a close on every side of the two young hunters arose the almost trackless woods with here and there a small opening where the wind had swept the rocks clear of snow not a sound broke the stillness  were we ever in this neighborhood before questioned dave after a silence of several minutes  yes i was up here three or four years ago answered his cousin who as my old readers know was a naturalborn hunter and woodsman got a deer right over yonder and he pointed with his hand the one i hit plumb in the left eye  oh yes i remember that came from dave it was a prime shot wish i could do as well sometime  you neednt complain dave youve done better than lots of men around here some of em cant shoot anything at all they are farmers and nothing else  well well all have to turn farmers sooner or laterafter the best of the game is killed off  has your father said anything about going out to his tradingpost on the kinotah again  nothing more than what you heard him say on new years daythat he would go as soon as the weather got warm enough and it was considered safe  i wish i could go out with you i really believe i could make some money bringing in peltsmore money than i can make by staying here  perhaps you could henry and oh i wish you could go went on dave impulsively wouldnt we have the best times though  the trouble is father wants me on the farm there is so much to do you see while the war was on everything went to pieces  but rodney can help now he told me only yesterday that he felt strong enough to do almost anything  yes ive thought of that if he can take hold perhaps i can get father to consent did you say sam barringford was going  to be sure and so is white buffalo i suppose father will take not less than a dozen hunters and trappers with him and six or eight indians too he says he doesnt want to depend altogether on strangers when he gets out there and he hardly knows what has become of the most of those who were with him before  more than half of the crowd are dead shot down either in the trouble with the redskins or in the war  ive been wondering if there is anything left of the tradingpost father has half a notion that the indians burnt it to the ground and burnt the forest around it too if they have done that he wont want to build again on the burnover but at some new spot where the forest hasnt been touched and timber is easy to get  do you suppose they burnt the post jean bevoir had  i reckon not the indians were very friendly with that rascal  the youths had now come to the edge of the woods here was a welldefined trail running from wills creek to a hamlet knows as shadds run named after an old englishman who had settled there six years previous shadd and his family had been massacred by the indians at the time of braddocks defeat and all that was left of his commodious log cabin was a heap of halfburnt logs  turning into the trail the young hunters continued on their way to the morris homestead this itself was a new building for the first cabin had also gone up in flames during the terrible uprising on either side of the road were patches of woods with here and there a cleared field soon they came in sight of a log cabin  hullo neighbor thompson sang out henry and in a moment a man appeared at the door of the house musket in hand  so youve got back said the man and lowered his weapon what luck  two wild turkeys and seven rabbits answered henry he reached into his gamebag here are the two rabbits i promised you for the powder and he handed over the game  thank you henry theyll make a fine potpie didnt see any deer  no  thought not will you come in and warm up  im not cold  nor am i put in dave  paul thompson had been followed to the doorway by his wife sarah and the pair asked the two young hunters how matters were faring at home  we feel lonely here said mrs thompson in philadelphia we had so much company  you must come over to our house more answered henry mother i know will be glad to see you  the thompsons had come to that neighborhood the summer before taking up a claim of land left by a near relative who had died both were young and the husband had thought to improve his condition by turning farmer rather than by remaining a clerk in one of the philadelphia shops but the loneliness of the life was something neither had counted on and both were glad enough to talk to a neighbor at every available opportunity  i am coming over in a week or two to stay three days if your folks will keep me said mrs thompson paul is going over to dennetts mills on business  youll be welcome said henry and after a little more talk the young hunters went on their way  im anxious to see what sort of a farmer thompson will make said dave as he strode along i dont believe he knows a thing about tilling the soil hes as green as we should be behind the counter of a shop  hell have to learn the same as anybody else  at last the youths came in sight of home it was now dark and through the livingroom window they saw the gleam of a tallow candle which rested on the table  a shout from dave brought his father to the doorway back again eh exclaimed james morris and tired as two dogs after the chase ill warrant  we are tired answered the son but i reckon we could walk a few miles more if we had to  i see you didnt get a deer this time came from rodney morris as he too appeared at the doorway  mercy on us you cant expect them to get a deer every trip ejaculated mrs morris who was bustling around the big open fireplace preparing supper its a wonder they start up anything at all around here with all the hunting thats going on  we got two wild turkeys and seven rabbits said henry we left two rabbits at the thompsons and by the way mrs thompson is coming over in a week or two to stay three days paul is going to dennetts on business  ill be glad to have her here was the mothers reply poor dear i know just how lonely she feels of course you said it would be all right  yes i said shed be welcome  im so glad came from little nell as she brushed back the curls that were flying around her face mrs thompson is so nice she can tell the cutest stories  a storyteller always makes a friend of nell laughed her father even white buffalo can charm her with what he has to say when it comes to stories  white buffalo is a nice indian answered the little miss promptly the next time he comes here he said he would make me a big big wooden doll with joints that would move and glass beads for eyes  you wont fail to keep him busy if he lets you came from dave as he kicked the snow from his feet and came into the cabin he threw his game on a bench and hung up his bag musket outer coat and his hat something smells good in here he declared  youve walked yourselves into an appetite said rodney he picked up the wild turkeys good big fellows arent they youve earned your supper  the game was placed in a cold pantry to be cleaned and dressed on the morrow and then the inmates of the cabin gathered around the table to enjoy what mrs morris had to offer  it was a scene common in those days the livingroom floor was bare and so was the long table but both were scrubbed to a whiteness and cleanliness that could not be excelled on either side of the table were rude but substantial benches and at the ends were chairs which had been in use for several generations in a corner of the room stood mrs morriss spinningwheel and behind this was a shelf containing the family bible half a dozen books and a pile of newspapers which had been carefully preserved from time to time including copies of the pennsylvania gazette edited by benjamin franklin and also of the latters publications known as poor richards almanack full of quaint sayings and maxims over the shelf were some deers antlers and on these rested two muskets with the powder horns and bullet pouches hanging beneath behind the door stood another musket loaded and ready for use should an enemy or a wild beast put in an unexpected appearance  with no tablecloth one could scarcely look for napkins but a towel hung handy upon which one might wipe his fingers after handling a bone the dishes were far from plentiful and mostly of a sort to stand rough usage coffee and milk were drunk from bowls with narrow bottoms and wide tops and sometimes these bowls served also for corn mush and similar dishes forks had been introduced and also regular eating knives but old hunters and trappers like james morris and sam barringford preferred to use their hunting knives with which to cut their food and barringford considered a fork rather superfluous and dandified  when all were assembled joseph morris said grace and then mrs morris brought in what she had to offersome fried bacon a pot of baked beans apple sauce made from several strings of dried apples brought from the loft of the cabin and fresh bread just from the hot stones of the fireplace all fell to without delay and while eating dave and henry told the particulars of the hunt just ended it was not an elaborate meal but it was much better than many of their neighbors could afford and the morrises were well content  i think you were wise to go out today said james morris after the young hunters had told their story there is another storm in the air and it wont be long in settling down  it is going to be a long hard winter father answered dave  what makes you say that  henry said so he found a squirrels nest just loaded with nuts  certainly a pretty good sign for the squirrels know just about how long they have got to keep themselves in food before spring comes  i hope it stays clear for a day longer put in joseph morris i am looking for sam barringford he went to bedford for me and if it should snow traveling for him will be bad  sam wont mind a little snowstorm came from henry he has been out in the heaviest kind of a storm more than once  after the evening meal the whole family gathered around the open fireplace and an extra log was piled on the blaze as nobody seemed to want to read the tallow candle was extinguished and saved for another occasion for candles were by no means as plentiful as some of my youthful readers may imagine they were all of home manufacture and the making of them was no easy task     chapter iii  barringfords strange discovery   the new cabin of the morrises built after the burning of the old was somewhat similar in shape to that which had been reduced to ashes there was the same small bedroom at the north end which as before had been turned over to dave and henry but this room boasted of two windows instead of one each fitted with a heavy wooden shutter to be closed in winter or during an attack by the indians  the old fourpost bedstead of walnut and hickory with its cords of rawhide was gone and in its stead the morrises had built a wide bunk against the inner wall of the apartment with a mattress of straw and a pillow of the same material for feathers were just then impossible to obtain under the window was a wide bench made of a half log commonly called a puncheon bench and the flooring was likewise of puncheons that is split logs with the flat side smoothed down into the walls were driven pegs of wood upon which the youths could hang their garments  the room was cold almost icy and it did not take dave and henry long to get into bed after they had made up their minds to retire having said their prayers they huddled close together for warmth covering themselves with blankets and a fur robe james morris had brought from his tradingpost  the wind had been gradually rising and by midnight it was blowing half a gale whistling shrilly around the cabin and through the heavy boughs of the neighboring trees the doors and shutters rattled and awakened mrs morris but the boys and men slept well for the sounds were familiar ones  in the early morning came a change the wind went down and there was a heavy fall of snow which kept up steadily for many hours by the time dave and henry arose the snow was several inches deep on the doorstep where it had previously been swept clean  traveling for sam barringford will certainly be bad remarked rodney who was already at work blowing up the fire for his mother if this keeps on it will be a couple of feet deep by nightfall  as there was but little to do that morning dave and henry took their time in dressing after breakfast they set about cleaning the wild turkeys and the rabbits the feathers of the turkeys were saved and also the rabbits skins for all would come in useful sooner or later around the cabin home  the wind is rising once more remarked joseph morris in the middle of the afternoon after a trip to the cattle shed to see that the stock were safe it is blowing the snow in all directions  the boys had been out trying to clean a path to the spring but found their labors unavailing so they filled a cask which stood in the pantry with water that they might not fall short of this necessary commodity should they become completely snowed in  nightfall was at hand and the wind was whistling more fiercely than ever when henry chanced to go to the door to see if the snow was covering the cattle shed  as he looked out he heard a faint cry he listened intently and soon the cry was repeated  somebody is calling for help he exclaimed to the others  where asked joseph morris quickly and reached for his hat and greatcoat  i think the call came from yonder answered the son pointing in the direction  was it sam barringfords voice  i couldnt make out  perhaps some traveler has lost his way put in rodney  we can go out and see said joseph morris he went to the doorway this way he shouted this way  help came back faintly help  were coming  joseph morris was soon out of the house and james morris followed him without delay mrs morris lit the lantern and hung it outside of the doorway that they might see their way back and also placed a candle in the window the fire was stirred up so that the one in trouble might be warmed up and given something hot to drink  with the snow swirling in all directions around them it was no easy matter for joseph morris and his brother to move forward to the spot from whence the cry for help had proceeded in spots the snow lay three and four feet deep and to pass through some of the drifts was out of the question  sam is it you called out james morris presently  yes was the feeble answer  where are you  here by the old split hickory jest about lost my wind too  well soon be with you answered james morris  there was a row of brushwood to the south of the split hickory tree and in the shelter of this the morrises moved forward as rapidly as possible the keen wind cut like a knife and they knew that it was this which had exhausted the old frontiersman they were trying to succor  almost blinded and nearly out of wind themselves they at last reached the split tree to find sam barringford crouched behind a mass of the snowladen branches he had a large pack on his back and also a bundle in his arms  sam barringford was a backwoodsman of a type that has long since vanished from our midst he was between fifty and sixty years of age tall thin and as straight as an arrow he wore his hair and his beard long and his heavy eyebrows sheltered a pair of small black eyes that were as penetrating as those of any wild beast he was a skilled marksman and at following a trail had an instinct almost equal to that of the red men with whom he had so often come in contact he was dressed in a long hunting shirt and furs and wore a coonskin cap with the tail of the animal hanging over his shoulder  winded eh remarked joseph morris laconically  why didnt you throw down your packs and leave em  couldnt leave this ere pack nohow returned barringford nodding at the bundle in his arms  why not nobody is going to steal it tonight i reckon  taint that joe the bundles alive  what  babiestwo on em too  i vow put in james morris babies give them to me and ill carry em to the house joe you give sam a lift if he needs it  james morris took the precious bundle while his brother relieved the old frontiersman of the pack on his back and took the latters arm the return to the cabin was made without delay james morris getting there some minutes before joseph managed to arrive with barringford clinging to his arm  sam has brought a couple of babies lucy said james morris as he rushed up to the fireside and proceeded to open the bundle in his arms  i do declare gasped mrs morris babies where did he get them  i dont know butoh  the bundle had burst open and there to the astonished gaze of all gathered around were presented to view two little fat and chubby boy babies each about a year of age  oh the dear little things cried mrs morris snatching up one of them and hugging it to her breast are you alive  for answer the baby boy set up a faint cry and this was immediately answered by a similar cry from the other baby then arose a grand chorus which left no doubt of the facts that the babies were alive and that each possessed a good pair of lungs and full knowledge of how to use them  warm them up james while i get them some pap said mrs morris  oh the nice little babies put in little nell crowding close to touch the soft and somewhat cold cheeks and such pretty eyes too and such soft hair mamma i think they are just too beautiful for anything  while mrs morris was preparing some pap and some warm milk joseph morris arrived with sam barringford and proceeded to make the old frontiersman comfortable the water was already boiling in the big iron pot and barringford was given a glass of hot liquor which soon made him feel like himself once more later still he was served with a hearty meal which he ate as if famished  great babies aint they he said beats all creation how i found em too  so you found them put in rodney where  on the road about three miles from this placeclose to where the chelingworth cabin used to stand  did you find them in the snow queried dave with deep interest  i did an i didnt ye see they was wrapped in the bundle an the bundle was tied up to a tree limb  and left there all alone cried mrs morris who was busy feeding the little ones  it was a case of necessity maam the man who had had the children had done his best by em an he couldnt do no more returned sam barringford gravely  tell us the particulars sam said james morris  i will i was coming along the trail fightin my way as best i could in the teeth of the wind an feelin bitter cold adoin of it when i came to a spot where there had been a fight between a man a horse and some wild beastswolves most likely i couldnt git the straight of it at fust but at last i figured out that the horse had gone into a hole broke his leg and pitched the man out on his head on the rocks the man had had the babies in a bundle and to keep em from gettin too cold had put em in the tree instead of on the ground or else he did it to save the babies from the wild beasts  the wild beasts had done their bloody work well and man an horse had been torn limb from limb the mans skull was crushed and it and part of the horse lay in a nasty hole an thats what makes me think both had the accident the man had emptied his two pistols and used his knife but it wasnt no use the fight was agin him from the start  horrible murmured mrs morris while little nell and some of the others shuddered  i didnt notice the bundle in the tree at fust but while i was takin in the awful sights afore me i heard a strange sound sam barringford thets a wildcat sez i to myself and swung my gun around putty quick but it wasnt no wildcat at all but them babies beginning to set up a howl maybe i wasnt taken back it war the greatest amazement ever overtook me barrin none added the old frontiersman emphatically  was there anybody else around asked james morris  not a soul i looked everywhere an tried to git a shot at some of the wild beasts but they had gone clean an clear then i made up my mind the best to do war to get them babies to some shelter or theyd freeze to deth i didnt know ef other folks around here war to hum so i made for this place when i got to the split hickory i war so tuckered out i set up the yell you heard  did the man have anything with him besides the babies asked rodney  no bundle but he had his pistols the knife a gold watch some gold and silver and some other things which i didnt pick up because of the snow an the wind here are the things i did bring along and sam barringford brought them forth from a bag he had carried and laid them in a pile on the table     chapter iv  searching for clews   the others gathered around and surveyed the articles barringford had brought along with keen interest the money amounted to two pounds and six shillings some in spanish coin but mostly in english the pistols were english weapons but the knife was such as could be bought at any frontier town in the colonies the watch was a large openfaced affair and on the dial was marked richard gardell maker london 1742  hard to tell if he was an englishman or a colonist mused james morris what of his clothing sam  almost torn to ribbons by the wild beasts  well have to go back to the spot as soon as the storm clears away said joseph morris  you didnt find anything with the mans name on it came from dave  nary a thing lad but my search wasnt any too good remember answered barringford  as soon as i saw the babies i started for here with em  each has a locket around its neck came from mrs morris suddenly perhaps they will give some clew  i trust they do answered her husband that man may have been their father or otherwise only a servant sent to take them to some place but be that as it may we must discover where the little ones belong  oh let us keep them burst in little nell i want some little brothers to play with  hush dear came from the mother mayhap the mother of these little ones is this moment mourning for them and wondering where they can be  the lockets were small oval affairs rather hard to open until a thin knife blade was inserted between the two parts of each one contained a miniature of an old lady in court dress and the other a portrait of an elderly gentleman with powdered wig and goldrimmed spectacles the face of each was full of kindness and nobleness  two fine old folks ill warrant came from joseph morris  more than likely the grandparents of the little ones returned his brother  the lockets seem new said rodney perhaps they were christening presents or given to the babies on their first birthday  the babies look very much alike and seem of an age said mrs morris who had by this time fed them all they cared to eat i doubt not but that they are twins  just what i was thinking said henry you had better remember which locket belongs to each or you may get em mixed up  mercy on us i never thought of that exclaimed his mother let me seeyes the first locket came from this one and she hastened to replace it  there is a slight difference in their looks said dave after a close survey of the two tiny faces one has a rounder chin than the other and a flatter nose  dave is right answered his aunt but the difference is not very great  will you keep the babies for the present questioned sam barringford i dont know what to do with em im sartin  to be sure we will said mrs morris poor dears if it was their father who was killed it may go hard with them  the matter was talked over during the meal and for two hours afterward but none could reach any conclusion regarding the identity of the little strangers all agreed that the best thing to do would be to look for more clews as soon as the weather permitted  there was a large indian basket in the cabin in which dave and henry usually brought in kindling for the fire this was emptied and cleaned and in it was made a comfortable bed for the babies to sleep on having satisfied their hunger and become thoroughly warm both slept soundly nor did they awaken until early morning  by sunrise the storm was practically over although a few hard particles of snow still whirled down in the high wind joseph morris said they had better wait an hour or two longer for the wind to go down and this was done  can i go along asked dave eagerly im sure i wont mind the walk at all  id like to go too added henry and when the party started it consisted of the two youths their fathers and sam barringford  the men took turns at leading the way and breaking open the trail no mean task when in some spots the snow lay to a depth of four and five feet they kept as much as possible in the shelter of the trees and bushes where the drifts were not so high the sun shining clearly made the scene on all sides a dazzling one not a sound broke the stillness birds and beasts being equally silent  it took over an hour to reach the ruins of the chelingworth cabinone of the first erected in that territory and burnt four times before it was finally abandoned as they passed the ruins sam barringford came to a halt  listen he said briefly  all did so and at a distance heard a sudden yelping which gradually increased  wolves cried henry  you are right answered the old frontiersman reckon they have come back to finish their work  let us drive them off put in dave with a shudder if there is anything left of the man we ought to give him a decent burial  yes lad i agree but there aint much left but bones  all pushed forward and soon reached the spot where sam barringford had made his strange discovery five wolves were close by sniffing eagerly through the snow and more were in the rear  ive my shotgun said dave shall i give em a dose  yes answered barringford and taking aim at two of the foremost wolves the youth pulled the trigger of his weapon the report was followed by a mad yelp of pain and both wolves went down one dead and the other badly wounded the other wolves then ran off with all possible speed  illustration the report was followed by a mad yelp of pain  a fair shot dave cried the old frontiersman and striding forward he dispatched the wounded wolf with his hunting knife doin almost as well as henry now aint ye  not quite as well as that was daves modest answer  the new fall of snow had covered all traces of the tragedy recently enacted at the spot but the morrises had brought along a pair of shovels and a broom and soon the party was at work clearing away the snow as sam barringford directed  the remains of man and horse were at last uncovered and then began an earnest search for some clew which might lead to the identity of the unfortunate person  here is a gold ring said henry presently and held it up  joseph morris took the ring and examined it with care there was an inscription inside but it was so worn he could not decipher it  they also brought to light several pieces of clothing torn to tatters as barringford had said the horses saddle was likewise there and the reins and curb but absolutely nothing which gave either name or address  this looks as if we were stumped said henry pausing in his labor of digging away the snow  right ye are came from barringford too bad id like to know who them twins belong to  reckon theyll belong to you sam said james morris with a faint smile  me well i vum an old man like me all alone in the world with twins whatll i do with em answered me thet will ye and he scratched his head in perplexity  we can keep them for the present answered joseph morris indeed i dont think my wife will care to give them up in a hurry she said this morning the youngsters had taken a tight hold of her heart  ef i had a hum of my own began barringford but no taint righti ought to find out whar they belong  perhaps you can find out all about them at bedford or fort loudan or annapolis or philadelphia put in james morris certain it is they belong somewhere  they had now come to the end of their search and as there seemed nothing more to do prepared to return home the ground was too hard to permit of the burial of the remains of the stranger and they were placed between some rocks with other rocks over them to keep off the wild beasts then joseph morris marked the nearest tree with a large cross and a question marka common sign of those days showing that somebody unknown had met death in that vicinity  when the morris cabin was again reached they found the babies wide awake and cooing contentedly mrs morris had dressed them up as best she could and she was holding one while rodney held the other little nell was dancing around the floor in wild delight  oh i just love those babies so much cried the little miss i want mamma to keep them if nobody comes to take them away  dont want to send them to the poorhouse then questioned her father quizzically  to the poorhouse she repeated scornfully no indeed  what a fate for such darlings murmured mrs morris no joseph hard as times may be i cannot consent to send these little ones away to live on charity even if the authorities were willing to take themwhich i doubt  never fear lucy i do not intend to be hard on the twins and you must remember sam here has a claim on them  oh uncle sam began little nellshe often called him unclewont you please let me keep the babies  the question was so gravely put the old frontiersman had to laugh outright a great question truly he made answer and i dont know if they are mine yet  but if nobody calls for them  barringford scratched his head  in thet case i reckon as how ill have to adopt em dont see nuthin else to do  one thing is certain they shall stay here for the present said mrs morris and that important question settled she turned over the baby she held to dave while she bustled about to prepare a late dinner     chapter v  a lively elk hunt   the storm just passed proved to be the last one for some time to come and in a week the trails leading from wills creek to the eastward became more or less broken the trail to fort bedford was likewise opened and sam barringford made a journey hither and was gone eight days  the others awaited his return with great interest but one look at his face when he arrived convinced all that he had failed in his mission  cant find out anything about them twins he said getting down to what was in their minds without delay the man was seen around fort bedford for two days but he didnt tell his business and nobody that i talked to had seen the babies nor had they seen him atalkin to any wimmen folks  where did he stop overnight  thets something i couldnt find out nuther  he must have been an odd sort observed james morris  perhaps the twins didnt belong to him at all suggested henry if they did why was he ashamed to show em  sam barringford shrugged his shoulders and drew a long breath dont ask me henry its a clar mystery thets wot it is  settling himself before the roaring fire barringford told his story in detail he repeated all that the inhabitants at bedford had told him but this threw no light on the mystery nobody had seen the stranger come into the place and nobody had seen him depart  wonder where he did come from mused dave he certainly must have come from somewhere  after that the winter days passed slowly sam barringford remained at the morris home occasionally going out alone or with some of the others in quest of game he was always glad to have dave and henry with him and they were likewise delighted to go for as my old readers will remember sam barringford was a famous hunter and rarely came back emptyhanded  one day henry who had been out after wild turkeys came back in a state of mild excitement he had seen hoofprints which were strange to him and he wanted barringfords opinion on them  they looked something like a deers he said but were larger  must have been an elk answered the old frontiersman but i allow as how thar aint many of them critters around this deestrict  henry had come back in the evening so that the tracks he had discovered were not inspected by sam barringford until the following morning the pair went out accompanied by dave and all were armed and supplied with provisions enough to last two days if necessary  the way led up a small hill back of the house and then through a patch of scrub timberthe best having been cut away when the new cabin was built beyond the scrub timber was a small cliff of rocks and further still a dense forest leading to the stream upon which the morris boys had had such thrilling adventures in the past  here are the tracks said henry when the edge of the forest was gained and see here is another trail made last night ill be bound  barringford took his time at examining the hoofprints in the snow and at a spot where the sun came down warmly and made the ground slightly soft  reckon i was right he said ef it aint an elk it aint nuthin i ever seed afore  if it is an elk let us try to bring him down by all means cried henry id like a pair of elk horns very much  the trouble is he may be miles an miles away from here by this time answered barringford  never mind let us try it anyway put in dave  all were on snowshoesdave and henry possessing pairs made for them by white buffalo years before and barringford a pair he had traded in at one of the posts giving some fox skins in exchange  im willing lads said the old frontiersman even if we dont git the elk we may stir up something else wuth knocking over  he led the way directly into the forest following the tracks of the game with ease dave came behind him while henry brought up the rear  all was almost absolutely silent occasionally a winter bird circled through the air or a frightened squirrel ran from a tree branch to his hollow and twice they caught a fair view of a bunch of rabbits nibbling at some tender shoots of brushwood the young hunters could have shot the rabbits with ease but now they were after larger game and they knew better than to fire shots which would most likely drive the elk for miles were the beast within hearing distance  how far do you calculate the elk is from here asked dave after a good mile had been covered  thats no easy question to answer dave returned sam barringford he may have gone two miles and he may have gone ten well have to trust to luck to catch up to him i dont calkerlate he went far in this deep snow  another mile was covered and they came to a spot where the snow was kicked up in several directions a roughbarked tree was near by and on this it was plain to see that the elk had rubbed himself vigorously  thet proves he aint gone far said barringford almost in a whisper he stopped to scratch himself an then dropped into a walk go slow now and keep quiet an we may come up to him before you know it  the old frontiersmans advice was followed and they turned along the newlymade trail which now led up to the top of another hill here was a goodsized clearing and barringford motioned for the others to keep back until he could reconnoiter they stepped behind some brushwood and each looked to the priming of his musket and to the flint  presently barringford held up his hand and motioned for them to advance but with caution  reckon ive spotted him but i aint sartin he whispered see thet hollow yonder i think hes back of them bushes an rocks we had better spread out a bit  the others understood and while dave went to the right henry moved to the left leaving barringford to advance as before the hollow mentioned was nearly quarter of a mile away yet so sharp were the old frontiersmans eyes that he had noted a peculiar moving of the upper branches of the brushwood before him as if some large animal was tramping around browsing on such tender shoots as the snow had not covered  if the elk dont go off like a streak henry shall have the first shot barringford had said and it was arranged that all things being favorable dave should shoot next if a second bullet was required barringford would hold himself in readiness for the unexpected  there was a cleared spot to cover and at a signal from the old frontiersman they advanced across this being all of a hundred yards from each other and in something of a semicircle  they made no noise and the elk for such it really was did not notice them until they were within easy gunshot of where he was feeding then up went his head to scent the air and with a snort of sudden fear he started away straight ahead of them  bang it was henrys weapon that spoke up the instant he had the game out of range of the bushes the bullet lodged in the elks flank and he immediately began to limp but he did not drop and now it was daves turn to fire bang went the second weapon and the bullet lodged but a few inches below that sent in by henry on went the wounded creature limping painfully but still making good time especially where the snow on the rocks was partly swept away  come on after him yelled henry reloading with all speed i dont think he can get away  he had scarcely spoken when barringford took aim and let drive strange as it may seem the third bullet struck immediately between the other two the frontiersman had aimed at the other flank but the elk had jumped to one side to avoid a hole just as the hammer of the musket struck the flint  henry was running on as fast as his snowshoes would permit and having reloaded dave and barringford followed they were going downhill once more but now the elk made a turn and darted into a belt of timber lining the river reaching the stream he paused for a moment looked despairingly at his wounded and bleeding flank and then started across the ice  when henry reached the bank of the stream the elk was pulling himself up the steep bank on the other side he now offered a fair shot once more and the youth was not slow to take advantage of it up came the gun his gaze moved along the sights and down came the trigger but alas the flint was an old one and it failed to light the priming up came the hammer with an exclamation of impatience but it was too latethe elk was once more out of sight  why didnt you give him another shot demanded dave as he rushed up  the confounded flint wouldnt strike fire growled henry thats one of a lot i bought in new york when we were coming home and they are no good  ill see if i cant give him another answered his cousin and tumbled rather than climbed down to the river bank barringford came after him and both crossed the stream and mounted the bank opposite here the snow was deep and both went into it headfirst getting a liberal dose down their sleeves and collars  oh columbus but theres no fun in this cried dave as he brushed himself off ugh but that snow down my backbone isnt a bit pleasant  dont waste time hyer cried barringford almost roughly it made him angry to think that his first shot had not laid the elk low if you want to stay behind why  not at all interrupted dave im with you and away he went beside the old frontiersman henry had now adjusted a new flint to his musketlock and was following across the river as speedily as possible  the forest was thick before them and they could hear the elk crashing along in a blind fashion which indicated that he was speedily becoming exhausted once they heard him stop but before they could reach the spot he was off again at a still slower pace  weve got him now said barringford grimly might as well slack up and wait for henry  he knew that henry would be much disappointed if he was not in at the death they slowed up and soon the young hunter came in sight  did the elk get away he demanded  no he is just ahead answered dave dont you hear him  sure enough so you waited for me im glad you did  away they went in a bunch until the elk could be heard less than five rods away then came a silence  he has turned and is going to fight cried barringford and a moment later they came in sight of the elk backed up against a clump of walnuts standing at bay with dilated nostrils and a gaze of mingled alarm and rage in his large round eyes  he is your game henry said barringford and henry took aim promptly at one of those eyes the elk made a rush but he was too late bang went henrys gun the game gave a wild leapand fell dead in his tracks     chapter vi  surrender of fort detroit   a good shot cried dave as all of the party moved forward to inspect the dead elk  couldnt have been better nohow came from sam barringford he looked the game over carefully about as large as ive seen in these parts he added  he has got just the kind of horns ive been wanting to get said henry with pardonable pride but i reckon either of you could have hit him in the eye too he added candidly  it is going to be no easy job getting him home said dave shall we put him on a drag  yes lad an ive a rope we can slip over those horns an all can take hold said barringford we can go as far as possible by the river for that will be easier  barringford carried a sharp hatchet in his belt and with this he cut down a suitable tree branch and fashioned it into such a drag as was desired then the elk was lifted upon it and bound fast and the rope was fastened to the horns  getting through the forest to the river was no mean task but once on the ice progress was rapid and long before nightfall they were within easy walking distance of home  game here is not near as plentiful as it was three or four years ago remarked dave as they pushed on dont you remember how we used to go out henry and bring down all sorts of small animals  some day there wont be anything left put in barringford time was when buffalo were plentiful but now youve got to go a long distance to spot em how this elk got here is a mystery to me i thought they stayed up near the lakes  the heavy winter made him go a long distance for food i reckon answered henry and this was probably the correct explanation  little nell was at the window arranging a row of pegs rodney had made for her in the form of a company of soldiers the largest peg went for the captain and this she called washington while another which would not stand but insisted upon falling over she called general braddock for she had heard the older folks talk over braddocks fearful defeat at fort duquesne and of what washington had done to save what was left of the english troops from annihilation  here they come shouted the little miss and oh such a big deer as they have  an elk as sure as fate ejaculated rodney looking over her shoulder henry will have the horns he wanted now  and we need the meat said james morris as he flung open the door and hurried outside elk is pretty strong i know but it is better than no fresh meat at all and i am tired of rabbit  the party of hunters soon came up and all of the others including mrs morris surveyed the game with interest while they listened to how the elk had been tracked and brought low  certainly worth going many miles for said james morris the pelt is a fine one  the elk was hung up out of the reach of any wild beasts that might be prowling around and the next day henry and sam barringford skinned the animal and cut up the meat as mrs morris desired it the tongue was smoked a small part of the forequarter pickled and the remainder kept fresh by being hung up where it was cold that day they dined on elk steaks and all pronounced the fresh meat very acceptable  late in the afternoon paul thompson came to the cabin on horseback bringing his wife with him  we were coming sooner said the husband but my wife got a sore throat and i thought i had better wait until she was well again  i hope it is all right now replied mrs morris as she escorted her visitors into the cabin  quite well but she mustnt expose herself too much when i go to dennetts i am going to get her a mixture from the doctor  the thompsons were astonished to see the babies and wanted at once to hear all about them  it certainly is a queer mixup said the man later on ill see if i can learn anything about them when i am away somebody ought to be able to place themalthough to be sure a great number of children have become hopelessly lost during the late war  we know that answered mrs morris with a shudder wasnt little nell stolen from us by the indians and then held by that bad french trader jean bevoir  didnt you say bevoir was dead asked paul thompson  he is answered james morris and i must confess i am rather glad of it he caused me a great deal of trouble in one way and another  i have news that fort detroit has surrendered to us went on paul thompson the surrender took place on november the twentyninth  is that so cried dave with deep interest was there any fighting  i dont believe there was but the french commander was very bitter over the surrender and so was pontiac the chief of the ottawas  pontiac repeated henry i dont know that i ever heard of him  i have put in dave somebody told me he was with the indians that attacked general braddock at the opening of the war  yes he was thar came from barringford an i heard tell at thet hospital i was in up to canada thet he was with montcalm when the french fit general wolfe montcalm give him a suit of french officers clothes and the injun was tickled to death over em  the news that fort detroit had surrendered to the english was true immediately after the fall of montreal as already described in detail in this series general amherst ordered major robert rogers of rogers rangers fame to ascend the st lawrence and the great lakes and take possession of detroit michillimackinacnow called mackinawand other french strongholds which had not yet been turned over to the british  the start was made on the twelfth of september 1760 and the force under rogers consisted of two hundred men a mere handful as troops as reckoned today but one which was considered amply large enough to accomplish its purpose the journey was made in a dozen or more whaleboats and fort niagara was reached on the first of octoberabout the time dave henry and barringford received their release from the army and prepared to start for the morris home hundreds of miles away  moving up the niagara river as far as the rapids rogers force carried their boats with their loads around the falls and then embarked for the journey up lake erie stopping at the fort at presqu isle and at several other points  winter was now on in all its fury and a heavy rain made rogers go into camp in the forest bordering the water hardly had this been done when a number of indians put in an appearance and demanded to know where the english soldiers were going  this is french and indian territory said they you can advance no further  rogers tried to explain that the war was now over and that all the land belonged to england but the indians would not listen and said he must wait until they had consulted the great chief pontiac  when pontiac finally came dressed as became a great warrior he listened gravely to what rogers had to say he was much chagrined to learn that the french had capitulated and said that he must have the night in which to think it over when he went away rogers and his soldiers feared treachery but it did not come  the next day pontiac came once more he now said he was willing to let the english advance provided they would do what was right by his followers and treat him as his rank deserved rogers said he would do the best he could and both smoked the pipe of peace  when the mouth of the detroit river was gained word came in that a large body of indians was hiding in the forest bordering the stream waiting to slaughter the whites at once the rangers were on the alert but the threatened attack did not come for pontiac told the indians that it would be useless to fight the english at present that they might rather become friends with them and await the settlement of the war between england and france  captain beletre was in command at fort detroit when the news was first brought to him that the french at montreal had surrendered he refused to believe it  i will fight he cried and did his best to arouse the indians to aid him in defeating the object of rogers mission but when the colonial commander sent him a copy of the terms of the capitulation beletre was forced to submit and did so with the best grace possible soon the fleur de lis of france was lowered and the cross of st george of england floated proudly from the flagstaff  this surrender without bloodshed caused great wonder among the red men and their wonder increased when they saw the french made prisoners with no attempt on the part of the rangers to massacre them they thought that the english must indeed be powerful and were glad that they had taken pontiacs advice and remained for the time being friendly  detroit takenit was at that time but a straggling village with a rude palisadea detachment was sent to the south to occupy fort miami and fort ouatanon places of lesser importance then rogers himself set out up lake huron to take michillimackinac but winter was now on in all its severity and his boats were driven back by the snow and floating ice so that he had to abandon this portion of his task but it may be mentioned here that during the following spring now so close at hand a body of royal americans journeyed to michillimackinac and took possession thus was the surrender of the french in america made complete so far as it embraced the territory which had been in dispute for so many years the english imagined that times of peace and plenty were to follow but they had not reckoned with pontiac or with the thousands of indians who stood ready to dig up the war hatchet at the call of this daring and learned chief     chapter vii  preparing for the expedition westward   the winter had been a severe one but early in march came a rapid change and in a few days the spring thaw began in earnest flooding the banks of the creeks and rivers and causing not a little damage to such buildings as were located close to the waters edge the forest in that vicinity was still heavy so that the freshet was not as severe as it is in these days when there remains but little timber to break the rush of snow and ice and water down the sides of hills and mountains  with the coming of spring james morris began to make his arrangements for visiting his tradingpost on the kinotah in the meantime those at the cabin did their best to learn something concerning the two babies sam barringford had picked up but the efforts in this direction were without success  nothing could be learned of the traveler who had the little children although diligent inquiries were pursued at fort bedford and many other points letters were sent to annapolis and to philadelphia concerning barringfords discovery but brought no satisfaction once a party wrote that the children might belong to his dead brother but this proved to be untrue  its a complete mystery thats what it is declared henry  and it looks to me as if it will never be solved added dave  the children still remained at the morris house and mrs morris gave both the best of care the kind woman felt positive that they were twins and all who saw the children agreed that she was right one was slightly darker than the other in eyes and hair and one chin was rounder than the other but otherwise it was next to impossible to tell them apart  reckon ill have to shoulder em as my own remarked sam barringford one day id do it in a minit if it wasnt thet i havent nary a home to take em to  you may leave them here said mrs morris promptly i have talked it over with joseph and with james and it will be quite suitable  if youll take em in charge ill pay you for it mistress morris said the old frontiersman it will be a weight off my shoulders to have ye do it i know as how the little chaps will get the best o care  and so it was arranged that the twins should remain with mrs morris barringford named them tom and artie after two uncles of his own and these names clung to them as they grew older little did barringford or the morrises dream of what the finding of these twins was to lead to in years to come  of one thing i am certain said james morris one day they are of good breeding no common blood flows in their veins  i take it you are right answered his brother and it may be that some day sam will be well rewarded for saving them from death  after a great deal of deliberation it had been decided that james morris should start for the west about the first of may dave and henry were to go with him and likewise sam barringford and three other frontiersmen named lukins sanderson and jadwin the party was likewise to contain four indians of the delaware tribe under white buffalo the whites were all to go mounted and were to take six packhorses in addition at first james morris thought to take a couple of wagons at least as far as fort pitt but this plan was at the last moment abandoned for wagons were scarce and high in price and there was no telling if they could be sold when the last fort on the frontier was gained and further progress with anything on wheels became out of the question  the coming of white buffalo with his handful of trusted braves was an event for dave and henry this chief had been their friend for many years and they felt that they could rely upon him no matter how great the emergency in the past the tribe to which white buffalo belonged had been split some fighting with the english and others with the french but now some of the leaders including skunk tail were dead and the war being at an end all were reunited under the leadership of white buffalo and a young chief named rain cloud but white buffalo could not forgive some of the men of his tribe for taking up arms against the english and he was glad enough in consequence to get away with his few chosen ones  how how said the indian meaning how do you do as he took first daves hand and then henrys and gave each a tight grip white buffalo is glad to see his young friends looking so well the war has not harmed them  no white buffalo we are as well as ever answered dave and how have you been since last we saw you  white buffalo is not so young as he once was answered the chief his step is not so light and his eye cannot see so far before many winters he will be gathered to his fathers  nonsense put in henry you can shoot as straight as any of us and i know it and walk just as far too who told you that you couldnt  the young braves at white buffalos village they do not care for a chief who is old  they make a big mistake and id tell them so if i had the chance went on henry earnestly you are all right white buffalo and well be very glad to have you along even if your tribe doesnt want you any longer  at this the eyes of the old delaware glistened henry is my true friend he murmured and david is my friend too white buffalo shall never forget them  are the men with you young men questioned dave  no they are almost as old as white buffalo himself  that will suit father he doesnt care for the young braves they always want to do what pleases them and not what is ordered  they are like untrained dogs who follow one trail and then another and hunt out nothing was the old chiefs comment  true to his word he had brought a new doll for little nell made by himself with no other tool than his hunting knife it was of wood with eyes of beads and with joints fastened with deer thongs it was wonderfully painted and on the top of the head was a bit of fur for hair  white buffalo bring the papoose he told of he said producing it from under his blanket lady papoose her name minnehaha  oh what a beautiful beautiful doll screamed little nell as she embraced it and her arms and legs move too and such a nice name minnehaha   what does minnehaha mean asked mrs morris as she too surveyed the precious gift  minnehaha means laughing water answered the indian chief grand lady like queen  she is certainly a grand doll put in rodney nell you must take the best of care of it  i shall answered the little miss and she did  james morris had gone to annapolis accompanied by his brother and at this important seaport purchased such things as were needed for the expedition including some extra weapons powder ball and shot a box of flints some clothing and many other things of more or less usefulness to these were added when wills creek was again reached two casks of salt pork two bags of beans a sack of flour a canister of coffee others of sugar salt pepper and various other articles meant for the table no fresh meat was taken the party depending upon their firearms to supply game and their lines and hooks to furnish fish a small supply of feed was also taken for the horses but this was to be used only when natural fodder could not be found  and all this was for an expedition from cumberland to the ohio river a distance of not much over a hundred miles and which today can be made in the trains inside of three hours with ease but the trail the party was to take was all of two hundred miles in length and fifteen to twenty miles per day was considered good traveling this shows well the progress made in our country in the past one hundred and forty odd years  there were not sufficient accommodations at the morris cabin for all the whites of the party and the frontiersmen who were to go with barringford remained at the fort at cumberland until the start while the indians made themselves at home in the woods once white buffalo was invited to take dinner at the cabin and did so with his usual reserve eating the meal in almost total silence and immediately following with a smoke of peace between himself and james and joseph morris  that indian is one out of a hundred remarked joseph morris to his brother afterward i dont believe in trusting them much but i would trust white buffalo  that is exactly how i feel about it was the answer and why i was so anxious to have him along he has proved himself our friend through thick and thin it is too bad that there are not more of such  perhaps there would be james had the indians been treated fairly from the start but you know as well as i how the traders have cheated them when driving bargains and how some have given them too much rum and then literally robbed them  yes yes i know and it is the one black spot on our colonization there should be a law against it but even that does not warrant the red men in being so savage as they have at times proved themselves  true again but both the english and the french have been almost equally brutal at times look at some of the old frontiersmenthose barringford has often spoken about they liked a slaughter as well as the indians and did not hesitate to scalp the enemy in the same way  yes but they learned that from the redskins in the first place  that is true too but they should not have taken up the custom but instead they should have tried to teach the indians to do better concluded joseph morris and there the unsatisfactory argument rested     chapter viii  on the old braddock road   as old readers of this series will remember there were but two roads or trails leading from the eastward to fort pitt at the junction of the allegheny and monongahela rivers where is today located the great manufacturing city of pittsburg  the southern road was that cut through at the time general braddock made his unsuccessful attack on fort duquesne as the stronghold was then named by the french this ran through great meadows and then northward to fort pitt it started at fort cumberland and passed within short walking distance of where the morris homestead was located  the northern road was that cut through by general forbes during the second campaign against fort duquesne when the french had been driven from that territory by the english troops and royal americans this started from fort bedford about thirty miles north of fort cumberland and ran over the allegheny mountains and across stony creek bushy run and oilier streams it was a considerably shorter route than the other but the trail was in certain spots more difficult  at first james morris had thought to use the upper and shorter route but he was fairly well acquainted with the other and at last decided to stick to that which he knew rather than experiment with the unknown  i know we can get through on general braddocks road he said it may take a few days longer but time is of no immense value to us  you are quite sure the indians on that road are at peace with us asked his brothers wife timidly i do not wish henry to get into more fighting he saw quite enough of that during the war  white buffalo assures me that for the present the war hatchet has been buried everywhere lucy to be sure there is no telling when it will be dug up again but i reckon we can take care of ourselves should trouble come  the starting of the expedition proved quite an event at wills creek and many neighbors living within a radius of two and three miles came to see them off among the number was paul thompson who said he would do what he could for those left behind during the absence of james morris dave and henry  it was a perfect day with a warm breeze blowing up from the potomac river not a cloud ruffled the sky and the spring birds filled the air with their melody  puts me in mind of the time i went out to the tradingpost with you said dave to sam barringford as the two rode along side by side dont you remember what a time we had getting through and how i fell into the river and was afraid of being captured by the indians  yes lad i remember it well answered the old frontiersman but the trail aint half as bad as it was thenbraddocks pioneers smoothed down the rough places putty wellnot but what some of the brushwood has grown up agin  shall we stop again at the indian village of nancoke  the village aint thar no more dave fire in the forest swept it away last year so i heard tell some time ago but i reckon well stop at some redskin village afore we git to the kinotah  the end of the first days traveling found the party miles beyond the last plantation on the road they stopped in the midst of a little clearing where there had once been a house but this the indians had burnt years before and the tall brushwood covered the halfburnt logs and choked up the neighboring spring  the trail is poor observed james morris much poorer than i expected we shall have our own troubles getting through  it is not as good as when barringford and i marched under general braddock answered dave then the pioneer corps cut down every tree and bush that was in our way  and lost so much time our army was defeated put in the old frontiersman grimly braddock meant well but he didnt know how to fight indians  early in the morning the movement forward was resumed there was a small stream to cross and a long hill and then they entered into the depths of a primeval forest where the tops of the trees were a hundred feet and more overhead and the great twisted roots lay sprawling in all directions covered partly with moss and decayed leaves the trail was still visible but the branches of the trees on either side met overhead cutting off the sunlight and making it uncomfortably dark excepting at midday  james morris and sam barringford led the way with the frontiersmen lukins sanderson and jadwin bringing up on either side back of these came the packhorses with their loads looked after by dave and henry and further to the rear were the indians under white buffalo all told the party made quite an imposing appearance and if put to it could have offered considerable opposition to any enemy that might have appeared  the route through the forest soon grew worse the heavy frost of the past winter had upheaved many rocks and they lay scattered in all directions on the side of a hill up which they were climbing sometimes a horse would slip on them and go down and once a pack animal rolled completely over smashing flat what was on his back  there goes our beans cried henry oh what luck  dave gave a look and then regardless of the seriousness of the situation burst into a laugh the beans were rolling in all directions under the rocks and the horses feet it took some time to rescue the fallen animal and gather up the best part of the beans  never mind said barringford philosophically those beans will grow and when you come back this way agin ye can pick em henry  thank you but i shant come back just for a quart or two of beans was the youths answer if the silence was sometimes oppressive during the day it was doubly so at night occasionally some birds would break the stillness or they would hear the croaking of frogs in the marshes or the bark of a distant fox but that was all if any big game was at hand it took good care to keep its distance  the party soon reached the river where dave had had his stirring adventure on horseback as already described in with washington in the west and the youth pointed out to his cousin the spot where he had gone into the rapids  ill never forget that event said he with something like a shudder it was what barringford would call a close call  fortunately there was now a good fording place at hand so the entire party crossed without difficulty on the other shore the trail made a new turn and now began the ascent of a long hill up which the packhorses moved with the pace of snails those in the saddle had often to dismount and lead their steeds and at the end of each mile all stopped for a needed rest  dont know as this ere trail is as good as tudder remarked sam barringford but they tell me it knocks three miles out o the bend an thats something  james morris and the old frontiersman had imagined the weather would remain fair but on the morning of the fourth day out a cold rain set in that chilled all to the bone the indians under white buffalo wished to go into camp at once but james morris decided to keep on and did so until the middle of the afternoon when as the storm increased the party halted beneath a large clump of trees and lost no time in getting out their shelters and putting them up the indians had a wigwam of skins and the whites two canvas coverings these were placed close together and a roaring camp fire was started near by where all hands tried to dry themselves and get warm a steaming hot meal was also served which did much to make everybody feel comfortable  i do hate a cold rain on a march grumbled henry as he crouched in the shelter beside dave makes me feel like a wet hen that cant get inside of the coop  if only one doesnt catch cold replied dave dont you remember the cold i caught when we were up at lake ontario  to be sure and i had a cold myself henry paused for a moment where has barringford gone  he said he was going to try to stir up some game i dont know what he expects to get in this rain  he ought to know what he is doing he is the best white hunter that i ever ran across  an hour passed and by that time it was dark the indians sat in their wigwam smoking and talking in low guttural tones the white hunters were also telling yarns of the war and of the various indian uprisings before that time they were thrilling tales and the youths listened to them with deep interest both dave and henry had been through a great deal themselves so they knew that the stories though wild and wonderful were probably based on facts today when we live in such security and comfort we can hardly realize the dangers and privations those pioneers endured to make our glorious country so full of rich blessings to us  growing tired of sitting down henry had just arisen to stretch his limbs when a sudden rushing sound through the forest reached his ears  what is that he questioned and instinctively reached for his rifle  some animal i reckon answered dave  a rifle shot rang out and the sound came closer then as henry ran out of the shelter he uttered a yell of alarm  a buffalo lookout  he was right a magnificent specimen of the buffalo tribe was crashing along under the wet trees and among the bushes he was alone and rushing along at his best speed in a twinkling he struck the clump of trees and hitting the shelter of the whites smashed it flat     chapter ix  henrys strange disappearance   in days gone by the american buffalo or bison roamed nearly the entire length and breadth of north america the indians hunted the animal industriously but their efforts with bow and spear were not sufficient to exterminate the species  but with the coming of the white man to america matters took a different turn the buffalo could not run away so easily from a rifle shot and armed with the best weapons they could obtain indians and white hunters rounded up the buffaloes at every possible opportunity in order to obtain the pelts this soon caused the animals to thin out and flee to the westward beyond the mississippi where they at last sought refuge in the rocky mountains so fiercely have they been hunted during the past seventyfive years that today but a few herds remain and ere long these promise to be totally exterminated  henry had never seen a buffalo so far to the eastward and he was therefore much astonished at the sudden appearance of the shaggyheaded beast he gave a yell of alarm which was followed by another yell from dave as the frail shelter bent beneath the weight of the buffalo  a bison shouted james morris and white buffalo took up the cry of alarm then down went the canvas flat and the buffalo made a plunge for the forest beyond henry heard a groan from dave as the youth was covered up not waiting longer he raised his gun took hasty aim at the animal and fired  did ye git him the query came from sam barringford as bareheaded he rushed into the little clearing back of the trees i give him one in the side but it didnt seem to stop him none  i dont know if i hit him or not answered henry he burst upon us so swiftly i hardly knew what to do  while this talk was going on james morris was crawling from under the wreck of the tent barringford reloaded and ran on after the buffalo and henry did likewise they could hear the great beast plunging headlong through the brush  he has got it putty bad remarked barringford if he hadnt he wouldnt ram into things so hard reckon he hardly knows what he is doin  i hope we get him answered henry his eyes filled with eager desire we would have fresh meat for a long time and plenty of jerked beef too  more than half a mile was covered and still the buffalo kept on much to the surprise of the young hunter and the pioneer  not so badly hit as i reckoned on panted barringford  perhaps i didnt hit him at all was henrys answer  soon they gained the top of a rise of ground here the rocks were smooth and slippery and in a twinkling henry went down and rolled over and over down a long hill  hi hi stop yourself roared barringford in quick alarm stop or yell go over the cliff  his alarm was justified for the hill ended in a cliff all of thirty feet in height below which were some jagged rocks and a small mountain torrent flowing into the upper monongahela  henry heard the cry but did not understand the words yet he did not like the idea of rolling he knew not to where and dropping his gun he caught at the wet rocks and bushes which came to hand but his downward progress was not stayed and in a few seconds he reached the edge of the cliff and rolled out of sight  illustration henry  rolled over and over down a long hill  the incident happened so quickly that barringford was almost stunned he started to go down the hill after henry but for fear of meeting a like fate dropped on his breast in the wet and worked his way along from rock to bush with great caution twice he called henrys name but no answer came back  if he went over on them rocks its likely he was smashed up he groaned why didnt i have sense enough to hold him back i knew this dangerous spot was here  step by step he drew closer to the edge of the cliff the snows of the past winter had washed away and loosened much of the ground and once he felt as if everything was giving way and he was to share the fate of his companion  at last he was within three feet of the edge of the cliff he could look down into the gully beyond but not down on the side where he felt henry must be resting  henry he called loudly henry  he waited for fully a minute but no answer came back his face grew more disturbed than ever  he is hurt thats sartin he muttered like as not he broke his neck  barringford always carried a bit of rope with him and he now had the same piece used in dragging the elk to the morris homestead taking this he tied it to a stout bush and by this means lowered himself to the very edge of the cliff  night was now approaching and at the bottom of the gully all was so dark he could see only with the greatest of difficulty the torrent ran among rough rocks and brushwood with here and there a patch of long grass bent flat from the winters snows  henry where are you  again there was no answer and now barringford was thoroughly alarmed he remembered how mrs morris had asked him to keep watch over her son  got to git down to him somehow he told himself i hope hes only stunned  after a general survey of the situation the old frontiersman decided that the cliff terminated at a point several hundred yards to the southward accordingly he climbed up the hill with care and commenced to make a detour in that direction  it was hard work to make any movement forward for the rocks were unusually rough and between them were hollows filled with mud dead leaves and water three times he fell and when he arose he was plastered with mud from head to feet but he did not turn back and every minute wasted only added to his alarm for sam barringford rough though he was in outward appearance had a heart that at times could be as tender as that of a child  if the lads dead i dont know how im agoin to break the news to his folks he groaned with a long sigh joseph and his wife allers looked to me to keep an eye on him they expect me to be keerful twasnt right at all fer me to take henry so close to sech a dangerous spot i ought to be licked fer it an licked hard too  it was a good half hour before he could get down to where the torrent flowed over the rocks he was now a quarter of a mile from where henry had taken the unexpected tumble and working his way down the stream was no easy task  it had set in to rain harder than ever and the black clouds soon shut out what little was left of daylight wet to the skin and shivering from the cold he moved on as well as he was able again he called henrys name but only a dull echo came back partly drowned by the rushing of the water  when barringford thought he had covered the proper distance he came to a halt on his back he carried henrys rifle as well as his own having picked it up when leaving the top of the hill but the owner of the firearm was nowhere visible  ill have to make a light no two ways on thet he mused and moved close up under the rocks to get some dry kindlings but everything was thoroughly wet around him and though he set fire to the tinder in his box he could obtain nothing in the shape of a torch  again he stumbled on soon getting into the water up to his waist in fresh alarm he found his way out of the torrent and next encountered some thick wiry bushes where further progress seemed out of the question  beats all how things are goin crosswise he muttered as he paused to get his breath an all along o thet confounded buffalo too reckon hes miles an miles away by this time and in this surmise the old frontiersman was correct  an hours search convinced him that henry was no longer in that vicinity but what had become of the youth was a mystery  he wouldnt walk away without lettin me know reasoned barringford must be he fell into the water and got drowned and somethin is holdin him under one thing is sartin if thets so taint no use to try to find him afore mornin might as well go back to camp an break the news  but he was unwilling to go back and again and again he called henrys name listening with all the acuteness of which his trained sense of hearing was capable only the rushing of the torrent and the dripping of the rain answered him  no use he muttered he is gone an thet is all there is to it ive got to face the music and tell the others though its worse nor pullin teeth to do it  getting out of the gully in the almost total darkness was now truly difficult and had not barringford been skilled in woodcraft he would certainly have been lost but he had taken note of the way he had come and remembered every bush tree and rock and now he returned by the same route it was a tough climb back to the forest where the trail of the buffalo had been last seen and here he had to rest once more before starting for the camp     chapter x  a wait in camp   let us go back to the time when the buffalo in his mad eagerness to get away from the hunters plunged headlong into the shelter of the whites and hurled it flat  under the canvas lay dave with the breath knocked completely out of him he felt something heavy come down on his back and then for the moment knew no more  when he opened his eyes he found that his father had hauled him from under the wreckage and was gazing earnestly into his face  are you hurt son demanded james morris quickly  iireckon not was the slow answer but something hit me in thethe back whewhere is the buffalo  gone and barringford and henry after him  hope they lay him low  so do i but are you quite sure you are not injured i thought the animal stepped on you  maybe he did father but im all right thank goodness and dave stretched himself to prove his words  the indians had gathered around and were talking excitedly some wanted to join in the hunt but the frontiersmen under barringford held them back  you let sam an henry go it alone said sanderson they know wot they are adoin  that is true answered white buffalo my white brothers can shoot welli have seen it  soon the knockeddown tent was raised again and the fire stirred up then as the storm increased all crouched in the shelters they had erected and awaited the return of henry and the old frontiersman  id like to eat a buffalo steak now firstrate said dave smacking his lips it would touch the spot and chase away the blues  buffalo steak is rather strong like elks meat answered his father but we need strong food on such a rough journey as this  its a pity there isnt a better trail father  some day there will be a regular road davewhen there are more settlements to the westward i look for the time when we shall have cities out here the same as along the seaboard  wont never see that said the frontiersman named lukins  why not risked james morris  the injuns wont allow it thats why mr morris they dont mind a tradinpost or two whar they kin sell hides an git rum an sech things but they dont want no towns or cities you wont never see a city on the ohio nor in them western countries at all  i believe the cities are bound to come said dave as more folks come over from england and germany and france theyll be bound to spread out the indians wont stop em  they will if they rise an dig up the war hatchet put in jadwin the other frontiersman  if they dig up the hatchet too often they will be wiped out said james morris they may fight all they pleasein the end both the english and the french will conquer them  how large do you think our country will get in time father questioned dave  that is a hard question to answer dave i think you may live to see strong settlements on the ohio and your children may see towns on the mississippi about the great western countries i know nothing nor does any other white man i suppose they are overrun by indians and all sorts of wild beasts or perhaps there is nothing there but beasts and trackless forests  its too bad the indians wont live as the white people live went on dave thoughtfully we might get along famously together  it is not the indians nature to till the soil my son he loves to roam about and to hunt and fish and then take it easy more than this when the spirit stirs him he must fight and if he cannot fight the white man he will fight his fellow indians you have often heard white buffalo tell how one tribe will fight another tribe for several seasons and how the tribes sometimes split up and fight among themselves  of course didnt the delawares to whom he belongs split up one side going to the french and the others fighting under white buffalo for our cause but when a war is over they might settle down  as the time passed the others concluded that henry and barringford had found the buffalo hunt longer than they had anticipated  perhaps the animal has led them such a chase they wont come back until morning suggested james morris it is no fine thing to travel in the wet and darkness  right you are said sanderson sam may hunt in the wet if he wants to but none of it for me  an early supper was had and something was kept hot for those who were missing for it was felt they would come in chilled to the bone and with tremendous appetites  dave was beginning to grow sleepy when he heard a movement outside and a moment later sam barringford came into view with downcast face and with the water dripping from his coonskin cap and hunting shirt  sam cried james morris leaping up so youve got back at last did you get the buffalo where is henry  no we didnt get the buffalo answered the old frontiersman his voice grew husky henryhe ismissinghe dropped over a cliff he could not go on  over a cliff gasped dave you dont mean he isis he too failed to finish what was in his mind  i cant tell you what happened after he slipped from my sight went on barringford  oh sam do you mean to say he is killed  i hope not lad but it looks juberous no two ways ont  tell me how it happened said james morris and now all in the camp gathered around to hear what the old frontiersman had to say  the ice once broken barringfords tongue grew more talkative and he related all the particulars so far as he knew them  when i worked my way down into the waterway i felt sartin i would find henry in some sort o shape he concluded but i couldnt find nuthin not even his cap his gun he dropped on the hill an here it is and he handed it to dave  it was a fearful shock and the tears stood in daves eyes and ran down his cheeks while the youths father was scarcely less affected the frontiersmen had little to say and the indians with the exception of white buffalo took the matter stoically for the perils of the hunt were no new things to them  white buffalo took in every word that was spoken when matters of importance were to be considered he had little to say  shall white buffalo go forward and make a search he asked simply after sam barringford had stopped speaking  what can you do after sam here has failed questioned james morris i know you are keen on the trail white buffalo but you know that sam is too  four eyes are better than two returned the indian using an old saying of his tribe  let him go by all means if he wishes put in barringford the man to find henry an bring him back to camp is my best friend  white buffalo will you take me along asked dave eagerly  dave son dont you think you had better remain with me asked his father  no father we must find henry please let me go  dave can go if he wishes answered white buffalo the journey will not be pleasant but if henry is found we shall be glad is not white buffalo right  take torches with you or a lantern said barringford  torches were quickly procured and placed in a bit of skin that they might not get wet then another torch was lit and the old frontiersman gave the indian chief minute directions about the trail to the water course under the cliff  white buffalo knows something of that land said the chief he will not go astray  i should hope not said dave we want to find henry not lose ourselves  take a bag full of eating along put in james morris you may want something before morning and also a bandage and some stimulants for henry in case he is badly hurt and needs them he could not let himself believe that his nephew was dead  all right father ill take whatever you say answered dave and soon he and white buffalo had all the articles mentioned each went armed with his rifle and hunting knife and the indian carried his hatchet as well  do not remain away later than tomorrow noon said james morris when they were ready to leave if you are not back by that time i shall fear that something has happened to you also  dont fear for me so long as i am with white buffalo replied dave and this speech pleased the indian chief very much  dont you try to go down to the stream by way of the hill cautioned sam barringford if you do you may break your necks  the old frontiersman had sprained his foot but he did not deem it best to mention that fact nevertheless if he had been better able to walk he would probably have accompanied dave and white buffalo in spite of the first search made by him  its a shame thets wot it is he declared after the youth and the indian had departed it distresses me oncommonly to think such a thing could happen to henry  i hope with all my heart he is alive responded james morris  but if he is dead  then i shall return to wills creek without delay and start for the west some time laterafter i have given my brother and his family all the comfort i can said the trader soberly     chapter xi  happenings of a stormy night   it is now high time that we return to henry and see how he fared after his sudden and unexpected disappearance over the edge of the cliff  the young pioneer was well aware of his peril and as he rolled out of sam barringfords sight he clutched wildly at every bush and projecting rock that came near his hand  once a sapling growing in a cleft of the cliff struck his shoulder around this he managed partly to twist his arm and this saved him from serious injury  he struck some rocks however with considerable force and for a moment was stunned  what a tumble he muttered when he had regained his breath it is a wonder that i didnt kill myself  with an ache in the side occasioned by the rough experience henry arose and started to look for some spot along the cliff where he might climb to the top  where he stood it was almost totally dark and he had not taken over a score of steps when he floundered into a hollow filled with water and mud he leaped across this to find himself in a split of the cliff where the bushes were unusually high and thick here the rain hung heavily from every twig and soon soaked him worse than ever  he thought he heard barringford calling and started to answer then he pushed forward once more hoping each moment to gain higher ground  but the pocketfor such it really wasgrew deeper and suddenly he found himself at the edge of a deep hole he tried to step back but the dirt under his feet gave way and he plunged downward he knew not whither he felt his head strike some projection and felt some dirt come down on top of him and then for the time being he knew no more  the young hunter came to his senses slowly his first realization was that his head pained him greatly and that some weight was trying to force the air from his lungs he tried to move his hands to learn that each was covered with the dirt which had come down on top of him  with a great effort he cleared his hands and then his body and tried to rise to his feet but he could not stand and trembling like a leaf he sank down on a rock near at hand all was pitch dark around him and the rain beat steadily on his head  im in a pickle truly he muttered dismally wonder where sam can be  he tried to cry out but his voice was woefully weak and uncertain and he soon gave up the effort then he tried again to walk but had to desist in despair  he could not imagine how long he had been under the fallen dirt but knew it must be some time perhaps an hour or two where barringford was there was no telling  im worse off than i was before that is sure he thought maybe i wont be able to get out of this mess before morning  feeling stronger after a while he arose and groped his way forward he had not taken a dozen steps before he came to some rocks they arose slantingly and under them he found a dry spot well sheltered from the rain  this is a little better than the other place was he mused but id like to know just what sort of a hole this is and what the prospect is of getting out  like barringford the young pioneer carried a flint and tinderbox with him and under the rocks it was a comparatively easy matter for henry to strike a light he found some dry leaves and twigs blown hither by the wind and presently had a respectable fire started over which he crouched in an effort to drive away the chill which was stealing over him  this is a buffalo hunt with a vengeance he muttered i was a fool to start off after the animal in such a storm and in the darkness after this ill do my hunting altogether in the daytime  in a search for more firewood henry presently came to an opening in the rocks behind him it was totally dry here and taking up the best of the firebrands he moved to the new location soon he had a roaring fire the smoke going upward to some hole overhead which he could not locate  this must be something of a cave he mused wonder where it can lead to  he felt that it would be useless to attempt trying to get out of the hollow he was in before daylight and so proceeded to make an investigation of the opening  it proved of no great size however and nothing met his gaze but rocks dirt decayed tree roots and a heap of bones in a far corner showing that it had once been the den of a wild beast  i am glad the beast isnt here now thought henry id be badly off without a gun  slowly the time wore away and henry had now to make another search for firewood if he expected to keep the blaze going and what to do he scarcely knew  if i look for wood ill get wet again he reasoned and if i dont go and get some the fire will leave me in the cold  he was on the point of scraping the fire together to make it last as long as possible when an unexpected whistle broke upon his ears he sprang to the front of the shelter and listened intently the whistle was one he knew well and the whistler was rendering an old english air called lucy locket lost her pocket an air which we today call yankee doodle  dave shouted the young hunter and set up a wild yell dave where are you  is that you henry came from the edge of the hollow  yes look out or youll get a tumble as i did  white buffalo knows the trail came in the voice of the indian chief  hullo is that you white buffalo very well but be careful  torches in hand dave and white buffalo moved forward slowly but the indian knew exactly what he was doing and soon he and the youth with him were at the bottom of the hollow in safety then dave ran forward to greet his cousin  are you badly hurt he questioned  no im all right dave although i got two nasty tumbles  sam was afraid you had been killed he searched all around but couldnt find you  i was foolish not to wait until sam came down to the water course i started to get out alone and got into this pickle why didnt you shout when you came up  we saw the fire but white buffalo thought there might be some unfriendly indians or trappers around so then i thought of my old whistle i knew you would recognize it  henry had to tell his story and then dave asked him if he was well enough to return to the camp without delay  they are all anxious about you especially father and sam he added  to be sure ill go back to camp its no fun staying here im quite hungry too  then you must have something before we leave  the meal was soon disposed of and led by white buffalo the party left the hollow and proceeded through the forest it was a long hard journey but neither of the youths minded it both being thankful that the adventure had terminated so happily  when henry reached camp once more he was hailed with great joy by james morris and sam barringford the uncle embraced his nephew and the old frontiersman gripped henrys hand until the bones fairly cracked  i have been more than worried ever since sam came back with his sad tale said james morris in the future henry you must be very careful when you go hunting otherwise i shall not want to leave you out of my sight  id give my right hand ruther than see ye kilt said barringford huskily next time we go out i reckon as how well keep close together  its strange you didnt get on my trail returned henry you are usually a good one at such things  the downpour washed out the tracks said james morris  im not so good at such things as white buffalo is answered sam barringford bluntly he is born to it and white buffalo it does you credit  white buffalo was once called the trail king said the delaware proudly he found the trail when all others failed it was in the war with the ottawas  the rain had now ceased and once more the campfires were started up and the wet things were placed to dry  since so much of the night has been lost we may as well take it easy tomorrow said james morris and this was done this gave barringford a chance to nurse his sprained foot for which he was thankful     chapter xii  the ruins of the old tradingpost   once more the arduous journey westward was resumed the hills left behind they traveled a peaceful valley where riding on horseback was a real pleasure small game was now sighted in plenty and dave and henry brought down their full share of what was bagged the indians joined in the hunting with keen pleasure and white buffalo brought down a silvertailed fox the pelt of which became the envy of all the red men under him  having crossed a broad but shallow water course they reached an indian village called badoktah which had but recently been established by a tribe of the shawanoes the coming of the shawanoes eastward into the territory of the delawares was not liked by the latter and white buffalo and his men met those in the village with scant courtesy  the land of the shawanoes is beyond the rolling muskingum said white buffalo to dave they have come hither because they know my tribes are weak but some day we shall drive them back to the lands that are their own  do they claim the land up at lake erie asked the youth  no that is the land of the wyandots and the iroquois  and how far to the west do they own the land  for three days journey on foot then comes the land of the mighty miamis and to the northward the lands of the pottawattamies the ottawas and the ojibways  and who occupy the lands still further westward  on the mighty father of waters answered the indian chief meaning the mississippi are the illinois and to the northward the kickapoos and the sacs and winnebagoes of the tribes beyond the mighty river white buffalo knows but little by some they are said to be exceeding cruel and others have told that they are dumb and paint their bodies with mud  the village of badoktah consisted of about thirty wigwams made of rude skins and long poles as was usual at all such villages each wigwam was decorated with rough indian pictures and writings giving the name of the occupant his family and telling of his deeds in war the wigwams were without exception exceedingly dirty and the shawanoes themselves were little betteroffering a strong contrast to white buffalo and his followers indian dogs were everywhere many of them miserable curs all barking viciously and showing their teeth  the warriors were getting ready to go out on a hunt but they waited until their unexpected visitors had departed one or two of them had met james morris at the tradingpost on the kinotah and they remembered that he had treated them well as a consequence the indians did what they could to make the newcomers welcome although they showed plainly that they would have been better pleased had the delawares not been present  you must come and trade with me when i have reestablished myself said james morris to the warriors of the village i will treat you honestly  they remained in the village but two hours and then pushed forward straight for fort pitt  at the time of which i write fort pitt was a structure standing on the point of land where the monongahela and the alleghany rivers unite to form the broad ohio as already told it had been named fort duquesne by the french but after the surrender to general forbes it was renamed after william pitt a great leader in england in 1759 much of the old fort was torn down by general stanwix who erected in its place a much larger and stronger structure built of logs bricks and dirt and well protected with a number of cannon  when the party reached the fort james morris was welcomed warmly by the english officer in command no white men had passed that way since early winter and all in the fort were anxious to hear the latest news and to receive the newspapers which the trader had thoughtfully brought along  you are very adventurous said the commandant of the fort i do not know how the shawanoes will treat you  have you had any trouble demanded james morris  not of any consequence some drunken indians came here a few weeks ago and did some shooting but nobody was hurt and i speedily sent the drunkards about their business  all the whites of the party were glad to rest at the fort for several days and white buffalo and his men remained with them during that time dave and henry met several soldiers who had been with the youths during one campaign or another  glad to see you came out of the war hale and hearty said one of the soldiers you are both lucky  we were lucky answered henry  the fall of montreal has brought the war to a quick close went on the soldier but that is not saying that the indians wont give us plenty of trouble in the future  they had better not they will get the worst of it said dave  it is some of the great chiefs who are stirring them up morris if the regular run of redskins were left alone they would be peaceable enough but the chiefs go among them and say we are stealing their hunting grounds away from them and all that and that gets them excited  yes i know and to a certain extent what they say is true too  the trouble is the redskins wont make a fair deal theyll sell land one year and then want it back the next added another soldier  have you seen any french traders in this vicinity asked henry  not since we gave orders for them to quit their trading i reckon they feel mighty sore our captain told me that a few were thinking of becoming british subjects they realize that the french hold in america is now broken for good  the stop at fort pitt at an end the party continued on its way to the kinotah a beautiful stream the name of which has long since been changed the trail was now exceedingly rough and so narrow in spots that the packhorses could scarcely get through the branches of the trees hung low so that often all had to move along on foot the one consolation was that the weather remained fine so that campingout at night proved a real pleasure and a rest  there are not half the indians in this neighborhood that there were three and four years ago remarked james morris to barringford the war has thinned them out more than i expected  i look for big times with game returned the old frontiersman it will be almost like striking a new hunting ground  every night a watch was kept for the possible appearance of an enemy either twofooted or fourfooted but no man came to disturb them and if any wild beasts were near they kept well out of sight once lukins brought down a small wildcat but that was all  it must be confessed that james morris was exceedingly anxious to see how the tradingpost had fared during his absence and as soon as the rolling kinotah was reached he set off on a gallop along the bank of the stream followed by dave and henry leaving barringford to advance more leisurely with the packtrain  the river with its clear sparkling waters was as beautiful as ever but while they were still two miles from where the tradingpost had been located they noticed a change in the character of the surroundings the heavy spring freshets had done their work and the river banks were torn into numerous gullies and creeks while the trunks and limbs of great trees lay in all directions further still they came to a long burnt district which made the heart of the trader turn sick with dread  it is as i feared he said sadly there has been a terrible burnover here and the district is no longer what it was  in less than half an hours riding over the blackened ground they came to where the long comfortable tradingpost had been located only a pile of ashes with here and there a burnt log sticking up marked the spot and james morris could scarcely keep back the tears as he surveyed the ruin wrought tears came to daves eyes and henry shook his head  well have to go further now wont we father said dave after a long spell of silence you wont want to build here again  no dave ill not build here it was a beautiful place but it seemed fated not to thrive we must push on to some other territory  dismounting they started to poke among the ruins thinking they might possibly turn up something of value while they were at this task barringford and the others appeared  well i vum cried the old frontiersman ef this aint jess too naturally bad fer anything didnt expect it like this did ye an sech a handsome spot as it was too  white buffalos heart is sad said the indian chief he feels sore for his brother james the great forest has fallen and many will be the summers ere it rises again  you are right white buffalo answered the trader and even when it does rise it will not be as grand as it was before  the party could not go into camp on the burnover so sanderson took charge of the packtrain and led it along the river where the waters flowed toward the broad ohio in the meantime the morrises and sam barringford dug over the ashes where the tradingpost had stood  little of value was found outside of a rusty pistol two rusty hunting knives a bullet mold a string of wampum and a few earthen dishes and an hour later the searchers left the spot  it is too bad said james morris i loved the place dearly but it may be we shall find another further on that is just as good  let us hope it will be better said dave trying to look on the cheerful side  yes let us hope it will be better said henry and the others echoed the sentiment     chapter xiii  building the new tradingpost   four days later found the entire party encamped on the bank of the ohio river about twenty miles from the district which had suffered from the terrible ravages of fire  they had indeed found a spot as beautiful as that which had once chained james morris to the kinotah there was a tiny bluff overlooking the broad stream and back of this a long low hill covered with a forest of exceptionally good timber around the hill wound a pleasing brook gurgling gently in its passage over the stones the brook was lined with various kinds of bushes and flowering plants and not far off was a series of rocks where a spring of pure cold water gushed forth the soil along the river bank was rich in the extreme and james morris saw at once that anything planted in it would grow with but little care  after all i think we have done well to come thus far said he to dave and henry the ohio is a larger stream than the kinotah hence i think the chances to do some trading will be better and without loss of time he staked out a plot of ground and in his own way proclaimed himself proprietor he knew that later on he would have to prove his claim to the land company claiming the whole tract but he felt that this with proper influence would be easy the land companies were glad to have the backing of honest traders for to survey their possessions and dispose of certain plots was by no means easy  the spot for the location of the new tradingpost having been found many hard days of toil followed for all of the white men and for dave and henry the indians could not be persuaded to work but spent their time in hunting and fishing and thus supplied the entire party with food  the first work was to build a rude but substantial palisade of logs about twelve feet long and sharpened at the upper end this palisade extended from the river front to where the brook made a turn almost parallel to the ohio with the north side flanked by a small rise of rocks the gateway was at the south end ten feet wide and later on fitted with a strong pair of gates secured by a top and a bottom crossbar  fortunately as already stated good timber was close at hand and while dave henry and sam barringford cut the logs the others had the horses haul them to where they were wanted and set them up as desired james morris was an old hand at this sort of employment and so the work went forth rapidly  this is really working for a living said dave one day after having brought down a tall straight tree from which at least four logs could be cut we are truly earning our bread by the sweat of our face  but its healthy labor and i dont mind it answered his cousin  do you really mean that henry asked dave resting for a moment and gazing sharply at the other  henry colored slightly i suppose you think id rather be out hunting with white buffalos crowd he said slowly  wouldnt you tell the plain truth  perhaps i would but i dont let myself think about it dave this work has got to be done and i mean to do my full share of it i reckon everybody has to do things he dont just like in this life  i think you are right therei know i often have to do em  and it dont do to growl either the best thing to do is to pitch in and get through as fast as possible went on henry and then set to chopping with renewed vigor  do you remember the time we first started to chop down trees continued dave how our hands got blistered and how we wouldnt give up because the men were looking on  indeed i do what a lot has happened since that time the war and our going to fort niagara and then down the lakes and the st lawrence to quebec and montreal and all the fighting in one way dave we have seen quite something of life  so we have but i want no more war  neither do i answered henry neither dreamed of the terrors of the indian uprising or of the grim horrors of the revolution which would come later the molding of this great nation into what it is today was to be no easy matter  inside of two months the greater part of the work on the palisade was complete there were many things still to accomplish but james morris decided to let these rest until later he and the others set to work to clear the grounds within called the stockade and then a long low log house was started at one side and a low storehouse and horse stable at the other  so far but few hunters and trappers had appeared to do any trading strange as it may seem the ohio at this point had but few indians upon it the red men confining their operations very largely to the smaller streams but those who did appear were treated liberally by james morris and soon they spread the news with the result that quite a fair trade was established by the time snow was flying once more  the white men and especially dave and henry were glad enough to shift from the outside camp to the log house as soon as one end of the building was completed all was still in a crude state but sleeping under any sort of roof was preferable to the open the entire house could not be completed that season so only two rooms were made weather proof one for trading and the other for living and sleeping purposes  not as nice as at home observed dave as he gazed at the rough logs filled in with mud and the dirt flooring but it will be warm this winter and thats something  it had been decided that barrington and henry should return to the morris homestead before winter set in they were to take six of the horses and if everything went well were to return to the tradingpost as early as possible in the spring bringing with them a long list of articles wanted by james morris both were now quite anxious to return to the east henry to learn how his folks were faring and barringford to see the twins and find out if their identity had yet been disclosed  if they aint found out nuthin about them twins im going to make em my own said the old frontiersman i aint got no chick nor child an i might as well be adoin somethin for somebody in this world  but you must leave them at our house returned henry mother and little nell are so attached to them  the departure of henry and barringford was an event and all quit working to see them off dave was sorry to part with his cousin and wrung his hand several times  you take good care of yourself he said dont tumble over any more cliffs  and you take good care of yourself during the winter returned henry it snows heavily out here so they tell me dont you get lost in a snowstorm like you did when you and sam were journeying to fort oswego  dave and james morris accompanied the pair as far as the burnover and then watched them as they disappeared over a distant ridge as they were lost to sight the youth could not repress a sigh which reached his parents quick ears  sorry to see henry go i suppose dave  yes father we have been together so much you know henry seems like a brother to me  i dont doubt it for he is to me almost like a son i trust he and sam reach wills creek in safety  both father and son had thought to return to the new trading post as soon as they left the others but now neither was in the humor for working for what little was left of the day and james morris asked dave if he wished to go on a short hunt  we may not stir up much but i think the change will do us good  ill go gladly cried dave and they set off on horseback up the kinotah and then followed a small creek along which both had hunted in days gone by  the day was an ideal one and though game in that vicinity was scarce the indians having gone over the ground half a dozen times each enjoyed the outing thoroughly dave managed to bring down some birds and two squirrels and his father a pair of grouse and with this they rested content  supposing we take another look at the ruins of the old post suggested dave when they were on the return it is not so very late yet and we may pick up something which we missed before  very well dave  along the creek the wild flowers grew in reckless profusion and the youth often stopped to admire them and once he picked a handful to take back with him  you love flowers said his father  i do father dont you  somewhat your taste comes from your mother she thought much of them and when we planted the garden she always planted flower seeds too and the trader gave a long sigh as he thought of the good woman who had died so many years before  presently they came once more to the burnover and then made their way straight to the ruins of the old tradingpost the spot looked more forlorn than ever for the storms of the summer had washed some mud over part of the ground and grass and weeds flourished amid the blackness  that shows what nature can do observed james morris give this a few years more and it will be impossible to tell that a post ever stood here in the same fashion entire villages have been wiped out so that historians going there later cannot locate even the first sign of the ruins  an old shovel had been left at the place and working with this james morris began to turn over some of the burnt sticks at a spot where he thought he might possibly come upon something of value in the meantime dave poked around to suit himself and presently found two jugs and an iron pot  i think these are still good to use he said and started down to the creek to wash them off and inspect them more closely  he had just reached the creek when a sound in the brushwood beyond caught his ears he looked up to see three frenchmen on horseback riding toward him the man in advance looked familiar to him and as this individual drew closer dave recognized jean bevoir     chapter xiv  jean bevoir has his say   had somebody suddenly arisen from the dead before him dave would have been no more astonished than he was when he beheld the frenchman who in the past had caused him and his relatives so much trouble  jean bevoir he gasped but no it cannot be for bevoir was killed at the fall of montreal  the three frenchmen did not notice the youth until the very edge of the creek was reached then jean bevoir uttered an exclamation in french  settlers after all he said to his companions  where asked both and came forward one on each side of him  by this time dave was confronting the trio boldly and now jean bevoir looked at him more closely  parbleu he muttered tis that dave morris or mayhap i am dreaming  jean bevoir faltered the youth ii thought you were dead  dead and how came you to think that  they told us you were shot down at montreal  ha i see and you were glad of it not so but i have disappointed you the frenchman paused and then chuckled to himself you cannot flee from jean bevoir so easily  what do you want here  want do you ask what would any honest man want yes i was shot and left for dead but my good friends nursed me to health malgre moll and now i am come to claim what is my own  by this time james morris had noted the appearance of the newcomers and leaving his work over the ruins he walked forward to see who they were  can it be possible that this is jean bevoir he ejaculated  yes father answered dave the report that he was killed was false  but the soldiers were so sure  they made a mistake it is jean bevoir beyond any doubt  so you are here declared the frenchman glaring darkly at the trader i was told that the englishmen had come no further westward than fort duquesne  you mean fort pitt answered james morris pointedly fort duquesne is a thing of the past some day the fort shall come back to its own put in one of bevoirs companions whose name was jacques valette you english have but a slim foothold  that is a matter of opinion valette answered james morris he knew jacques valette to be a hunter of the rougher sort given to much fighting and dissipating the war is at an end and for the present my country is master of the situation  the english do not own this land put in jean bevoir it has always belonged to the french and the indians and it belongs to them still no army has been sent out here to take possession and how can the english claim that which they have not even seen or marked out  i wont discuss the old quarrel with you bevoir said james morris briefly we are here to stay and that is the end of the matter so far as i am concerned you can do as you please but i warn you not to interfere with me if you do you will get your fingers burnt  the place is burnt down said the third frenchman whose name was hector bergerac he too was a hunter but of a better sort than bevoir or valette shall you build again  not here answered james morris i have located a new post on the ohio  the ohio came from the three frenchmen simultaneously and the others looked at jean bevoir  where upon the ohio have you placed the new post demanded the french trader  his manner was so insolent that james morris grew nettled  had you asked me civilly i would have answered you bevoir he returned but now you can find out for yourself  we were going to erect a post upon the ohio put in bergerac our packtrain is but a day behind us  it will be a loss of time and money for you frenchmen to do that came quickly from james morris i tell you that the english are in control and they mean to keep control in the end you will lose all you possess  we are not for war but for peace said hector bergerac i for one will obey the english law if i find out that that is what must be done  pouf came from jean bevoir show not the heart of a chicken bergerac remember we french have still most of the indians as friends  do you mean to say that you will incite the red men to fight us demanded james morris  ha that makes you shiver does it cried jean bevoir wickedly we shall not have to say much the red men can take their own part they know well that the french are their true friends and the english their real enemies  you scoundrel cried james morris hotly dare to provoke the red men to fight and i will see to it that you shall not escape as you did at montreal perhaps you do not know that i have knowledge of your evil doings at montrealhow you and others tried to loot the stores and private dwellings and how both the french and the english soldiers turned on you and your dastardly companions and shot you down how you escaped from justice i do not know but perhaps even yet the authorities will listen to a charge against you  at this plain outburst jean bevoir grew first pale and then crimson his hand sought the pistol at his side but the stern look in the english traders face caused him to drop his hold on the weapon  i will not listen to such talk from you he exclaimed grating his teeth savagely the story is not true and you know it i was wounded while aiding some french people who were sick i never stole a thing in my life it is for the english to make up such tales just to get the french into trouble  you wouldnt have to take my word for it retorted james morris grimly the evidence would rest with those who caught you in the act at montreal  will you tell us where your post on the ohio is located asked jacques valette  you heard my answer to bevoir returned james morris if you wish to locate why not do so here this was a spot monsieur bevoir always admired he added with some slight show of sarcasm  on this burntover spot ejaculated jean bevoir no thank you i shall go where i expected to goto the ohio  rather late in the year to put up a post now suggested dave who could not help saying something  at this speech jean bevoir smiled knowingly  trust me that i know what i am doing he said come he added to his companions in french we can gain nothing by remaining here longer  he turned his steed around and rode off and valette and bergerac did the same soon the brushwood and forest hid them from view  well i never burst out dave who would have thought it  it seems we are not clear of that rascal after all said james morris bitterly not only is he alive but he is coming out to his old hunting ground to bother us  do you think he will set up a post near us father  he did that when i located here he seems to take savage delight in crowding on my heels  that valette is about as bad a rascal as bevoir  that is true  do you know much of the third fellow  not a great deal but i always fancied he was a frenchman of the better sort he used to be attached to the fort at presqu isle i once bought some furs from him and he was much pleased over what i gave him for them he said it was much more than bevoir offered  he seems handinglove with bevoir now  perhaps or else it may be that he was simply hired by bevoir to come out and help establish a new post  what can they do with winter so close at hand  nothing much son they will have to work hard to provide themselves a shelter  bevoir didnt appear to be much worried  he may possibly have something in mind of which i know nothing answered james morris thoughtfully it is too bad i wish he would go away and leave me alone he might just as well establish himself a hundred miles from here as to be on top of me  it was now too dark to continue the search around the ruins and taking the few things they had found with them they returned to the new post  we had better not say anything about bevoir and his crowd said james morris as they journeyed along let the men and the indians find it out for themselves  all right father just as you say answered dave but when they find it out what then  then let the men say what they please we will try to avoid a quarrel  jean bevoir hates white buffalo worse than poison  i do not doubt it for white buffalo accused him several times of cheating the hunters of his tribe out of a reasonable exchange for their furs bevoir got the indians drunk and then literally robbed them  he dealt principally in rum didnt he  yes he never gave the indians anything else if he could help it all told i think he was the most rascally trader i ever met in these parts concluded james morris     chapter xv  daves unwelcome visitor   for several weeks after that nothing more was seen or heard of jean bevoir and his party more than once james morris questioned the frontiersmen and indians in a roundabout manner asking if they had met any strangers but the replies were largely in the negative white buffalo had once run across a small band of shawanoes who had said they would later on come to the post to trade but that was all  perhaps after all bevoir thought best to move away from this district said dave to his parent  no the rascal is not to be gotten rid of so readily was the answer even if he does not build a post he will loiter around in the shade until he gets the chance to do me some injury  there was now a promise of snow in the air and a few days later the ground was covered to the depth of an inch or more this made tracking game good and without delay the frontiersmen and indians set off to see what they might bring in as a consequence dave and mr morris were left at the post alone  i am glad the snow held off so long said james morris henry and barringford must be home by this timeor else close to it  if no accidents befell them said the son  with the men and indians away it was rather lonely around the post for dave but there was plenty to do and the youth kept himself well employed from sunrise to sunset occasionally he went fishing in the river with fair success the log house was made as comfortable as possible and both worked hard over the stable that the horses might not suffer when the winter set in in earnest  extra timbers had been cut at the top of the hill back of the tradingpost and when another fall of snow came james morris decided to slide these down to where he wanted them  if you need me just call or fire a gun he said one morning and then set off up the hill taking a team of the strongest horses with him  after his father was gone dave took a walk around the post cleaned some fish he expected to fry for dinner and looked after the remaining horses not a soul appeared to be in sight and for a little while he felt very lonely indeed but soon he broke into a cheery whistle which served to raise his spirits  well be busy enough as soon as the hunters and trappers begin to bring in their game he thought i hope we do a good business and make some money being a soldier didnt pay very handsomelyand this war has cost father a neat penny  returning to the log house from the barn he was surprised to find the main door wide open he felt certain that he had closed it on coming away  father are you there he called out striding forward  there was no answer but a second later came a crashing of glass and looking into the main room of the post he saw jacques valette sprawled out on a puncheon bench with a jug of liquor in his arms and a broken tumbler lying on the floor before him  what do you want here demanded dave indignantly  for the moment jacques valette did not answer but glared at the youth in an uncertain fashion  why do you ask me questions he queried in french and with several hiccoughs  let that liquor alone went on dave now realizing that the french hunter and trapper was more than half intoxicated let it alone i say and he tried to force the jug from valettes grasp want a drink shouted the man holding tight want a drink get meme some more glass boy  i will not let the jug alone and now dave got it in his possession and put it on a high shelf out of the frenchmans reach  with a frightful imprecation in his native tongue jacques valette staggered to his feet he made a clutch for daves right ear but the youth eluded him then in turning he went sprawling over the puncheon bench and his head struck the floor while his feet stuck up in the air  it was a comical sight but dave did not laugh he realized that he had an ugly customer with whom to deal he well knew how utterly lawless some of these wild hunters and trappers were when half full of liquor and knew that they would do almost anything to get more drink with which to finish their debauch running to the doorway he called loudly for his father  stop your noise shouted jacques valette stop or i make big trouble and he shook his fist at dave he was on his feet once more swaying unsteadily from side to side  i want you to go answered dave go do you hear  give me the jug and i go  illustration let go cried dave let go i say  not a drop you have had too much already  only haf one glass give the jug like good fellow  so speaking valette lurched over to the shelf and started to bring down the jug once more but ere he could do so dave had him by the arm and was hauling him backward  in a great rage at being thus thwarted jacques valette began to struggle with the youth he was a powerful fellow and for several minutes it looked as if he would get the better of dave his hold was a good one and soon he threw the youth to the floor and held him there  let go cried dave let go i say and did his best to wrench himself free  it was in the midst of this struggle that james morris rushed in having heard daves loud cry for assistance he took in the situation at a glance and bending down struck valette on the side of the head  you brute let my son go  bewildered by the blow the halfintoxicated frenchman fell back and dave staggered to his feet panting for breath valette had caught him by the throat and the marks of his fingers were still visible  what does this mean demanded mr morris after a pause in which the youth did his best to get back his breath  in a few words dave explained while he was talking jacques valette managed to rise to his feet if he had been angry before he was doubly so now he felt for his pistol but luckily the weapon was gone  ha you take my pistol he cried gif it back to me  i havent your pistol said dave you didnt have one  i did i want it back growled jacques valette  youll get no pistol here put in james morris you have no right to come to my post and raise a disturbance and attack my son  i want some rum i pay returned the frenchman i haf english moneyplenty too  with a leer he put one hand into his outer garment and felt around in a pocket then he felt in his other pockets  ha the money it is gone he cried you take my money too this is the coup de grace truly but a langlaise  it is not after the english fashion put in dave who understood the french fairly well we are honest people here and as my father says you have no right to come here and raise a quarrel  the moneyall gone muttered jacques valette the loss appeared to sober him for a moment fifteen pounds ten shillingsall gone  do you mean to say you had fifteen pounds and ten shillings questioned james morris  the french hunter and trapper nodded oui oui  and you havent it now  jacques valette shrugged his shoulders not a shilling all is gone you haf it and he shook his hand in daves face  dont dare to accuse my son of theft exclaimed james morris angrily he has nothing of yours  a perfect war of words followed jacques valette insisted that on coming to the post he had had a pistol and the money mentioned as they were now gone he felt certain that dave had taken them he could not or would not tell where he had been previous to his journey to james morris place  you lost them before you came here that is certain said james morris i want no more from you get out and he forced the frenchman to leave jacques valette walked away slowly muttering all sorts of imprecations in french under his breath  hell try to make us trouble for this observed dave after the unwelcome visitor had gone  i have no doubt but that you are right son answered james morris let us hunt around and see if he dropped his pistol and money anywhere in this vicinity  a thorough hunt was made but nothing was found which looked as if it might belong to the frenchman half an hour later it began to snow once more and soon the tracks made by jacques valette were covered up  after this i am going to keep the gates barred when we are alone said james morris ill hang the horn outside so anybody who wants to get in can blow and this was done  getting the timbers down the hillside proved no light task and often dave went out to aid his father for they could easily hear the horn at the gate from a great distance they had also to get in extra firewood for the winter which promised now to be unusually severe  it was almost christmas time before the hunters and trappers who had gone out began to come in with their furs among the first to arrive were lukins and sanderson who had managed to bring down a large variety of animals including two large bears the pelts of which were worth considerable these trappers were followed by jadwin who had not fared so well having lost some of his game in the river and then came white buffalo and his men who had been more successful than any of the others in those days the post became a bustling place and it really looked as if james morris venture would prove a moneymaking one he gave fair value for all that was brought to him and whites and indians declared themselves well satisfied with their dealings     chapter xvi  dave meets pontiac   it was white buffalo who brought in the first definite news that the indians throughout the length and breadth of the ohio valley and along the great lakes were becoming dissatisfied with the manner in which the english had taken possession of new france canada and the west  white buffalo has spoken with some of the great chiefs said he and all are agreed that the sky is black for the indian with the end of the war the english will push further and further into the forest and the hunting grounds will be taken away from the red man the indian must live by the hunt so what is he to do  its the old question over again answered james morris the indians wont become farmers and so they have got to suffer  but the indians claim the land as their own resumed white buffalo it was left to them by their forefathers the land of the english lies in england across the great water  i hope you dont stand for war white buffalo came from dave quickly  not for war on the friends of white buffalo was the ready answer but even white buffalo cannot stand idly by and see the english take all which belongs to his tribe and to the other red men the indian gets nothing in return he and his squaw and his papoose must live what should he do can my friends tell  james morris gave a sigh honestly white buffalo i cannot if i could i might solve the whole of this vexing question and then perhaps wed have no war but it doesnt seem right for the whites and the indians to be fighting all the time it hurts one just as much as it hurts the other  my brother james does not tell the truth said the indian chief somewhat sadly it hurts the indian far more than it hurts his white brother white buffalo has eyes and he is wise enough to see that the indian cannot fight the white man and win in the end the red man may slay many but in the end he will lose i know it i feel it and white buffalo bowed his head  do you look for an uprising soon questioned james morris after a long pause  not at oncethe red men have not forgotten how they suffered during this great war but it will comenext summer or the summer after the red man does not forget that he has suffered  let us hope by next summer the trouble will be forgotten came from james morris and that was all he could say  christmas found the post buried deeply in snow and hunting for the time being was out of the question the place was crowded and white trappers and indians often spent the night in the stable with the horses there was an active demand upon james morris supplies and he could have disposed of three times as many had he had them  strange as it may seem nothing more was heard from jacques valette and jean bevoir and the morrises often wondered what had become of them and of their companion hector bergerac they questioned the hunters both white and red but could get no information  they must have gone up to the lakes after all said james morris if it is so i am thankful for it  and so am i thankful added dave  as soon as the weather moderated the hunters and trappers sallied forth once more going up and down the ohio and many miles to the westward some of the indians used their guns as skillfully as the white men but when powder and ball were scarce they fell back upon their bows and arrows and it was astonishing what large game they secured  once during the winter dave went out with white buffalo on a hunt which lasted three days they took their bags full of provisions and the indian chief led the way across the ohio and into the depths of the forest which was entirely new to the youth  white buffalo knows the deer are plentiful here said the indian and so it proved for before noon they struck the trail of some of the animals and by nightfall had laid a large buck and his mate low then they took up the trail of some other animals and were equally successful  the evening of the second days hunt found the pair in the vicinity of an indian village called shilagum standing not far from where the muskingum river flowed into the ohio it was only a small place but noted among the shawanoes as the abode of a great medicine man named pakalokalla or medicineoftheclouds the medicine man was an old fellow with but one ear and an eye that drooped but he was looked to as being powerful and many of the indians refused to do much without consulting him  white buffalo was known in the village but being of a different tribe he received a cold welcome until he said he was willing to pay for accommodations for himself and his companion pointing at the same time to a small skin hanging over his shoulder at once the indians bustled about and made the squaws get the visitors something to eat and made them clean out a small wigwam where the pair might rest for the night  dave was suspicious about the wigwam and especially the old robes offered for bedding for he had had one unpleasant experience with red mens vermin as already related in this series but the wigwam and the robes proved fairly clean after all and he slept soundly until morning  when he came forth for his breakfast he was informed by white buffalo that a most important visitor had arrived at the village this was none other than pontiac the great chief of the ottawas who was accompanied by several companions including deer neck an underchief of the wyandots  having heard so much about pontiac dave was anxious to see him he spoke to white buffalo about the matter and the latter spoke to one of the head men of the village and a little later both were introduced to the man who a year and a half later was to head one of the greatest indian uprisings known to our history  at this time pontiac was between fortyfive and fifty years of age tall wellformed and with muscles of iron his hair was long his eyes black and penetrating and his general manner a commanding one where he had come from was rather uncertain although it was generally believed that his father had been either an ottawa a miami or a sac and his mother an ojibway  not only was pontiac the head of the ottawas but he was likewise a chief of the metais a powerful organization in the lake region the members of which were supposed to be master magicians to the metais the ignorant savages humbled themselves as they did to their greatest medicine man  of the early history of pontiac but little can be said it is doubted if he was a great hunter although he could use his bow and arrows and a gun with considerable skill it was as a leader that he shone best he had uncommon sagacity good reasoning powers and a manner of talking that was most persuasive more than this his spirit was such that once having undertaken a project he would do his best to carry it through no matter what the cost  what had brought him to this village dave did not learn nor did white buffalo for pontiac said but little so long as they remained at hand the great chief showed plainly that he wished to be alone with those he had sought out so white buffalo and the youth did not prolong their stay longer than was necessary  as they were about to leave pontiac strode forward and glanced sharply at dave  they tell me your father has opened a tradingpost on the ohio he said in his native tongue  dave did not understand but white buffalo quickly interpreted the speech  he has answered the youth  does he expect to stay there or move still further westward  he is going to stay  at this the great chief gave dave another close look then he turned away and said no more  what do you make of this white buffalo asked dave after they had left the indian village a goodly distance behind them  pontiac likes not the fact that daves father has settled down on the ohio was the slow answer pontiac wishes the english to keep close to the shores of the great waters  i must say he looks like a great chief said the youth thoughtfully  he is a great chief and his power is as widespreading as a great summer storm answered white buffalo the red men everywhere listen to him with all ears  do you suppose he came to see that medicine man  it may be sohe did not tell white buffalo but pontiac is a magicianhe can work wonders when he will so i have heard  dave did not believe this but said nothing on the point to his companion for he knew it would be useless to attempt to uproot so deepset a superstition  i sincerely hope pontiac does not try to make trouble for my father he went on  he will do nothing at presentthe time is not ripe the war hatchet is not dug up when the snow covers the ground  i know that but we want no trouble in the spring either  at this white buffalo shrugged his shoulders  who can tell what the moons to come will bring forth he said the sun comes up and man is alive it sets and the last rays fall upon his grave the great spirit of the happy hunting ground rules but the face of the great spirit is hidden from the eyes of the red man and the eyes of the white man as well     chapter xvii  the attack on the packtrain   with the coming of spring both james morris and dave looked eagerly for the time when henry and barringford should return to the tradingpost with many articles which were much needed and with what was better yet news from home  i can hardly wait for henry to get here said dave one day there is so much i want to know about  you must be patient dave returned his parent the trails are by no means good yet and it may be that they have not got started on the journey  the indians were now bringing in many beaver skins to exchange for blankets and powder but james morris had nothing to offer them many came from a great distance and were much disappointed so it was not long before the trader looked for the coming packtrain as anxiously as did dave  if they dont come soon ill lose what trade i have established he said they will take their skins and furs where they are sure of making an exchange  with the white hunters and trappers it was different all were willing to trust james morris and simply left their goods at the post to be paid for when the packtrain arrived it may be added here that barringford and henry had been told in secret to bring with them one hundred pounds about five hundred dollars in gold and silver money for not a few wanted cash for their pelts  in the meantime came news that jean bevoir and jacques valette had been seen among the indians on the upper muskingum river they had done a little trading with the indians in that neighborhood and had become very friendly with a young chief named flat nose and with some warriors under him who went by the name of the wanderers  did you ever hear of this flat nose asked dave of the frontiersman who had brought in the information  not i but jadwin has said the hunter he says he is as treacherous as they make em and so are all the wanderers under him they move from place to place taking whatever they can lay their hands on  then they will just suit a fellow like jean bevoir  i dont doubt but that you are right lad and theyll suit jacques valette too  what has become of hector bergerac do you know  i think he has cut company with bevoir and valette he was too honest for them i reckon  in the meantime matters between the english and the indians all over the colonies were going from bad to worse those in authority would not listen to such a man as sir william johnson who knew the red men thoroughly and such a wise statesman as benjamin franklin who believed in giving the indian his just due the war had cost a great deal and now it was decided to cut down expenses which meant that in the future the indians would get but few of the presents which in the past had been presented to them more than this english traders of all sorts were allowed to go among the red men and barter as they pleased and some of these literally robbed those who were too ignorant or simple of heart to trade intelligently  the coming of so many english traders made the french traders furious and as they saw their business slipping away from them they did all they could to get the english into hot water with the red men they told the indians that the english meant to take everything from them their lands their wigwams and their possessions including their squaws and childrento make slaves of the latterand that the red men must fight or be wiped out and they always added that if the indians would make war they the french would help them in every possible manner  this was but the empty talk of brutal and ignorant traders who had everything to gain and nothing to lose but the indians listened to them and at last concluded that it must be sothat the english meant to exterminate them they held long councils of war and at last determined to strike a blow at the first favorable opportunity pontiac spoke at many of these secret meetings in a manner that was truly eloquent of the cause he espoused  the indian must fight or he must become as a squaw and a slave said pontiac the english will press him to the bitter end they say they are our friends but they come as wolves in the night to take away our all you ask how are we to fight them for they are many we must use our cunning we must not let them think we are their enemies we must treat them as our best friends then when the time is ripe shall the blow be struck and no english man woman or child shall escape pontiac has spoken who is there to dispute what he has said  the discontent of the indians was strongest throughout virginia pennsylvania and new york the delawaresthose who would not listen to such chiefs as white buffalowere angered in the extreme and the shawanoes were likewise unsettled in new york state some simpleminded indians petitioned sir william johnson to have the english forts kicked out of the way as they expressed it this of course could not be done and the red men viewed the strengthening of the strongholds with increased suspicion some threats were made to destroy the fort at detroit but the time was not ripe for a wellplanned attack and nothing came of it  at last james morris could bear the waiting no longer and leaving dave and the frontiersman sanderson in charge of the tradingpost he set out with jadwin on horseback to see if he could learn anything about the packtrain that was expected  be very careful while i am gone he said to his son and dave promised to do his best  the route of mr morris and his companion lay through the burnover and along the trail previously followed good time was made for their steeds were fresh and by nightfall they had covered at least twentyfive miles they went into camp at a convenient spot on the bank of a purling brook where nothing came to disturb them while they slept hardly had they gone two miles in the morning however when they came upon a sight that filled them with alarm propped up against a tree was henry capless and with the blood streaming over his face from an ugly cut in the forehead  henry what does this mean demanded james morris  uncle james faltered the youth helphelp me  to be sure ill help you henry but what does it mean where are sam and the others and the horses  we were attackedsome indians and some white men came upon us at nightfall yesterday lampton and cass who were with us were shot down and sam was hit and so was i our indians fled into the forest for the enemy were four to one sam and i did what we could but we had to run in the darkness we became separatedand here i am  while henry was speaking his uncle was washing his wound for the youth had stopped near a brook and now the hurt was bound up with a bit of cloth which was always carried by the trader for just such emergencies henry was very weak and said he had wandered aimlessly about during the night trying to find the trail to the tradingpost it may be that sam is dead he said sadly i know he was struck twice by a rifle bullet and by an arrow which went into his shoulder lampton and cass i know are dead for i examined them conoseka one of the indians was hit in the left arm but he fled with the other redskins of our party  did you recognize any of those who attacked you  no for they were in the forest while we were in a little clearing the attack came without warning we were just building a campfire when two rifle shots rang out and lampton and cass fell then came a yell from the whites and the war cry from the indians and shots and arrows flew in all directions sam and i picked up our guns and i know sam hit one of the whites for i saw him throw up his hands and fall in some brushwood then one of the redskins went down and after that i was hit and went into a twist so i cant exactly tell what followed i heard sam yell to me to run or wed be killed and i picked up my gun and ran for the trees i hadnt gone very far when i tripped and fell and the gun got lost in a dark hollow i tried to find the gun but i couldnt and then i heard some indians coming after me and i ran on again until i found a small place between the rocks where i hid until about three hours ago then i started to look for the trail but i got dizzy and had to sit down where you found me  you havent seen any of your party since you ran away  not a soul the indians and sam ought to be somewhere near and the packtrain too for that matter  the rascals must have known the packtrain was coming said jadwin who had been through many fights on the frontier to my mind it looks like a wellplanned attack  that is true answered james morris the question is shall we go forward and investigate or return to the post and give the alarm  reckon you had better give the alarm those rascals may be plannin to attack the post too  i was thinking of that but i would like to know what has become of the packtrain and all of my belongings  then supposing you go ahead alone and take a look around while henry and i go to the post  this was quickly settled upon and a few minutes later james morris moved onward on horseback with his gun ready for use should the enemy put in an appearance     chapter xviii  after the encounter   less than an hour after leaving his nephew and jadwin james morris reached the spot where the fearful encounter of the evening before had occurred   the spectacle was one to make the heart of any onlooker turn sick and a shudder passed through the frame of the trader as he gazed at the scene of desolation before him  close to the burntout campfire rested the form of barnaby cass a wellknown resident of winchester who had followed barringford to the ohio district in an endeavor to better his fortunes a bullet had passed through his heart and he must have died ere his body struck the ground  a dozen paces away lay the corpse of the other white man oliver lampton well known through western pennsylvania as the trapper preacher because about half of his time was spent in hunting and trapping and the remainder in preaching temperance to the whites and red men who indulged in liquor to excess beside lampton lay one of the packhorses also dead and another packhorse lay a little further off suffering greatly from two broken legs to put this animal out of its misery james morris fired a shot into its brain  great confusion was on all sides for many of the packs had been broken open and rifled of their most valuable contents about half of the stuff had been left behind principally the goods of the greatest weight much that was breakable had been broken and some valuable blankets that could not be carried off had been slashed and cut with keen knives in a hasty endeavor to ruin them  the rascals muttered the trader if only we can get on their trail they shall pay dearly for their bloody work here  having surveyed the camp he moved around among the trees and brushwood in the vicinity he soon found the body of an indian who had belonged to the packtrain party and then another indian who looked to be an enemy the latter had his face painted in peculiar wavy streaks which the trader had seen twice before  the wanderers he muttered i half suspected it might be so this is the work of that rascal flat noseand if that is so he is moving northward with all speed to get away with his booty more than likely some french huntersha he broke off short for in the undergrowth he had caught sight of another form that of a white man leaning against a fallen tree with a gun clutched tightly in his stiffened hands  baptiste masson he muttered naming a rough french hunter and trapper who in years gone by had worked for jean bevoir as i thought it was a plot between the wanderers and the french they mean to drive me from the ohio if they possibly can masson eh can it be that jean bevoir and valette and bergerac were in it too more than likely  the frenchman was dead and james morris did not hesitate to take his gun and ammunition he also searched the fellows pockets but found nothing of value nor any clew which might lead to the identity of his companions in the outrage a further hunt through the forest revealed where something of a struggle had taken place between two white men on foot but both were gone and the trail was lost in an adjacent brook down which one had fled and the other had likely followed at least for a distance  the fact that he did not find the body of sam barringford gave james morris hope if the old frontiersman was not seriously wounded it was more than likely he was on the trail of those who had attacked the packtrain with a view to finding out where they were going or to ascertain exactly who was responsible for the affair  i know sam will do what he can he thought and with this small degree of comfort he loaded his steed with such things as he could carry and started on the return to the tradingpost  it was a hard journey and he did not reach the ohio until long after nightfall he found the post being guarded by five frontiersmen and eight indians who had been hastily called together as soon as henry and jadwin appeared  father cried dave joyfully as he ran to meet his parent i am glad you are back safe  has henry come  yes and i made him lie down he was so weak what an awful fight it must have been did you discover who did it  partly one of the dead redskins was a wanderer and a dead white man was that goodfornothing baptiste masson i have often mentioned to you  the fellow who traveled with jean bevoir  the same i am inclined to think that the attack was organized by flat nose of the wanderers and bevoir if youll remember jadwin said flat nose bevoir and valette were very friendly  what about sam  i couldnt find any trace of him although i looked around pretty well  sam carried fifty pounds of the money you sent for henry has the rest of it safe  i am glad of that but i wish i knew about sam he may have run himself into a regular hornets nest  nothing had happened to disturb those at the post itself and james morris lost no time in sending out two white men and two indians with horses to bring in what was left on the trail of his belongings  it was found that henry was not seriously wounded and after a good nights sleep the youth felt much better his mind was now clearer and he related all the particulars of the attack as far as he knew them  i should judge there must have been at least six white men and twenty indians he said  they ran from tree to tree and had us at a disadvantage from the very start i should have been shot dead if i hadnt got behind one of the horses the redskins set up a fearful din after the white men shot off their guns i was afraid every one of us would be killed and scalped  thank god that you escaped murmured james morris and dave breathed a silent amen the following day found james morris more impatient than ever to learn what had become of sam barringford he wanted to go on a search for the old frontiersman yet he did not deem it advisable to leave the tradingpost fearing that an attack might come during his absence  i will go out for you said jadwin id do most anything fer sam barringford we have hunted and fit injuns fer twentyfive years and more  and ill go with tony put in ira sanderson i think we can hit the trail if any white men can  the matter was talked over for fully an hour and dave took in what was said with deep interest  father let them go and let me go with them he said you know what i think of sam if he is in trouble i want to aid him if it can possibly be done  youll be safer here dave  perhaps but let me go wont you  dave continued to plead and in the end it was settled that he should accompany tony jadwin and ira sanderson on the scouting tour the three were to go on horseback and were to return inside of four or five days unless a turn of circumstances made it necessary to stay away longer  you take good care of yourself dave said henry who was sitting on a bench with his head bound up those indians are on the warpath and they mean business  well ill mean business too if i get a chance at them replied the youth with a short laugh  from henry it was learned that all at the morris homestead were well the twins were now able to walk and were very cute in spite of all that had been done to learn something of their parentage the mystery surrounding their identity was as thick as ever a few inquiries had been made concerning them but nobody had come forward to claim the pair  i reckon they are going to be sams twins after all said henry that is unless something has happened to sam if hes deadbut no i cant think that can you  i cannot answered dave soberly hes our best chum isnt he oh he must be alive he paused a moment but if he isnt i reckon well have to keep the twins for him  of course well have to keep the twins my but they are funny little chaps nell thinks the world of them and mother and rodney are just about as bad i think behind it all the folks would rather keep them than have somebody come and take them away concluded henry  preparations for the departure were soon complete and the party left the tradingpost in the morning long before the sun was up it had been decided that they should go straight to the spot where the attack had taken place and from that point do their best to learn what had become of sam barringford and of the men who had run away with the goods  remember my son to keep out of danger if you can possibly do so was james morris final warning i would rather lose my goods a dozen times over than have anything serious happen to you  ill do my best answered dave and a moment later he rode away little dreaming of the surprises in store for him     chapter xix  the trail through the forest   it can truthfully be said that at the time of which i write no hunter on the trail was more keeneyed among the whites than antonio jadwin who had been chosen as leader of the little expedition  tony jadwin as he was familiarly called was english by birth but had come to america while but a child of four his folks had settled on the frontier and both had been massacred in an uprising when the lad was less than sixteen tony had at once started in as a hunter and trapper on his own responsibility and from that day to the present time had managed to earn for himself a comfortable if not a luxurious living  he took to all sorts of shooting trapping and fishing as the proverbial duck takes to water and could follow a deer trail almost in the dark he had brought down all sorts of game and his left shoulder showed deep scars dating back to a fierce facetoface fight with a bear in which he had after a tough struggle come off victorious  having arrived at the scene of the attack jadwin took a close survey of the situation going over the ground far more observantly than had james morris nothing escaped his keen eyes and he quickly announced that henry had probably been right in his estimate of the number of the enemy he also pointed out barringfords footsteps and declared that the old frontiersman had most likely followed the others after the packtrain was overhauled and looted  it was nightfall by the time all these observations were made and the three decided to go into camp at a convenient spot not far away while dave prepared supper the others dug a large grave and into this the bodies of cass and lampton were placed and a stone was set up to mark the spot  jadwin would not allow all to sleep at once declaring that a watch was necessary ill stay awake a few hours and then call ira said he and then ira can call dave and so it was arranged  dave was tired by the hard journey and it was not long before he was sound asleep he did not awaken until four in the morning when sanderson aroused him  why didnt you call me before he cried leaping up i want to do my full share of duty while i am out with you  its all right lad answered the other im not very sleepy myself but a couple of hours wont do me any harm  a brook was close by and at this dave took a washing up which made him wideawake then he began to gather some sticks with which to start up a blaze in order to cook the morning meal  he had taken up half a dozen sticks when a sound not very far away caught his ears he was on the alert instantly thinking it might perhaps be some wild animal a dozen paces away was his gun and he dropped the firewood and caught up the weapon  hardly had he done so when he saw the form of a burly french hunter stealing through the forest toward the spot where the attack had been made on the packtrain fortunately the frenchman did not look toward dave so he and his companions and their steeds were not discovered  that fellow is up to no good that is certain thought the youth and lost no time in arousing his companions  a frenchman eh said jadwin moren likely one of the crowd come back to see if he cant take away what was left of the loot  making no noise they followed the frenchman who was dressed in the conventional garb of the hunters of the great lakes the newcomer moved forward swiftly and they had all they could do to keep up with him  the spot reached the frenchman gazed around with evident dismay probably he had expected to see what had been left of the packtrain still there  gone he muttered in his native tongue i have had my trip of thirty miles for nothing  after a careful look around he returned to the forest and set off at a quick pace in the direction from whence he had come  shall we leap upon him and make him a prisoner asked dave in a whisper  no replied jadwin shortly keep quiet  dave now understood what was in the trappers mind and kept still and in a moment more the frenchman was out of sight moving swiftly to the northwest  i will follow him on foot and blaze the trail with my hunting knife said jadwin to dave and sanderson you can come after me with the horses he will probably go straight to where the rest of the rascals are in camp  in a minute jadwin was off and the others were not slow to follow as before mentioned the trail led to the northwest through an unusually thick growth of sycamores and hemlocks fortunately the way was well defined being used by many wild beasts in their trips between the ohio and the great lakes  the french hunter and trapper was a rapid walker and tadwin did not catch sight of the fellow for two hours after starting on the trail then he located the man sitting on a slight knoll resting he at once halted and kept his position until the frenchman moved again when he followed as before  during the entire day the following was kept up in this fashion late in the afternoon the frenchman stopped to prepare himself a meal building a tiny fire between some stones for that purpose seeing this jadwin walked back a short distance and there met dave and sanderson who had followed his blazed trail without difficulty  hes a good walker was daves comment as the three partook of food themselves how much further do you think hell go tonight  at this query jadwin shrugged his shoulders tell you that dave after he goes to sleep he answered dryly  the horses were tethered and all three stole forward to take another look at the stranger to their surprise he had sunk back in some bushes beside his little fire and was fast asleep  he is not going very much further tonight whispered dave just listen to him snore  a consultation was held and dave was for stealing up while the man slept and seeing if his pockets contained anything which might lead to his identity jadwin and sanderson were willing and watched the young pioneer with deep interest as he moved slowly forward screening himself by the very bushes that served the sleeping man as bed and pillow  the frenchman slept soundly so the youth ran but a small risk of awakening him with great caution he searched one pocket after another finding a small amount of silver and several letters with these he returned to jadwin and sanderson and the three withdrew to look over the communications  tony jadwin could read a little french and in his labored manner he spelt out the two letters dave had captured by these they learned that the frenchman was named louis glotte and that he belonged at detroit the settlement taken from the french by the english after the fall of montreal both spoke of money to be made out of the english and were signed jean  that must mean jean bevoir cried dave this glotte must be another of bevoirs rascally companions  to be sure put in sanderson and bevoir must mean the attack that was made on the packtrain  i think he will rejoin bevoir by tomorrow sure said tony jadwin and then we may learn what has become of sam  while one or another remained on guard during the night the others slept dave it must be admitted was impatient to learn what had really become of his old frontier friend and it was some time before he could bring himself to slumber near at hand was an owl hooting weirdly through the night under ordinary circumstances they would have scared the bird away but now they did not dare for fear of arousing louis glottes suspicions  the sun was just coming up when sanderson called softly to the others hes moving said the hunter and in a few minutes jadwin took to the trail as before and the others came after with the horses  the way was now more difficult than ever and they had numerous small streams to cross then they came to a river and before jadwin could catch sight of the frenchman again the fellow was in a canoe and hurrying to the other side  now we are in a pickle truly declared dave how are we to get to the other side without a boat  wait until hes out of sight and i will show you answered jadwin  louis glotte soon disappeared among the bushes and then jadwin led the way to where a fallen tree lay tie up the horses he ordered and it was done next the tree trunk was pushed into the stream and all straddled it by means of rude paddles cut from tree boughs they ferried themselves to the opposite shore  wait i see something murmured dave after having gone through the bushes which lined the waters edge  so i do see something came from jadwin lay low until i investigate boys  dave and sanderson secreted themselves in the bushes and waited tony jadwin disappeared and it was the best part of half an hour before he returned  just as i thought he said the frenchmen and the indians have a village back there on the bank of a creek that flows into this river jean bevoir is there and also jacques valette and i rather think all the stolen goods are there also     chapter xx  guarding the tradingpost   did you see anything of sam barringford asked dave who was just then thinking more of his old friend than of his fathers belongings  i did not but i shouldnt be surprised if those frenchmen and redskins had some prisoners answered jadwin they have one wigwam that they are guarding closely if it doesnt contain prisoners it contains something of great value  for quarter of an hour the frontiersmen and dave talked over the situation but could not solve the problem of what was best to do next  to attack would be foolhardy even if we hid ourselves among the trees said sanderson theyd drive us from cover sooner or later and kill us  one of us might go back for help suggested the young pioneer  i was thinking of that but that would take time and your father couldnt spare enough men to make it worth while as near as i can make out there are six frenchmen in the camp and nineteen red men or twentyfive fighters in all the most we could muster up would be ten or a dozen that would be two to one  if they have any captives and especially sam barringford i wish we could release them  let us wait until nightfall suggested ira sanderson something may turn up  not far away was a slight rise of ground and behind some bushes on this they hid themselves from this quarter they could get a fair view of the village and note much of what was going on  they had scarcely settled themselves when they heard a shout and an indian who had been on guard came in with another indian who had just arrived on foot from a distance  it is an ottawa murmured jadwin one of the braves of pontiacs tribe  he evidently has news said dave i wish we knew what it was  jadwin decided to crawl to another spot and learn if he could overhear what was being said  this time he was gone the best part of an hour nor did he return until dave and sanderson saw the strange indian messenger depart  what did you learn asked the youth eagerly  a great deal answered jadwin hurriedly  we must get back to the tradingpost without delay  why  the indians are going to make an attack the miamis are up in arms pontiac has told them that if they do not destroy the forts and tradingposts the english will soon wipe them from the face of the earth  the old nick take pontiac ejaculated sanderson   id like to get on his trail and make him a prisoner put in dave  another thing sam barringford is bevoirs prisoner  are you certain  yes i heard bevoir speak of it to another frenchman he says he will make barringford suffer before he is done with him  oh the rascal burst out dave i wish  never mind lad i know how you feel but every moment is precious we must hasten to the post and prepare for the attack  yes yes come and dave himself led the way  not to excite the suspicions of either red men or white they did not use the canoe which was at hand but recrossed the stream on the tree trunk which had brought them over in the first place this done they cast the tree adrift and lost not a moment in mounting their steeds  tis a long long ride said jadwin but if the horses can make it without a nights rest so much the better for us and for all of the others  it proved a ride that dave morris never forgot all that day and through the night the three pressed on through the mighty forests and across the creeks and small rivers more than once a horse would stumble and almost throw his rider and the branches of the trees often cut them stinging blows across the faces and necks and hands once dave received a long scratch on the left cheek from which the blood flowed freely but he did not stop to bind up the wound nor did he complain  to save father and henry and the post such was the burden of his thought he remembered how that other post on the kinotah had been attacked should the new post fall he well knew that it would go hard with all who had stood to defend it  when at last the post was gained dave was more dead than alive chafed by his hard ride and almost exhausted he tumbled rather than leaped from the saddle it was the middle of the night and the coming of the three had provoked a small alarm so that all at the tradingpost came to learn what was in the air  jadwins story was soon told and dave and sanderson corroborated it without delay james morris called the whites and indians around him  there is news that the french and indians intend to attack this post he said loudly will you help me to save what is my own or must i surrender  at once there was a hubbub white buffalo was the first to step to the traders side  white buffalo will fight for his brother james said the indian chief simply and his braves will fight also and he motioned for the other indians to follow him  im for the post every time cried jadwin if i hadnt been i shouldnt have been in sech a hurry to get back  ditto myself put in sanderson  i reckon we air all with you drawled one of the trappers we want an english tradinpost hyer eh boys  thats the tune added another the only question is air we strong enough for em  got to be exclaimed sanderson emphatically ill fight em for all i know how muttered henry his rest had done him much good  the details of the defense were quickly arranged for james morris had often speculated upon just what to do in such a situation as was now at hand everything left outside of the palisade was brought in and then the gates were closed barred and reenforced by large rocks which lay handy this accomplished every gun and pistol in the post was examined cleaned and put into perfect order for use and powder and ball were dealt out liberally the indians also looked after their bows and arrows and hunting knives and tomahawks were not forgotten  by the time arrangements were all complete the sun was shining in the eastern sky hour after hour passed and no strangers put in an appearance  but they will come never fear said jadwin ive made no mistake  somebody coming now shouted james morris who was near the gate a moment later an indian came strolling along the bank of the river evidently he had expected to find the gate to the stockade wide open seeing it closed he hesitated for a moment  hoola hoola he shouted brown bear come to trade  where are your furs asked james morris mounting some steps so that he could see over the gate  furs in canoe on river answered brown bear his eyes were full of distrust and suspicion  you are one of the wanderers i believe said james morris you trade with the french not with the english  trade with english now said the red man doggedly  you cant trade here so pass on  no take furs from brown bear  no  make much cheap trade buffalo skin too an bear  bring them up till i see them  white man open gate  show me your buffalo and bear skins was all james morris would answer  with a grunt of disgust brown bear walked away and disappeared among the bushes  do you think he really has the furs asked henry i dont  no henry he came to report what we were doing he is a spy well see some more of them soon  illustration where are your furs asked james morris  mr morris was right half an hour later another indian accompanied by louis glotte came into view from over the hill  open the gate want to trade cried the indian  vat for you close ze gate meester morris asked glotte smoothly no fighting now no and he laughed shortly  no i dont reckon there will be any fighting answered the trader but if it comes i am ready for it the indian cant come in but you can if you wish and he threw a ladder over the gate keeping hold of the top  not knowing what a trap he was walking into louis glotte spoke to the indian in his native tongue and then mounted the ladder as soon as the frenchman was inside of the stockade james morris returned the ladder to its original position  dont you come too near he shouted to the indian and waved him away  ill keep an eye on him never fear said sanderson who was at one of the portholes  what want you of me demanded glotte as he gazed around at the armed english and indians in dismay  i want to talk to you replied james morris come into the cabin with me  more suspicious than ever the frenchman followed into the building slowly dave came after and so did jadwin  now glotte you can consider yourself a prisoner said james morris shortly place your gun on that table and your pistol also     chapter xxi  sam barringford brings news   louis glotte understood the true situation at last and the cold sweat stood out on his forehead james morris had a pistol in his hand and the frenchman saw that all of the others were also armed  so i am your prisonair he said slowly for vat tell me zat  you know well enough put in dave  as james morris pistol came up the frenchmans gun was placed on the rough table and his pistol followed glotte might have showed fight but he saw that such a course would be worse than useless he had walked into a neat trap and with his eyes wide open  louis glotte said james morris sternly i want you to tell me the truth do you hear if you do not tell me the plain truth you shall suffer  vat ees it you vant  who organized the attack on my packtrain  i know nothing of zat  stop you do know and you must tell me  the frenchman grew pale and something like a shiver passed over him he saw that james morris was in no mood for trifling  whowho say zat louis glotte know bout dat he asked stammeringly  i say so you were there for one  no no ii vas far away  tell me who organized the attack  ii cannot  you can  no no iiistop do not shoot me i vill tell eet vas jean bevoir  i thought as much was jacques valette with him  oui but say not i tell you or za vill keel me  and hector bergerac  the frenchman shook his head not bergerac no he ees gone avay  who were the others  after considerable hesitation louis glotte named them over then james morris questioned him concerning the wanderers and learned that they had been headed by their chief flat nose the other red men he knew little about but he said they were a dirty irresponsible tribe willing to do almost anything for the sake of getting provisions or rum  they think ze packtrain carry much rum said glotte verra mad when za found out not so  in the end he told practically all he knew being assured that he would not be harmed if he made a full confession jean bevoir and flat nose had led the attack in which four of their party had been killed or wounded what had been taken away was removed under the directions of bevoir and taken to an indian village many miles away as he expressed it he said the red men were about a hundred and fifty strong and had made sam barringford a prisoner of course he knew nothing of the visit of dave jadwin and sanderson to the place nor did james morris enlighten him  the trader then insisted upon knowing if an attack upon the tradingpost was contemplated and glotte at last confessed that such was a fact the man was a thorough coward at heart and willing to do almost anything in order to save his own life  we shall have to make you a prisoner for the present said james morris and without ceremony glottes hands were bound behind him and he was tied to a strong post used for hitching purposes  the indian who had come up with the frenchman had retreated to the forest and for the time being not a human form was to be seen anywhere outside of the palisade but the english did not relax their vigilance  perhaps theyll wait until night to begin the attack said henry the redskins love to fight under cover of darknesswe know that too well  or else the report that the gate is closed and the place guarded will dishearten them returned his cousin  hour after hour went by and night came on a stricter watch than ever was kept but as before neither indian or frenchman showed himself more than this the night birds and owls uttered their cries as usual mingled with the bark of a fox and the mournful howling of several wolves all of which told that the vicinity was most likely entirely free from human beings  they wanted to catch us unawares and they have discovered their mistake said one frontiersman and such was probably the case for the whole of the night and the following morning passed without further alarm  some of those at the post were now impatient to go out and follow up the enemy but others demurred stating that their numbers were too small  if those wretches are in hiding theyd wipe us out in no time said sanderson better stay where we are for the present  nevertheless james morris and tony jadwin went out on a short scouting expedition along the river and then for a few hundred feet into the forest they advanced with great caution taking care not to expose themselves in the open and carrying their guns ready for use should any of the enemy show themselves  we cannot afford to take many chances said james morris as they moved forward our force at the post is too small  wish we had a company of royal americans here to knock em out said jadwin  three hours were spent on the scouting tour and both of the men were on the point of turning back to the fort satisfied that the frenchmen and indians had indeed given up the proposed attack when they heard the sound of rapid footsteps and a man burst into view running with all his might and main  halt cried james morris who at the first sound had raised his musket while jadwin did the same  dont shoot came back in the wellknown voice of sam barringford  sam cried the trader lowering his weapon what does this mean  it means im most out o breath with runnin gasped the old frontiersman but git to the postthe french and indians air acomin  sam barringford had come up close to the others and now without more words all three headed for the post it was easy to discern that the old frontiersman was wellnigh exhausted and he was glad enough to take hold of james morris shoulder on one side and tony jadwins on the other  been a prisoner of them skunks fire burn em he explained ill tell ye all about it later have ye heard o henry an the others  yes henry is safe and so are most of the others cass and lampton are dead we were afraid you had been killed too until louis glotte told us you were a prisoner and then james morris told of the manner in which dave jadwin and sanderson had followed up the trail  glad ye got glotte a prisoner said barringford he is most as mean a skunk as jean bevoir  they now came in view of the post and were quickly admitted by those on guard  sam barringford cried dave and henry in a breath and ran up to greet their old friend  after he had been fed and allowed to rest a bit barringford told his story in detail he said he had followed jean bevoir and the others to the river near which the indian village was located a stray indian dog had exposed his hiding place and after a desperate fight in which one indian had been killed and he himself had been cut in the shoulder with a tomahawk they had succeeded in making him a prisoner he had been put into the wigwam already mentioned with his hands bound behind him and to a stake driven deeply into the soil he knew of the message sent in by pontiac and added that numerous other attacks were to be made on forts and settlements throughout the west  but how did you get away asked dave  easier nor i expected was the old frontiersmans answer as soon as it was settled the post should be attacked there was some confusion and the guard left the wigwam i yanked and pulled with all my might and at last the stake came out of the ground then i rolled to the back of the wigwam and slipped under the skins to some bushes as soon as i was that far i got on my feet and legged it for all i knew how i ran along the river for about a mile because i didnt know how to get across with my hands tied at last i got the rawhides loose and slipped em and then i came over at a shallow spot where i didnt have to swim but a few yards i ran as fast as i could for i didnt know how soon the attack would start  something has gone wrong or they would be here by this time put in sanderson  glotte viewed the coming of sam barringford with great astonishment how you geet avay he asked  that is my business glotte answered the old frontiersman i reckon you thought i couldnt do it eh and he chuckled to himself  zat fellow ees a sharp one was the frenchmans comment he ees like ze flea to slip avay oui  throughout the remainder of the night the guard remained as watchful as ever but it was labor lost for neither french nor indians showed themselves  at daybreak white buffalo said he would go out on another scouting tour taking with him two of his braves they moved off by the way of the river bank and then made a large semicircle returning to the post from a diametrically opposite direction  wanderers and bad frenchmen all gone announced the chief on coming back they came but did not fight  do you mean to say that they have been here cried james morris  white buffalo nodded several times five canoes come down the river land by the four big trees the trail is in the mud and the wet grassso many frenchmenhe held up five fingersand so many indiansholding up both hands twice and then four fingers a total of twentyfour  where did they go to asked henry  go into the woods and stand two walk around to the hillone canoe land on other side of river and indians go up past the postthen come back then all gone once more afraid to fight the frenchmen and the wanderers are cowards and the face of the delaware showed his deep disdain  it must be true put in sanderson they most likely met the indian who came here first and then the fellow with glotte and both told em it would be of no usethat we were too strong for them  well if they are gone i hope they dont come back again said dave and a number standing around echoed the sentiment     chapter xxii  the rock by the river   the indians did not return and in fortyeight hours the scare was over and the hunters and trappers sallied forth from the tradingpost as before confident that sanderson had been rightthat the enemy had thought the little garrison too strong for them  but this was a mistake jean bevoir and flat nose had been eager for the fight but word had come in at the last moment that the attack must be put off and such was the power of pontiac and other great chiefs of that vicinity that flat nose obeyed as it was impossible for the handful of frenchmen under bevoir to do anything alone the whole scheme fell through and then bevoir lost no time in getting back to where he had left the loot from the packtrain claiming that which had been allotted to him and his men and getting away further to the northwestward where he felt tolerably safe from pursuit  how far the conspiracy to fall upon the english on the frontier in the summer of 1762 was concocted by pontiac will perhaps never be known some historians have contended that he was responsible for it in its entirety while others have told us that the real pontiac conspiracy was confined to the awful uprising which took place just one year later but be that as it may it is undoubtedly true that pontiac hated the english intensely and that it galled him exceedingly to see them pushing further and further to the north and the west his own lands around the great lakes were being invaded and when his tribe went to the english for redress they got but scant attention  the summer of 1762 proved to be one of anxiety and uncertainty for all on or near the frontier to the northward the iroquois or mingoes as they were commonly called were held in check by sir william johnson but in western new york and western pennsylvania the wyandots the shawanoes and certain tribes of the delawares did what they could to harass the pioneers burning cabins and sheds at night stealing crops and cattle and occasionally murdering men women and children or carrying the latter off into captivity there were no battles but the pioneers and frontiersmen retaliated and as winter came on the feeling of bitterness increased no one felt safe and all wondered what new outrage would happen next  the delawares have been mentioned as taking part in these evil doings and as white buffalo and his followers were delawares it is but right that their standing should be explained in years gone by the delawares had been a mighty tribe numbering over a hundred villages of importance but internal strife had done its work and now the villages were widely scattered so that delawares could be found from virginia in the south to the great lakes in the north and as far west as the mississippi those who remained near the eastern coast generally sided with the english while the others either strove to remain neutral or threw in their fortunes with the french  it must not be supposed that james morris allowed matters to rest after it became known that no attack would be made upon the tradingpost he wished to recover the stolen goods and also the fifty pounds which had been taken from sam barringford by jean bevoir at the time the old frontiersman was a prisoner at the wanderers village  an expedition was organized consisting of the trader and seven whites and indians and they remained out the best part of a week hunting for the wanderers and for bevoir and his companions but the wanderers had moved and bevoir had likewise disappeared and the trail was lost at the river bank  i suppose i can say goodby to both money and goods said james morris soberly i declare its too bad  ill try to make it right with ye about the money said barringford  no sam i dont want you to do that you did your best and its not your fault that the money is gone nor the goods either but id give a few pounds to get hold of bevoir and his crowd  as the days went by it was decided by james morris not to send to the east for more goods until late in the fall the goods to be brought to the tradingpost early in the spring louis glotte was allowed his liberty and immediately disappeared  both dave and henry were very anxious to go out on a regular hunt with barringford and this was arranged for several weeks after it became positively known that all hostile whites and red men had left the neighborhood of the tradingpost the hunting tour was to last a week or ten days and the young pioneers made their preparations accordingly  sam we must get a buffalo this trip said henry nothing less will satisfy me  easier said nor done lad answered the old frontiersman the hunters an trappers have scart em putty far to the westward howsomeever we can try our best to lay one low  i want to get a bear said dave  all were feeling in fine spirits when the start was made and james morris came out of the post to see them off all were on horseback for barringford had said that a buffalo hunt was generally in the open where riding was fairly good  now dont you get into any more trouble were mr morris parting words weve had trouble enough to last us a lifetime  well do our best to steer clear of it answered his son  the evening of the first day found them in a territory that was entirely new to both dave and henry although barringford had been over the ground several times only some small game had been seen not worth powder and shot as the old frontiersman put it and they made their evening meal from some fish which henry managed to catch while barringford was preparing the fish both of the young pioneers took a swim in the river where the water was cool and refreshing  this is something like cried dave as he splashed around  youre right there answered henry only i dont want any more wildcats tumbling down on my head from the trees he continued referring to an adventure which has already been told in marching on niagara  i dont believe there are any wildcats around here henry the place seems utterly deserted i reckon well have to travel a day longer before we strike game the old hunters have been over the ground too thoroughly  its not half as bad as it will be when more settlers come here  that is true  the young pioneers felt in fine spirits and as barringford was slow in getting the evening meal prepared henry proposed a swimming match  ill race you to yonder big rock and back he cried pointing to a round stone resting on the opposite bank under a thick overhanging tree the best piece of fish in the pan to the one who wins  done returned dave are you ready to start  yes but wait let us call sam and he can start us and he yelled to the old frontiersman  want to race eh said barringford all right if ye aint too tired after sech a ride as weve had all ready then go it both on ye go  away they went side by side each cutting the clear water with a firm broad stroke for both could swim well  its goin to be nip an tuck i reckon went on barringford as interested as if the youths were matched for a heavy purse i must say i dont know who to shout for do your best both on ye now dave that wont do  for dave had fallen behind a few strokes but henry could not keep the speed at which he had started and slowly but surely his cousin reached his side once more and then went a foot and more ahead  henry this wont do sang out the old frontiersman dont you let dave git the best on ye strike out an make it a tie  thus encouraged and laughing to himself henry put on another spurt and while dave was still four yards from the big rock came up alongside as before  now ye have it roared barringford keep the pace both on ye the feller to lose gits walloped an the winner gits the kings cross an a purse of a thousand pounds tech the rock fair an squar or ill call the race off and barringford slapped his thigh in high glee to see such a contest took him back to his boyhood days and he half wished he was in the race himself  both reached the rock at precisely the same time and rested heavily on it for a second so that barringford might see that it was really and truly teched as he expressed it it was somewhat over their heads and in the water at their feet they could feel the sprawling roots of the tree behind it  then exactly how it happened would be hard to tell but without warning the great rock suddenly slipped from the river bank and went into the water with a loud splash carrying the two swimmers down under it  barringford saw the catastrophe and for the instant he stood spellbound it was as if the light of day had suddenly given way to the darkness of night both of his young friends were gone carried to the bottom by that huge rock which had seemed such a safe point for the turn in the race  the old frontiersman waited a few secondsto him they seemed an eternityand then as neither henry nor dave reappeared he plunged hastily into the river and swam in their direction with all his might and main he was a good swimmer and now desperation lent strength to his muscles  he was in midstream when he saw a head bob up and an instant later he recognized henry the youth was panting for breath  henry he called out henry whar is dave  iidont know came with a gulp and a gasp that rock waswas almost the dedeath of me  dave must be under it groaned the old frontiersman we must help him or hell be drowned  yes yes henry tried to catch his breath oh sam what shall we do  he tried to look down into the water but the falling of the rock had dislodged a quantity of dirt also and what had before been so clear was now muddy so that little or nothing could be seen excepting the top of the stone which now lay about six inches below the surface  cant you see him at all queried barringford after a painful pause  i cant see anything oh this is awful  dive an take a look ordered the old frontiersman and taking as good a breath as his condition would allow henry went down to catch hold of the sprawling roots with his hands and try his best to locate the body of his cousin but the muddy water made his eyes smart and seeing was practically out of the question more than this the great rock was slowly sliding outward to the deeper part of the stream so he had to watch out for fear of being caught once more  didnt see him asked barringford as he came closer  no its too rily  ill go down myself  barringford was as good as his word and went down without an effort his watersoaked clothing aiding him to sink he caught hold of the rock and the roots and strained his eyes in all directions then the rock began to move once more and he had to get out of the way just as henry had done  im afraid its all up with the poor lad he said when he could speak if hes down there hes drowned by this time  dont let us give up sam pleaded henry and started to go down once more when the rock turned completely over and a long tree root flew up close to the surface of the stream  there he is shouted barringford and swam forward he was right the tree root had brought up the body of dave and the young pioneer lay before them his eyes closed and nothing giving any indication that he was still alive both swam to it and in a second more they had it in their arms and were making for the shore with their burden     chapter xxiii  dave and the fawn   sam do you think he will live  over and over henry asked the question as he and the old frontiersman worked over the inanimate form they had brought to shore from the waters of the river  hope so henry but i cant tell yet was barringfords answer well do all we can and trust the rest to god  both worked with a will doing whatever they thought was best barringford held dave up by the ankles and allowed much of the water to run from the unfortunates mouth and then they rolled the youth and worked his arms and rubbed him  at first it looked as if all their efforts would be in vain and tears gathered in henrys eyes but then they saw dave give a faint shudder followed by a tiny gasp  hes comin around shouted barringford in a strangely unnatural voice praise heaven for it  but there was still much to do before dave could breath with any kind of regularity and they continued to rub him and slap him while barringford forced him to gulp down a small quantity of stimulants brought along in case of emergency then a fire was started up and later on henry brought over the youths clothes for to take dave across the stream was out of the question  for over an hour dave felt so weak that neither of the others attempted to question him both helped him into his clothes and gave him something hot to drink and made him comfortable on a couch of twigs and leaves  i thought my time had come when i went under he said when he could talk the rock pinned me down between the treeroots and if it hadnt been for the roots i suppose i should have been crushed to death i held my breath as long as i could and then i gulped in some water and lost my senses  it was truly a narrow escape was barringfords comment i didnt expect no sech accident when i let ye go into the swimmin match  did you go under henry  yes but i soon got myself loose was the reply i was almost scared stiff when you didnt come up dave after this well have to be more careful than ever  it was wuss nor thet wildcat i reckon came from barringford  i should say so returned henry promptly it almost makes me vow never to go in swimming again  as dave continued to feel weak it was decided to remain where they were all of the next day henry procured a log and some brushwood and on these ferried over their things and he likewise tied up the horses so that they might not stray away  by morning dave felt more like himself and he would have gone ahead on the hunt but barringford would not permit it  we have plenty of time said the old frontiersman you jest lay around in the sun an youll feel better for it  well then you and henry can go out insisted dave there is no reason why you should suck your thumbs waiting for me  at this the others demurred but about noon having had a lunch barringford and henry set out promising to return before sundown they had not expected to hunt on this side of the river but now they were there the old frontiersman said they might see what they could stir up  the camp had been pitched behind some bushes that fringed the river bank close at hand was a clump of trees and back of these was the edge of the mighty forest yet unspoiled by the ax of the pioneer not far from the camp was a small brook where the water rushed over a series of sharp rocks making a murmur pleasing to hear  having straightened out the camp dave took barringfords advice and lay down in the warm sunshine to rest the little work that he had done had tired him more than he was willing to admit and having closed his eyes to do some thinking he quickly fell into a sound slumber which lasted for several hours  when he awoke all was still around him and he rubbed his eyes wondering what had aroused him then he caught sight of a tiny squirrel sitting bolt upright at the foot of the nearest tree gazing curiously at him  hullo you little rascal said dave goodnaturedly so you ran across me did you what kind of an animal did you take me for  the squirrel continued to gaze at him but at his first movement to arise the frisky animal gave a swish of his brush and was gone up the tree in a twinkling  dont believe in making friends thats sure went on the young pioneer as he stretched himself heighho but i must have slept pretty soundly and for three hours at least well it was as good a way as any to put in the time  the sunshine had made dave thirsty and presently he walked to the brook to get a drink as he was in no hurry he took his time and consequently made little or no noise  he had parted some low bushes and was just looking for some favorable spot at which to bend down when something caused him to look up the brook there to his astonishment and delight he beheld a beautiful fawn standing in several inches of water watching some birds which circled close by  oh what a shot was daves thought and as quietly as a mouse he fell back out of sight and then ran to where he had left his gun the weapon was ready for use and soon he was at the brook once more  there was no breeze blowing and the only sound that broke the stillness was the rushing of the little watercourse and the songs of half a dozen birds in the vicinity the fawn was still there but seemed to be on the point of running away why dave could not tell  not to let such a chance to bag tender meat escape him the young pioneer took hasty aim and fired the bullet sped true and with a convulsive leap into the air the fawn fell into the shallow brook dead  while the smoke was still pouring from his gunbarrel dave caught sight of a larger deer previously hidden from view by some brushwood scarcely had he laid the fawn low when another gunshot rang out and this deer also went down kicking convulsively  hullo sam and henry must be near he thought and ran forward to make certain that the second animal should not get away at the same time he set up a shout so that neither of the others might fire on him by mistake  but the second shot bad been almost as true as the first and by the time he came up the large deer was breathing its last  hullo he shouted we must have spotted these deer at exactly the same time  no answer came back to this call and now dave looked around with surprise if henry and barringford were near why did they not show themselves  its mighty queer he muttered to himself if theyhullo hector bergerac  dave was right and an instant later the french hunter and trapper stepped into the opening he gazed around sharply to see if the young pioneer had any companions with him his clothing was almost in tatters and his general manner showed that he had been having a hard time of it  are you alone morris was his first question  perhaps i had better ask you that question came just as quickly from the young pioneer  yes i am alone was the answer i was making my way to your fathers tradingpost when i saw the deer and shot it  and i shot the fawn what were you going to do at the tradingpost  i wish to talk to your father on matters of business  did jean bevoir send you  at the mention of bevoir hector bergeracs face grew dark and took on a look full of bitterness  no he did not send me i came of my own accord i was a fool to go with him in the first place and that is why i wish to see your father  did you have anything to do with the looting of the packtrain  no no i am not a robber of the road like bevoir and valette they wanted me to go into the thing but i refused then we quarreled and i went my own way but after that jean bevoir made me a prisonerhe and flat nosethinking i was going to tell upon them i was a prisoner until yesterday when i managed to get away taking this gun with me for twentyfour hours i have tasted nothing but one little bird and i am half starved  you say you want to see my father went on dave after a pause may i ask what you wish of him  i want to tell him of some plans bevoir and flat nose have made they wish to make trouble  are they near here  no they are going away for the present but they will be back either in the winter or the spring  hector bergerac was willing enough to go into the camp with dave and between them they dragged the fawn and the large deer to the spot the fire was started up and some venison set to broiling and of this the frenchman partook liberally proving that he was indeed half starved  you cannot be alone he ventured while eating where are your companions  they are off on a hunt but will soon be here answered dave and half an hour later barringford and henry put in an appearance they were doubly astonished first upon seeing bergerac and then upon seeing the game their own luck had not been very good and they only had a few birds and a beaver to their credit  they listened with interest to what bergerac had to tell and when the frenchman had warmed up he related the full particulars of how bevoir valette and flat nose had concocted the plan to loot the morris packtrain corroborating glottes story in all details he said that all the frenchmen with bevoir knew that it was nothing but an act of thievery but that some of the indians had looked upon it merely as the beginning of the new uprising against the english an uprising which he considered had been started by pontiac and those under the great chief  i am no longer for war he concluded i wish only for peace and i am sorry that i did not remain in the st lawrence territory the war has cost me all that i possessed it was not much but it was enough now i must start over again  if you will do what is square my father will be glad to deal with you and he will pay you all your skins are worth returned dave but you must not play him false  he can trust me take my word upon it said hector bergerac i have thought it over and i feel certain that french rule in this country is at an end england is too strong for us to fight longer would be like striking ones head against a stone wall  which shows that you have some sense put in barringford i must say im sick o war too let us all go to huntin i say an make money if the french an the english would unite wed have nothin to fear from the redskins  but they will not unite it is not in their nature but if they will only keep the peace it will help greatly concluded bergerac  he was worn out from traveling and glad enough to remain with the others over night he dressed his deer and said he would take the skin to the tradingpost and also such a part of the meat as he could readily carry  he probably means to turn over a new leaf said henry after bergerac had departed i hope he does  he seemed to be mighty anxious to see your uncle put in barringford  well if he can save uncle james from serious trouble i hope he does it  what a scoundrel jean bevoir is put in dave wouldnt you think that after all his upsettings he would be content to rest and do what was right  some men are born that way lad said the old frontiersman its in their nature he wont stop bein bad until hes killed or dies a natural death no two ways ont  i think jacques valette must be about as bad  more n likelyblackbirds generally flock together but i dont reckon that valette is the schemer bevoir ishe dont keep sober enough  ive often wondered if it wasnt bevoir who robbed valette that time ventured dave i think hed be equal to it  like as notor else valette dropped his money on the trail an never knew it     chapter xxiv  something about slaves and indian captives   two days later found the young hunters and barringford about forty miles further to the northwest of the tradingpost at one of the most beautiful spots it is possible to imagine  to the westward was a small stream running silently through a wide stretch of prairie land the banks covered with bushes and plants to the eastward was the edge of the mighty forest a few giant trees standing out picturesquely in the foreground under the trees lay the sprawling roots covered in spots with light and dark green moss as soft to tread upon as the richest velvet carpet at one side of the camp was a small series of rocks and from them gushed forth a spring of cold water running over the rocks and into the tall grass out of sight  the weather had remained perfect and the last twentyfour hours had been productive of sport not to be despised they had found a beaver dam and taken twelve beavers and had also laid low two deer and a cougar or panther the lastnamed animal had been found asleep by barringford and a single bullet had dispatched it almost before the beast awakened  thets what i call deadeasy huntin barringford remarked when the panther was found to be dead no fight nor nuthin  you wont often surprise the game like that replied henry  the two young pioneers had surveyed the panther with interest the fur even at this season of the year was fairly good and they had assisted barringford in dressing it and it now hung on a branch of the nearest tree  what a farm one could have here declared dave as his eye roved over the stretch of prairie not a single tree to cut down or stump to burn or drag out  and just look at the soil came from henry as black and rich as any i ever saw a fellow could raise anything he wished without half trying  it is certainly beautiful ground put in barringford who sat in the shade smoking a red clay pipe with a reed stem an some day youll see a plantation here true enough  how well the indians could live if they would only till this soil continued dave but you cant get them to raise anything but a little maize and tobacco  they are naturalborn huntersjust like i am said henry with a short laugh  sam shall we find that buffalo weve been talking about  the old frontiersman blew a long stream of smoke from his mouth ere replying will it rain afore sunday dave he drawled  what has that got to do with it  nuthin only you know as much about thet as i do about the buffalo ef he comes this way well git him an if he dont why we wont git him thets all and the old frontiersman continued his enjoyment of the pipe  you said buffaloes like such prairie ground as this declared henry  so they do so they do but most of the buffaloes thet war here air goneeither killed or lit out to the westward ye see went on the old hunter buffaloes air like elkthey need lots o elbowroom ive been told thet a young buffalo will travel fifty miles an think nuthin of it  i dont think i want to try running down a young one then answered henry ill try an old one that cant travel over three or four miles and this caused a general laugh  they had spent the entire morning on the edge of the prairie keeping somewhat out of sight so as not to disturb any game that might appear all had enjoyed an unusually hearty dinner and were quite content to take it easy during the middle of the day a faint breeze was blowing which was exceedingly pleasant for the morning had been a trifle warm  i wonder what the folks are doing just now mused henry  i think i can tell you answered dave your father and rodney are getting ready to go back to the field to work your mother is clearing off the table and little nell is playing with the twins perhaps they are wondering what we are doing at the tradingpost too  them twins is what gits me came from barringford its mighty funny i cant find out who they belong to aint it  it is in one way sam but you must remember that many women and children have been lost in the last five or six years this war has been simply awful in that respect the indians dont think anything of carrying them off into captivity  well why should they when you come to think of it came from henry  oh henry  now hold on dave let me reason it out for you the whites hold hundreds of black slaves dont they  yes  well to an indian it is no worse for a red man to hold a white person as a captive than it is for a white man to own a slave its a poor rule that wont work both ways  the blacks are naturally slavesaint good fer nuthin else put in barringford who had some oldfashioned ideas on the subject  i dont believe that sam came from dave some black people are wiser than you think if they had the chance to rise theyd do it  i heard tell that some men believe in freeing the blacks came from henry  some on em dont want to be free said the old frontiersman jest look at the slaves belongin to old lord fairfax and to the dinwiddies and to the washingtons why they all think it is an honor to belong to them families they wouldnt go if ye druv em away  yes i know for i have talked to some of em myself said dave the washington blacks are particularly faithful if they were set free i dont suppose theyd know what to do with themselves  theyd starve said barringford  but to come back to where we started from went on dave there is a difference between being a white mans slave and being an indian captive the whites dont kill their slaves or torture them  they torture some of em replied henry ive seen a negro whipped till it made my blood boil of course the majority of em are treated fairly good  a darkey who has a good home on the plantation has nuthin to complain on said barringford his master feeds him clothes him and takes care of him when hes sick in nine cases out of ten hes better off nor he would be if he had to shift fer himself  i shouldnt wonder if we had trouble some day over this slave question came from henry if they bring too many over the slaves may rise up some day and try to wipe the whites out  dont you fear for thet henry they aint equal to it nohow  but if they join with the injuns  theyll never do thet nuther an you know it a good darky aint got no opinion at all o a redskinthey hate em wuss nor pison  how long the fruitless discussion might have lasted there is no telling but during a brief pause henry chanced to glance across the prairie and uttered an exclamation  something is moving yonder what is it  barringford leaped to his feet and gave a long earnest look  buffaloes he said laconically two on em  can we catch them queried dave  we can try lad but keep under cover they seem to be coming this way  all three hurried back to the foremost trees in the forest carrying their guns as they did so luckily the campfire had died out so there was no smoke to alarm the animals further in the forest the horses were tethered having had their fill of grass two hours before  better see if the horses are ready for use henry said barringford we may have to do some tall riding for our game  i will answered henry and ran back without loss of time the three steeds were quickly saddled and then the young hunter brought them forward in a bunch still however keeping them out of sight of the prairie  it was now seen that the buffaloes were indeed moving in the direction of the camp the two that had at first appeared were followed by eight or ten others who kept in a bunch several rods behind the leaders  oh what a chance for big game whispered dave if only we had two or three guns apiece  never mind we have our pistols came from henry theyll count for something at close quarters  whatever you do dont all fire at once cautioned barringford one bullet may not be enough for one of the buffaloes ill fire first and if he dont fall then henry can fire and then dave  anxiously they waited for the big game to come within gun shot the buffaloes moved slowly and to dave it appeared an age before even half the distance was covered  oh pshaw they are turning to the northward cried henry a few minutes later  wait they may turn this way again said barringford but they were disappointed the buffaloes continued to move in a direction that was parallel to the edge of the forest  well lose them unless we ride after them said dave and a minute later all were in the saddle leaving their camping outfit behind them  they kept well in among the trees riding as hard as possible until half a mile was covered then barringford slipped to the ground and crawled forward to the open  we are gaining on em he announced another ride like thet an we can go after em on the prairie  once more they urged their steeds forward the way was full of rocks and dangerous treeroots but the horses were growing used to such traveling and rarely made a misstep twice they crossed little creeks which flowed into the larger stream beyond then without warning they reached a portion of the forest so thick with young trees that further progress in that direction was impossible  nothing left but to take to the open and ride like the wind announced the old frontiersman are ye ready lads  yes came from both  then follow me  barringford turned his horse toward the open prairie and the others came close behind him away they went at what to an ordinary observer would have seemed a breakneck speed the little ride through the forest had warmed up the horses and the rest of the morning had put them in fine condition for a good run on they sped as if they enjoyed it fully as much as did their riders  dont make any noise came from barringford the nearer we get without bein discovered the better  at least a third of the distance toward the buffaloes was covered when suddenly the herd stopped short they had heard the dull thud of the horses hoofs and now looked around to see what the sound meant then came a wild snorting and throwing of shaggy heads and away went the herd due west and making the best speed of which their sturdy limbs were capable  they have found us out shouted barringford now to catch emor miss em  i dont intend to miss em came warmly from henry but i think you ought to give me the first shot if i get nearest to em  all right henry so be it  no more was said for with the pace such a hot one nobody cared to waste breath in conversation far ahead the buffaloes were running as gamely as ever being spread out somewhat in a semicircle with the leader a heavy old fellow with an extra shaggy head a little in advance  slowly but surely henry gained on both of his companions his steed was the best of the three and if henry was a naturalborn hunter and trapper he was likewise a good horseman bending low over the horses neck he spoke words of encouragement to which the animal responded to the best of his ability  thus mile after mile was covered and still the buffaloes kept on as before they were now coming to a locality where the prairie was broken up into little hummocks with here and there gopher holes that were exceedingly dangerous  at last all three of the hunters saw one of the buffaloes go down one leg had gone into a gopher hole and become broken and although the animal arose and tried to run it was soon overtaken by henry  finish him off dave yelled back the young hunter im going to see if i cant run down another and he kept on as before  dave heard the cry he could not make out what was said but he understood and riding up close to the hurt buffalo he let the animal have a bullet directly in the head it was a fair shot and with a lurch the beast staggered a few feet and then fell with a heavy thud on the prairie  good for you dave cried barringford that makes number one now let us finish him and see if we can run down some more on em     chapter xxv  the results of a buffalo hunt   the brief stop made by dave and barringford had allowed henry to increase his lead until now he was almost out of sight of those behind him the prairie was growing rougher and soon the buffaloes reached a small creek bordered in spots with trees and brushwood into the creek they plunged boldly and scrambled up the opposite bank henry came after them and now another level stretch of prairie was encountered at least a mile across and several times that in length  the buffaloes were gradually turning to the northward once more and by keeping straight for them henry cut off much of the distance he would otherwise have been compelled to cover he soon saw that they had changed their course because of a river they were afraid to swim for it was shallow and the mud on the bottom was sticky and treacherous  they certainly know what they are doing thought the young hunter go along buzzy we must catch them somehow  buzzy heard the words and leaped forward in a fresh effort as he did this henry looked behind him and was surprised to learn that both dave and barringford were nowhere in sight  can they have given up the chase he asked himself it was possible but not at all probable perhaps they had more trouble with that fallen buffalo than they expected he thought  at last henry saw that the animals ahead of him were beginning to slacken their speed the leader still kept on with three or four others but the rest were dropping further and further behind one in particular quite a big beast too lagged more than any of them and henry soon spotted this for his own  ill have you yet old fellow he told himself and looked to see if the priming of his gun was still as it should be  once more the buffaloes made a turn to the westward following the bank of the river just mentioned the beast henry had picked out was a dozen or more rods to the rear and this distance was increasing rapidly evidently his wind had given out suddenly he stopped short whirled around and made straight for the young hunter  henry was not taken greatly by surprise and had been on the lookout for such a trick as the buffalo came closer he pulled the hammer of his gun to his chagrin the weapon refused to go off acting exactly as it had done when he was after the big elk  what luck he muttered and then had to pull his horse to one side the animal was now nervous and in a twinkling it balked and sent henry flying headlong to the ground then without waiting to note what was happening the horse set off on a run whence it had come  to face an angry buffalo had been bad enough while on horseback but on foot it was doubly perilous for the instant after he picked himself up henry knew not what to do then in sheer desperation he raised his rifle once more and pulled the trigger as before  the weapon now spoke up and the bullet hit the bison for such the american buffalo really is fairly and squarely between the eyes down went the beast as if struck with a heavy club but the skull was thick and the shot was by no means fatal  as soon as the gun was empty henry retreated he knew better than to use his pistol until it became absolutely necessary to do so with all possible speed he reloaded the larger weapon  the young hunter was just fixing the priming and looking to the flint when the bison came up with a snort and charged as before there was blood trickling down his face and he presented a truly ferocious sight henry waited until the beast was but a few paces away then aimed for the right eye once more and fired  this time both gun and aim did not disappoint him the bullet passed into the very brain of the buffalo and he pitched over with a thud that could be heard for a long distance once or twice he pawed the prairie grass but that was all  henry did not examine his prize at once a glance convinced him that he had nothing more to fear in that direction and then he looked for the other buffaloes all were out of sight he reloaded his gun and then began to search for his horse  to his chagrin the steed was also among the missing nor could he catch sight of the animal anywhere try his best then he looked for dave and barringford they had not come up and where they were there was no telling  he was alone on the broad prairie with the dead buffalo more than this the chase had occupied considerable time and he saw with some alarm that both night and a storm were coming up already in the west dark clouds were beginning to crawl up toward the orb of day in a few minutes more the sun was obscured and the bright stretches of the prairie took on a somber tone  well im certainly in a pickle he thought i wonder where that horse went to and how long it will be before dave and sam come up  had there been a tree handy henry would have mounted it to take observations but not even a hillock was near and he had to content himself with remaining on the level using his eyes to the utmost  if they dont come soon i suppose ill have to spend the night here he mused that wont be very pleasant especially if any wolves happen to be around  hoping every minute that dave and barringford would appear henry examined the dead buffalo the prize was a big one and it must be admitted that the young hunter was much elated as he surveyed it  for a first buffalo im sure that isnt so bad he thought the folks at home will be surprised when they hear about it  swiftly the storm came closer and presently the scattering drops of rain came down followed by a steady shower with nothing to protect him he was soon wet to the skin  knowing there was scant danger of a prairie fire during a storm henry took out his huntingknife and cut up a small portion of the buffalo then he dug out the dry grass from under the game lit his tinderbox and started up a fire feeding it both with grass and with some buffalo fat the latter made quite a heavy smoke and he hoped that this would attract the attention of the others  but when fully an hour had gone by henry grew both hungry and uneasy something serious must have happened he mused they wouldnt leave me like this  he set up a yell using the utmost power of his strong lungs for that purpose only the patter of the rain answered him  crouching over the tiny fire he cooked himself a bit of the buffalo meat and ate it then he walked over to the river and procured a drink on every side he could see nothing but the prairie with the stream running through it like a huge serpent close to the waters edge were a few bushes and some of these he pulled up with ease with which to replenish the fire  to tell the truth henry felt very lonely often had he been out in the forest at night but the present experience was new to him had there been some rocks at hand or a single tree he might have made himself feel at home but this immense stretch of flat land watersoaked and becoming fast wrapped in the darkness of night was truly depressing  give me the woods every time for an outing he said to himself but now i am here i reckon ive got to make the best of it  returning to the river he pulled up what was left of the bushes these he did not put on the fire but propped up against the broad back of the buffalo forming a little shelter into which he crawled in an endeavor to protect himself from the rain night was now on him and he felt certain that he would have to remain in the spot until morning  one thing is certain ill never forget this buffalo hunt he murmured as he turned in its not proving as much fun as i thought it would be  for a good two hours henry crouched in the little shelter trying his best to go to sleep the rain continued to come down but fortunately it was not cold so he suffered but little discomfort on that account at last his head fell forward on his breast and he became oblivious to all around him  towards one oclock in the morning the rain ceased and a brisk wind came up from the southwest as the stars began to show themselves the wind carried to the keen nostrils of several wolves the scent of the buffalo carcass the wolves were hungry and with little yelps of satisfaction they trotted off toward where the game lay  it did not take the beasts long to get within a dozen yards of the dead buffalo several were about to leap forward to plunge their fangs into the cut flesh when they made the discovery that a human being was present at once a howling of dismay arose on the night air  the howl awoke henry with a start for the moment he could not imagine what had awakened him but with the true instinct of the hunter he reached for his gun and also felt to see if his hunting knife was where it should be  wolves he told himself and set up a sudden yell at the sound of his voice the beasts retreated into the darkness and began to yelp violently they were much disappointed for they had expected to have a rare feast on the big carcass lying before them  ill have to stir up that fire thats certain thought the young hunter and he made haste to use his tinderbox but grass and bushes were too wet to ignite and in a few minutes he had to give up the idea  in the meantime the wolves had ranged themselves in a semicircle before him continuing to howl as dismally as ever one especially large beast came a little forward showing his fangs viciously  get back there cried henry and the leader of the wolves retreated for the moment but then he came closer than ever and the others followed  picking up one of the bushes henry threw it at the pack and all set up a wild yelping away they sped into the darkness and he fancied they were gone but this did not last they came back howling with additional loudness and drew closer and closer until it looked as if the largest would certainly leap for the young hunters throat  henry waited no longer but raising his musket fired at the leader of the wolves with a snarl the beast sprang into the air and whirled over and over in his death agonies the struggle carried him further away from where henry stood and without loss of time the youth reloaded his weapon so that he might be prepared for another attack  the sudden fall of the leader disconcerted the other wolves for the time being and it was fully five minutes before they came forward as before henry half expected them to eat the dead wolf but they did not touch the body  reckon they mean business thought the young hunter setting his teeth hard they want either the buffalo or me and they shant have eitherif i can help it  he yelled once more at the beasts but this time they merely halted showing that the sound of his voice did not alarm them as it had previously done then like a flash one leaped for henrys throat  crack went the rifle again and this wolf also fell shot through the throat the wound was serious but not fatal and with gleaming teeth and eyes that blazed with fury the beast gathered himself for another spring on he came but henry knew enough to leap to one side not wishing to use his pistol excepting as a last resort he drew his huntingknife and watching his chance plunged it into the wolfs shoulder down went the beast and a second stroke of the blade finished the creature  scarcely was the second wolf down when all the others appeared to come forward in a bunch bang went henrys pistol and a third wolf was struck in the breast then the youth caught up a bush and whirled it into the beasts faces but some got behind him and one snapped at his huntingshirt and another at his leather leggings it looked as if in another minute he would be down and killed     chapter xxvi  strange indian magic   well where in the world can henry have ridden to  it was dave who asked the question he sat on his horse peering forth in all directions through the storm and the oncoming darkness beside him was barringford equally anxious to learn what had become of their companion  killing the first buffalo had not proved easy and they had spent more time over the game than they had anticipated but a bullet from daves pistol had finished the big creature and then the pair had looked around for henry to find that he had vanished  a hunt had followed in first one direction and then another as the storm came up daves horse was unfortunate enough to run into a mud reach close to the river and it proved no light task to save the steed from being drowned  with the coming of night barringford had proposed that they go into camp but dave was too worried to do this and urged that the search be continued  for all we know those buffaloes may have turned and charged on henry he said i shant rest until i know the truth  if they turned an charged im afeered its all up with henry returned the old frontiersman a mad buffalo can make short work o a hunter hes wuss nor a mad bull  they moved off slowly after this in something of a semicircle occasionally one or the other would raise a yell but to these cries no answer was returned  might as well give it up dave onless ye want to ride around all night said barringford at last  he had hardly spoken when dave drew up his horse  hark sam what is that  the old frontiersman listened attentively for several minutes  wolves onless i miss my guess he replied presently  they appear to be heading toward us  no they are off in that direction dave barringford pointed with his hand they are after something  not our buffalo meat i hope  no they are heading the other way its something else  let us follow they may be after another buffalo or after henry  that is so  on they went once more soon they could no longer hear the wolves and drew up in perplexity while they were consulting together they heard a distant gun shot  somebuddy is afirin on em ejaculated barringford perhaps its henry come and he set off at a gallop with dave beside him as they rode on they heard another gun shot and a moment later the report of a pistol  it must be henry and if so he is having a fearful fight with the wolves cried dave oh sam we must help him  i see him shouted barringford and in less than half a minute later he was blazing away at the wolves dave also fired his gun and his pistol and four wolves were put out of the fight in almost the time it takes to tell of the deed  save me came faintly from henry save me  i will answered barringford and leaped from his horse huntingknife in hand the blade was plunged deeply into a wolf that had henry by the left arm dave used his musket as a club and another of the beasts was sent staggering back with a broken jaw  what few remained of the beasts were scared by the new arrivals and now they made off at top speed it was high time for henry had suffered much and as soon as the living wolves had disappeared he plunged forward and fainted in barringfords arms  he has had a lough time of it poor fellow murmured the old frontiersman if we hadnt a come up as we did he would have been done for  is he seriously hurt questioned dave anxiously  dont think he is dave its his wind as has given out  barringford was right and it was not long before henry revived his arm was slightly pierced in three places and on his left leg were two long irregular scratches these were washed and bound up by dave and during the time consumed barringford managed to start up a tiny fire in spite of the dampness  where in the world have you been asked henry i watched and watched for you  and weve been hunting for you until we were about ready to give it up answered his cousin the wolves put us on the track  sitting around the fire which barringford coaxed into a respectable blaze each party told what had happened since the separation  reckon as how youve had your fill o buffalo huntin jest for the present said barringford when the narratives were concluded buffaloes an wolves is a terribul bad combination  where is your game questioned henry  about two mile from here i reckon  perhaps the wolves will be after that  cant help it if they air lad dave wanted to look for you an wouldnt stay by the game nohow cant blame him nuther seein as we came up jest in the nick o time added the old frontiersman  all thoughts of sleep were now out of the question and the three sat around the tiny campfire discussing the situation with the first streak of dawn barringford set to work skinning the buffalo and dave assisted  while they were thus occupied henry saw a familiar form advancing slowly over the prairie he set up a call and in a few minutes his horse came up on a trot to mingle with the other horses  you rascal to leave me in the lurch cried henry but he did not strike the steed but patted him instead be thankful that he has come back said barringford sometimes a frightened critter like thet runs off an never shows himself again after the buffalo had been skinned the best portions of the meat were cut out and rolled in the hide which was strapped to the back of barringfords saddle the wolves were left where they had fallen sooner or later them other wolves will come back said the old frontiersman an theyll eat wots left of the buffalo an the wolves carcasses too it was fully an hour before they reached the spot where the other buffalo had fallen no wild beasts had been near the carcass and now this was also dressed and the hide packed up behind dave then they set off for the camp on the edge of the prairie reaching it shortly after noon i declare the spot seems like home cried dave i must say i am glad to return to it all were equally happy and lost no time in preparing a regular meal which tasted far better than the makeshift they had indulged in early in the morning hunting was declared to be at an end for the time being and for the rest of that day and all of the next the three took it easy  my bear hasnt shown himself said dave but i reckon i can do without him  the rest of the hunting tour passed without anything out of the ordinary happening many small animals were brought in by both dave and henry and barringford varied the sport by laying low a wildcat that came one night to rob them of some of the meat  when the start for the tradingpost was begun they found their steeds loaded down with the trophies of the chase consequently progress was slow and it took one day longer than they had expected to reach the ohio  back again i see cried james morris cheerily and safe and sound too i am glad to see it  weve had a powerfully good trip answered barringford two buffalo an no end o small game  that is certainly fine boys i reckon you are proud of the haul  we are answered dave promptly and henry nodded have you seen anything of hector bergerac he continued  yes he is here now he has told me his story and told me all about jean bevoir jacques valette and that redskin they call flat nose hector bergerac wants to cut the whole crowd and i am going to help him to do it  the weather had threatened a change and inside of a week after dave and his companions returned to the tradingpost there was a heavy frost and two days later a touch of ice  i think winter is coming now said james morris and if anybody is going to start for home hell have to do it soon  i shouldnt mind taking the trip answered dave it seems an age since i saw uncle joe and the others  the matter was talked over for several days and it was finally agreed that dave should go eastward this time in company with barringford and white buffalo and his braves henry would remain with his uncle and so would the others at the tradingpost only a few horses were to be taken along and in the spring dave and barringford were to purchase ten additional steeds and bring along a wellguarded packtrain containing goods to the value of eight hundred pounds the tradingpost was now doing well and it looked as if sooner or later the morrises would make a small fortune out of it  the departure was made in a keen frosty air which was as clear as it was invigorating henry and daves father accompanied those who were going as far as the burnover on the kinotah and then watched them out of sight around a bend of the trail  it looks a bit familiar to me now said dave to barringford as they rode along under the big trees  i suppose in a few years more there will be a regular road here just as there now is from fort pitt eastward  like as not lad onless the redskins upset everything again  they have been very quiet lately  yes dave but thet may be the calm afore a storm as sailor men call it i dont believe in trustin a quiet injun  white buffalo is good enough when he is quiet answered the youth with a merry glance at the chief mentioned who was riding a short distance to the rear  true but a few good injuns dont make a basketful answered barringford using a form of speech he had heard once when down east  the weather proved fine until fort pitt was gained here the party put up for two days the commandant of the stronghold being glad to meet those who might bring news  all is quiet here said the officer there was something of a plan to attack us during the summer but it fell through why i dont exactly know i think the indians are waiting for the french to help them  will they do that asked dave  i dont think so the french are having their hands full in the old country  when the party left fort pitt the sky was overcast and that night came a light fall of snow they had been told that there had been a landslide on the route and that they had better take another trail one leading around to the northward  this trail bring party to indian village of ninalicmic announced white buffalo  are they much of a tribe asked dave  only a handful but my white brothers must beware of the ninalicmics they are of the magicians and do great wonders  they are a branch of the magicians who live up near the lakes put in barringford ive heard of them but i thought they had cleared out long ago  when they came close to the village they heard a strange beating of indian tomtoms and a loud shouting and clapping of hands  some kind of dance going on said barringford reckon as how ill go in advance and see if its safe to break in on em  let me go with you said dave  the others were halted and dave barringford and white buffalo went forward on foot keeping themselves out of sight behind a row of bushes and a series of low rocks  before them was a fairsized glade in the midst of which was located the indian village consisting of a dozen or more wigwams all of good dimensions and each gaudily painted with many signs and symbols in front of several of the wigwams were erected posts on which hung strips of feathers and other strips of bears claws and wampum belts that were new to daves eyes  in the center of the village was a cleared space and here a bright campfire was burning on each side sat several indians all smeared with various colored paints and greases other red men were dancing around the fire keeping time to the tomtoms and chanting in a low monotonous tone  big medicine men and magicians said white buffalo make much magic  dave looked at his old indian friend and saw to his astonishment that white buffalo was ill at ease if not actually nervous had he been alone it is likely that he would have turned on his heel and hurried away  what be they asaying demanded barringford after listening to the chant i never heard sech gibberish in my life afore  much magic answered white buffalo magic make the indians strong to fight their white enemies  oh so thats it eh do they believe in it white buffalo  magic is magic returned the old chief simply  does it mean digging up the war hatchet  white buffalo cannot tell for he is not in their secrets but if the hatchet should be dug upha  white buffalo stopped short for the flap of one of the wigwams had opened and a tall indian had stepped outside the red man was naked to the waist and painted with rings and blotches of several colors on his head he carried something of a crown of black feathers with brass ornaments dangling over each ear as he came out those around the fire set up a yell of welcome  who is it questioned dave in a whisper  pontiac the great chief of the ottawas answered white buffalo and then he added hastily as pontiac threw up his arms and swept them around in a circle let us go let us not stay it is not safe pontiac will make great magic let us go ere it is too late     chapter xxvii  the trail of pontiac   the fright of such a brave chief as white buffalo may seem strange to my young readers but it must be remembered that among the indians the art of magic was considered the blackest art of all and a magician was looked upon as something far out of the ordinary the art was somewhat similar to that of the voodoos of the south and the fakirs of india and a real magician was looked up to and obeyed where a common medicine man would be ignored  it is said upon fairly good authority that pontiac belonged to the magicians of the great lakes this has already been mentioned but nothing has been said of how he practiced the black art much that was recorded has been lost so some things can only be surmised but his doings had a strong hold on all who came in contact with him making his friends stick to him closer than ever and causing many of his enemies to drop their antagonism and sue for peace  dont you get afraid of him white buffalo whispered barringford his magic is all humbug  no no it is true insisted the indian chief he caught dave by the hand come if dave is caught watching he will surely lose his life  i shall stay if sam stays said the youth well take good care that we are not discovered  you can go back to the others went on barringford but at this white buffalo demurred and in the end remained to see the weird performance  the dance of the magicians lasted fully a quarter of an hour then came a low chant and a conference followed strange strings of beads were exchanged and finally pontiac made an address in an indian dialect of which neither barringford nor dave could understand a word  white buffalo listened to the address with keen interest his first fright over he was now fairly calm and when pontiac stopped and prepared to leave the village he pulled the others back to a place of safety  pontiac will go away alone he said white buffalo follow on the trail want his brothers dave and sam to come too  why asked the others in a breath  learn much maybe do the english great good pontiac is like a fox in wisdom if the spell of magic is broken pontiac may fall as falls the mighty tree of the forest before the hurricane  i must say i dont quite follow ye buffalo came from barringford where is pontiac going  to the woods where the waters fall in the sunshine white buffalo thinks he knows the spot but he is not sure  why should we follow him  white buffalo cannot explain there is much magic perhaps the coming of night will clear the mystery  both dave and barringford were much perplexed never before had white buffalo acted in this manner and it was easy to see that he was laboring under great excitement  we may as well do what white buffalo says came from dave after he had talked to the old frontiersman in private well only lose a day or two by the operation and we are in no particular hurry to reach wills creek  very well lad ill go ye ont was the answer we may learn something of great importance to the english authorities  white buffalo had by this time joined those of his tribe who were with him his speech to his followers was as peculiar in its effects as had been the mysterious incantations of the magicians upon himself two voted to follow pontiac while the others said they would not do so under any circumstances the squaws can return to the tradingpost said the chief and thus were the others dismissed a short while after this all were on the trail of pontiac who contrary to expectations had taken with him a young brave known by the extraordinary name of footinhismouth a wyandot famous for his accuracy at shooting footinhismouth had often won prizes at target shooting both among the indians and the french and he was called one of the best hunters in the ohio valley both pontiac and his escort were on horseback and they rode so swiftly along the forest trail that the others had all they could do to keep close to them white buffalo led and never once did he allow those he was following to suspect his presence whenever they slowed up so did he and instead of passing over an open space he invariably rode around it keeping his steed in the shelter of the trees and brushwood if he is simply going to his home on the detroit river well have our ride for nothing observed dave after six or eight miles had been covered  oh something is in the wind you may be sure of that returned barringford the question is what is it  it was growing dark when pontiac and his companion came to the side of a fairsized brook rushing swiftly over some rough rocks they passed up this brook for a distance of several hundred feet and then took to the other side here there was a burnt spot covering half an acre and dave and the others noted the remains of a cabin  somebuddy lived here once an was wiped out remarked the old frontiersman laconically cant tell who did it  the falling of waters could now be plainly heard and before long pontiac and footinhismouth reached a beautiful waterfall fifteen or eighteen feet in height the fall was narrow and was lined upon either side with rugged rocks overgrown with mosses and trailing vines at the foot of the waterfall was a circular pool of great depth  pontiac and his companion came to a halt and dismounting tied their horses to trees near by at once those who were following did the same and all crawled forward with extreme caution to learn what would next take place  for several minutes pontiac stood talking earnestly to footinhismouth and pointing to the waterfall then both climbed the rocks at the side of the fall until they could touch the water with their hands  something is up now thats certain whispered dave  the words had just been uttered when a curious thing happened with a quick movement pontiac stepped through the waterfall and disappeared from sight  well i never murmured dave where did he go to  hush murmured barringford look  footinhismouth was gazing fixedly at the waterfall he hesitated for fully a minute then watching his chance he dove into the waterfall as pontiac had done and also disappeared  white buffalo looked at his white companions gravely do my white brothers know what that means he asked  i think i do answered barringford there must be a cave back there and the opening to it is through the waterfall  but how would they be able to find such a cave questioned dave  in two ways lad there may be some other opening and they may have discovered this opening when the waterfall had run dry  it must be a cave came from white buffalo and if it is it is the cave pontiac told about at the village of ninalicmic  what did he say about it  pontiac told of planting guns in the ground he said they would grow and the indians could one day pluck them and use them  planting guns i dont understand  its an amazement truly put in barringford we wont know what it means until  until what sam do you feel like following into the cave  i shouldnt mind if i knew the directions pontiac gave to that other redskin but without them directions a feller might lose his life easy enough in the attempt he might have told him to turn to the left or the right or somethin like that you know  true enough well what do you advise  the matter was talked over with white buffalo and it was decided to remain where they were until pontiac and footinhismouth returned for their horses  they are bound to do thet sooner or later said barringford by the way they tethered em i reckon they expect to come back shortly  an hour passed and dave was growing tired of the watch when white buffalo who lay beside him gave his sleeve a quick jerk and nodded toward the waterfall as the young hunter looked in the direction he saw a sudden movement and pontiac emerged on the rocks dripping wet an instant later footinhismouth followed and both climbed down to the side of the pool  they have been on some sort o a mission whispered barringford wonder whats next  untying their horses pontiac and his companion turned them up the slope leading to the stream above the waterfall here the pair consulted for some time what was said neither white buffalo nor those with him could make out but soon pontiac rode off in one direction and footinhismouth in another  shall we follow pontiac further questioned dave for my own part id rather stay here and find out what this cave if such it is contains  tis the cave of the magicians answered white buffalo my white brothers must be careful how they enter it  i am not afraid of magic white buffalo but of course i want to know what i am doing  we can examine the place in the dark as well as the daylight came from barringford its queer pontiac and his friend didnt take torches with em  there may be torches inside  perhaps but if i go in ill take my own torch  so will i sam and a good big one too  again there was a consultation and at last it was agreed that barringford should attempt to enter the cave first if he succeeded and the way was an easy one dave was to follow and lastly white buffalo the other indians would remain on guard  tucking a good bit of torch wood in his leathern belt barringford climbed up to the footing pontiac had first occupied he examined the waterfall with care and also looked at the pool below  dont think ill git more n a dirty tumble if i fail to git in he said to dave here goes  he made a leap and passed through the falling sheet of water before him with his heart almost in his throat dave watched and waited he was still doing this when suddenly barringford came to view again  its easy boys he chuckled jest like walkin down a pair o big stone steps jump about six feet an youll be all right  again he passed through the waterfall and now dave and white buffalo lost no time in following the opening beyond was two feet wide and high enough for a man to stand upright the flooring led downward several steps and then turned to the left where the passageway spread out into an irregular cave of uncertain dimensions and various heights  that was certainly easy enough remarked dave while barringford was busy lighting the tinder in his box i declare i only got the water on my head and shoulders with a good big hood a fellow could keep as dry as a bone  with some difficulty the tinder was lit and the torch followed swinging it around barringford soon had a good blaze and then he held the torch aloft that they might look around them  their first view of the interior of the cave was a disappointment close at hand were nothing but bare rocks covered here and there with rude writing in the indian language a little further on were some heaps of bones probably those of wild animals but whether killed for the meat or not they could not tell  not much wuth seein so far remarked the old frontiersman as he gave his torch another swing let us move on  be careful the walking may be treacherous came from white buffalo and the warning came none too soon for a short distance further on was an opening in the flooring a yard wide and of great depth they leaped it with ease but had one fallen into it there is no telling what would have happened  beyond this the passageway narrowed for a short distance here some of the rocks were wet showing that there was a small stream or a pool of water overhead the flooring was exceedingly rough so that they had to move slowly and make sure of one footing ere they tried another  i wonder how long the indians have known of this cave said dave  white buffalo hear of strange cave many years ago came from the indian chief hear much when colonel washington and general braddock fight the french and the indians under pontiac  then is it a fact that pontiac fought against us at that time asked dave  white buffalo has heard so pontiac is a great warrior  hullo suddenly cried barringford who was a few feet in advance were coming to something interesting now  what is it asked dave eagerly  look fer yourself lad  they had gained a portion of the cave that was almost circular in form in the center was an immense black stone on this rested a large pile of tobacco and several pipes and beside these were strings of beads and wampum and curiously shaped shells and spears there were likewise some strings of feathers and a dozen or more pairs of curiously worked moccasins there were also a number of medals evidently of english design and workmanship  army medals cried dave picking one up why sam these must have been stolen from our soldiers  taken from our dead heroes most likely answered the old frontiersman its a curious collection aint it dave  cave of the big council said white buffalo pointing to the wampum strings and belts much magic here  these are undoubtedly medals belonging to english soldiers and royal americans said dave they should be restored to their owners or else to the government  i agree with ye there lad answered barringford an when we leave we can take em along     chapter xxviii  an underground storehouse   to the indians as some of my young readers must know many wampum belts were speech belts usually given as a present when some great message was delivered consequently white buffalo looked the belts over with great interest certain that they were connected with matters of great importance  pontiac is as powerful as white buffalo supposed said he presently  dave and barringford did not reply for they had pushed on to another chamber of the cave here was an additional sight that made both cry out with wonder  didnt expect nuthin like this did you dave queried barringford  not in the least answered the young hunter  the chamber was not very large but it was literally filled with rifles and pistols of various sizes and makes some still bright and others much rusted from water and dampness to the collection were added several swords one with a scabbard and the others without there were also a large number of powder horns and bullet pouches and other soldier equipments  where did all this stuff come from went on dave it looks like part of an army outfit  thets jest wot it is lad  and it must have belonged to our army  right agin  if pontiac was in command of the indians at the time of general braddocks defeat do you suppose he had some of the red men bring this stuff here  thats a question either the stuff came from thet place or else from some other battle later on one thing is sartin theres a fairly good quantity on it and it ought to be restored  what had we best dotell the commander at fort pitt  i reckon thet would be the proper thing to do dave  i suppose pontiac thinks to use these guns some day went on the young pioneer he wanted to hide them until the time came to dig up the hatchet once more  white buffalos brother must be right came from the indian chief in a war the guns would give the indians much power  maybe pontiac told the indians he would make guns and swords by magic said dave suddenly  it is not impossible returned white buffalo gravely the magicians have brought forth powder by magic  and so can pontiac shouted barringford who had moved to one corner of the chamber reckon this is a bad place fer a torch and he held back the flame  what have you discovered now sam  five halfkegs o powder  as he spoke the old frontiersman pointed to a rocky shelf whereon rested the five halfkegs covered with a piece of heavy drugget often used in colonial days in place of rubber cloth  full too said dave after lifting one sam this stuff is worth a good bit of money  perhaps well git a reward if we return it to the government was the answer  it ought to be returned whether we get a reward or not  exactly as i think  there was a narrow passageway behind the chamber and sam barringford squeezed into this  dont reckon i can make it he panted presently seems like i was a leetle too hefty dave do you want to try it might be an opening to the outside world an if there is we wont have to go through thet water agin  taking the torch dave pushed into the opening which gradually grew smaller and smaller until he had to crawl on his hands and knees  tight fit eh called the old frontiersman after him  yes but it may be larger further on answered the young pioneer as he continued to advance   fortunately the passageway was dry so he had nothing to fear from water he progressed fully fifty feet when he saw a large opening beyond  im coming to another room he shouted back  but a sharp stone over a foot high barred his further progress the stone appeared to be rather loose and he fancied he could push it out ahead of him laying down the torch he caught hold of the stone and soon had it turned from its resting place  what are you doing called barringford  getting a stone out of my way  you jest be careful how you loosen up these stones returned the old frontiersman quickly the dirt dont seem to be none too hard an  whatever else sam barringford said was lost upon dave for at that moment down came a quantity of dirt on the young pioneer which almost buried him he attempted to back out the way he had come but just as he was about to move more dirt fell in that direction followed by half a dozen large stones then to avoid being completely caught he pushed on ahead and by tight squeezing forced his way into the chamber beyond  the fall of stones and dirt was as dismaying as it was perilous looking into the passageway torch in hand dave saw that it was now completely choked to get out by the way he had come was impossible he was virtually entombed alive  a shiver went over him and he called to sam barringford with all the power of his youthful lungs to his intense dismay no answer came back showing that the fall of dirt and stones had been greater than anticipated  theyll surely try to dig me out he thought but it may take a whole day and in the meantime   he did not finish but his heart sank within him he examined the passageway once more and shouted as before he fancied he heard an answer but was not certain  looking about him the young pioneer saw that he was in a cavern not over twenty feet square beyond was a tall split in the rocks which seemed to run upwards  that may lead to daylight he thought anyway i might as well try it as stay here  his torch was now burning so low he could no longer hold it he looked around for something else with which to continue the light but nothing was at hand he rested the torch on a rock and a few minutes later it fluttered up and went out leaving him in total darkness  it was a truly horrible situation and daves heart sank like a lump of lead in his bosom for the time being all hope of escape appeared to be cut off he shouted again and again but could get no reply  of course theyll do their best to dig me out he reasoned but they have no tools and the passageway was very small anyway if the rocks are wedged in all the power they can bring to bear wont budge them  he felt around the chamber and soon found himself at the split in the rocks he entered it for a distance of a few yards and then came back to the point from which he had started  it would be foolish to go into that in the dark he thought i might fall into some ugly hole or have worse luck ill stay here and see what comes  he sat down and gave himself up to his reflections they were rather bitter he now realized how tired he was and not long after this sank into merciful slumber  when dave awoke all was still dark around him how long he had slept he could not tell but he knew it must have been for some time for he felt wonderfully refreshed getting up he stretched himself and his eyes roved around the chamber  a single streak of light caught his eye coming from the split he had failed to examine he approached the split once more and saw that the light was stronger a short distance beyond so strong in fact that he could see the surface of the rocks and dirt  it must be morning and that must lead to the outer world he told himself can it be possible i have spent the whole night down here  the dampness had made him stiff in the joints but to this he paid no attention his one thought was to reach the top of the earth again feeling his way with care he entered the split in the rocks and slowly climbed from one projection to another the rocks came to an end amid the roots of a large tree and in a few minutes more dave was pulling himself up among the roots and into the open air  the glorious sunshine struck full in his face as he emerged to find himself on something of a sweeping hill dotted here and there with trees and brushwood his heart gave a leap for joy inwardly he thanked god for his safe deliverance from perils underground  now to find my way back to the waterfall and let sam and white buffalo know that i am safe he told himself but first i had better mark this spot so that i can find it again  with his hunting knife he started to make a blaze upon the tree it was easily done and he turned around to make certain of the locality  then like lightning from a clear sky came an attack as sudden as it was unexpected two forms leaped from behind some neighboring bushes they were indians and one held a tomahawk in his hand with the flat of this he struck dave a blow on the head knocking him down  dont gasped the young pioneer when a second blow descended giving him a shock he could not withstand he stretched out his arms and then rolled over on his back senseless  illustration tis one of the english said the taller of the indians  tis one of the english said the taller of the indians in his native language we were right to set a watch here  and what shall be done with him questioned the second pontiac cares not for the scalp of a stripling  it shall be for pontiac to answer was the reply bind him to yonder tree there may be more to come forth like foxes from their holes  without ceremony daves limp body was dragged into a thicket and fastened to a tree then the two indians went back to renew their watch this continued for the best part of an hour  at the end of that time three other indians appeared including footinhismouth the latter listened intently to what had happened  the fight is over he said two indians are dead and a white man and a delaware squaw named white buffalo have retreated in the direction of fort pitt let us away from here without delay for i must report this new happening to pontiac  and the stripling what of him  bring him along  dave was just returning to his senses when the indians shook him roughly a scalping knife was brandished before his eyes and he was given to understand that he must either walk with them or suffer death  where are you going to take me he asked when he felt strong enough to speak  this question the indians would not answer but two of them shoved him roughly and he was compelled to walk to where a number of horses were in waiting with his hands tied behind him and his head aching severely he was mounted on one of the animals and the entire party set off northward through the forest  if only sam was here thought the young pioneer dismally he did not know that a fierce handtohand conflict had taken place near the waterfall and that barringford and white buffalo had barely escaped with their lives yet such was a fact  the ride was a rough and hard one for dave and long before it came to an end he was ready to sink into a faint from exhaustion every time he reeled in the saddle one of the red men would shove him up roughly or prick him with the end of a scalping knife  at last the indians called a halt at the foot of a small cliff they dismounted and forced dave to the ground and the entire party ascended to the top of the cliff here was a welldefined path and along this they journeyed for a short distance coming out presently at a point where there was a small sheet of water fed by several brooks on the edge of the pondit can scarcely be called a lakewas an indian village containing perhaps a hundred inhabitants it was known as shanorison and here dwelt an aged chief named mamuliekala looked up to by many of the red men because he had once made a trip to boston and to england mamuliekala never ceased to tell of the wonders of the land across the ocean but only a handful of the red men believed all he said contending that the english and the rolling of the ship on the ocean had cast a spell over his mind so that his eyes had deceived him  having been brought into shanorison dave was brought before one of the under chiefs and his captors told their tale the talking was in a dialect the young pioneer could not understand and he was asked no questions then one of the indians took him by the arm and led him away  what are you going to do with me asked the youth  hold white young man a prisoner was the answer  what for  the white young man must tell pontiac how he came into the cave under the waterfall  did you see any other white people there  moon head cannot answer that question said the indian  in the center of the village was a small and rather dirty wigwam and in this dave was placed his hands were kept fastened behind him and also tied to a short post in the center of the shelter  if the young man attempts to escape he will be killed like a dog said the indian on departing  when will pontiac be here called dave after him but to this the red man made no reply he stalked away letting the flap of the wigwam close after him  if dave felt sick in body he was doubly so in mind the expedition to the east had come to a sudden and unexpected termination and what was to be the real end of the adventure there was no telling certain it was that pontiac would be very angry when he learned that the secret he and his followers had guarded so closely was known to the english and dave felt that it might go very hard with him in consequence  perhaps theyll burn me at the stake or do something equally bad he thought dismally i must say i wish i was out of it i wonder if i cant manage to escape     chapter xxix  pontiacs trail once more   the fight between the indians and the party under barringford and white buffalo had been short and sharp finding they could not open the passageway to the chamber in which dave was as they supposed entombed alive the old frontiersman and the indian chief had returned to the outer world hoping to find another entrance to the cave in the midst of the search the enemy had fallen upon them and the slaughter of the indians under white buffalo had occurred  pontiacs braves had suffered also but to what extent barringford and white buffalo could not tell barringford was wounded in both the thigh and the back but fortunately neither hurt was serious white buffalo received a bullet through the forearm and a cut from a tomahawk yet with the adroitness of his race he managed to flee with the old frontiersman and both after much difficulty managed to elude their pursuers  we must return to fort pitt and tell the commander there of what has happened said barringford and white buffalo agreed their horses were gone so they had to return on foot the journey taking them two days  fort pitt it may be mentioned here was at the time commanded by captain simeon ecuyer a brave officer of swiss birth who had served the colonies well for years he listened to barringfords tale with close attention and keen interest  i have suspected something of this sort for a long while he said it was known that many guns and pistols were stolen at the time of general braddocks defeat and also during the battles further to the north i will send out a party at once and if we can capture the indians i will see to it that justice is done  bring along picks and spades said the old frontiersman we must save dave morris if the deed is possible  a company eighteen strong and fully armed left the fort that very noon two sharpshooters were in advance but none of the enemy put in an appearance arriving at the waterfall they found the spot totally deserted roaming the forest were two of the horses and these were easily captured and later on one more animal was secured  well this beats anything i have ever seen declared the lieutenant who was in command of the soldiers after following barringford into the cave its a perfect treasure house  pray do me the kindness to lose no time in clearing out that passageway responded barringford and under his directions the soldiers set to work with picks and spades and various other entrenching tools to remove the fallen rocks and dirt  it was a hard task but inside of three hours the way was cleared and barringford crawled through followed by white buffalo  gone murmured the old frontiersman with a sigh of relief i am mighty glad of it  white buffalo glad too returned the indian chief simply let us look for his trail  plenty of torches were at hand and also a lantern making the rocky chamber almost as bright as day with ease the indian chief traced daves footsteps to the split in the rocks and then hauled himself out through the opening by the tree roots followed by barringford  this is the way he got out said the old frontiersman but why didnt he return to the waterfall  fight here was the red mans answer pointing to the footprints in the soil two indians come up behind dave come  they left the vicinity and soon both reached the conclusion that the young pioneer had been carried away a prisoner  but where did they take him to questioned barringford  we must follow the trail was all white buffalo could answer  a conference was held with the lieutenant and it was decided that the whole party should follow the trail  we can come back to the cave for the goods later said lieutenant peterson we certainly must rescue young morris and make an example of those who have carried him off  it was no light task to follow the indian trail through the woods with all the cuteness of which they were capable the followers of pontiac had taken to a shallow stream for over quarter of a mile and before the trail could be discovered again night came on they tried to keep up the hunt with torches but it was of no avail  beaten muttered barringford and his eyes grew moist poor dave what will become of him  with the coming of morning the lieutenant decided to return to the waterfall an examination was made and it was found to be an easy task to make the water flow in another direction thus leaving the main entrance to the cave a dry one without delay the things inside were removed and loaded on horses in this manner everything was sooner or later removed to fort pitt  i shall report to the authorities without delay said captain ecuyer more than likely you will be well rewarded for this discovery but no reward was ever received  never mind the reward answered barringford i want to find dave morris  at present i cannot send out another detachment barringford but i will do so in a few days  then ill take time by the forelock and let his father know what has happened  i believe i should do so were i in your place  barringford had had his wounds washed and dressed and mounted on a fresh horse he lost no time in riding back to the tradingpost on the ohio white buffalo did not go with him stating he would renew the hunt for the lost trail  it was henry who met the old frontiersman at the stockade gate  whats wrong he questioned quickly where is dave  before barringford had time to answer james morris showed himself  something has gone wrong he cried i can see it in your face what is it  we had a brush with the indianspart of pontiacs party said the old frontiersman  and dave  we think he was made a prisoner went on barringford and then told his story in detail  and you say white buffalo has gone out again to look for the lost trail questioned the trader  yes hell find it too if it is to be done i thought youd like to know so that you could go out with me and the soldiers  yes yes  id like to go myself uncle james put in henry  one of us ought to remain at the post henry i do not like to leave it in the hands of strangers  but they are not all strangers pleaded henry some of the men we know very well we can leave sanderson in charge he knows what to do and so does jadwin  well ill see about it said mr morris  as barringford was hungry a hasty meal was prepared for him and then the morrises had a talk with sanderson jadwin and some of the others as a result sanderson said he would take charge of the tradingpost for a week or longer if necessary and jadwin said he would also remain close at hand in case he was wanted  this left henry free to join mr morris and barringford in the hunt for dave and the young pioneer was not long in preparing himself for the expedition fresh horses were obtained and the party set off early the following morning when the sun had not yet shown itself over the rolling hills to the eastward  the day had promised fair but about noon the sky grew dark very suddenly and soon after this came a flurry of snow followed by a heavy wind which tore through the trees of the forest with a mighty roar hurling more than one trunk to the ground broken branches fell in all directions one hitting henry on the head and scaring his steed so that the animal could scarcely be controlled  i must say i dont like this much panted the young pioneer as he reined in the horse what is it a tornado  well have to get behind some rocks for the present declared barringford and this was done the fierce wind continued for half an hour longer and then subsided more snow followed but then came sunshine as bright and fair as one would wish  only a squall after all said james morris but it was heavy while it lasted  when the party arrived at fort pitt they found the soldiers ready to go out once more but nothing had been heard of white buffalo which all thought rather strange  perhaps he has failed to recover the trail said james morris sorrowfully with all his sagacity white buffalo cannot do the impossible  do you think it impossible to recover such a trail asked lieutenant peterson  hell find itif you give him time enough put in barringford confidently no injun better nor white buffalo on a trail  i believe that said henry hes as smart as they make em  two hours after this white buffalo came in he was plainly tired out but his face brightened on seeing the whites he knew so well  white buffalo has found the trail he announced it leads to the village of shanorison where lives the old chief mamuliekala the great water bear mamuliekala and pontiac are like brothers they have made dave their prisoner  do you know where dave is now  white buffalo has not seen his white brother but thinks dave is at the village or close to it but we must hurry for soon pontiac and his braves will go northward to the land of the wyandots and the ottawas  will they take dave or kill him asked henry  at this the indian chief shrugged his shoulders  who can answer for the future he said briefly  let us be on the way cried james morris impatiently an hour lost may mean much to my son  did the indians at the village see you questioned captain ecuyer of the indian chief  no white buffalo showed not himself for it would not have been wise  while the soldiers were preparing for the new expedition the indian chief was given food and drink after which he said he felt much better he was provided with a fresh horse to mount and said he would take a nap in the saddle a common trick even among red men of today this may appear strange to some of my young readers but in our army it is well known that men have slept both in the saddle and while on the march  when the soldiers were assembled captain ecuyer addressed them briefly  men said he you are embarking on rather a dangerous mission i am sorry i cannot be with you but it is my duty to remain at the fort for there may be a general uprising of which we know nothing i expect every man to obey lieutenant peterson thoroughly and i want all to do their duty to the uttermost if you can avoid bloodshed do so but do not let pontiac or his followers lead you into any trap if you are needed at the fort i shall send a messenger after you and then you must return with all possible speed for no matter what else happens fort pitt must not be taken from us  the men gave a little cheer and in two minutes the line of march was taken up some sharpshooters and barringford leading the way with james morris and henry not far behind once again they turned into the mighty forest heading now directly for the village of shanorison mr morris was very anxious to push ahead with all speed but the soldiers would not go beyond their regular gait  let us go ahead said he at last to henry i cannot stand this suspense  im willing enough answered his nephew only let us take sam along  this was done and despite the protests of the sharpshooters they were soon out of sight a little later white buffalo joined them having taken the nap already mentioned  the trail was just as difficult to follow as before and more than once they had to halt in perplexity for the thickets seemed impassable  you must have had your own troubles in following the trail said henry to white buffalo in admiration  slow work but sure said the indian chief with a little smile white buffalo is growing oldhe cannot follow like one whose eyes are bright  at last they reached the cliff not wishing to abandon their horses they made a detour coming up to the indian village by what might be termed a back way in a thicket they tethered their steeds and once on foot each inspected his weapon to see that it was ready for use  dont want any tripup this time said henry to the flintlock he carried you have played me tricks enough after this i want you to behave yourself  it was decided that james morris and white buffalo should go slightly in advancethe indian chief to point out the different parts of the village luckily no dogs were near to betray their approach  to their amazement they found the village practically abandoned only the women and children and a few very old men being present the old chief mamuliekala was likewise gone  what can this mean questioned james morris  it means that the braves have flown as fly the birds at the coming of winter answered white buffalo  let us set a watch and make sure  barringford and henry were called up and all moved slowly from one outskirt of the village to another then they marched forward boldly arousing several sleeping dogs who began to bark loudly  a cry went up from one of the squaws who had a pappoose in her arms and at this half a dozen squaws and two old men showed themselves  where is mamuliekala the great water bear asked white buffalo sternly  he has gone on a journey answered one of the old men his eyes shifting uneasily as he spoke  and where is the white prisoner who was here  the old man hesitated and looked for aid from the other aged indian  there was no white prisoner here said the second old indian  are you so old that you cannot remember said white buffalo sternly the white prisoner was here where has he gone answer without delay  long knife knows not he has been sick and asleep when he awoke mamuliekala and many of the braves were gone  this was all the old man would say and the other aged indian said he had been away in the woods digging roots and herbs for three days the stories were probably not true but nothing was to be gained by crossexamining the pair and white buffalo did not try it  let us search the village and question the squaws said he and this was done without delay at first but little could be learned but at last they made out that pontiac had been there and also footinhismouth and both had gone off during the night with mamuliekala taking the braves and some young white person with them one squaw said that footinhismouth had said the white young man was a runaway soldier and that pontiac meant to take him to the fort at detroit and claim a reward for the service  it was a trickif the story is true said james morris  true or not they certainly have taken dave away answered barringford and that being so all we can do is to follow them     chapter xxx  in the camp of the enemy   to dave in the dark and foulsmelling wigwam the time passed slowly his mind was busy wondering what the indians meant to do with him that they were enraged over the discovery of the underground storehouse was very evident he heard them talking earnestly among themselves but what was said or what conclusion was reached he could not ascertain  late in the evening an indian girl brought him something to eat and a jug of water she was rather handsome with her glossy hair and deep dreamy eyes and dave wanted very much to question her but she could speak no english and merely shook her head and smiled when he spoke to her  i dont think she would try to harm me he mused wonder if i could get her to aid me but this last question remained unanswered for the young pioneer never saw the indian maiden again  having slipped to the bottom of the post he fell into a troubled sleep from which he was rudely awakened by a light kick in the side an indian stood there gazing at him speculatively  white young man stand up and come along grunted the red man and released him from the post  with stiff arms and shoulders and knees that did not wish to move dave walked from the wigwam it was early morning and near a small campfire were assembled footinhismouth mamuliekala and several others they were eating the first meal of the day and dave was given a fair share of the food when he started to talk he was told to keep silent and after that saw it would be useless for the present to say more  the meal over the indians brought forth a number of horses and soon the whole party were leaving the village being followed by a number of braves dave had not seen before it was cold and raw and the wind blew freely and more than once came a flurry of snow  by the middle of the afternoon the party reached another village called white bear spring tradition telling that a white bear had once had his den close to the spring which fed the brook that was at hand there was but a small collection of wigwams here and the place seemed more than half asleep when dave and his captors came in  while on horseback the young pioneers hands had remained free so that he might guide the steed through the forest and along the river bank but now when he dismounted his hands were again bound behind him  white young man try to run away indian kill said footinhismouth with a frown and after that dave was allowed to move around the campfire as pleased him but if he tried to edge toward the boundary of the village he was at once ordered back in a manner that left no room for dispute  they dont intend to let me get away he thought dismally and yet what good will it do them to carry me off  it was easy to ask himself this question but no answer could be reached and at length he had to give it up he noticed that some indians were sent out as guards and he knew that the red men were fearful that somebody had followed them  the night was passed at white bear spring and the following day the indians split up into two parties one moving back to the southward and the other continuing to the north with the latter contingent went dave and footinhismouth the indian had a long talk with mamuliekala and dave saw a string of wampum passed from the old magician to the other he also heard pontiacs name mentioned  a hard journey on foot now followed the trail was over rocks and uneven ground and more than once the young pioneer slipped and fell the indians were in no good humor and often pushed and struck him urging him forward they did not stop for dinner and the days tramp was not concluded until an hour after sunset when they reached a small valley wherein flowed a stream on its way to lake erie  the coming of footinhismouth to this place was hailed with delight by the indians who had erected a village there here were a number of huts and log cabins showing that the red men had gone into winter quarters dave was thrust into a hut and told to make himself comfortable on a bundle of robes that were both dirty and full of vermin he was given a scant supper and in the morning his breakfast was no more substantial and even worse cooked  several days followed in which nothing out of the ordinary occurred dave was occasionally given the freedom of the camp at which times two braves were set to watch him at other times and during the night he was forced to keep in the hut while a red man young or old sat on guard at the doorway  winter was now coming forward rapidly and one morning he awoke to find the ground covered with snow to a depth of several inches some additional indians had come in during the night and the village was full of life in consequence  among the newcomers was flat nose the rascal who had aided jean bevoir and jacques valette to make the raid on the morris packtrain flat nose listened with interest to all the other red men had to tell him and looked at dave when the young pioneer was eating his dinner then flat nose left the camp in a hurry stating that he would be back the next day  twelve miles away was a tradingpost which in years gone by had been erected by a frenchman named camboyne the frenchman had been slain by some indians and for three years the post had been deserted many white hunters and many red men believing it to be haunted but some indians who had not heard the story of ghosts came along once and stopped at the post and after that indians and whites came and went as pleased them but everybody was afraid to do any harm to the place or to take permanent possession and there the dilapidated building stood until about the time of the revolution when a windstorm razed it to the ground  to the socalled haunted post went flat nose where he joined half a dozen of his followers of the wanderers  what has become of our white brothers bevoir and valette he asked of a fellow warrior in his native tongue  they have gone away but will be back before the sun is down was the answer why does flat nose ask the question  i bring news of importance the wyandots have in their village the son of james morris he who has settled upon the ohio  a prisoner or to trade  a prisoner where he was captured they will not tell but flat nose thinks it must have been miles from here  was pontiac of the ottawas at the village asked the other indian  he was looked for by sunset that is why i have hurried to see jean bevoir and his men they may wish to question the wyandots and pontiac concerning young morris  and what about word to fall upon the whites and slay them  the time is not yet ripe such was the word given to me by footinhismouth many of the indians are not yet ready for the war  bah we shall never be ready cried the other red man in disgust and turned away  for the rest of the day flat nose waited impatiently for the coming of bevoir and jacques valette when at last he saw them approaching he ran to meet them  as best he could he related what he had seen and heard at the indian village jacques valette listened in moody silence but ere flat nose had finished a crafty look came into jean bevoirs face  ha it will be a master stroke he cried in french a master strokeif only i can get this dave morris in my power flat nose did well to tell me  perhaps we shall burn our fingers growled jacques valette who was none the brighter for having drank several glasses of liquor that afternoon  no no jacques not if we keep our wits about us i must find out why they have made him their prisoner  and what think you to do then asked valette exhibiting some interest at last  think can you not see if pontiac will only turn the youth over to our tender mercies we shall hold all of the morrises in our power  i see not how  jacques you are growing stupid tis as clear as glass we are becoming hard pressed glotte has disappeared and bergerac has deserted us and gone over to the enemy  he should have his neck wrung for him muttered valette  i agree he has most likely told them everything the english are in power  but not for long jean not for long  about that i am not so sure the news from france would seem to point to the fact that our country will give up everything for the sake of peace half of the red men are already the friends of the english and more will follow if france does nothing to aid pontiac and his followers  pontiac is stronghe will strike a terrible blow when all his plans are complete  i think that myself but he is not yet ready and when he is he may find the english too strong for him and if pontiac fails what will become of us we shall be hunted down smoked out tracked to our final stopping placeand hanged  you are a true comforter upon my word  i am not one to throw dust into my own eyes jacques can i not see what is taking place around us even many of our old friends shun us not only our own countrymen but also the indians they see how the wind is blowing  with this dave morris in your power what will you do questioned jacques valette after a pause during which jean bevoir began to walk up and down nervously  with him in our power we shall be safe yes we may even dictate terms to james morris the father he will do anything to save his sonhis only child  you mean that you will make him promise not to prosecute us  yes and more perhaps  what more  jean bevoir closed one eye suggestively  leave that to me jacques the plan is not yet clear in my mind but one thing is certain james morris will do anything to save his son from harm  but what of that henry morris and that old hunter barringford  both will do as james morris wishes for one is his nephew and the other a very close friend of the family  you may not be able to handle pontiac  that of course remains to be seen it is possible he may be glad enough to get rid of the prisoner the game is worth the trying went on jean bevoir and if pontiac will not give morris up i have another plan he added suddenly  what is that  time enough to speak of it if pontiac refuses my request jacques but i must not lose time here every hour may count will you go to the village with me or remain with flat nose  i will go along answered jacques valette and soon the wily pair set out on their mission     chapter xxxi  held as a spy   two hours after flat nose left the indian village several ottawas came in to announce the coming of pontiac at once there was a fresh stir and everything possible was done to give the great chief a proper reception when he appeared the head of the wyandot tribe went forward to greet him and both sat down in front of the main log cabin of the village to smoke and to talk  the conference lasted but a short quarter of an hour and then pontiac had himself conducted to the hut in which dave was a prisoner  the white young man is sorry to be a prisoner he said slowly and gazing searchingly into the young pioneers eyes  i am sorry answered dave simply i do not understand it are not the english and the red men now at peace with each other  tis true but the white young man has not treated the indians fairly  what have i done that was wrong  illustration the white man is sorry to be a prisoner he said slowly  the white young man has the eyes of a hawk he has seen into places that are dark and secret such sights are not good for him  if you mean the cave under the waterfall let me ask why did you have those guns and pistols and the powder that belong to the english stored there  the english owe the poor indians muchthey will not pay hence the indians thought it no more than fair to keep the goods  not wishing to anger the great chief too much dave did not reply to this  the white young man has the eyes of a hawk and the cunning of a fox continued pontiac he is no trapper no hunter no trader but a spy  a spy cried dave a light breaking in upon him so you take me to be a spy  and pontiac is right tis useless to deny it the young man would spy upon the indians and then go and tell the great english general of what he has seen he is a snake in the grass close to the trail of pontiac and his followers  i am not a spy chief pontiac my father is a trader and i help him at his tradingpost on the ohio that is all  pontiac waved his hand the wind can blow a lie away but the truth is like a rock that the wind cannot stir pontiacs followers have watched the white youth and he knows  chief pontiac is mistaken i give him my word upon it answered dave and then he added what do you propose to do with me  that remains to be seen in war times the english and the french put a spy to death it may be that pontiac will be more merciful but first the white young man must tell all he knows  of what  of the secrets of the indians and of their plans  i know next to nothing i understand but little of the language  and what of the plans of the english  you mean of our soldiers  of the soldiers and of those who command them  i know absolutely nothing about our soldiers i was in the army at the fall of montreal but after that i was mustered out and i went back to my regular work on the farm and to hunting and fishing  you were at the fort at niagara  yes i was there too before i went down the st lawrence  and still you say you are not a spy the fox is sly but not so sly as pontiac supposed i tell you once for all i am not a spy chief pontiac  the celebrated indian chief drew himself up and gave dave a long earnest look he evidently saw that the young pioneer meant what he said he was about to speak to offer dave a chance to return home but then he remembered what had happened at the underground storehouse and hesitated  pontiac will see the white young man again he said briefly and left as abruptly as he had come  the conversation made dave more uneasy in mind than before he had not thought that the red men would consider him a spy if they continued to do that it might go extra hard with him in the near future pontiac had said that the french and the english put a spy to death but he had not added that the indians frequently took a spy and tortured him most cruelly yet such was a fact only two years before a spy had been caught by the indians near the great lakes and it was a matter of record that the red men had placed him upon the ground flat on his back and built a fire upon his breast leaving him to burn slowly to death the thought of this sent a cold shiver down daves backbone  i hope they dont torture me he muttered oh anything but that there was no consolation in the thought that pontiac had said he might be more merciful than the french or english he knew how cruel all red men could be when their evil passions were aroused  when pontiac came away from his interview with dave he was beyond a doubt in a quandary his plans against the english were many and evidently he was much worried thinking dave knew much more than was the fact it had galled him to let the summer pass without striking the cherished blow but he had great hopes for the summer to come and history has already recorded what he did shortly after the time of which i am now writing  pontiac was in deep thought when a young brave came to him and said two french hunters wished to speak to him thinking they might have news of value he consented to the interview and was soon in conversation with jean bevoir and jacques valette  of bevoir pontiac had heard several times he knew the french trader to be a twofaced rascal and probably he despised him accordingly for judged solely by indian standards pontiac was an upright and honest man his duplicity was only that of the red man when on the warpath in his personal dealing he would not have cheated a fellow indian or a white man out of a farthing  jean bevoir was not long in coming to the point  he said he had heard that dave morris had been made a prisoner by the indians if pontiac wanted to get rid of the young fellow he bevoir would take him off his hands and be glad to do it  but what will my french friend do with this morris asked pontiac  leave that to me answered bevoir ill take good care that he does not bother you again  by skillful questioning pontiac managed to learn a great deal of what was in bevoirs mind and he saw at once that the frenchman was indeed an enemy to the young pioneer then valette began to talk saying morris should never cross the path of the indians again once he and bevoir got their hands upon him  pontiac wishes him to live said the chief shrewdly  he shall not die said bevoir but we shall take care that he comes not to this neighborhood again  pontiac said he would think it over he felt certain that bevoir and valette were up to some foul deed and was half inclined to send them from the village  while pontiac thinks it over can i speak to the prisoner asked jean bevoir  after some hesitation pontiac allowed him to see dave and soon the two were face to face in the hut pontiac wished to set a spy to listen to what was said but another matter claimed his attention  jean bevoir cried dave what brings you to this place  not so loud answered jean bevoir in a whisper morris i am your friend believe me  my friend ejaculated the young pioneer  oui listen the indians wish to kill you i wish to save you if i do that will youyou  what  will you promise to go to your father and tell him i have saved you  why do you want that  we are now enemies i wish to be friends he will be a friend to one who saves his sons life  perhaps bevoir daves head was in a whirl but thisof you i can scarcely believe it and then that attack on the packtrain  was hector bergeracs work i can prove it come shall i save you or not  yes save me if you can muttered dave  and you will tell your father of it  yes  then listen here is a sharp hunting knife see i will stick it between the logs so that you may cut your cords with it tonight when you hear the owl hoot free yourself and steal from the hut if you can follow the hoot of the owl and i will be there with swift horses  and then asked the young pioneer  we will away straight for your fathers tradingpost jean bevoir paused a moment it may be i can persuade pontiac to give you up if i can so much the better but if not remember what i have told you if pontiac asks you if you will go with me say yes  i may be shot down if i try to escape in the dark  you must take the risk bevoir came closer they mean to burn you at the stake tomorrow at nooni heard the talk an hour ago he went on in a low tone  ill escape if i can said dave and a moment later jean bevoir left him  the young pioneers thoughts were in a tumult he did not believe in bevoir yet what the man said might possibly be true he did not wish to be tortured by the indians  id rather run my chances with bevoir he told himself ill have the knife and perhaps i can pick up a gun or a pistol he may be sick of hiding himself and he knows father will treat him kindly if he really does save me  dave had not seen jacques valette and he fancied he was to meet jean bevoir alone it would be dark and perhaps he could slip away from the frenchman as well as from the indians anyway the plan appeared to be worth trying  pontiac had expected to remain at the village over night but at sunset a messenger came for him to meet some other chiefs several miles away he departed hastily leaving dave in charge of footinhismouth and the wyandots  when jean bevoir saw pontiac depart he was glad that he had spoken to dave about escaping he felt certain the young pioneer would fall into the trap he and valette left the camp together and at once summoned flat nose and the other indians who were in their employ  once let me get dave morris in my power and all will be well said jean bevoir exultantly he was in such high spirits he could scarcely wait for night to come  where will you take him questioned valette  to the westward where i know we shall be safe  and after that  i shall negotiate with james morris chuckled bevoir oh but i shall bring him to terms  at last it grew dark there was a promise of a storm in the air and soon the snow began to come down this did not suit bevoir for it would make tracking easy but as this could not be avoided he determined to make the best of it should it continue to snow the tracks made during the night would soon be obliterated     chapter xxxii  a fight and a victoryconclusion   the news that dave was not at the indian village of shanorison was dismaying to mr morris barringford and henry for they had expected beyond a doubt to find the captive there  all we can do is to continue on the trail said james morris promptly i shall not turn back until he is found  nor i added henry promptly  were bound to catch em some time came from the old frontiersman dont you think so white buffalo  white buffalo is sure he can overtake those who are fleeing answered the chief but it may take many days  lieutenant peterson was consulted and he said he would follow the trail for one day longer  after that i will have to turn back he continued i have strict orders to go but so far from fort pitt and no further you see we may be needed there if the redskins contemplate an attack that is true said james morris i should like to have you with us but orders are orders  i will detail two of my best shots to go with your party mr morris they are men who are used to fighting the redskins in their own way and will be of great assistance  the day passed slowly but when the sun went down no indians had been seen the little party went into camp under the shelter of some trees and in the early morning lieutenant peterson set out on the return to fort pitt leaving behind the two sharpshooters as he had promised  and now to go it alone cried henry perhaps well do better than with so many soldiers behind us  we can certainly continue the hunt with less chance of being observed answered his uncle  henry was very impatient to overtake those who had dave in charge but the trail was an uncertain one and once they made a false move which took them some miles out of their true course this false turn made white buffalo very angry and he berated himself roundly for the mistake  white buffalo is getting old he declared he is like a squaw on the trail he had better go and live with the old women of his tribe  never mind white buffalo we are all liable to make mistakes said the trader kindly  at last the indian chief announced that they had reached fresh tracks and that they were close to another village soon after that barringford came in and announced that he had seen the trail of some white men evidently hunters and trappers  we must be careful now said the old frontiersman if we aint we may run into a reglar trap  the party came to a halt and soon after that it began to snow and by the time it was dark the snow covered the ground to the depth of an inch and more  that ends trailing said barringford hang the luck anyway  as the snow continued to come down they made themselves comfortable under some immense spruce trees whose branches almost touched the ground here supper was had and then henry and barringford accompanied by white buffalo moved up to the top of a small hill which was close at hand hoping to discover something from that point of vantage  i see a campfire cried henry who was the first to gain the high ground  yes an it aint more n quarter o mile from here nuther came from barringford tell ye what boys i think weve come about to the end o the trail eh white buffalo  white buffalo thinks his brother sam is right was the slow answer tis the campfire of the wyandots and no other campfire is near he added sweeping the entire distance with his sharp eyes  shall we go forward at once questioned the young pioneer eagerly  well see what your uncle says returned barringford   it did not take them long to consult with james morris and as a result the whole party moved onward once more with the morrises barringford and white buffalo in advance  this movement occurred on the very night that dave meant to try for liberty the knife in the logs was still there and all unknown to the indians who were holding him a prisoner he backed up to it and cut the thongs that bound his hands behind him  outside of the hut it was snowing furiously and the indian guard did not attempt to pace up and down as usual but sat under a shelter of bark smoking and dozing the indians did not think that their prisoner would attempt to escape for on all sides of the village lay the immense forest inhabited by many savage animals and now fast filling with snow unarmed and unguided a single person in that region would soon become lost and most likely perish from hunger  at last dave thought it time to make a move he had not yet heard the signal agreed upon between himself and jean bevoir but he did not wish to wait for this being even more anxious to escape from the frenchman than from the red men  with the hunting knife in his hand he moved cautiously to the rear of the hut here was a small opening which he had discovered the day before through it he wormed his way coming out through the dead leaves and the snow on the outside a dozen steps away was a fringe of brushwood and hither he moved with the silence of a ghost  as he gained the bushes the hoot of an owl or rather the imitation thereof came to his ears it was the signal and he knew that jean bevoir must be close at hand  instead of going directly toward the signal dave attempted to go around it his object in doing this was to get behind bevoir obtain one of the horses the frenchman had mentioned and be off before jean bevoir could stop him he knew he would run the risk of being shot should the frenchman still be treacherous but hoped that the darkness of the night would favor him  again came the hoot of the owl in the same place as before dave was moving around to the southward trying to pierce the darkness between the thick branches of the trees and the snow he could see next to nothing and almost before he knew it he had stepped into a hollow and gone down a distance of several feet his knee struck a rock hurting him severely and causing him to give a gasp of pain  as dave was rising a form appeared before him and an instant later he was confronted by flat nose the indian came forward before the young pioneer could think of withdrawing  white young man here cried flat nose softly and he followed this with the call of a nightbird thrice repeated  i want nothing of you exclaimed dave and started to retreat when flat nose caught him by the arm but dave struck out with the hunting knife and the indian fell back with a wound in his shoulder before he could recover the young pioneer was running off as swiftly as his hurt knee would permit  in a moment more dave heard not only flat nose but also several others in pursuit a call reached him in the voice of jean bevoir but to this he paid no attention he knew that his only safety lay in escape  but while he was running from flat nose and jean bevoir he was making directly towards jacques valette and in less than a minute the two came face to face valette had his gun handy and the moment the young pioneer appeared he raised the weapon  stop he roared stop or i shoot  do not let him escape cried jean bevoir in french  i have him safe enough came from valette  covered by a gun in the hands of such a villain as jacques valette dave did not know what to do the fellow looked ready to shoot and even anxious to pull the trigger  while he was meditating jean bevoir flat nose and several indians of the wanderers tribe came up the young pioneer was immediately surrounded and flat nose caught him around the breast from the rear pinning his arms to his side the hunting knife was taken from him and he realized at once that further resistance would be useless  ha so you think to escape not so sneered jean bevoir i was afraid it would be so but now you are my prisonair ha ha  what are you going to do with me asked dave as calmly as he could but with a sinking heart  you will learn that later dave morris  you said you would take me back to my fathers tradingpost  did you believe zat ha ha you are a leetle fool i shall take you to the west far away oui then your father shall come to terms not so he will do anything to geet back his only son  like a flash the full realization of jean bevoirs plot forced itself upon the young pioneer he was truly in the hands of the enemy and it was safe to say that bevoir would not treat him any better than had pontiac if as well  supposing i wont go with you he said  you shall go with us replied jean bevoir you are my prisonair and must do as i say jacques bring up the horses  valette turned away to do as bidden as he did so there came a shout from a distance followed by a peculiar indiancry telling all in the village that the white captive had escaped  we must be quick said bevoir in french there is not a moment to spare  jacques valette brought up the horses with all possible speed there was one for dave and he was hoisted in the saddle with his hands bound behind him then the whole party turned directly westward toward a trail well known to flat nose and his followers  it was now snowing furiously and the trail left by the party was quickly covered in the village the alarm continued and several of the wyandots and the red men left behind by pontiac began a diligent search for the missing prisoner in the party was footinhismouth and before long he found the right trail and came in sight of jacques valette who was in the rear  he had hardly raised his cry of discovery when valette turned in the saddle took aim through the falling snow and fired his bullet went true and footinhismouth pitched headlong and lay still forever  they are coming cried valette as he went forward once more we shall have to fight for it  no no we must escape through the snow ejaculated jean bevoir he had not dreamed that the situation would take such a serious turn come come  on they went faster than ever the branches of the trees struck dave in the breast and in the face and once he was almost thrown from the saddle they were passing down into an open space where the snow was blowing furiously jean bevoir hailed the falling flakes with satisfaction they would surely cover the trail which so badly needed obliteration  beyond the open space was another patch of timber but here the trees were further apart so progress was easier on and on they went with the wyandots and ottawas still in pursuit the horses were almost out of breath yet were urged to do their utmost by the frenchmen and the wanderers who knew that if the pursuers came up to them a fierce pitched battle would surely result with perhaps a number killed and wounded on each side  dave was tugging at the cords which tied his hands and now to his satisfaction they came loose leaving him free he wondered what he had best do should he risk a rush to the right or the left that would place one set of enemies in front of him and one behind but all might pass on leaving him to shift for himself  while he was deliberating a shout rang out ahead followed by a rifle shot then as if in a dream he heard a yell in sam barringfords voice  stop jean bevoir you everlastin rascal stop  sam sam he screamed and rode forward sam is it really you  dave came in the voice of henry dave what can this mean what are you doing here  the cry came from the left and dave turned his horse in that direction more shots rang out and he saw an indian go down then jacques valette turned toward the young pioneer  you shall not get away cried the rascally french hunter and raised his gun but before he could use the weapon james morris fired upon him and valette pitched into the snow shot through the thigh then dave went on and in a moment more found himself among his friends and relatives  there was no time to answer questions the wyandots and ottawas were coming up swiftly and once more the wanderers and jean bevoir attempted to outdistance them jacques valette also attempted to remount his horse but ere he could do so a wyandot reached him and struck him down again the blow crushed the frenchmans skull and he died before sunrise  we must get out of this said dave when he could speak the indians are after us if we stay here we may be caught between two fires  come with me came from white buffalo white buffalo knows a good hiding place  james morris party turned back and with dave by his fathers side all rode through the forest to the southward here they reached a small brook backed up by rugged rocks and a thick patch of timber in the timber they halted and in a short while the snow now whirling in every direction hid their trail completely from view  listening intently they heard many shots at a distance and knew that a fierce fight was on between those from the village and the party under jean bevoir the fighting kept on for a good halfhour then gradually died away to the northward  safe in the shelter near the brook dave told his story to which his father henry and the others listened with great interest  you can be thankful that we came up as we did said james morris  i am thankful said the young pioneer i never want to see jean bevoir and his rascally companions again  perhaps jean bevoir is dead put in henry that shooting must have meant something  i brought down jacques valette continued mr morris but i dont believe i killed him  i hit bevoir in the arm came from barringford hell remember it a while ill warrant  it was all pontiacs fault came from dave i think the authorities ought to bring him to book for it  perhaps they will answered james morris seriously  let me add a few words more and then bring to a close this story of pioneer life and of adventures while on the trail of pontiac  the snowstorm that started that evening proved a heavy one and it was not until nearly a week later that the morris party managed to get back to fort pitt here the commandant listened to what they had to relate with close attention and said he would report to the proper authorities at the first opportunity but means of communication were now almost entirely cut off and in the end little or nothing was done to make pontiac and his followers explain their actions matters of greater importance coming up in the meantime  when they felt able to do so dave and barringford continued on the trip to wills creek taking white buffalo and some of his followers with them the others of the party returned to the tradingpost anxious to learn if matters there were quiet they found no cause for alarm but a few days later two trappers came in with news that nearly all of the bevoir party had been killed bevoir himself escaping after being wounded both in the arm and the side  the wyandots and the ottawas are very angry at the wanderers said the hunter who furnished the news they say the wanderers must hereafter keep to the hunting grounds in the far west the wyandots say there was some mistake made about dave and they are going to bring in next spring the goods they got away from bevoir and which were stolen from the packtrain  i trust they keep their word answered james morris but i reckon that fifty pounds is gone for good  i think they will keep their word said sanderson who knew many of the wyandots well they want to be at peace and theyd be all right if only the ottawas would leave them alone  pontiac will never rest until he has united the indians in a regular war against the english said james morris and how true his words were will be shown in another volume of this series to be entitled the fort in the wilderness or the soldier boys of the indian trails in this volume we shall meet all of our old friends again and learn what more was done toward establishing the tradingpost on the ohio and of how jean bevoir again crossed the path of the morrises and made himself more odious than ever  the homecoming of dave was made a joyous time at the morris cabin his aunt lucy came out to greet him warmly followed by rodney and little nell the twins stood in the doorway gazing shyly at him and sam barringford  i am so glad you are safe said mrs morris as she kissed her nephew  and im glad myself answered dave but she did not fully understand all he meant until he had told his story  reckon as how this is my family came from sam barringford as he took one of the twins in each arm no news of em is thar he asked  no news sam said rodney reckon they are yours right enough but rodney was mistaken as later events proved  well ill try to give em a fathers care went on the old frontiersman and he gave each twin a halfdozen hugs and kisses at which both crowed loudly they were the pets of the household and all loved them dearly  you cant imagine how good it feels to be at home once more said dave later on the tradingpost is all well enough but it cant touch a place like this  if all goes well i am going out to the tradingpost next year came from rodney i am now as strong as any of you  do not talk of spring yet said mrs morris we have still a long hard winter to face  what she said was true and winter started in earnest the very next day snowing for the best part of a week and then turning off bitterly cold yet firewood was to be had in plenty and the cabin was kept warm and comfortable for all  weve had some great times this past season said barringford as he warmed himself by the cheerful kitchen blaze great times eh white buffalo  the indian chief who had come in to smoke a friendly pipe nodded my brother sam is right he said but all has gone well so let us be thankful  yes let us be thankful came from dave  and they were thankful and here let us leave them wishing them the best of luck for the future     the end
