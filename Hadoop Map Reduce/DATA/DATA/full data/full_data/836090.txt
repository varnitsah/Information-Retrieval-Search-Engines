836090	marie  an episode in the life of the late allan quatermain   by h rider haggard   original digital editors note  in the interest of readability where italics are used to indicate nonenglish words i have silently omitted them or replaced them with quotation marks     dedication  ditchingham 1912  my dear sir henry  nearly thirtyseven years have gone by more than a generation since first we saw the shores of southern africa rising from the sea since then how much has happened the annexation of the transvaal the zulu war the first boer war the discovery of the rand the taking of rhodesia the second boer war and many other matters which in these quickmoving times are now reckoned as ancient history  alas i fear that were we to revisit that country we should find but few faces which we knew yet of one thing we may be glad those historical events in some of which you as the ruler of natal played a great part and i as it chanced a smaller one so far as we can foresee have at length brought a period of peace to southern africa today the flag of england flies from the zambesi to the cape beneath its shadow may all ancient feuds and blood jealousies be forgotten may the natives prosper also and be justly ruled for after all in the beginning the land was theirs such i know are your hopes as they are mine  it is however with an earlier africa that this story deals in 1836 hate and suspicion ran high between the home government and its dutch subjects owing to the freeing of the slaves and mutual misunderstandings the cape colony was then in tumult almost in rebellion and the boers by thousands sought new homes in the unknown savagepeopled north of this bloodstained time i have tried to tell of the great trek and its tragedies such as the massacre of the truehearted retief and his companions at the hands of the zulu king dingaan  but you have read the tale and know its substance what then remains for me to say only that in memory of longpast days i dedicate it to you whose image ever springs to mind when i strive to picture an english gentleman as he should be your kindness i never shall forget in memory of it i offer you this book  ever sincerely yours  h rider haggard  to sir henry bulwer gcmg     preface   the author hopes that the reader may find some historical interest in the tale set out in these pages of the massacre of the boer general retief and his companions at the hands of the zulu king dingaan save for some added circumstances he believes it to be accurate in its details  the same may be said of the account given of the hideous sufferings of the trekboers who wandered into the fever veld there to perish in the neighbourhood of delagoa bay of these sufferings especially those that were endured by triechard and his companions a few brief contemporary records still exist buried in scarce works of reference it may be mentioned also that it was a common belief among the boers of that generation that the cruel death of retief and his companions and other misfortunes which befell them were due to the treacherous plottings of an englishman or of englishmen with the despot dingaan     editors note  the following extract explains how the manuscript of marie and with it some others one of which is named child of storm came into the hands of the editor  it is from a letter dated january 17th 1909 and written by mr george curtis the brother of sir henry curtis bart who it will be remembered was one of the late mr allan quatermains friends and companions in adventure when he discovered king solomons mines and who afterwards disappeared with him in central africa   this extract runs as follows  you may recall that our mutual and dear friend old allan quatermain left me the sole executor of his will which he signed before he set out with my brother henry for zuvendis where he was killed the court however not being satisfied that there was any legal proof of his death invested the capital funds in trustee securities and by my advice let his place in yorkshire to a tenant who has remained in occupation of it during the last two decades now that tenant is dead and at the earnest prayer of the charities which benefit under quatermains will and of myselffor in my uncertain state of health i have for long been most anxious to wind up this executorshipabout eight months ago the court at last consented to the distribution of this large fund in accordance with the terms of the will  this of course involved the sale of the real property and before it was put up to auction i went over the house in company of the solicitor appointed by the court on the top landing in the room quatermain used to occupy we found a sealed cupboard that i opened it proved to be full of various articles which evidently he had prized because of their associations with his earthy life these i need not enumerate here especially as i have reserved them as his residuary legatee and in the event of my death they will pass to you under my will  among these relics however i found a stout box made of some red foreign wood that contained various documents and letters and a bundle of manuscripts under the tape which fastened these manuscripts together as you will see is a scrap of paper on which is written in blue pencil a direction signed allan quatermain that in the event of anything happening to him these mss are to be sent to you for whom as you know he had a high regard and that at your sole discretion you are to burn or publish them as you may see fit  so after all these years as we both remain alive i carry out our old friends instructions and send you his bequest which i trust may prove of interest and value i have read the ms called marie and certainly am of the opinion that it ought to be published for i think it a strange and moving tale of a great lovefull moreover of forgotten history  that named child of storm also seems very interesting as a study of savage life and the others may be the same but my eyes are troubling me so much that i have not been able to decipher them i hope however that i may be spared long enough to see them in print  poor old allan quatermain it is as though he had suddenly reappeared from the dead so at least i thought as i perused these stories of a period of his life of which i do not remember his speaking to me  and now my responsibility in this matter is finished and yours begins do what you like about the manuscripts  george curtis   as may be imagined i the editor was considerably astonished when i received this letter and the accompanying bundle of closelywritten mss to me also it was as though my old friend had risen from the grave and once more stood before me telling some history of his stormy and tragic past in that quiet measured voice that i have never been able to forget  the first manuscript i read was that entitled marie it deals with mr quatermains strange experiences when as a very young man he accompanied the illfated pieter retief and the boer commission on an embassy to the zulu despot dingaan this it will be remembered ended in their massacre quatermain himself and his hottentot servant hans being the sole survivors of the slaughter also it deals with another matter more personal to himself namely his courtship of and marriage to his first wife marie marais  of this marie i never heard him speak save once i remember that on a certain occasionit was that of a garden fête for a local charityi was standing by quatermain when someone introduced to him a young girl who was staying in the neighborhood and had distinguished herself by singing very prettily at the fête her surname i forget but her christian name was marie he started when he heard it and asked if she were french the young lady answered no but only of french extraction through her grandmother who also was called marie  indeed he said once i knew a maiden not unlike you who was also of french extraction and called marie may you prove more fortunate in life than she was though better or nobler you can never be and he bowed to her in his simple courtly fashion then turned away afterwards when we were alone i asked him who was this marie of whom he had spoken to the young lady he paused a little then answered  she was my first wife but i beg you not to speak of her to me or to anyone else for i cannot bear to hear her name perhaps you will learn all about her one day then to my grief and astonishment he broke into something like a sob and abruptly left the room  after reading the record of this marie i can well understand why he was so moved i print it practically as it left his hands  there are other mss also one of which headed child of storm relates the moving history of a beautiful and i fear i must add wicked zulu girl named mameena who did much evil in her day and went unrepentant from the world  another amongst other things tells the secret story of the causes of the defeat of cetewayo and his armies by the english in 1879 which happened not long before quatermain met sir henry curtis and captain good  these three narratives are indeed more or less connected with each other at least a certain aged dwarf called zikali a witchdoctor and an terrible man has to do with all of them although in the first marie he is only vaguely mentioned in connection with the massacre of retief whereof he was doubtless the primary instigator as marie comes first in chronological order and was placed on the top of the pile by its author i publish it first with the others i hope to deal later on as i may find time and opportunity  but the future must take care of itself we cannot control it and its events are not in our hand meanwhile i hope that those who in their youth have read of king solomons mines and zuvendis and perhaps some others who are younger may find as much of interest in these new chapters of the autobiography of allan quatermain as i have done myself

allan learns french   although in my old age i allan quatermain have taken to writingafter a fashionnever yet have i set down a single word of the tale of my first love and of the adventures that are grouped around her beautiful and tragic history i suppose this is because it has always seemed to me too holy and faroff a matteras holy and faroff as is that heaven which holds the splendid spirit of marie marais but now in my age that which was faroff draws near again and at night in the depths between the stars sometimes i seem to see the opening doors through which i must pass and leaning earthwards across their threshold with outstretched arms and dark and dewy eyes a shadow long forgotten by all save methe shadow of marie marais  an old mans dream doubtless no more still i will try to set down that history which ended in so great a sacrifice and one so worthy of record though i hope that no human eye will read it until i also am forgotten or at any rate have grown dim in the gathering mists of oblivion and i am glad that i have waited to make this attempt for it seems to me that only of late have i come to understand and appreciate at its true value the character of her of whom i tell and the passionate affection which was her bounteous offering to one so utterly unworthy as myself what have i done i wonder that to me should have been decreed the love of two such women as marie and that of stella also now long dead to whom alone in the world i told all her tale i remember i feared lest she should take it ill but this was not so indeed during our brief married days she thought and talked much of marie and some of her last words to me were that she was going to seek her and that they would wait for me together in the land of love pure and immortal  so with stellas death all that side of life came to an end for me since during the long years which stretch between then and now i have never said another tender word to woman i admit however that once long afterwards a certain little witch of a zulu did say tender words to me and for an hour or so almost turned my head an art in which she had great skill this i say because i wish to be quite honest although iti mean my head for there was no heart involved in the mattercame straight again at once her name was mameena and i have set down her remarkable story elsewhere  to return as i have already written in another book i passed my youth with my old father a church of england clergyman in what is now the cradock district of the cape colony  then it was a wild place enough with a very small white population among our few neighbours was a boer farmer of the name of henri marais who lived about fifteen miles from our station on a fine farm called maraisfontein i say he was a boer but as may be guessed from both his christian and surname his origin was huguenot his forefather who was also named henri maraisthough i think the marais was spelt rather differently thenhaving been one of the first of that faith who emigrated to south africa to escape the cruelties of louis xiv at the time of the revocation of the edict of nantes  unlike most boers of similar descent these particular maraisfor of course there are many other families so callednever forgot their origin indeed from father to son they kept up some knowledge of the french tongue and among themselves often spoke it after a fashion at any rate it was the habit of henri marais who was excessively religious to read his chapter of the bible which it is or was the custom of the boers to spell out every morning should their learning allow them to do so not in the taal or patois dutch but in good old french i have the very book from which he used to read now for curiously enough in after years when all these events had long been gathered to the past i chanced to buy it among a parcel of other works at the weekly auction of odds and ends on the market square of maritzburg i remember that when i opened the great tome bound over the original leather boards in buckskin and discovered to whom it had belonged i burst into tears there was no doubt about it for as was customary in old days this bible had sundry flyleaves sewn up with it for the purpose of the recording of events important to its owner  the first entries were made by the original henri marais and record how he and his compatriots were driven from france his father having lost his life in the religious persecutions after this comes a long list of births marriages and deaths continued from generation to generation and amongst them a few notes telling of such matters as the change of the dwellingplaces of the family always in french towards the end of the list appears the entry of the birth of the henri marais whom i knew alas too well and of his only sister then is written his marriage to marie labuschagne also be it noted of the huguenot stock in the next year follows the birth of marie marais my marie and after a long interval for no other children were born the death of her mother immediately below appears the following curious passage  le 3 janvier 1836 je quitte ce pays voulant me sauver du maudit gouvernement britannique comme mes ancêtres se sont sauvés de ce diablelouis xiv  a bas les rois et les ministres tyrannique vive la liberté  which indicates very clearly the character and the opinions of henri marais and the feeling among the trekboers at that time  thus the record closes and the story of the marais endsthat is so far as the writings in the bible go for that branch of the family is now extinct  their last chapter i will tell in due course   there was nothing remarkable about my introduction to marie marais i did not rescue her from any attack of a wild beast or pull her out of a raging river in a fashion suited to romance indeed we interchanged our young ideas across a small and extremely massive table which in fact had once done duty as a block for the chopping up of meat to this hour i can see the hundreds of lines running crisscross upon its surface especially those opposite to where i used to sit  one day several years after my father had emigrated to the cape the heer marais arrived at our house in search i think of some lost oxen he was a thin bearded man with rather wild dark eyes set close together and a quick nervous manner not in the least like that of a dutch boeror so i recall him my father received him courteously and asked him to stop to dine which he did  they talked together in french a tongue that my father knew well although he had not used it for years dutch he could not or rather would not speak if he could help it and mr marais preferred not to talk english to meet someone who could converse in french delighted him and although his version of the language was that of two centuries before and my fathers was largely derived from reading they got on very well together if not too fast  at length after a pause mr marais pointing to myself a small and stubblyhaired youth with a sharp nose asked my father whether he would like me to be instructed in the french tongue the answer was that nothing would please him better  although he added severely to judge by my own experience where latin and greek are concerned i doubt his capacity to learn anything  so an arrangement was made that i should go over for two days in each week to maraisfontein sleeping there on the intervening night and acquire a knowledge of the french tongue from a tutor whom mr marais had hired to instruct his daughter in that language and other subjects i remember that my father agreed to pay a certain proportion of this tutors salary a plan which suited the thrifty boer very well indeed  thither accordingly i went in due course nothing loth for on the veld between our station and maraisfontein many pauw and koranthat is big and small bustardswere to be found to say nothing of occasional buck and i was allowed to carry a gun which even in those days i could use fairly well so to maraisfontein i rode on the appointed day attended by a hottentot afterrider a certain hans of whom i shall have a good deal to tell i enjoyed very good sport on the road arriving at the stead laden with one pauw two koran and a little klipspringer buck which i had been lucky enough to shoot as it bounded out of some rocks in front of me  there was a peach orchard planted round maraisfontein which just then was a mass of lovely pink blossom and as i rode through it slowly not being sure of my way to the house a lanky child appeared in front of me clad in a frock which exactly matched the colour of the peach bloom i can see her now her dark hair hanging down her back and her big shy eyes staring at me from the shadow of the dutch kappie which she wore indeed she seemed to be all eyes like a dikkop or thickheaded plover at any rate i noted little else about her  i pulled up my pony and stared at her feeling very shy and not knowing what to say for a while she stared back at me being afflicted presumably with the same complaint then spoke with an effort in a voice that was very soft and pleasant  are you the little allan quatermain who is coming to learn french with me she asked in dutch  of course i answered in the same tongue which i knew well but why do you call me little missie i am taller than you i added indignantly for when i was young my lack of height was always a sore point with me  i think not she replied but get off that horse and we will measure here against this wall  so i dismounted and having assured herself that i had no heels to my boots i was wearing the kind of rawhide slippers that the boers call veldshoon she took the writing slate which she was carryingit had no frame i remember being in fact but a piece of the material used for roofingand pressing it down tight on my stubbly hair which stuck up then as now made a deep mark in the soft sandstone of the wall with the hard pointed pencil  there she said that is justly done now little allan it is your turn to measure me  so i measured her and behold she was the taller by a whole halfinch  you are standing on tiptoe i said in my vexation  little allan she replied to stand on tiptoe would be to lie before the good lord and when you come to know me better you will learn that though i have a dreadful temper and many other sins i do not lie  i suppose that i looked snubbed and mortified for she went on in her grave grownup way why are you angry because god made me taller than you especially as i am whole months older for my father told me so come let us write our names against these marks so that in a year or two you may see how you outgrow me then with the slate pencil she scratched marie against her mark very deeply so that it might last she said after which i wrote allan against mine  alas within the last dozen years chance took me past maraisfontein once more the house had long been rebuilt but this particular wall yet stood i rode to it and looked and there faintly could still be seen the name marie against the little line and by it the mark that i had made my own name and with it subsequent measurements were gone for in the intervening forty years or so the sandstone had flaked away in places only her autograph remained and when i saw it i think that i felt even worse than i did on finding whose was the old bible that i had bought upon the market square at maritzburg  i know that i rode away hurriedly without even stopping to inquire into whose hands the farm had passed through the peach orchard i rode where the treesperhaps the same perhaps otherswere once more in bloom for the season of the year was that when marie and i first met nor did i draw rein for half a score of miles  but here i may state that marie always stayed just half an inch the taller in body and how much taller in mind and spirit i cannot tell   when we had finished our measuring match marie turned to lead me to the house and pretending to observe for the first time the beautiful bustard and the two koran hanging from my saddle also the klipspringer buck that hans the hottentot carried behind him on his horse asked  did you shoot all these allan quatermain  yes i answered proudly i killed them in four shots and the pauw and koran were flying not sitting which is more than you could have done although you are taller miss marie  i do not know she answered reflectively i can shoot very well with a rifle for my father has taught me but i never would shoot at living things unless i must because i was hungry for i think that to kill is cruel but of course it is different with men she added hastily and no doubt you will be a great hunter one day allan quatermain since you can already aim so well  i hope so i answered blushing at the compliment for i love hunting and when there are so many wild things it does not matter if we kill a few i shot these for you and your father to eat  come then and give them to him he will thank you and she led the way through the gate in the sandstone wall into the yard where the outbuildings stood in which the riding horses and the best of the breeding cattle were kept at night and so past the end of the long onestoried house that was stonebuilt and whitewashed to the stoep or veranda in front of it  on the broad stoep which commanded a pleasant view over rolling parklike country where mimosa and other trees grew in clumps two men were seated drinking strong coffee although it was not yet ten oclock in the morning  hearing the sound of the horses one of these mynheer marais whom i already knew rose from his hidestrung chair he was as i think i have said not in the least like one of the phlegmatic boers either in person or in temperament but rather a typical frenchman although no member of his race had set foot in france for a hundred and fifty years at least so i discovered afterwards for of course in those days i knew nothing of frenchmen  his companion was also french leblanc by name but of a very different stamp in person he was short and stout his large head was bald except for a fringe of curling irongrey hair which grew round it just above the ears and fell upon his shoulders giving him the appearance of a tonsured but dishevelled priest his eyes were blue and watery his mouth was rather weak and his cheeks were pale full and flabby when the heer marais rose i being an observant youth noted that monsieur leblanc took the opportunity to stretch out a rather shaky hand and fill up his coffee cup out of a black bottle which from the smell i judged to contain peach brandy  in fact it may as well be said at once that the poor man was a drunkard which explains how he with all his high education and great ability came to hold the humble post of tutor on a remote boer farm years before when under the influence of drink he had committed some crime in francei dont know what it was and never inquiredand fled to the cape to avoid prosecution here he obtained a professorship at one of the colleges but after a while appeared in the lectureroom quite drunk and lost his employment the same thing happened in other towns till at last he drifted to distant maraisfontein where his employer tolerated his weakness for the sake of the intellectual companionship for which something in his own nature seemed to crave also he looked upon him as a compatriot in distress and a great bond of union between them was their mutual and virulent hatred of england and the english which in the case of monsieur leblanc who in his youth had fought at waterloo and been acquainted with the great emperor was not altogether unnatural  henri maraiss case was different but of that i shall have more to say later  ah marie said her father speaking in dutch so you have found him at last and he nodded towards me adding you should be flattered little man look you this missie has been sitting for two hours in the sun waiting for you although i told her you would not arrive much before ten oclock as your father the prédicant said you would breakfast before you started well it is natural for she is lonely here and you are of an age although of a different race and his face darkened as he spoke the words  father answered marie whose blushes i could see even in the shadow of her cap i was not sitting in the sun but under the shade of a peach tree also i was working out the sums that monsieur leblanc set me on my slate see here they are and she held up the slate which was covered with figures somewhat smudged it is true by the rubbing of my stiff hair and of her cap  then monsieur leblanc broke in speaking in french of which as it chanced i understood the sense for my father had grounded me in that tongue and i am naturally quick at modern languages at any rate i made out that he was asking if i was the little cochon danglais or english pig whom for his sins he had to teach he added that he judged i must be as my hair stuck up on my headi had taken off my hat out of politenessas it naturally would do on a pigs back  this was too much for me so before either of the others could speak i answered in dutch for rage made me eloquent and bold  yes i am he but mynheer if you are to be my master i hope you will not call the english pigs any more to me  indeed gamin that is little scamp and pray what will happen if i am so bold as to repeat that truth  i think mynheer i replied growing white with rage at this new insult the same that has happened to yonder buck and i pointed to the klipspringer behind hanss saddle i mean that i shall shoot you  peste au moins il a du courage cet enfant at least the child is plucky exclaimed monsieur leblanc astonished from that moment i may add he respected me and never again insulted my country to my face  then marais broke out speaking in dutch that i might understand  it is you who should be called pig leblanc not this boy for early as it is you have been drinking look the brandy bottle is half empty is that the example you set to the young speak so again and i turn you out to starve on the veld allan quatermain although as you may have heard i do not like the english i beg your pardon i hope you will forgive the words this sot spoke thinking that you did not understand and he took off his hat and bowed to me quite in a grand manner as his ancestors might have done to a king of france  leblancs face fell then he rose and walked away rather unsteadily as i learned afterwards to plunge his head in a tub of cold water and swallow a pint of new milk which were his favourite antidotes after too much strong drink at any rate when he appeared again half an hour later to begin our lesson he was quite sober and extremely polite  when he had gone my childish anger being appeased i presented the heer marais with my fathers compliments also with the buck and the birds whereof the latter seemed to please him more than the former then my saddlebags were taken to my room a little cupboard of a place next to that occupied by monsieur leblanc and hans was sent to turn the horses out with the others belonging to the farm having first kneehaltered them tightly so that they should not run away home  this done the heer marais showed me the room in which we were to have our lessons one of the sitkammer or sitting chambers whereof unlike most boer stead this house boasted two i remember that the floor was made of daga that is antheap earth mixed with cowdung into which thousands of peachstones had been thrown while it was still soft in order to resist footweara rude but fairly efficient expedient and one not unpleasing to the eye for the rest there was one window opening on to the veranda which in that bright climate admitted a shaded but sufficient light especially as it always stood open the ceiling was of unplastered reeds a large bookcase stood in the corner containing many french works most of them the property of monsieur leblanc and in the centre of the room was the strong rough table made of native yellowwood that once had served as a butchers block i recollect also a coloured print of the great napoleon commanding at some battle in which he was victorious seated upon a white horse and waving a fieldmarshals baton over piles of dead and wounded and near the window hanging to the reeds of the ceiling the nest of a pair of redtailed swallows pretty creatures that notwithstanding the mess they made afforded to marie and me endless amusement in the intervals of our work  when on that day i shuffled shyly into this homely place and thinking myself alone there fell to examining it suddenly i was brought to a standstill by a curious choking sound which seemed to proceed from the shadows behind the bookcase wondering as to its cause i advanced cautiously to discover a pinkclad shape standing in the corner like a naughty child with her head resting against the wall and sobbing slowly  marie marais why do you cry i asked  she turned tossing back the locks of long black hair which hung about her face and answered  allan quatermain i cry because of the shame which has been put upon you and upon our house by that drunken frenchman  what of that i asked he only called me a pig but i think i have shown him that even a pig has tusks  yes she replied but it was not you he meant it was all the english whom he hates and the worst of it is that my father is of his mind he too hates the english and oh i am sure that trouble will come of his hatred trouble and death to many  well if so we have nothing to do with it have we i replied with the cheerfulness of extreme youth  what makes you so sure she said solemnly hush here comes monsieur leblanc    chapter ii the attack on maraisfontein   i do not propose to set out the history of the years which i spent in acquiring a knowledge of french and various other subjects under the tuition of the learned but prejudiced monsieur leblanc indeed there is none to tell sir when monsieur leblanc was sober he was a most excellent and wellinformed tutor although one apt to digress into many side issues which in themselves were not uninstructive when tipsy he grew excited and harangued us generally upon politics and religion or rather its reverse for he was an advanced freethinker although this was a side to his character which however intoxicated he might be he always managed to conceal from the heer marais i may add that a certain childish code of honour prevented us from betraying his views on this and sundry other matters when absolutely drunk which on an average was not more than once a month he simply slept and we did what we pleaseda fact which our childish code of honour also prevented us from betraying  but on the whole we got on very well together for after the incident of our first meeting monsieur leblanc was always polite to me marie he adored as did every one about the place from her father down to the meanest slave need i add that i adored her more than all of them put together first with the love that some children have for each other and afterwards as we became adult with that wider love by which it is at once transcended and made complete strange would it have been if this were not so seeing that we spent nearly half of every week practically alone together and that from the first marie whose nature was as open as the clear noon never concealed her affection for me true it was a very discreet affection almost sisterly or even motherly in its outward and visible aspects as though she could never forget that extra halfinch of height or month or two of age  moreover from a child she was a woman as an irishman might say for circumstances and character had shaped her thus not much more than a year before we met her mother whose only child she was and whom she loved with all her strong and passionate heart died after a lingering illness leaving her in charge of her father and his house i think it was this heavy bereavement in early youth which coloured her nature with a grey tinge of sadness and made her seem so much older than her years  so the time went on i worshipping marie in my secret thought but saying nothing about it and marie talking of and acting towards me as though i were her dear younger brother nobody not even her father or mine or monsieur leblanc took the slightest notice of this queer relationship or seemed to dream that it might lead to ultimate complications which in fact would have been very distasteful to them all for reasons that i will explain  needless to say in due course as they were bound to do those complications arose and under pressure of great physical and moral excitement the truth came out it happened thus  every reader of the history of the cape colony has heard of the great kaffir war of 1835 that war took place for the most part in the districts of albany and somerset so that we inhabitants of cradock on the whole suffered little therefore with the natural optimism and carelessness of danger of dwellers in wild places we began to think ourselves fairly safe from attack indeed so we should have been had it not been for a foolish action on the part of monsieur leblanc  it seems that on a certain sunday a day that i always spent at home with my father monsieur leblanc rode out alone to some hills about five miles distant from maraisfontein he had often been cautioned that this was an unsafe thing to do but the truth is that the foolish man thought he had found a rich copper mine in these hills and was anxious that no one should share his secret therefore on sundays when there were no lessons and the heer marais was in the habit of celebrating family prayers which leblanc disliked it was customary for him to ride to these hills and there collect geological specimens and locate the strike of his copper vein on this particular sabbath which was very hot after he had done whatever he intended to do he dismounted from his horse a tame old beast leaving it loose he partook of the meal he had brought with him which seems to have included a bottle of peach brandy that induced slumber  waking up towards evening he found that his horse had gone and at once jumped to the conclusion that it had been stolen by kaffirs although in truth the animal had but strolled over a ridge in search of grass running hither and thither to seek it he presently crossed this ridge and met the horse apparently being led away by two of the red kaffirs who as was usual were armed with assegais as a matter of fact these men had found the beast and knowing well to whom it belonged were seeking its owner whom earlier in the day they had seen upon the hills in order to restore it to him this however never occurred to the mind of monsieur leblanc excited as it was by the fumes of the peach brandy  lifting the doublebarrelled gun he carried he fired at the first kaffir a young man who chanced to be the eldest son and heir of the chief of the tribe and as the range was very close shot him dead thereon his companion leaving go of the horse ran for his life at him leblanc fired also wounding him slightly in the thigh but no more so that he escaped to tell the tale of what he and every other native for miles round considered a wanton and premeditated murder the deed done the fiery old frenchman mounted his nag and rode quietly home on the road however as the peach brandy evaporated from his brain doubts entered it with the result that he determined to say nothing of his adventure to henri marais who he knew was particularly anxious to avoid any cause of quarrel with the kaffirs  so he kept his own counsel and went to bed before he was up next morning the heer marais suspecting neither trouble nor danger had ridden off to a farm thirty miles or more away to pay its owner for some cattle which he had recently bought leaving his home and his daughter quite unprotected except by leblanc and the few native servants who were really slaves that lived about the place  now on the monday night i went to bed as usual and slept as i have always done through life like a top till about four in the morning when i was awakened by someone tapping at the glass of my window slipping from the bed i felt for my pistol as it was quite dark crept to the window opened it and keeping my head below the level of the sill fearing lest its appearance should be greeted with an assegai asked who was there  me baas said the voice of hans our hottentot servant who it will be remembered had accompanied me as afterrider when first i went to maraisfontein i have bad news listen the baas knows that i have been out searching for the red cow which was lost well i found her and was sleeping by her side under a tree on the veld when about two hours ago a woman whom i know came up to my camp fire and woke me i asked her what she was doing at that hour of the night and she answered that she had come to tell me something she said that some young men of the tribe of the chief quabie who lives in the hills yonder had been visiting at their kraal and that a few hours before a messenger had arrived from the chief saying that they must return at once as this morning at dawn he and all his men were going to attack maraisfontein and kill everyone in it and take the cattle  good god i ejaculated why  because young baas drawled the hottentot from the other side of the window because someone from maraisfonteini think it was the vulture the natives gave this name to leblanc on account of his bald head and hooked noseshot quabies son on sunday when he was holding his horse  good god i said again the old fool must have been drunk when did you say the attack was to beat dawn and i glanced at the stars adding why that will be within less than an hour and the baas marais is away  yes croaked hans and missie mariethink of what the red kaffirs will do with missie marie when their blood is up  i thrust my fist through the window and struck the hottentots toadlike face on which the starlight gleamed faintly  dog i said saddle my mare and the roan horse and get your gun in two minutes i come be swift or i kill you  i go he answered and shot out into the night like a frightened snake  then i began to dress shouting as i dressed till my father and the kaffirs ran into the room as i threw on my things i told them all  send out messengers i said to maraishe is at bothas farmand to all the neighbours send for your lives gather up the friendly kaffirs and ride like hell for maraisfontein dont talk to me father dont talk go and do what i tell you stay give me two guns fill the saddlebags with powder tins and loopers and tie them to my mare oh be quick be quick  now at length they understood and flew this way and that with candles and lanterns two minutes laterit could scarcely have been morei was in front of the stables just as hans led out the bay mare a famous beast that for two years i had saved all my money to buy someone strapped on the saddlebags while i tested the girths someone else appeared with the stout roan stallion that i knew would follow the mare to the death there was not time to saddle him so hans clambered on to his back like a monkey holding two guns under his arm for i carried but one and my doublebarrelled pistol  send off the messengers i shouted to my father if you would see me again send them swiftly and follow with every man you can raise  then we were away with fifteen miles to do and fiveandthirty minutes before the dawn  softly up the slope i said to hans till the beasts get their wind and then ride as you never rode before  those first two miles of rising ground i thought we should never come to the end of them and yet i dared not let the mare out lest she should bucket herself happily she and her companion the stalliona most enduring horse though not so very swifthad stood idle for the last thirty hours and of course had not eaten or drunk since sunset therefore being in fine fettle they were keen for the business also we were light weights  i held in the mare as she spurted up the rise and the horse kept his pace to hers we reached its crest and before us lay the great level plain eleven miles of it and then two miles down hill to maraisfontein  now i said to hans shaking loose the reins keep up if you can  away sped the mare till the keen air of the night sung past my ears and behind her strained the good roan horse with the hottentot monkey on its back oh what a ride was that  further i have gone for a like cause but never at such speed for i knew the strength of the beasts and how long it would last them half an hour of it they might endure more and at this pace they must founder or die  and yet such was the agony of my fear that it seemed to me as though i only crept along the ground like a tortoise  the roan was left behind the sound of his footbeats died away and i was alone with the night and my fear mile added itself to mile for now and again the starlight showed me a stone or the skeleton of some dead beast that i knew once i dashed into a herd of trekking game so suddenly that a springbok unable to stop itself leapt right over me once the mare put her foot in an antbear hole and nearly fell but recovered herselfthanks be to god unharmedand i worked myself back into the saddle whence i had been almost shaken if i had fallen oh if i had fallen  we were near the end of the flat and she began to fail i had overpressed her the pace was too tremendous her speed lessened to an ordinary fast gallop as she faced the gentle rise that led to the brow and now behind me once more i heard the sound of the hoofs of the roan the tireless beast was coming up by the time we reached the edge of the plateau he was quite near not fifty yards behind for i heard him whinny faintly  then began the descent the morning star was setting the east grew grey with light oh could we get there before the dawn could we get there before the dawn that is what my horses hoofs beat out to me  now i could see the mass of the trees about the stead and now i dashed into something though until i was through it i did not know that it was a line of men for the faint light gleamed upon the spear of one of them who had been overthrown  so it was no lie the kaffirs were there as i thought it a fresh horror filled my heart perhaps their murdering work was already done and they were departing  the minute of suspenseor was it but secondsseemed an eternity but it ended at last now i was at the door in the high wall that enclosed the outbuildings at the back of the house and there by an inspiration pulled up the mareglad enough she was to stop poor thingfor it occurred to me that if i rode to the front i should very probably be assegaied and of no further use i tried the door which was made of stout stinkwood planks by design or accident it had been left unbolted as i thrust it open hans arrived with a rush clinging to the roan with his face hidden in its mane the beast pulled up by the side of the mare which it had been pursuing and in the faint light i saw that an assegai was fixed in its flank  five seconds later we were in the yard and locking and barring the door behind us then snatching the saddlebags of ammunition from the horses we left them standing there and i ran for the back entrance of the house bidding hans rouse the natives who slept in the outbuildings and follow with them if any one of them showed signs of treachery he was to shoot him at once i remember that as i went i tore the spear out of the stallions flank and brought it away with me  now i was hammering upon the back door of the house which i could not open after a pause that seemed long a window was thrown wide and a voiceit was mariesasked in frightened tones who was there  i allan quatermain i answered open at once marie you are in great danger the red kaffirs are going to attack the house  she flew to the door in her nightdress and at length i was in the place  thank god you are still safe i gasped put on your clothes while i call leblanc no stay do you call him i must wait here for hans and your slaves  away she sped without a word and presently hans arrived bringing with him eight frightened men who as yet scarcely knew whether they slept or woke  is that all i asked then bar the door and follow me to the sitkammer where the baas keeps his guns  just as we reached it leblanc entered clad in his shirt and trousers and was followed presently by marie with a candle  what is it he asked  i took the candle from maries hand and set it on the floor close to the wall lest it should prove a target for an assegai or a bullet even in those days the kaffirs had a few firearms for the most part captured or stolen from white men then in a few words i told them all  and when did you learn all this asked leblanc in french  at the mission station a little more than half an hour ago i answered looking at my watch  at the station a little more than half an hour ago peste it is not possible you dream or are drunken he cried excitedly  all right monsieur we will argue afterwards i answered meanwhile the kaffirs are here for i rode through them and if you want to save your life stop talking and act marie how many guns are there  four she answered of my fathers two roers and two smaller ones  and how many of these menand i pointed to the kaffirscan shoot  three well and one badly allan  good i said let them load the guns with loopersthat is slugs not bulletsand let the rest stand in the passage with their assegais in case the quabies should try to force the back door  now in this house there were in all but six windows one to each sittingroom one to each of the larger bedrooms these four opening on to the veranda and one at either end of the house to give light and air to the two small bedrooms which were approached through the larger bedrooms at the back fortunately there were no windows for the stead was but one room deep with passage running from the front to the back door a distance of little over fifteen feet  as soon as the guns were loaded i divided up the men a man with a gun at each window the righthand sittingroom window i took myself with two guns marie coming with me to load which like all girls in that wild country she could do well enough so we arranged ourselves in a roughandready fashion and while we were doing it felt quite cheerfulthat is all except monsieur leblanc who i noticed seemed very much disturbed  i do not for one moment mean to suggest that he was afraid as he might well have been for he was an extremely brave and even rash man but i think the knowledge that his drunken act had brought this terrible danger upon us all weighed on his mind also there may have been more some subtle foreknowledge of the approaching end to a life that when all allowances were made could scarcely be called well spent at any rate he fidgeted at his windowplace cursing beneath his breath and soon as i saw out of the corner of my eye began to have recourse to his favourite bottle of peach brandy which he fetched out of a cupboard  the slaves too were gloomy as all natives are when suddenly awakened in the night but as the light grew they became more cheerful it is a poor kaffir that does not love fighting especially when he has a gun and a white man or two to lead him  now that we had made such little preparations as we could which by the way i supplemented by causing some furniture to be piled up against the front and back doors there came a pause which speaking for my own partbeing after all only a lad at the timei found very trying to the nerves there i stood at my window with the two guns one a doublebarrel and one a single roer or elephant gun that took a tremendous charge but both be it remembered flint locks for although percussion caps had been introduced we were a little behind the times in cradock there too crouched on the ground beside me holding the ammunition ready for reloading her long black hair flowing about her shoulders was marie marais now a wellgrown young woman in the intense silence she whispered to me  why did you come here allan you were safe yonder and now you will probably be killed  to try to save you i answered simply what would you have had me do  to try to save me oh that is good of you but you should have thought of yourself  then i should still have thought of you marie  why allan  because you are myself and more than myself if anything happened to you what would my life be to me  i dont quite understand allan she replied staring down at the floor tell me what do you mean  mean you silly girl i said what can i mean except that i love you which i thought you knew long ago  oh she said now i understand then she raised herself upon her knees and held up her face to me to kiss adding there thats my answer the first and perhaps the last thank you allan dear i am glad to have heard that for you see one or both of us may die soon  as she spoke the words an assegai flashed through the windowplace passing just between our heads so we gave over lovemaking and turned our attention to war  now the light was beginning to grow flowing out of the pearly eastern sky but no attack had yet been delivered although that one was imminent that spear fixed in the plaster of the wall behind us showed clearly perhaps the kaffirs had been frightened by the galloping of horses through their line in the dark not knowing how many of them there might have been or perhaps they were waiting to see better where to deliver their onset these were the ideas that occurred to me but both were wrong  they were staying their hands until the mist lifted a little from the hollow below the stead where the cattle kraals were situated for while the fog remained they could not see to get the beasts out these they wished to make sure of and drive away before the fight began lest during its progress something should happen to rob them of their booty  presently from these kraals where the heer maraiss horned beasts and sheep were penned at night about one hundred and fifty of the former and some two thousand of the latter to say nothing of the horses for he was a large and prosperous farmer there arose a sound of bellowing neighing and baaing and with it that of the shouting of men  they are driving off the stock said marie oh my poor father he is ruined it will break his heart  bad enough i answered but there are things that might be worse hark  as i spoke there came a sound of stamping feet and of a wild war chant then in the edge of the mist that hung above the hollow where the cattle kraals were figures appeared moving swiftly to and fro looking ghostly and unreal the kaffirs were marshalling their men for the attack a minute more and it had begun on up the slope they came in long wavering lines several hundreds of them whistling and screaming shaking their spears their warplumes and hair trappings blown back by the breeze the lust of slaughter in their rolling eyes two or three of them had guns which they fired as they ran but where the bullets went i do not know over the house probably  i called out to leblanc and the kaffirs not to shoot till i did for i knew that they were poor marksmen and that much depended upon our first volley being effective then as the captain of this attack came within thirty yards of the stoepfor now the light growing swiftly was strong enough to enable me to distinguish him by his apparel and the rifle which he heldi loosed at him with the roer and shot him dead indeed the heavy bullet passing through his body mortally wounded another of the quabies behind these were the first men that i ever killed in war  as they fell leblanc and the rest of our people fired also the slugs from their guns doing great execution at that range which was just long enough to allow them to scatter when the smoke cleared a little i saw that nearly a dozen men were down and that the rest dismayed by this reception had halted if they had come on then while we were loading doubtless they might have rushed the place but being unused to the terrible effects of firearms they paused amazed a number of them twenty or thirty perhaps clustered about the bodies of the fallen kaffirs and seizing my second gun i fired both barrels at these with such fearful effect that the whole regiment took to their heels and fled leaving their dead and wounded on the ground as they ran our servants cheered but i called to them to be silent and load swiftly knowing well that the enemy would soon return  for a time however nothing happened although we could hear them talking somewhere near the cattle kraal about a hundred and fifty yards away marie took advantage of this pause i remember to fetch food and distribute it among us i for one was glad enough to get it  now the sun was up a sight for which i thanked heaven for at any rate we could no longer be surprised also with the daylight some of my fear passed away since darkness always makes danger twice as terrible to man and beast whilst we were still eating and fortifying the windowplaces as best we could so as to make them difficult to enter a single kaffir appeared waving above his head a stick to which was tied a white oxtail as a sign of truce i ordered that no one should fire and when the man who was a bold fellow had reached the spot where the dead captain lay called to him asking his business for i could speak his language well  he answered that he had come with a message from quabie this was the message that quabies eldest son had been cruelly murdered by the fat white man called vulture who lived with the heer marais and that he quabie would have blood for blood still he did not wish to kill the young white chieftainess that was marie or the others in the house with whom he had no quarrel therefore if we would give up the fat white man that he might make him die slowly quabie would be content with his life and with the cattle that he had already taken by way of a fine and leave us and the house unmolested  now when leblanc understood the nature of this offer he went perfectly mad with mingled fear and rage and began to shout and swear in french  be silent i said we do not mean to surrender you although you have brought all this trouble on us your chance of life is as good as ours are you not ashamed to act so before these black people  when at last he grew more or less quiet i called to the messenger that we white folk were not in the habit of abandoning each other and that we would live or die together still i bade him tell quabie that if we did die the vengeance taken on him and all his people would be to wipe them out till not one of them was left and therefore that he would do well not to cause any of our blood to flow also i added that we had thirty men in the house which of course was a lie and plenty of ammunition and food so that if he chose to continue the attack it would be the worse for him and his tribe  on hearing this the herald shouted back that we should every one of us be dead before noon if he had his way still he would report my words faithfully to quabie and bring his answer  then he turned and began to walk off just as he did so a shot was fired from the house and the man pitched forward to the ground then rose again and staggered back towards his people with his right shoulder shattered and his arm swinging  who did that i asked through the smoke which prevented me from seeing  i parbleu shouted leblanc sapristi that black devil wanted to torture me leblanc the friend of the great napoleon well at least i have tortured him whom i meant to kill  yes you fool i answered and we too shall be tortured because of your wickedness you have shot a messenger carrying a flag of truce and that the quabies will never forgive oh i tell you that you have hit us as well as him who had it not been for you might have been spared  these words i said quite quietly and in dutch so that our kaffirs might understand them though really i was boiling with wrath  but leblanc did not answer quietly  who are you he shouted you wretched little englishman who dare to lecture me leblanc the friend of the great napoleon  now i drew my pistol and walked up to the man  be quiet you drunken sot i said for i guessed that he had drunk more of the brandy in the darkness if you are not quiet and do not obey me who am in command here either i will blow your brains out or i will give you to these men and i pointed to hans and the kaffirs who had gathered round him muttering ominously do you know what they will do with you they will throw you out of the house and leave you to settle your quarrel with quabie alone  leblanc looked first at the pistol and next at the faces of the natives and saw something in one or other of them or in both that caused him to change his note  pardon monsieur he said i was excited i knew not what i said if you are young you are brave and clever and i will obey you and he went to his station and began to reload his gun as he did so a great shout of fury rose from the cattle kraal the wounded herald had reached the quabies and was telling them of the treachery of the white people    chapter iii the rescue   the second quabie advance did not begin till about halfpast seven even savages love their lives and appreciate the fact that wounds hurt very much and these were no exception to the rule their first rush had taught them a bitter lesson of which the fruit was evident in the crippled or dying men who rolled to and fro baked in the hot sun within a few yards of the stoep not to speak of those who would never stir again now the space around the house being quite open and bare of cover it was obvious that it could not be stormed without further heavy losses in order to avoid such losses a civilised people would have advanced by means of trenches but of these the quabies knew nothing moreover digging tools were lacking to them  so it came about that they hit upon another and in the circumstances a not inefficient expedient the cattle kraal was built of rough unmortared stones those stones they took each man carrying two or three which rushing forward they piled up into scattered rough defences of about eighteen inches or two feet high these defences were instantly occupied by as many warriors as could take shelter behind them lying one on top of the other of course those savages who carried the first stones were exposed to our fire with the result that many of them fell but there were always plenty more behind as they were being built at a dozen different points and we had but seven guns before we could reload a particular schanz of which perhaps the first builders had fallen would be raised so high that our slugs could no longer hurt those who lay behind it also our supply of ammunition was limited and the constant expenditure wasted it so much that at length only about six charges per man remained at last indeed i was obliged to order the firing to cease so that we might reserve ourselves for the great rush which could not now be much delayed  finding that they were no longer harassed by our bullets the quabies advanced more rapidly directing their attack upon the south end of the house where there was but one window and thus avoiding the fire that might be poured upon them from the various openings under the veranda at first i wondered why they selected this end till marie reminded me that this part of the dwelling was thatched with reeds whereas the rest of the building which had been erected more recently was slated  their object was to fire the roof so soon as their last wall was near enough that is about halfpast ten of the clock they began to throw into the thatch assegais to which were attached bunches of burning grass many of these went out but at length as we gathered from their shouts one caught within ten minutes this part of the house was burning  now our state became desperate we retreated across the central passage fearing lest the blazing rafters should fall upon our natives who were losing heart and would no longer stay beneath them but the quabies more bold clambered in through the south window and attacked us in the doorway of the larger sittingroom  here the final fight began as they rushed at us we shot till they went down in heaps almost at our last charge they gave back and just then the roof fell upon them  oh what a terrible scene was that the dense clouds of smoke the screams of the trapped and burning men the turmoil the agony  the front door was burst in by a flank onslaught  leblanc and a slave who was near him were seized by black clawlike hands and dragged out what became of the frenchman i do not know for the natives hauled him away but i fear his end must have been dreadful as he was taken alive the servant i saw them assegai so at least he died at once i fired my last shot killing a fellow who was flourishing a battleaxe then dashed the butt of the gun into the face of the man behind him felling him and seizing marie by the hand dragged her back into the northernmost roomthat in which i was accustomed to sleepand shut and barred the door  allan she gasped allan dear it is finished i cannot fall into the hands of those men kill me allan  all right i answered i will i have my pistol one barrel for you and one for me  no no perhaps you might escape after all but you see i am a woman and dare not risk it come now i am ready and she knelt down opening her arms to receive the embrace of death and looked up at me with her lovely pitiful eyes  it doesnt do to kill ones love and live on oneself i answered hoarsely we have got to go together and i cocked both barrels of the pistol  the hottentot hans who was in the place with us saw and understood  it is right it is best he said and turning he hid his eyes with his hand  wait a little allan she exclaimed it will be time when the door is down and perhaps god may still help us  he may i answered doubtfully but i would not count on it nothing can save us now unless the others come to rescue us and thats too much to hope for  then a thought struck me and i added with a dreadful laugh i wonder where we shall be in five minutes  oh together dear together for always in some new and beautiful world for you do love me dont you as i love you maybe thats better than living on here where we should be sure to have troubles and perhaps be separated at last  i nodded my head for though i loved life i loved marie more and i felt that we were making a good end after a brave fight they were battering at the door now but thank heaven marais had made strong doors and it held a while  the wood began to give at last an assegai appeared through a shattered plank but hans stabbed along the line of it with the spear he held that which i had snatched from the flank of the horse and it was dropped with a scream black hands were thrust through the hole and the hottentot hacked and cut at them with the spear but others came more than he could pierce and the whole doorframe began to be dragged outwards  now marie be ready i gasped lifting the pistol  oh christ receive me she answered faintly it wont hurt much will it allan  you will never feel anything i whispered as with the cold sweat pouring from me i placed the muzzle within an inch of her forehead and began to press the trigger my god yes i actually began to press the trigger softly and steadily for i wished to make no mistake  it was at this very moment above the dreadful turmoil of the roaring flames the yells of the savages and the shrieks and groans of wounded and dying men that i heard the sweetest sound which ever fell upon my earsthe sound of shots being fired many shots and quite close by  great heaven i screamed the boers are here to save us marie i will hold the door while i can if i fall scramble through the windowyou can do it from the chest beneathdrop to the ground and run towards the firing theres a chance for you yet a good chance  and you you she moaned i would rather die with you  do what i bid you i answered savagely and bounded forward towards the rocking door  it was falling outward it fell and on the top of it appeared two great savages waving broad spears i lifted the pistol and the bullet that had been meant for maries brain scattered that of the first of them and the bullet which had been meant for my heart pierced that of the second they both went down dead there in the doorway  i snatched up one of their spears and glanced behind me marie was climbing on to the chest i could just see her through the thickening smoke another quabie rushed on hans and i received him on the points of our assegais but so fierce was his charge that they went through him as though he were nothing and being but light both of us were thrown backwards to the ground i scrambled to my feet again defenceless now for the spear was broken in the kaffir and awaited the end looking back once more i saw that marie had either failed to get through the window or abandoned the attempt at any rate she was standing near the chest supporting herself by her right hand in my despair i seized the blade end of the broken assegai and dragged it from the body of the kaffir thinking that it would serve to kill her then turned to do the deed  but even as i turned i heard a voice that i knew well shout do you live marie and in the doorway appeared no savage but henri marais  slowly i backed before him for i could not speak and the last dreadful effort of my will seemed to thrust me towards marie i reached her and threw my hand that still held the gory blade round her neck then as darkness came over me i heard her cry  dont shoot father it is allan allan who has saved my life  after that i remember no more nor did she for a while for we both fell to the ground senseless   when my senses returned to me i found myself lying on the floor of the wagonhouse in the back yard glancing from my halfopened eyes for i was still speechless i saw marie white as a sheet her hair all falling about her dishevelled dress she was seated on one of those boxes that we put on the front of wagons to drive from voorkissies they are called and as her eyes were watching me i knew that she lived by her stood a tall and dark young man whom i had never seen before he was holding her hand and looking at her anxiously and even then i felt angry with him also i saw other things for instance my old father leaning down and looking at me anxiously and outside in the yard for there were no doors to the wagonhouse a number of men with guns in their hands some of whom i knew and others who were strangers in the shadow too against the wall stood my blood mare with her head hanging down and trembling all over not far from her the roan lay upon the ground its flank quite red  i tried to rise and could not then feeling pain in my left thigh looked and saw that it was red also as a matter of fact an assegai had gone half through it and hit upon the bone although i never felt it at the time this wound was dealt to me by that great quabie whom hans and i had received upon our spears doubtless as he fell hans by the way was there also an awful and yet a ludicrous spectacle for the quabie had fallen right on the top of him and lain so with results that may be imagined there he sat upon the ground looking upwards gasping with his fishlike mouth each gasp i remember fashioned itself into the word allemachte that is almighty a favourite dutch expression  marie was the first to perceive that i had come to life again shaking herself free from the clasp of the young man she staggered towards me and fell upon her knees at my side muttering words that i could not catch for they choked in her throat then hans took in the situation and wriggling his unpleasant self to my other side lifted my hand and kissed it next my father spoke saying  praise be to god he lives allan my son i am proud of you you have done your duty as an englishman should  had to save my own skin if i could thank you father i muttered  why as an englishman more than any other sort of man mynheer prédicant asked the tall stranger speaking in dutch although he evidently understood our language  the point is one that i will not argue now sir answered my father drawing himself up but if what i hear is true there was a frenchman in that house who did not do his duty and if you belong to the same nation i apologise to you  thank you sir as it happens i do half the rest of me is portuguese not english thank god  god is thanked for many things that must surprise him replied my father in a suave voice  at that moment this rather disagreeable conversation which even then both angered and amused me faintly came to an end for the heer marais entered the place  as might have been expected in so excitable a man he was in a terrible state of agitation thankfulness at the escape of his only beloved child rage with the kaffirs who had tried to kill her and extreme distress at the loss of most of his propertyall these conflicting emotions boiled together in his breast like antagonistic elements in a crucible  the resulting fumes were particoloured and overpowering he rushed up to me blessed and thanked me for he had learnt something of the story of the defence called me a young hero and so forth hoping that god would reward me here i may remark that he never did poor man then he began to rave at leblanc who had brought all this dreadful disaster upon his house saying that it was a judgment on himself for having sheltered an atheist and a drunkard for so many years just because he was french and a man of intellect someone my father as a matter of fact who with all his prejudices possessed a great sense of justice reminded him that the poor frenchman had expiated or perchance was now expiating any crimes that he might have committed  this turned the stream of his invective on to the quabie kaffirs who had burned part of his house and stolen nearly all his stock making him from a rich man into a poor one in a single hour he shouted for vengeance on the black devils and called on all there to help him to recover his beasts and kill the thieves most of those presentthey were about thirty in all not counting the kaffir and hottentot afterridersanswered that they were willing to attack the quabies being residents in the district they felt and indeed said that his case today might and probably would be their case tomorrow therefore they were prepared to ride at once  then it was that my father intervened  heeren he said it seems to me that before you seek vengeance which as the book tells us is the lords it would be well especially for the heer marais to return thanks for what has been saved to him i mean his daughter who might now very easily have been dead or worse  he added that goods came or went according to the chances of fortune but a beloved human life once lost could not be restored this precious life had been preserved to him he would not say by manhere he glanced at mebut by the ruler of the world acting through man perhaps those present did not quite understand what he my father had learned from hans the hottentot that i his son had been about to blow out the brains of marie marais and my own when the sound of the shots of those who had been gathered through the warning which i left before i rode from the mission station had stayed my hand he called upon the said hans and marie herself to tell them the story since i was too weak to do so  thus adjured the little hottentot smothered as he was in blood stood up in the simple dramatic style characteristic of his race he narrated all that had happened since he met the woman on the veld but little over twelve hours before till the arrival of the rescue party never have i seen a tale followed with deeper interest and when at last hans pointed to me lying on the ground and said there is he who did these things which it might be thought no man could dohe but a boy even from those phlegmatic dutchmen there came a general cheer but lifting myself upon my hands i called out  whatever i did this poor hottentot did also and had it not been for him i could not have done anythingfor him and the two good horses  then they cheered again and marie rising said  yes father to these two i owe my life  after this my father offered his prayer of thanksgiving in very bad dutchfor having begun to learn it late in life he never could really master that languageand the stalwart boers kneeling round him said amen as the reader may imagine the scene with all its details which i will not repeat was both remarkable and impressive  what followed this prayer i do not very well remember for i became faint from exhaustion and the loss of blood i believe however that the fire having been extinguished they removed the dead and wounded from the unburnt portion of the house and carried me into the little room where marie and i had gone through that dreadful scene when i went within an ace of killing her after this the boers and maraiss kaffirs or rather slaves whom he had collected from where they lived away from the house to the number of thirty or forty started to follow the defeated quabie leaving about ten of their number as a guard here i may mention that of the seven or eight men who slept in the outbuildings and had fought with us two were killed in the fight and two wounded the remainder one way or another managed to escape unhurt so that in all this fearful struggle in which we inflicted so terrible a punishment upon the kaffirs we lost only three slain including the frenchman leblanc  as to the events of the next three days i know only what i have been told for practically during all that time i was off my head from loss of blood complicated with fever brought on by the fearful excitement and exertion i had undergone all i can recall is a vision of marie bending over me and making me take food of some sortmilk or soup i supposefor it seems i would touch it from no other hand also i had visions of the tall shape of my whitehaired father who like most missionaries understood something of surgery and medicine attending to the bandages on my thigh afterwards he told me that the spear had actually cut the walls of the big artery but by good fortune without going through them another fortieth of an inch and i should have bled to death in ten minutes  on this third day my mind was brought back from its wanderings by the sound of a great noise about the house above which i heard the voice of marais storming and shouting and that of my father trying to calm him presently marie entered the room drawingto behind her a kaffir karoos which served as a curtain for the door it will be remembered had been torn out seeing that i was awake and reasonable she flew to my side with a little cry of joy and kneeling down kissed me on the forehead  you have been very ill allan but i know you will recover now while we are alone which she added slowly and with meaning i dare say we shall not be much in future i want to thank you from my heart for all that you did to save me had it not been for you oh had it not been for youand she glanced at the blood stains on the earthen floor put her hands before her eyes and shuddered  nonsense marie i answered taking her hand feebly enough for i was very weak anyone else would have done as much even if they did not love you as i do let us thank god that it was not in vain but what is all that noise have the quabies come back  she shook her head  no the boers have come back from hunting them  and did they catch them and recover the cattle  not so they only found some wounded men whom they shot and the body of monsieur leblanc with his head cut off taken away with other bits of him for medicine they say to make the warriors brave quabie has burnt his kraal and fled with all his people to join the other kaffirs in the big mountains not a cow or a sheep did they find except a few that had fallen exhausted and those had their throats cut my father wanted to follow them and attack the red kaffirs in the mountains but the others would not go they said there are thousands of them and that it would be a mad war from which not one of them would return alive he is wild with grief and rage for allan dear we are almost ruined especially as the british government are freeing the slaves and only going to give us a very small price not a third of their value but hark he is calling me and you must not talk much or excite yourself lest you should be ill again now you have to sleep and eat and get strong afterwards dear you may talk and bending down once more she blessed and kissed me then rose and glided away    chapter iv hernando pereira   several more days passed before i was allowed out of that little warstained room of which i grew to hate the very sight i entreated my father to take me into the air but he would not saying that he feared lest any movement should cause the bleeding to begin again or even the cut artery to burst moreover the wound was not healing very well the spear that caused it having been dirty or perhaps used to skin dead animals which caused some dread of gangrene that in those days generally meant death as it chanced although i was treated only with cold water for antiseptics were then unknown my young and healthy blood triumphed and no gangrene appeared  what made those days even duller was that during them i saw very little of marie who now only entered the place in the company of her father once i managed to ask her why she did not come oftener and alone her face grew troubled as she whispered back because it is not allowed allan and then without another word left the place  why i wondered to myself was it not allowed and an answer sprang up in my mind doubtless it was because of that tall young man who had argued with my father in the wagonhouse marie had never spoken to me of him but from the hottentot hans and my father i managed to collect a good deal of information concerning him and his business  it appeared that he was the only child of henri maraiss sister who married a portuguese from delagoa bay of the name of pereira who had come to the cape colony to trade many years before and settled there both he and his wife were dead and their son hernando maries cousin had inherited all their very considerable wealth  indeed now i remembered having heard this hernando or hernan as the boers called him for short spoken of in past years by the heer marais as the heir to great riches since his father had made a large fortune by trading in wine and spirits under some government monopoly which he held often he had been invited to visit maraisfontein but his parents who doted on him and lived in one of the settled districts not far from cape town would never allow him to travel so far from them into these wild regions  since their death however things had changed it appeared that on the decease of old pereira the governor of the colony had withdrawn the wine and spirit monopoly which he said was a job and a scandal an act that made hernando pereira very angry although he needed no more money and had caused him to throw himself heart and soul into the schemes of the disaffected boers indeed he was now engaged as one of the organisers of the great trek which was in contemplation in fact it had already begun into the partially explored land beyond the borders of the colony where the dutch farmers proposed to set up dominions of their own  that was the story of hernando pereira who was to benay who had already becomemy rival for the hand of the sweet and beautiful marie marais  one night when my father and i were alone in the little room where he slept with me and he had finished reading his evening portion of scripture aloud i plucked up my courage to tell him that i loved marie and wished to marry her and that we had plighted our troth during the attack of the kaffirs on the stead  love and war indeed he said looking at me gravely but showing no sign of surprise for it appeared that he was already acquainted with our secret this was not wonderful for he informed me afterwards that during my delirium i had done nothing except rave of marie in the most endearing terms also marie herself when i was at my worst had burst into tears before him and told him straight out that she loved me  love and war indeed he repeated adding kindly my poor boy i fear that you have fallen into great trouble  why father i asked is it wrong that we should love each other  not wrong but in the circumstances quite naturali should have foreseen that it was sure to happen no not wrong but most unfortunate to begin with i do not wish to see you marry a foreigner and become mixed up with these disloyal boers i hoped that one day a good many years hence for you are only a boy allan you would find an english wife and i still hope it  never i ejaculated  never is a long word allan and i dare say that what you are so sure is impossible will happen after all words that made me angry enough at the time though in after years i often thought of them  but he went on putting my own wishes perhaps prejudices aside i think your suit hopeless although henri marais likes you well enough and is grateful to you just now because you have saved the daughter whom he loves you must remember that he hates us english bitterly i believe that he would almost as soon see his girl marry a halfcaste as an englishman and especially a poor englishman as you are and unless you can make money must remain i have little to leave you allan  i might make money father out of ivory for instance you know i am a good shot  allan i do not think you will ever make much money it is not in your blood or if you do you will not keep it we are an old race and i know our record up to the time of henry viii at any rate not one of us was ever commercially successful let us suppose however that you should prove yourself the exception to the rule it cant be done at once can it fortunes dont grow in a night like mushrooms  no i suppose not father still one might have some luck  possibly but meanwhile you have to fight against a man who has the luck or rather the money in his pocket  what do you mean i asked sitting up  i mean hernando pereira allan maraiss nephew who they say is one of the richest men in the colony i know that he wishes to marry marie  how do you know it father  because marais told me so this afternoon probably with a purpose he was struck with her beauty when he first saw her after your escape which he had not done since she was a child and as he stopped to guard the house while the rest went after the quabieswell you can guess such things go quickly with these southern men  i hid my face in the pillow biting my lips to keep back the groan that was ready to burst from them for i felt the hopelessness of the situation how could i compete with this rich and fortunate man who naturally would be favoured of my betrotheds father then on the blackness of my despair rose a star of hope i could not but perchance marie might she was very strongnatured and very faithful she was not to be bought and i doubted whether she could be frightened  father i said i may never marry marie but i dont think that hernando pereira ever will either  why not my boy  because she loves me father and she is not one to change i believe that she would rather die  then she must be a very unusual sort of woman still it may be so the future will tell to those who live to see it i can only pray and trust that whatever happens will be for the best for both of you she is a sweet girl and i like her well although she may be boeror french and now allan we have talked enough and you had better go to sleep you must not excite yourself you know or it may set up new inflammation in the wound  go to sleep must not excite yourself i kept muttering those words for hours serving them up in my mind with a spice of bitter thought at last torpor or weakness overcame me and i fell into a kind of net of bad dreams which thank heaven i have now forgotten yet when certain events happened subsequently i always thought and indeed still think that these or something like them had been a part of those evil dreams  on the morning following this conversation i was at length allowed to be carried to the stoep where they laid me down wrapped in a very dirty blanket upon a rimpistrung bench or primitive sofa when i had satisfied my first delight at seeing the sun and breathing the fresh air i began to study my surroundings in front of the house or what remained of it so arranged that the last of them at either end we made fast to the extremities of the stoep was arranged an arc of wagons placed as they are in a laager and protected underneath by earth thrown up in a mound and by boughs of the mimosa thorn evidently these wagons in which the guard of boers and armed natives who still remained on the place slept at night were set thus as a defence against a possible attack by the quabies or other kaffirs  during the daytime however the centre wagon was drawn a little on one side to leave a kind of gate through this opening i saw that a long wall also semicircular had been built outside of them enclosing a space large enough to contain at night all the cattle and horses that were left to the heer marais together with those of his friends who evidently did not wish to see their oxen vanish into the depths of the mountains in the middle of this extemporised kraal was a long low mound which as i learned afterwards contained the dead who fell in the attack on the house the two slaves who had been killed in the defence were buried in the little garden that marie had made and the headless body of leblanc in a small walled place to the right of the stead where lay some of its former owners and one or two relatives of the heer marais including his wife  whilst i was noting these things marie appeared at the end of the veranda having come round the burnt part of the house followed by hernan pereira catching sight of me she ran to the side of my couch with outstretched arms as though she intended to embrace me then seeming to remember stopped suddenly at my side coloured to her hair and said in an embarrassed voice  oh heer allanshe had never called me heer in her life beforei am so glad to find you out how have you been getting on  pretty well i thank you i answered biting my lips as you would have learnt marie had you come to see me  next moment i was sorry for the words for i saw her eyes fill with tears and her breast shake with something like a sob however it was pereira and not marie who answered for at the moment i believe she could not speak  my good boy he said in a pompous patronising way and in english which he knew perfectly i think that my cousin has had plenty to do caring for all these people during the last few days without running to look at the cut in your leg however i am glad to hear from your worthy father that it is almost well and that you will soon be able to play games again like others of your age  now it was my turn to be unable to speak and to feel my eyes fill with tears tears of rage for remember that i was still very feeble but marie spoke for me  yes cousin hernan she said in a cold voice thank god the heer allan quatermain will soon be able to play games again such bloody games as the defence of maraisfontein with eight men against all the quabie horde then heaven help those who stand in front of his rifle and she glanced at the mound that covered the dead kaffirs many of whom as a matter of fact i had killed  oh no offence no offence marie said pereira in his smooth rich voice i did not want to laugh at your young friend who doubtless is as brave as they say all englishmen are and who fought well when he was lucky enough to have the chance of protecting you my dear cousin but after all you know he is not the only one who can hold a gun straight as you seem to think which i shall be happy to prove to him in a friendly fashion when he is stronger  here he stepped forward a pace and looked down at me then added with a laugh allemachte i fear that wont be just at present why the lad looks as though one might blow him away like a feather  still i said nothing only glanced up at this tall and splendid man standing above me in his fine clothes for he was richly dressed as the fashion of the time went with his high colouring broad shoulders and face full of health and vigour mentally i compared him with myself as i was after my fever and loss of blood a poor whitefaced rat of a lad with stubbly brown hair on my head and only a little down on my chin with arms like sticks and a dirty blanket for raiment how could i compare with him in any way what chance had i against this opulent bully who hated me and all my race and in whose hands even if i were well i should be nothing but a child  and yet and yet as i lay there humiliated and a mock an answer came into my mind and i felt that whatever might be the case with my outward form in spirit in courage in determination and in ability in all in short that really makes a man i was more than pereiras equal yes and that by the help of these qualities poor as i was and frail as i seemed to be i would beat him at the last and keep for myself what i had won the prize of maries love  such were the thoughts which passed through me and i think that something of the tenor of them communicated itself to marie who often could read my heart before my lips spoke at any rate her demeanour changed she drew herself up her fine nostrils expanded and a proud look came into her dark eyes as she nodded her head and murmured in a voice so low that i think i alone caught her words  yes yes have no fear  pereira was speaking again he had turned aside to strike the steel of his tinderbox and was now blowing the spark to a glow before lighting his big pipe  by the way heer allan he said that is a very good mare of yours she seems to have done the distance between the mission station and maraisfontein in wonderful time as for the matter of that the roan did too i have taken a fancy to her after a gallop on her back yesterday just to give her some exercise and although i dont know that she is quite up to my weight ill buy her  the mare is not for sale heer pereira i said speaking for the first time and i do not remember giving anyone leave to exercise her  no your father did or was it that ugly little beast of a hottentot i forget which as for her not being for salewhy in this world everything is for sale at a price ill give youlet me seeoh what does the money matter when one has plenty ill give you a hundred english pounds for that mare and dont you think me a fool i tell you i mean to get it back and more at the great races down in the south now what do you say  i say that the mare is not for sale heer pereira then a thought struck me or an inspiration and as has always been my fashion i acted on it at once but i added slowly if you like when i am a bit stronger ill shoot you a match for her you staking your hundred pounds and i staking the mare  pereira burst out laughing  here friends he called to some of the boers who were strolling up to the house for their morning coffee this little englishman wants to shoot a match with me staking that fine mare of his against a hundred pounds british against me hernando pereira who have won every prize at shooting that ever i entered for no no friend allan i am not a thief i will not rob you of your mare  now among those boers chanced to be the celebrated heer pieter retief a very fine man of high character then in the prime of life and of huguenot descent like heer marais he had been appointed by the government one of the frontier commandants but owing to some quarrel with the lieutenantgovernor sir andries stockenstrom had recently resigned that office and at this date was engaged in organizing the trek from the colony i now saw retief for the first time and ah then little did i think how and where i should see him for the last but all that is a matter of history of which i shall have to tell later  now while pereira was mocking and bragging of his prowess pieter retief looked at me and our eyes met  allemachte he exclaimed is that the young man who with half a dozen miserable hottentots and slaves held this stead for five hours against all the quabie tribe and kept them out  somebody said that it was remarking that i had been about to shoot marie marais and myself when help came  then heer allan quatermain said retief give me your hand and he took my poor wasted fingers in his big palm adding your father must be proud of you today as i should be if i had such a son god in heaven where will you stop if you can go so far while you are yet a boy friends since i came here yesterday i have got the whole story for myself from the kaffirs and from this mooi meisje pretty young lady and he nodded towards marie also i have gone over the ground and the house and have seen where each man fellit is easy by the blood marksmost of them shot by yonder englishman except one of the last three whom he killed with a spear well i tell you that never in all my experience have i known a better arranged or a more finely carried out defence against huge odds perhaps the best part of it too was the way in which this young lion acted on the information he received and the splendid ride he made from the mission station again i say that his father should be proud of him  well if it comes to that i am mynheer said my father who just then joined us after his morning walk although i beg you to say no more lest the lad should grow vain  bah replied retief fellows of his stamp are not vain it is your big talkers who are vain and he glanced out of the corner of his shrewd eye at pereira your turkey cocks with all their tails spread i think this little chap must be such another as that great sailor of yourswhat do you call him nelsonwho beat the french into frothed eggs and died to live for ever he was small too they say and weak in the stomach  i must confess i do not think that praise ever sounded sweeter in my ears than did these words of the commandant retief uttered as they were just when i felt crushed to the dirt moreover as i saw by maries and i may add by my fathers face there were other ears to which they were not ungrateful the boers also brave and honest men enough evidently appreciated them for they said  ja ja das ist recht that is right  only pereira turned his broad back and busied himself with relighting his pipe which had gone out  then retief began again  what is it you were calling us to listen to mynheer pereira that this heer allan quatermain had offered to shoot you a match well why not if he can hit kaffirs running at him with spears as he has done he may be able to hit other things also you say that you wont rob him of his moneyno it was his beautiful horsebecause you have taken so many prizes shooting at targets but did you ever hit a kaffir running at you with an assegai mynheer you who live down there where everything is safe if so i never heard of it  pereira answered that he did not understand me to propose a shooting match at kaffirs charging with assegais but at something elsehe knew not what  quite so said retief well mynheer allan what is it that you do propose  that we should stand in the great kloof between the two vleis yonderthe heer marais knows the placewhen the wild geese flight over an hour before sunset and that he who brings down six of them in the fewest shots shall win the match  if our guns are loaded with loopers that will not be difficult said pereira  with loopers you would seldom kill a bird mynheer i replied for they come over from seventy to a hundred yards up no i mean with rifles  allemachte broke in a boer you will want plenty of ammunition to hit a goose at that height with a bullet  that is my offer i said to which i add this that when twenty shots have been fired by each man he who has killed the most birds wins even if he has not brought down the full six does the heer pereira accept if so i will venture to match myself against him although he has won so many prizes  the heer pereira seemed extremely doubtful so doubtful indeed that the boers began to laugh at him in the end he grew rather angry and said that he was willing to shoot me at bucks or swallows or fireflies or anything else i liked  then let it be at geese i answered since it is likely to be sometime before i am strong enough to ride after buck or other wild things  so the terms of the match were formally written down by marie as my father although he took a keen sporting interest in the result would have nothing to do with what he called a wager for money and except myself there was no one else present with sufficient scholarship to pen a long document then we both signed them hernan pereira not very willingly i thought and if my recovery was sufficiently rapid the date was fixed for that day week in case of any disagreement the heer retief who was staying at maraisfontein or in its neighbourhood for a while was appointed referee and stakeholder it was also arranged that neither of us should visit the appointed place or shoot at the geese before the match still we were at liberty to practise as much as we liked at anything else in the interval and to make use of any kind of rifle that suited us best  by the time that these arrangements were finished feeling quite tired with all the emotions of the morning i was carried back to my room here my midday meal cooked by marie was brought to me as i finished eating it for the fresh air had given me an appetite my father came in accompanied by the heer marais and began to talk to me presently the latter asked me kindly enough if i thought i should be sufficiently strong to trek back to the station that afternoon in an oxcart with springs to it and lying at full length upon a hidestrung cartel or mattress  i answered certainly as i should have done had i been at the point of death for i saw that he wished to be rid of me  the fact is allan he said awkwardly i am not inhospitable as you may think especially towards one to whom i owe so much but you and my nephew hernan do not seem to get on very well together and as you may guess having just been almost beggared i desire no unpleasantness with the only rich member of my family  i replied i was sure i did not wish to be the cause of any it seemed to me however that the heer pereira wished to make a mock of me and to bring it home to me what a poor creature i was compared to himselfi a mere sick boy who was worth nothing  i know said marais uneasily my nephew has been too fortunate in life and is somewhat overbearing in his manner he does not remember that the battle is not always to the strong or the race to the swift he who is young and rich and handsome a spoiled child from the first i am sorry but what i cannot help i must put up with if i cannot have my mealies cooked i must eat them green also allan have you never heard that jealousy sometimes makes people rude and unjust and he looked at me meaningly  i made no answer for when one does not quite know what to say it is often best to remain silent and he went on  i am vexed to hear of this foolish shooting match which has been entered into without my knowledge or consent if he wins he will only laugh at you the more and if you win he will be angry  it was not my fault mynheer i answered he wanted to force me to sell the mare which he had been riding without my leave and kept bragging about his marksmanship so at last i grew cross and challenged him  no wonder allan i do not blame you still you are silly for it will not matter to him if he loses his money but that beautiful mare is your ewelamb and i should be sorry to see you parted from a beast which has done us so good a turn well there it is perhaps circumstances may yet put an end to this trial i hope so  i hope they wont i answered stubbornly  i dare say you do being sore as a galled horse just now but listen allan and you too prédicant quatermain there are other and more important reasons than this petty squabble why i should be glad if you could go away for a while i must take counsel with my countrymen about certain secret matters which have to do with our welfare and future and of course they would not like it if all the while there were two englishmen on the place whom they might think were spies  say no more heer marais broke in my father hotly still less should we like to be where we are not wanted or are looked upon with suspicion for the crime of being english by gods blessing my son has been able to do some service to you and yours but now that is all finished and forgotten let the cart you are so kind as to lend us be inspanned we will go at once  then henri marais who was a gentleman at bottom although even in those early days violent and foolish when excited or under the influence of his race prejudices began to apologise quite humbly assuring my father that he forgot nothing and meant no offence so they patched the matter up and an hour later we started  all the boers came to see us off giving me many kind words and saying how much they looked forward to meeting me again on the following thursday pereira who was among them was also very genial begging me to be sure and get well since he did not wish to beat one who was still crippled even at a game of goose shooting i answered that i would do my best as for my part i did not like being beaten it any game which i had set my heart on winning whether it were little or big then i turned my head for i was lying on my back all this time to bid goodbye to marie who had slipped out of the house into the yard where the cart was  goodbye allan she said giving me her hand and a look from her eyes that i trusted was not seen then under pretence of arranging the kaross which was over me she bent down and whispered swiftly  win that match if you love me i shall pray god that you may every night for it will be an omen  i think the whisper was heard though not the words for i saw pereira bite his lip and make a movement as though to interrupt her but pieter retief thrust his big form in front of him rather rudely and said with one of his hearty laughs  allemachte friend let the missje wish a good journey to the young fellow who saved her life  next moment hans the hottentot screamed at the oxen in the usual fashion and we rolled away through the gate  but oh if i had liked the heer retief before now i loved him    chapter v the shooting match   my journey back to the mission station was a strange contrast to that which i had made thence a few days before then the darkness the swift mare beneath me rushing through it like a bird the awful terror in my heart lest i should be too late as with wild eyes i watched the paling stars and the first gathering grey of dawn now the creaking of the oxcart the familiar veld the bright glow of the peaceful sunlight and in my heart a great thankfulness and yet a new terror lest the pure and holy love which i had won should be stolen away from me by force or fraud  well as the one matter had been in the hand of god so was the other and with that knowledge i must be content the first trial had ended in death and victory how would the second end i wondered and those words seemed to jumble themselves up in my mind and shape a sentence that it did not conceive it was in the victory that is death which when i came to think of it of course meant nothing how victory could be death i did not understandat any rate at that time i who was but a lad of small experience  as we trekked along comfortably enough for the road was good and the cart being on springs gave my leg no pain i asked my father what he thought that the heer marais had meant when he told us that the boers had business at maraisfontein during which our presence as englishmen would not be agreeable to them  meant allan he meant that these traitorous dutchmen are plotting against their sovereign and are afraid lest we should report their treason either they intend to rebel because of that most righteous act the freeing of the slaves and because we will not kill out all the kaffirs with whom they chance to quarrel or to trek from the colony for my part i think it will be the latter for as you have heard some parties have already gone and unless i am mistaken many more mean to follow marais and retief and that plotter pereira among them let them go i say the sooner the better for i have no doubt that the english flag will follow them in due course  i hope that they wont i answered with a nervous laugh at any rate until i have won back my mare i had left her in retiefs care as stakeholder until the match should be shot off  for the rest of that two and a half hours trek my father looking very dignified and patriotic declaimed to me loudly about the bad behaviour of the boers who hated and traduced missionaries loathed and abominated british rule and permanent officials loved slavery and killed kaffirs whenever they got the chance i listened to him politely for it was not wise to cross my parent when he was in that humour also having mixed a great deal with the dutch i knew that there was another side to the question namely that the missionaries sometimes traduced them as in fact they did and that british rule or rather party government played strange tricks with the interests of distant dependencies that permanent officials and impermanent ones toosuch as governors full of a little brief authorityoften misrepresented and oppressed them that kaffirs encouraged by the variegated policy of these party governments and their servants frequently stole their stock and if they found a chance murdered them with their women and children as they had tried to do at maraisfontein though there it is true they had some provocation that british virtue had liberated the slaves without paying their owners a fair price for them and so forth  but to tell the truth it was not of these matters of high policy which were far enough away from a humble youth like myself that i was thinking what appealed to me and made my heart sick was the reflection that if henri marais and his friends trekked marie marais must perforce trek with them and that whereas i an englishman could not be of that adventurous company hernando pereira both could and would   on the day following our arrival home what between the fresh air plenty of good food for which i found i had an appetite and liberal doses of pontaca generous cape wine that is a kind of cross between port and burgundyi found myself so much better that i was able to hop about the place upon a pair of crutches which hans improvised for me out of kaffir sticks next morning my improvement continuing at a rapid rate i turned my attention seriously to the shooting match for which i had but five days to prepare  now it chanced that some months before a young englishman of good familyhe was named the honourable vavasseur smythwho had accompanied an official relative to the cape colony came our way in search of sport of which i was able to show him a good deal of a humble kind he had brought with him amongst other weapons what in those days was considered a very beautiful hairtriggered smallbore rifle fitted with a nipple for percussion caps then quite a new invention it was by a maker of the name of j purdey of london and had cost quite a large sum because of the perfection of its workmanship when the honourable v smythof whom i have never heard sincetook his leave of us on his departure for england being a generoushearted young fellow as a souvenir of himself he kindly presented me with this rifle which i still have       this singlebarrelled percussioncap rifle described by      allan quatermain which figures so prominently in the      history of this epoch of his life has been sent to me by      mr curtis and is before me as i write it was made in the      year 1835 by j purdey of 314 12 oxford street london      and is a beautiful piece of workmanship of its kind without      the ramrod which is now missing it weighs only 5 lbs 3      34 oz the barrel is octagonal and the rifled bore      designed to take a spherical bullet is 12 in in diameter      the hammer can be set to safety on the halfcock by means of      a catch behind it       another peculiarity of the weapon one that i have never      seen before is that by pressing on the back of the trigger      the ordinary light pull of the piece is so reduced that the      merest touch suffices to fire it thus rendering it hair      triggered in the fullest sense of the word       it has two flapsights marked for 150 and 200 yards in      addition to the fixed sight designed for firing at 100      yards       on the lock are engraved a stag and a doe the first lying      down and the second standing       of its sort and period it is an extraordinarily wellmade      and handy gun finished with horn at the end of what is now      called the tongue and with the stock cut away so as to      leave a raised cushion against which the cheek of the      shooter rests       what charge it took i do not know but i should imagine from      2 12 to 3 drachms of powder it is easy to understand that      in the hands of allan quatermain this weapon obsolete as it      is today was capable of great things within the limits of      its range and that the faith he put in it at the trial of      skill at the groote kloof and afterwards in the fearful      ordeal of the shooting of the vultures on the wing upon the      mount of slaughter when the lives of many hung upon his      marksmanship was well justified this indeed is shown by      the results in both cases       in writing of this rifle messrs purdey informed me that      copper percussion caps were experimented with by colonel      forsyth in 1820 and that their firm sold them in 1824 at a      cost of £1 15s per 1000 although their use did not become      general until some years laterthe editor  that was about six months earlier than the time of which i write and during those months i had often used this rifle for the shooting of game such as blesbuck and also of bustards i found it to be a weapon of the most extraordinary accuracy up to a range of about two hundred yards though when i rode off in that desperate hurry for maraisfontein i did not take it with me because it was a single barrel and too small in the bore to load with loopers at a pinch still in challenging pereira it was this gun and no other that i determined to use indeed had i not owned it i do not think that i should have ventured on the match  as it happened mr smyth had left me with the rifle a large supply of specially cast bullets and of the new percussion caps to say nothing of some very fine imported powder therefore having ammunition in plenty i set to work to practise seating myself upon a chair in a deep kloof near the station across which rock pigeons and turtle doves were wont to fly in numbers at a considerable height i began to fire at them as they flashed over me  now in my age i may say without fear of being set down a boaster that i have one gift that of marksmanship which i suppose i owe to some curious combination of judgment quickness of eye and steadiness of hand i can declare honestly that in my best days i never knew a man who could beat me in shooting at a living object i say nothing of target work of which i have little experience oddly enough also i believe that at this art although then i lacked the practice which since has come to me in such plenty i was as good as a youth as i have ever been in later days and of course far better than i am now this i soon proved upon the present occasion for seated there in that kloof after a few trials i found that i could bring down quite a number of even the swift straightflying rock pigeons as they sped over me and this be it remembered not with shot but with a single bullet a feat that many would hold to be incredible  so the days passed and i practised every evening finding me a little better at this terribly difficult sport for always i learned more as to the exact capacities of my rifle and the allowance that must be made according to the speed of the bird its distance and the complications of the wind and of the light during those days also i recovered so rapidly that at the end of them i was almost in my normal condition and could walk well with the aid of a single stick  at length the eventful thursday came and about middayfor i lay in bed late that morning and did not shooti drove or rather was driven in a cape cart with two horses to the place known as groote kloof or great gully over this gorge the wild geese flighted from their pans or feeding grounds on the high lands above to other pans that lay some miles below and thence i suppose straight out to the sea coast whence they returned at dawn  on arriving at the mouth of groote kloof about four oclock in the afternoon my father and i were astonished to see a great number of boers assembled there and among them a certain sprinkling of their younger womankind who had come on horseback or in carts  good gracious i said to my father if i had known there was to be such a fuss as this about a shooting match i dont think i could have faced it  hum he answered i think there is more in the wind than your match unless i am much mistaken it has been made the excuse of a public meeting in a secluded spot so as to throw the authorities off the scent  as a matter of fact my father was quite right before we arrived there that day the majority of those boers after full and long discussion had arranged to shake the dust of the colony off their feet and find a home in new lands to the north  presently we were among them and i noticed that one and all their faces were anxious and preoccupied pieter retief caught sight of me being helped out of the cart by my father and hans whom i had brought to load and for a moment looked puzzled evidently his thoughts were far away then he remembered and exclaimed in his jolly voice  why here is our little englishman come to shoot off his match like a man of his word friend marais stop talking about your lossesthis in a warning voiceand give him good day  so marais came and with him marie who blushed and smiled but to my mind looked more of a grown woman than ever before one who had left girlhood behind her and found herself face to face with real life and all its troubles following her close very close as i was quick to notice was hernan pereira he was even more finely dressed than usual and carried in his hand a beautiful new singlebarrelled rifle also fitted to take percussion caps but as i thought of a very large bore for the purpose of goose shooting  so you have got well again he said in a genial voice that yet did not ring true indeed it suggested to me that he wished i had done nothing of the sort well mynheer allan here you find me quite ready to shoot your head off he didnt mean that though i dare say he was i tell you that the mare is as good as mine for i have been practising havent i marie as the aasvogels that is vultures round the stead know to their cost  yes cousin hernan said marie you have been practising but so perhaps has allan  by this time all the company of boers had collected round us and began to evince a great interest in the pending contest as was natural among people who rarely had a gun out of their hands and thought that fine shooting was the divinest of the arts however they were not allowed to stay long as the kaffirs said that the geese would begin their afternoon flight within about half an hour so the spectators were all requested to arrange themselves under the sheer cliff of the kloof where they could not be seen by the birds coming over them from behind and there to keep silence then pereira and ii attended by my loader but he alone as he said a man at his elbow would bother himand with us retief the referee took our stations about a hundred and fifty yards from this face of cliff here we screened ourselves as well as we could from the keen sight of the birds behind some tall bushes which grew at this spot  i seated myself on a campstool which i had brought with me for my leg was still too weak to allow me to stand long and waited presently pereira said through retief that he had a favour to ask namely that i would allow him to take the first six shots as the strain of waiting made him nervous i answered certainly although i knew well that the object of the request was that he believed that the outpost geesespygeese we called themwhich would be the first to arrive would probably come over low down and slow whereas those that followed scenting danger might fly high and fast this in fact proved to be the case for there is no bird more clever than the misnamed goose  when we had waited about a quarter of an hour hans said  hist goose comes  as he spoke though as yet i could not see the bird i heard its cry of honk honk and the swish of its strong wings  then it appeared an old spurwinged gander probably the king of the flock flying so low that it only cleared the cliff edge by about twenty feet and passed over not more than thirty yards up an easy shot pereira fired and down it came rather slowly falling a hundred yards or so behind him while retief said  one for our side  pereira loaded again and just as he had capped his rifle three more geese also flying low came over preceded by a number of ducks passing straight above us as they must do owing to the shape of the gap between the land waves of the veld above through which they flighted pereira shot and to my surprise the second not the first bird fell also a good way behind him  did you shoot at that goose or the other nephew asked retief  at that one for sure he answered with a laugh  he lies muttered the hottentot he shot at the first and killed the second  be silent i answered who would lie about such a thing  again pereira loaded by the time that he was ready more geese were approaching this time in a triangle of seven birds their leader being at the point of the triangle which was flying higher than those that had gone before he fired and down came not one bird but two namely the captain and the goose to the right of and a little behind it  ah uncle exclaimed pereira did you see those birds cross each other as i pulled that was a lucky one for me but i wont count the second if the heer allan objects  no i did not nephew answered retief but doubtless they must have done so or the same bullet could not have pierced both  both hans and i only looked at each other and laughed still we said nothing  from the spectators under the cliff there came a murmur of congratulation not unmixed with astonishment again pereira loaded aimed and loosed at a rather high gooseit may have been about seventy yards in the air he struck it right enough for the feathers flew from its breast but to my astonishment the bird after swooping down as though it were going to fall recovered itself and flew away straight out of sight  tough birds these geese exclaimed pereira they can carry as much lead as a seacow  very tough indeed answered retief doubtfully never before did i see a bird fly away with an ounce ball through its middle  oh he will drop dead somewhere replied pereira as he rammed his powder down  within four minutes more pereira had fired his two remaining shots selecting as he was entitled to do low and easy young geese that came over him slowly he killed them both although the last of them after falling waddled along the ground into a tuft of high grass  now murmurs of stifled applause broke from the audience to which pereira bowed in acknowledgment  you will have to shoot very well mynheer allan said retief to me if you want to beat that even if i rule out one of the two birds that fell to a single shot as i think i shall hernan has killed five out of six which can scarcely be bettered  yes i answered but mynheer be so good as to have those geese collected and put upon one side i dont want them mixed up with mine if i am lucky enough to bring any down  he nodded and some kaffirs were sent to bring in the geese several of these i noted were still flapping and had to have their necks twisted but at the time i did not go to look at them while this was being done i called to retief and begged him to examine the powder and bullets i was about to use  whats the good he asked looking at me curiously powder is powder and a bullet is a bullet  none i dare say still oblige me by looking at them my uncle  then at my bidding hans took six bullets and placed them in his hand begging him to return them to us as they were wanted  they must be a great deal smaller than hernans said retief who being stronger uses a heavier gun  yes i answered briefly as hans put the charge of powder into the rifle and drove home the wad then taking a bullet from retiefs hand he rammed that down on to the top of it capped the gun and handed it to me  by now the geese were coming thick for the flight was at its full only either because some of those that had already passed had sighted the kaffirs collecting the fallen birds and risenan example which the others noted from afar and followedor because in an unknown way warning of their danger had been conveyed to them they were flying higher and faster than the first arrivals  you will have the worst of it allan said retief it should have been shot and shot about  perhaps i answered but that cant be helped now  then i rose from my stool the rifle in my hand i had not long to wait for presently over came a wedge of geese nearly a hundred yards up i aimed at the first fellow holding about eight yards ahead of him to allow for his pace and pressed next second i heard the clap of the bullet but alas it had only struck the outstretched beak of which a small portion fell to the ground the bird itself after wavering a second resumed its place as leader of the squad and passed away apparently unharmed  baas baas whispered hans as he seized the rifle and began to reload you were too far in front these big waterbirds do not travel as fast as the rock pigeons  i nodded wishing to save my breath then quivering with excitement for if i missed the next shot the match appeared to be lost presently i took the rifle from his hand  scarcely had i done so when a single goose came over quite as high as the others and travelling as though the black devil had kicked it as retief said this time i allowed the same space to compensate for the objects increased speed and pressed  down it came like a stone falling but a little way behind me with its head knocked off  baas baas whispered hans still too far in front why aim at the eye when you have the whole body  again i nodded and at the same time heaved a sigh of relief at least the match was still alive soon a large flight came over mixed up with mallard and widgeon i took the righthand angle bird so that it could not be supposed i had browned the lot as here in england they say of one who fires at a covey and not at a particular partridge down he came shot straight through the breast then i knew that i had got my nerve and felt no more fear  to cut a long story short although two of them were extremely difficult and high one being i should say quite a hundred and twenty yards above me and the other by no means easy i killed the next three birds one after the other and i verily believe could have killed a dozen more without a miss for now i was shooting as i had never shot before  say nephew allan asked retief curiously in the pause between the fifth and sixth shots why do your geese fall so differently to hernans  ask him dont talk to me i answered and next instant brought down number five the finest shot of the lot  a sound of wonder and applause came from all the audience and i saw marie wave a white handkerchief  thats the end said the referee  one minute before you stir i answered i want to shoot at something else that is not in the match just to see if i can kill two birds with one bullet like the heer pereira  he granted my request with a nod holding up his hand to prevent the audience from moving and bidding pereira who tried to interrupt to be silent  now while the match was in progress i had noticed two falcons about the size of the british peregrine wheeling round and round high over the kloof in which doubtless they bred apparently quite undisturbed by the shooting or perhaps they had their eyes upon some of the fallen geese i took the rifle and waited for a long while till at last my opportunity came i saw that the larger hen falcon was about to cross directly over the circle of its mate there being perhaps a distance of ten yards between them i aimed i judgedfor a second my mind was a kind of calculating machinethe different arcs and speeds of the birds must be allowed for and the lowest was ninety yards away then with something like a prayer upon my lips i pressed while every eye stared upwards  down came the lower falcon a pause of half a second and down came the higher one also falling dead upon its dead mate  now even from those boers who did not love to see an englishman excel there broke a shout of acclamation never had they beheld such a shot as this nor in truth had i  mynheer retief i said i gave you notice that i intended to try to kill both of them did i not  you did allemachte you did but tell me allan quatermain are your eye and hand quite human  you must ask my father i answered with a shrug as i sat myself down upon my stool and mopped my brow  the boers came up with a rush marie flying ahead of them like a swallow and their stout womenfolk waddling behind and formed a circle round us all talking at once i did not listen to their conversation till i heard pereira who was engaged in some eyeplay with marie say in a loud voice  yes it was pretty very pretty but all the same uncle retief i claim the match as i shot six geese against five  hans i said bring my geese and they were brought each with a neat hole through it and laid down near those that pereira had shot now i said to retief examine the wounds in these birds and then that on the second bird which the heer pereira killed when he brought down two at once i think it will be found that his bullet must have splintered  retief went and studied all the birds taking them up one by one then he threw down the last with a curse and cried in a great voice  mynheer pereira why do you bring shame on us before these two englishmen i say that you have been using loopers or else bullets that were sawn in quarters and glued or tied with thread look look and he pointed to the wounds of which in one case there were as many as three on a single bird  why not answered pereira coolly the bargain was that we were to use bullets but it was never said that they should not be cut doubtless the heer allans were treated in the same way  no i answered when i said that i would shoot with a bullet i meant a whole bullet not one that had been sawn in pieces and fixed together again so that after it left the muzzle it might spread out like shot but i do not wish to talk about the matter it is in the hands of the heer pieter retief who will give judgment as it pleases him  now much excited argument ensued among the boers in the midst of which marie managed to whisper to me unheard  oh i am glad allan for whatever they may decide you won and the omen is good  i dont see what geese have to do with omens sweetheart i answeredthat is since the time of the ancient romans anyhow i should say that the omens are bad for there is going to be a row presently  just then retief put up his hand calling out  silence i have decided the writing of the match did not say that the bullets were not to be cut and therefore hernan pereiras birds must count but that writing does say that any bird accidentally killed should not count and therefore one goose must be subtracted from pereiras total which leaves the two shooters equal so either the match is dead or since the geese have ceased to come it must be shot off another day  oh if there is any question said pereira who felt that public opinion was much against him let the englishman take the money i dare say that he needs it as the sons of missionaries are not rich  there is no question i said since rich or poor not for a thousand pounds would i shoot again against one who plays such tricks keep your money mynheer pereira and i will keep my mare the umpire has said that the match is dead so everything is finished  not quite interrupted retief for i have a word to say friend allan you have played fair and i believe that there is no one who can shoot like you in africa  that is so said the audience of boers  mynheer pereira went on retief although you too are a fine shot as is well known i believe that had you played fair also you would have been beaten but as it is you have saved your hundred pounds mynheer pereira he added in a great voice you are a cheat who have brought disgrace upon us boers and for my part i never want to shake your hand again  now at these outspoken words for when his indignation was aroused retief was no measurer of language pereiras highcoloured face went white as a sheet  mein gott mynheer he said i am minded to make you answer for such talk and his hand went to the knife at his girdle  what shouted retief do you want another shooting match well if so i am ready with whole bullets or with split ones none shall say that pieter retief was afraid of any man and least of all of one who is not ashamed to try to steal a prize as a hyena steals a bone from a lion come on hernan pereira come on  now i am sure i cannot say what would have happened although i am quite certain that pereira had no stomach for a duel with the redoubtable retief a man whose courage was as proverbial throughout the land as was his perfect uprightness of character at any rate seeing that things looked very black henri marais who had been listening to this altercation with evident annoyance stepped forward and said  mynheer retief and nephew hernan you are both my guests and i will not permit quarrelling over this foolishness especially as i am sure that hernan never intended to cheat but only to do what he thought was allowed why should he who is one of the finest shots in the colony though it may be that young allan quatermain here is even better will you not say so too friend retief especially just now when it is necessary that we should all be as brothers he added pleadingly  no thundered retief i will not tell a lie to please you or anyone  then seeing that the commandant was utterly uncompromising marais went up to his nephew and whispered to him for a while what he said i do not know the result of it was however that after favouring both retief and myself with an angry scowl pereira turned and walked to where his horse stood mounted it and rode off followed by two hottentot afterriders  that was the last i saw of hernan pereira for a long while to come and heartily do i wish that it had been the last i ever saw of him but this was not to be    chapter vi the parting   the boers who ostensibly had come to the kloof to see the shooting match although in fact for a very different purpose now began to disperse some of them rode straight away while some went to wagons which they had outspanned at a distance and trekked off to their separate homes i am glad to say that before they left quite a number of the best of them came up and congratulated me both on the defence of maraisfontein and on my shooting also not a few expressed their views concerning pereira in very straightforward language  now the arrangement was that my father and i were to sleep that night at maraiss stead returning home on the following morning but my father who had been a silent but not unobservant witness of all this scene coming to the conclusion that after what had happened we should scarcely be welcome there and that the company of pereira was to be avoided just now went up to marais and bade him farewell saying that we would send for my mare  not so not so he answered you are my guests tonight also fear not hernan will be away he has gone a journey upon some business  as my father hesitated marais added friend i pray you to come for i have some important words to say to you which cannot be said here  then my father gave way to my delight and relief for if he had not what chance would there have been of my getting some still more important words with marie so having collected the geese and the two falcons which i proposed to skin for marie i was helped into the cart and we drove off reaching maraisfontein just as night set in  that evening after we had eaten heer marais asked my father and myself to speak with him in the sittingroom by an afterthought also or so it seemed to me he told his daughter who had been clearing away the dishes and with whom as yet i had found no opportunity to talk to come in with us and close the door behind her  when all were seated and we men had lit our pipes though apprehension of what was to follow quite took away my taste for smoking marais spoke in english which he knew to a certain extent this was for the benefit of my father who made it a point of honour not to understand dutch although he would answer marais in that language when he pretended not to understand english to me he spoke in dutch and occasionally in french to marie it was a most curious and polyglot conversation  young allan he said and you daughter marie i have heard stories concerning you that although i never gave you leave to opsit that is to sit up alone at night with candles according to the boer fashion between those who are courting you have been making love to each other  that is true mynheer i said i only waited an opportunity to tell you that we plighted our troth during the attack of the quabies on this house  allemachte allan a strange time to choose answered marais pulling at his beard the troth that is plighted in blood is apt to end in blood  a vain superstition to which i cannot consent interrupted my father  perhaps so i answered i know not god alone knows i only know that we plighted our troth when we thought ourselves about to die and that we shall keep that troth till death ends it  yes my father added marie leaning forward across the scored yellowwood table her chin resting on her hand and her dark bucklike eyes looking him in the face yes my father that is so as i have told you already  and i tell you marie what i have told you already and you too allan that this thing may not be answered marais hitting the table with his fist i have nothing to say against you allan indeed i honour you and you have done me a mighty service but it may not be  why not mynheer i asked  for three reasons allan each of which is final you are english and i do not wish my daughter to marry an englishman that is the first you are poor which is no discredit to you and since i am now ruined my daughter cannot marry a poor man that is the second you live here and my daughter and i are leaving this country therefore you cannot marry her that is the third and he paused  is there not a fourth i asked which is the real reason namely that you wish your daughter to marry someone else  yes allan since you force me to it there is a fourth i have affianced my daughter to her cousin hernando pereira a man of substance and full age no lad but one who knows his own mind and can support a wife  i understand i answered calmly although within my heart a very hell was raging but tell me mynheer has marie affianced herselfor perhaps she will answer with her own lips  yes allan replied marie in her quiet fashion i have affianced myselfto you and no other man  you hear mynheer i said to marais  then he broke out in his usual excitable manner he stormed he argued he rated us both he said that he would never allow it that first he would see his daughter in her grave that i had abused his confidence and violated his hospitality that he would shoot me if i came near his girl that she was a minor and according to the law he could dispose of her in marriage that she must accompany him whither he was going that certainly i should not do so and much more of the same sort  when at last he had tired himself out and smashed his favourite pipe upon the table marie spoke saying  my father you know that i love you dearly for since my mothers death we have been everything to each other have we not  surely marie you are my life and more than my life  very well my father that being so i acknowledge your authority over me whatever the law may say i acknowledge that you have the right to forbid me to marry allan and if you do forbid mewhile i am under age at any ratei shall not marry him because of my duty to you buthere she rose and looked him full in the eyes and oh how stately she seemed at that moment in her simple strength and youthful gracethere is one thing my father that i do not acknowledgeyour right to force me to marry any other man as a woman with power over herself i deny that right and much as it pains me my father to refuse you anything i say that first i will die to allan here i have given myself for good or for evil and if i may not marry allan i will go to the grave unwed if my words hurt you i pray you to pardon me but at the same time to remember that they are my words which cannot be altered  marais looked at his daughter and his daughter looked at marais at first i thought that he was about to curse her but if this were so something in her eyes seemed to change his mind for all he said was  intractable like the rest of your race well fate may lead those who cannot be driven and this matter i leave in the hands of fate while you are under agethat is for two years or moreyou may not marry without my consent and have just promised not to do so presently we trek from this country into faroff lands who knows what may happen there  yes said my father in a solemn voice speaking for the first time who knows except god who governs all things and will settle these matters according to his will henri marais listen he went on after a pause for marais made no answer but sat himself down and stared gloomily at the table you do not wish my son to marry your daughter for various reasons of which one is that you think him poor and a richer suitor has offered himself after a reverse of fortune has made you poor another and a greater the true reason is his english blood which you hate so much that although by gods mercy he saved her life you do not desire that he should share her life is it not true  yes it is true mynheer quatermain you english are bullies and cheats he answered excitedly  and so you would give your daughter to one who has shown himself humble and upright to that good hater of the english and plotter against his king hernando pereira whom you love because he alone is left of your ancient race  remembering the incident of the afternoon this sarcasm reduced marais to silence  well went on my father although i am fond of marie and know her to be a sweet and noblehearted girl neither do i wish that she should marry my son i would see him wed to some english woman and not dragged into the net of the boers and their plottings still it is plain that these two love each other with heart and soul as doubtless it has been decreed that they should love this being so i tell you that to separate them and force another marriage upon one of them is a crime before god of which i am sure he will take note and pay it back to you strange things may happen in those lands whither you go henri marais will you not then be content to leave your child in safe keeping  never shouted marais she shall accompany me to a new home which is not under the shadow of your accursed british flag  then i have no more to say on your head be it here and hereafter replied my father solemnly  now unable to control myself any longer i broke in  but i have mynheer to separate marie and myself is a sin and one that will break her heart as for my poverty i have something more perhaps than you think and in this rich country wealth can be earned by those who work as i would do for her sake the man to whom you would give her showed his true nature this day for he who can play so low a trick to win a wager will play worse tricks to win greater things moreover the scheme must fail since marie will not marry him  i say she shall replied marais and that whether she does or not she shall accompany me and not stay here to be the wife of an english boy  accompany you i will father and share your fortunes to the last but marry hernando pereira i will not said marie quietly  perhaps mynheer i added days may come when once again you will be glad of the help of an english boy  the words were spoken at random a kind of ejaculation from the heart caused by the sting of maraiss cruelty and insults like the cry of a beast beneath a blow little did i know how true they would prove but at times it is thus that truth is mysteriously drawn from some well of secret knowledge hidden in our souls  when i want your help i will ask for it raved marais who knowing himself to be in the wrong strove to cover up that wrong with violence  asked or unasked if i live it shall be given in the future as in the past mynheer marais god pardon you for the woe you are bringing on marie and on me  now marie began to weep a little and unable to bear that sight i covered my eyes with my hand marais who when he was not under the influence of his prejudices or passion had a kind heart was moved also but tried to hide his feelings in roughness he swore at marie and told her to go to bed and she obeyed still weeping then my father rose and said  henri marais we cannot leave here tonight because the horses are kraaled and it would be difficult to find them in this darkness so we must ask your hospitality till dawn  i do not ask it i exclaimed i go to sleep in the cart and i limped from the room and the house leaving the two men together  what passed afterwards between them i do not quite know i gathered that my father who when roused also had a temper and was mentally and intellectually the stronger man told marais his opinion of his wickedness and folly in language that he was not likely to forget i believe he even drove him to confess that his acts seemed cruel excusing them however by announcing that he had sworn before god that his daughter should never marry an englishman also he said that he had promised her solemnly to pereira his own nephew whom he loved and could not break his word  no answered my father because being mad with the madness that runs before destruction you prefer to break maries heart and perhaps become guilty of her blood  then he left him   the darkness was intense through it i groped my way to the cart which stood where it had been outspanned on the veld at a little distance from the house wishing heartily so miserable was i that the kaffirs might choose that black night for another attack and make an end of me  when i reached it and lit the lantern which we always carried i was astonished to find that in a rough fashion it had been made ready to sleep in the seats had been cleared out the hind curtain fastened and so forth also the pole was propped up with an oxyoke so as to make the vehicle level to lie in while i was wondering vaguely who could have done this hans climbed on to the step carrying two karosses which he had borrowed or stolen and asked if i was comfortable  oh yes i answered but why were you going to sleep in the cart  baas he replied i was not i prepared it for you how did i know that you were coming oh very simply i sat on the stoep and listened to all the talk in the sitkammer the window has never been mended baas since the quabies broke it god in heaven what a talk that was i never knew that white people could have so much to say about a simple matter you want to marry the baas maraiss daughter the baas wants her to marry another man who can pay more cattle well among us it would soon have been settled for the father would have taken a stick and beaten you out of the hut with the thick end then he would have beaten the girl with the thin end until she promised to take the other man and all would have been settled nicely but you whites you talk and talk and nothing is settled you still mean to marry the daughter and the daughter still means not to marry the man of many cows moreover the father has really gained nothing except a sick heart and much bad luck to come  why much bad luck to come hans i asked idly for his naïve summing up of the case interested me in a vague way  oh baas allan for two reasons first your reverend father who made me true christian told him so and a prédicant so good as he is one down whom the curse of god runs from heaven like lightning runs down a tree well the heer marais was sitting under that tree and we all know what happens to him who is under a tree when the lightning strikes it that my first christian reason my second blackman reason about which there can be no mistake for it has always been true since there was a black man is that the girl is yours by blood you saved her life with your blood and he pointed to my leg and therefore bought her for ever for blood is more than cattle therefore too he who would divide her from you brings blood on her and on the other man who tries to steal her blood blood and on himself i know not what and he waved his yellow arms staring up at me with his little black eyes in a way that was most uncanny  nonsense i said why do you talk such bad words  because they are true words baas allan oh you laugh at the poor totty but i had it from my father and he from his father from generation to generation amen and you will see you will see as i have seen before now and as the heer marais will see who if the great god had not made him madfor mad he is baas as we know if you whites dontmight have lived in his home till he was old and have had a good soninlaw to bury him in his blanket  now i seemed to have had enough of this eerie conversation of course it is easy to laugh at natives and their superstitions but after a long life of experience i am bound to admit that they are not always devoid of truth the native has some kind of sixth sense which the civilised man has lost or so it seems to me  talking of blankets i said in order to change the subject from whom did you get these karosses  from whom why from the missie of course baas when i heard that you were to sleep in the cart i went to her and borrowed them to cover you also i had forgotten she gave me a writing for you and he felt about first in his dirty shirt then under his arm and finally in his fuzzy hair from which last hiding place he produced a little bit of paper folded into a pellet i undid it and read these words written with a pencil and in french   i shall be in the peach orchard half an hour before sunrise be there if you would bid me farewellm   is there any answer baas asked hans when i had thrust the note into my pocket if so i can take it without being found out then an inspiration seemed to strike him and he added why do you not take it yourself the missies window is easy to open also i am sure she would be pleased to see you  be silent i said i am going to sleep wake me an hour before the cockcrowand staysee that the horses have got out of the kraal so that you cannot find them too easily in case the reverend wishes to start very early but do not let them wander far for here we are no welcome guests  yes baas by the way baas the heer pereira who tried to cheat you over those geese is sleeping in an empty house not more than two miles away he drinks coffee when he wakes up in the morning and his servant who makes it is my good friend now would you like me to put a little something into it not to kill him for that is against the law in the book but just to make him quite mad for the book says nothing about that if so i have a very good medicine one that you white people do not know which improves the taste of the coffee and it might save much trouble you see if he came dancing about the place without any clothes on like a common kaffir the heer marais although he is really mad also might not wish for him as a soninlaw  oh go to the devil if you are not there already i replied and turned over as though to sleep   there was no need for me to have instructed that faithful creature the astute but immoral hans to call me early as the lady did her mother in the poem for i do not think that i closed an eye that night i spare my reflections for they can easily be imagined in the case of an earnestnatured lad who was about to be bereft of his first love  long before the dawn i stood in the peach orchard that orchard where we had first met and waited at length marie came stealing between the tree trunks like a grey ghost for she was wrapped in some lightcoloured garment oh once more we were alone together alone in the utter solitude and silence which precede the african dawn when all creatures that love the night have withdrawn to their lairs and hiding places and those that love the day still sleep their soundest  she saw me and stood still then opened her arms and clasped me to her breast uttering no word a while later she spoke almost in a whisper saying  allan i must not stay long for i think that if my father found us together he would shoot you in his madness  now as always it was of me she thought not of herself  and you my sweet i asked  oh she answered that matters nothing except for the sin of it i wish he would shoot me for then i should have done with all this pain i told you allan when the kaffirs were on us yonder that it might be better to die and see my heart spoke truly  is there no hope i gasped will he really separate us and take you away into the wilderness  certainly nothing can turn him yet allan there is this hope in two years if i live i shall be of full age and can marry whom i will and this i swear that i will marry none but you no not even if you were to die tomorrow  i bless you for those words i said  why she asked simply what others could i speak would you have me do outrage to my own heart and go through life faithless and ashamed  and i i swear also i broke in  nay swear nothing while i live i know that you will love me and if i should be taken it is my wish that you should marry some other good woman since it is not well or right that man should live alone with us maids it is different listen allan for the cocks are beginning to crow and soon there will be light you must bide here with your father if possible i will write to you from time to time telling you where we are and how we fare but if i do not write know that it is because i cannot or because i can find no messenger or because the letters have miscarried for we go into wild countries amongst savages  whither do you go i asked  i believe up towards the great harbour called delagoa bay where the portuguese rule my cousin hernan who accompanies usand she shivered a little in my armsis half portuguese he tells the boers that he has relations there who have written him many fine promises saying they will give us good country to dwell in where we cannot be followed by the english whom he and my father hate so much  i have heard that is all fever veld and that the country between is full of fierce kaffirs i said with a groan  perhaps i do not know and i do not care at least that is the notion in my fathers head though of course circumstances may change it i will try to let you know allan or if i do not perhaps you will be able to find out for yourself then then if we both live and you still care for me who will always care for you when i am of age you will join us and say and do what they may i will marry no other man and if i die as may well happen oh then my spirit shall watch over you and wait for you till you join me beneath the wings of god look it grows light i must go farewell my love my first and only love till in life or death we meet again as meet we shall  once more we clung together and kissed muttering broken words and then she tore herself from my embrace and was gone but oh as i heard her feet steal through the dewladen grass i felt as though my heart were being rent from my breast i have suffered much in life but i do not think that ever i underwent a bitterer anguish than in this hour of my parting from marie for when all is said and done what joy is there like the joy of pure first love and what bitterness like the bitterness of its loss   half an hour later the flowering trees of maraisfontein were behind us while in front rolled the fireswept veld black as life had become for me    chapter vii allans call   a fortnight later marais pereira and their companions a little band in all of about twenty men thirty women and children and say fifty halfbreeds and hottentot afterriders trekked from their homes into the wilderness i rode to the crest of a tabletopped hill and watched the long line of wagons one of them containing marie crawl away northward across the veld a mile or more beneath  sorely was i tempted to gallop after them and seek a last interview with her and her father but my pride forbade me henri marais had given out that if i came near his daughter he would have me beaten back with sjambocks or hide whips perhaps he had gained some inkling of our last farewell in the peach orchard i do not know but i do know that if anyone had lifted a sjambock on me i should have answered with a bullet then there would have been blood between us which is worse to cross than whole rivers of wrath and jealousy so i just watched the wagons until they vanished and galloped home down the rockstrewn slope wishing that the horse would stumble and break my neck  when i reached the station however i was glad that it had not done so as i found my father sitting on the stoep reading a letter that had been brought by a mounted hottentot  it was from henri marais and ran thus   reverend heer and friend quatermaini send this to bid you farewell for although you are english and we have quarrelled at times i honour you in my heart friend now that we are starting your warning words lie on me like lead i know not why but what is done cannot be undone and i trust that all will come right if not it is because the good lord wills it otherwise   here my father looked up and said when men suffer from their own passion and folly they always lay the blame on the back of providence  then he went on spelling out the letter   i fear your boy allan who is a brave lad as i have reason to know and honest must think that i have treated him harshly and without gratitude but i have only done what i must do true marie who like her mother is very strong and stubborn in mind swears that she will marry no one else but soon nature will make her forget all that especially as such a fine husband waits for her hand so bid allan forget all about her also and when he is old enough choose some english girl i have sworn a great oath before my god that he shall never marry my daughter with my consent  friend i write to ask you something because i trust you more than these slim agents half the price a very poor one that i have for my farm is still unpaid to me by jacobus van der merve who remains behind and buys up all our lands it is £100 english due this day year and i enclose you power of attorney to receive and give receipt for the same also there is due to me from your british government £253 on account of slaves liberated which were worth quite £1000 this also the paper gives you authority to receive as regards my claims against the said cursed government because of the loss brought on me by the quabie kaffirs it will not acknowledge them saying that the attack was caused by the frenchman leblanc one of my household   and with good reason commented my father   when you have received these monies if ever i pray you take some safe opportunity of sending them to me wherever i may be which doubtless you will hear in due course although by that time i hope to be rich again and not to need money farewell and god be with you as i hope he will be with me and marie and the rest of us trekboers the bearer will overtake us with your answer at our first outspan  henri marais   well said my father with a sigh i suppose i must accept his trust though why he should choose an accursed englishman with whom he has quarrelled violently to collect his debts instead of one of his own beloved boers i am sure i do not know i will go and write to him allan see that the messenger and his horse get something to eat  i nodded and went to the man who was one of those that had defended maraisfontein with me a good fellow unless he got near liquor  heer allan he said looking round to see that we were not overheard i have a little writing for you also and he produced from his pouch a note that was unaddressed  i tore it open eagerly within was written in french which no boer would understand if the letter fell into his hands   be brave and faithful and remember as i shall oh love of my heart adieu adieu   this message was unsigned but what need was there of signature  i wrote an answer of a sort that may be imagined though what the exact words were i cannot remember after the lapse of nearly half a century oddly enough it is the things i said which i recall at such a distance of time rather than the things which i wrote perhaps because when once written my mind being delivered troubled itself with them no more so in due course the hottentot departed with my fathers letter and my own and that was the last direct communication which we had with henri or marie marais for more than a year  i think that those long months were on the whole the most wretched i have ever spent the time of life which i was passing through is always trying that period of emergence from youth into full and responsible manhood which in africa generally takes place earlier than it does here in england where young men often seem to me to remain boys up to fiveandtwenty the circumstances which i have detailed made it particularly so in my own case for here was i who should have been but a cheerful lad oppressed with the sorrows and anxieties and fettered by the affections of maturity  i could not get marie out of my mind her image was with me by day and by night especially by night which caused me to sleep badly i became morose supersensitive and excitable i developed a cough and thought as did others that i was going into a decline i remember that hans even asked me once if i would not come and peg out the exact place where i should like to be buried so that i might be sure that there would be no mistake made when i could no longer speak for myself on that occasion i kicked hans one of the few upon which i have ever touched a native the truth was that i had not the slightest intention of being buried i wanted to live and marry marie not to die and be put in a hole by hans only i saw no prospect of marrying marie or even of seeing her again and that was why i felt lowspirited  of course from time to time news of the trekboers reached us but it was extremely confused there were so many parties of them their adventures were so difficult to follow and i may add often so terrible so few of them could write trustworthy messengers were so scanty distances were so great at any rate we heard nothing of maraiss band except a rumour that they had trekked to a district in what is now the transvaal which is called rustenberg and thence on towards delagoa bay into an unknown veld where they had vanished from marie herself no letter came which showed me clearly enough that she had not found an opportunity of sending one  observing my depressed condition my father suggested as a remedy that i should go to the theological college at cape town and prepare myself for ordination but the church as a career did not appeal to me perhaps because i felt that i could never be sufficiently good perhaps because i knew that as a clergyman i should find no opportunity of travelling north when my call came for i always believed that this call would come  my father who wished that i should hear another kind of call was vexed with me over this matter he desired earnestly that i should follow the profession which he adorned and indeed saw no other open for me any more than i did myself of course he was right in a way seeing that in the end i found none unless big game hunting and kaffir trading can be called a profession i dont know i am sure still poor business as it may be i say now when i am getting towards the end of life that i am glad i did not follow any other it has suited me that was the insignificant hole in the worlds affairs which i was destined to fit whose only gifts were a remarkable art of straight shooting and the more common one of observation mixed with a little untrained philosophy  so hot did our arguments become about this subject of the church for as may be imagined in the course of them i revealed some unorthodoxy especially as regards the matter of our methods of christianising kaffirs that i was extremely thankful when a diversion occurred which took me away from home the story of my defence of maraisfontein had spread far and that of my feats of shooting especially in the goose kloof still farther so the end of it was that those in authority commandeered me to serve in one of the continual kaffir frontier wars which was in progress and instantly gave me a commission as a kind of lieutenant in a border corps  now the events of that particular war have nothing to do with the history that i am telling so i do not propose even to touch on them i served in it for a year meeting with many adventures one or two successes and several failures once i was wounded slightly twice i but just escaped with my life once i was reprimanded for taking a foolish risk and losing some men twice i was commended for what were called gallant actions such as bringing a wounded comrade out of danger under a warm fire mostly of assegais and penetrating by night almost alone into the stronghold of a chieftain and shooting him  at length that war was patched up with an inconclusive peace and my corps was disbanded i returned home no longer a lad but a man with experience of various kinds and a rather unique knowledge of kaffirs their languages history and modes of thought and action also i had associated a good deal with british officers and from them acquired much that i had found no opportunity of studying before especially i hope the ideas and standards of english gentlemen  i had not been back at the mission station more than three weeks quite long enough for me to begin to be bored with idleness and inactivity when that call for which i had been waiting came at last  one day a smous that is a low kind of white man often a jew who travels about trading with unsophisticated boers and kaffirs and cheating them if he can called at the station with his cartful of goods i was about to send him away having no liking for such gentry when he asked me if i were named allan quatermain i said yes whereon he replied that he had a letter for me and produced a packet wrapped up in sailcloth i asked him whence he had it and he answered from a man whom he had met at port elizabeth an east coast trader who hearing that he was coming into the cradock district entrusted him with the letter the man told him that it was very important and that i should reward the bearer well if it were delivered safely  while the jew talked i think he was a jew i was opening the sailcloth within was a piece of linen which had been oiled to keep out water addressed in some red pigment to myself or my father this too i opened not without difficulty for it was carefully sewn up and found within it a letterpacket also addressed to myself or my father in the handwriting of marie  great heaven how my heart jumped at that sight calling to hans to make the smous comfortable and give him food i went into my own room and there read the letter which ran thus   my dear allani do not know whether the other letters i have written to you have ever come to your hands or indeed if this one will still i send it on chance by a wandering portuguese halfbreed who is going to delagoa bay about fifty miles i believe from the place where i now write near the crocodile river my father has named it maraisfontein after our old home if those letters reached you you will have learned of the terrible things we went through on our journey the attacks by the kaffirs in the zoutpansberg region who destroyed one of our parties altogether and so forth if not all that story must wait for it is too long to tell now and indeed i have but little paper and not much pencil it will be enough to say therefore that to the number of thirtyfive white people men women and children we trekked at the beginning of the summer season when the grass was commencing to grow from the lydenburg districtan awful journey over mountains and through flooded rivers after many delays some of them months long we reached this place about eight weeks ago for i write to you at the beginning of june if we have kept correct account of the time of which i am not certain  it is a beautiful place to look at a flat country of rich veld with big trees growing on it and about two miles from the great river that is called the crocodile here finding good water my father and hernan pereira who now rules him in all things determined to settle although some of the others wished to push on nearer to delagoa bay there was a great quarrel about it but in the end my father or rather hernan had his will as the oxen were worn out and many had already died from the bites of a poisonous fly which is called the tsetse so we lotted out the land of which there is enough for hundreds and began to build rude houses  then trouble came upon us the kaffirs stole most of our horses although they have not dared to attack us and except two belonging to hernan the rest died of the sickness the last of them but yesterday the oxen too have all died of the tsetse bites or other illnesses but the worst is that although this country looks so healthy it is poisoned with fever which comes up i think in the mists from the river already out of the thirtyfive of us ten are dead two men three women and five children while more are sick as yet my father and i and my cousin pereira have by gods mercy kept quite well but although we are all very strong how long this will continue i cannot tell fortunately we have plenty of ammunition and the place is thick with game so that those of the men who remain strong can kill all the food we want even shooting on foot and we women have made a great quantity of biltong by salting flesh and drying it in the sun so we shall not actually starve for a long while even if the game goes away  but dear allan unless help comes to us i think that we shall die every one for god alone knows the miseries that we suffer and the horrible sights of sickness and death that are around us at this moment there lies by me a little girl who is dying of fever  oh allan if you can help us do so because of our sick it is impossible for us to get to delagoa bay and if we did we have no money to buy anything there for all that we had with us was lost in a wagon in a flooded river it was a great sum for it included hernans rich fortune which he brought from the cape with him in gold nor can we move anywhere else for we have no cattle or horses we have sent to delagoa bay where we hear these are to be had to try to buy them on credit but my cousin hernans relations of whom he used to talk so much are dead or gone away and no one will trust us with the neighbouring kaffirs too who have plenty of cattle we have quarrelled since unfortunately my cousin and some of the other boers tried to take certain beasts of theirs without payment so we are quite helpless and can only wait for death  allan my father says that he asked your father to collect some monies that were owing to him if it were possible for you or other friends to come to delagoa in a ship with that money i think that it might serve to buy some oxen enough for a few wagons then perhaps we might trek back and fall in with a party of boers who we believe have crossed the quathlamba mountains into natal or perhaps we might get to the bay and find a ship to take us anywhere from this horrible place if you could come the natives would guide you to where we are  but it is too much to hope that you will come or that if you do come you will find us still alive  allan my dearest i have one more thing to say though i must say it shortly for the paper is nearly finished i do not know supposing that you are alive and well whether you still care for me who left you so long agoit seems years and yearsbut my heart is where it was and where i promised it should remain in your keeping of course hernan has pressed me to marry him and my father has wished it but i have always said no and now in our wretchedness there is no more talk of marriage at present which is the one good thing that has happened to me and allan before so very long i shall be of age if i live still i dare say you no longer think of marriage with me who perhaps are already married to someone else especially as now i and all of us are no better than wandering beggars yet i have thought it right to tell you these things which you may like to know  oh why did god ever put it into my fathers heart to leave the cape colony just because he hated the british government and hernan pereira and others persuaded him i know not but poor man he is sorry enough now it is pitiful to see him at times i think that he is going mad  the paper is done and the messenger is going also the sick child is dying and i must attend to her will this letter ever come to your hands i wonder i am sending with it the little money i have to pay for its deliveryabout four pounds english if not there is an end if it does and you cannot come or send others at least pray for us i dream of you by night and think of you by day for how much i love you i cannot tell  in life or death i am  your marie   such was this awful letter i still have it it lies before me those ragged sheets of paper covered with faint pencilwriting that is blotted here and there with tear marks some of them the tears of marie who wrote some of them the tears of me who read i wonder if there exists a more piteous memorial of the terrible sufferings of the trekboers and especially of such of them as forced their way into the poisonous veld around delagoa as did this marais expedition and those under the command of triechard better like many of their people to have perished at once by the spears of umzilikazi and other savages than to endure these lingering tortures of fever and starvation  as i finished reading this letter my father who had been out visiting some of his mission kaffirs entered the house and i went into the sittingroom to meet him  why allan what is the matter with you he asked noting my tearstained face  i gave him the letter for i could not speak and with difficulty he deciphered it  merciful god what dreadful news he said when he had finished those poor people those poor misguided people what can be done for them  i know one thing that can be done father or at any rate can be attempted i can try to reach them  are you mad he asked how is it possible for you one man to get to delagoa bay buy cattle and rescue these folk who probably are now all dead  the first two things are possible enough father some ship will take me to the bay you have maraiss money and i have that five hundred pounds which my old aunt in england left me last year thank heaven owing to my absence on commando it still lies untouched in the bank at port elizabeth that is about eight hundred pounds in all which would buy a great many cattle and other things as for the third it is not in our hands is it it may be that they cannot be rescued it may be that they are dead i can only go to see  but allan allan you are my only son and if you go it is probable that i shall never see you more  i have been through more dangers lately father and am still alive and well moreover if marie is deadi paused then went on passionatelydo not try to stop me for i tell you father i will not be stopped think of the words in that letter and what a shameless hound i should be if i sat here quiet while marie is dying yonder would you have done so if marie had been my mother  no answered the old gentleman i should not go and god be with you allan and me also for i never expect to see you again and he turned his head aside for a while  then we went into matters the smous was summoned and asked about the ship which brought the letter from delagoa it seemed that she was an englishowned brig known as the seven stars and that her captain one richardson proposed to sail back to the bay on the morrow that was the third of july or in other words within twentyfour hours  twentyfour hours and port elizabeth was one hundred and eighteen miles away and the seven stars might leave earlier if she had completed her cargo and wind and weather served moreover if she did leave it might be weeks or months before any other ship sailed for delagoa bay for in those days of course there were no mail boats  i looked at my watch it was four oclock in the afternoon and from a calendar we had which gave the tides at port elizabeth and other south african harbours it did not seem probable that the seven stars would sail if she kept to her date before about eight on the morrow one hundred and twenty miles to be covered in say fourteen hours over rough country with some hills well on the other hand the roads were fairly good and dry with no flooded rivers to cross although there might be one to swim and there was a full moon it could be donebarely and now i was glad indeed that hernan pereira had not won my swift mare in that shooting match  i called to hans who was loafing about outside and said quietly  i ride to port elizabeth and must be there by eight oclock tomorrow morning  allemachte exclaimed hans who had been that road several times  you will go with me and from port elizabeth on to delagoa bay saddle the mare and the roan horse and put a headstall on the chestnut to lead with you as a spare give them all a feed but no water we start in half an hour then i added certain directions as to the guns we would take saddlebags clothes blankets and other details and bade him start about the business  hans never hesitated he had been with me through my recent campaign and was accustomed to sudden orders moreover i think that if i had told him i was riding to the moon beyond his customary exclamation of allemachte he would have made no objection to accompanying me thither  the next halfhour was a busy time for me henri maraiss money had to be got out of the strong box and arranged in a belt of bucks hide that i had strapped about me a letter had to be written by my father to the manager of the port elizabeth bank identifying me as the owner of the sum lodged there in my name a meal must be eaten and some food prepared for us to carry the horses shoes had to be seen to and a few clothes packed in the saddlebags also there were other things which i have forgotten yet within fiveandthirty minutes the long lean mare stood before the door behind her with a tall cranes feather in his hat was hans mounted on the roan stallion and leading the chestnut a fouryearold which i had bought as a foal on the mare as part of the bargain having been corn fed from a colt it was a very sound and wellgrown horse though not the equal of its mother in speed  in the passage my poor old father who was quite bewildered by the rapidity and urgent nature of this business embraced me  god bless you my dear boy he said i have had little time to think but i pray that this may be all for the best and that we may meet again in the world but if not remember what i have taught you and if i survive you for my part i shall remember that you died trying to do your duty oh what trouble has the blind madness of henri marais brought upon us all well i warned him that it would be so goodbye my dear boy goodbye my prayers will follow you and for the restwell i am old and what does it matter if my grey hairs come with sorrow to the grave  i kissed him back and with an aching heart sprang to the saddle in five more minutes the station was out of sight   thirteen and a half hours later i pulled rein upon the quay of port elizabeth just only just in time to catch captain richardson as he was entering his boat to row out to the seven stars on which the canvas was already being hoisted as well as i could in my exhausted state i explained matters and persuaded him to wait till the next tide then thanking god for the mares speedthe roan had been left foundered thirty miles away and hans was following on the chestnut but not yet upi dragged the poor beast to an inn at hand there she lay down and died well she had done her work and there was no other horse in the country that could have caught that boat  an hour or so later hans came in flogging the chestnut and here i may add that both it and the roan recovered indeed i rode them for many years until they were quite old when i had eaten or tried to eat something and rested awhile i went to the bank succeeded in explaining the state of the case to the manager and after some difficulty for gold was not very plentiful in port elizabeth procured three hundred pounds in sovereigns for the other two he gave me a bill upon some agent in delagoa bay together with a letter of recommendation to him and the portuguese governor who it appeared was in debt to their establishment by an afterthought however although i kept the letters i returned him the bill and spent the £200 in purchasing a great variety of goods which i will not enumerate that i knew would be useful for trading purposes among the east coast kaffirs indeed i practically cleared out the port elizabeth stores and barely had time with the help of hans and the storekeepers to pack and ship the goods before the seven stars put out to sea   within twentyfour hours from the time i had left the mission station hans and i saw behind us port elizabeth fading into the distance and in front a waste of stormy waters    chapter viii the camp of death   everything went well upon that voyage except with me personally not having been on the ocean since i was a child i who am naturally no good sailor was extremely ill as day by day we ploughed through seas that grew ever more rough also strong as i was that fearful ride had overdone me added to these physical discomforts was my agonising anxiety of mind which i leave anyone with imagination to picture for himself really there were times when i wished that the seven stars would plunge headlong to the bottom of the deep and put an end to me and my miseries  these however so far as the bodily side of them was concerned were i think surpassed by those of my henchman hans who as a matter of fact had never before set foot in any kind of boat perhaps this was fortunate since had he known the horrors of the ocean much as he loved me he would i am sure by one means or another have left me to voyage in the seven stars alone there he lay upon the floor of my little cabin rolling to and fro with the violent motion of the brig overcome with terror he was convinced that we were going to be drowned and in the intervals of furious seasickness uttered piteous lamentations in dutch english and various native tongues mingled with curses and prayers of the most primitive and realistic order  after the first twentyfour hours or so he informed me with many moans that the last bit of his inside had just come out of him and that he was now quite hollow like a gourd also he declared that all these evils had fallen upon him because he had been fool enough to forsake the religion of his people what was that i wonder and allow himself to be washed white that is be baptised by my father  i answered that as he had become white instead of staying yellow i advised him to remain so since it was evident that the hottentot gods would have nothing more to do with one who had deserted them thereon he made a dreadful face which even in the midst of my own woes caused me to laugh at him uttered a prolonged groan and became so silent that i thought he must be dead however the sailor who brought me my foodsuch foodassured me that this was not so and lashed him tight to the legs of the bunk by his arm and ankle so as to prevent him from being rolled to bits  next morning hans was dosed with brandy which in his empty condition made him extremely drunk and from that time forward began to take a more cheerful view of things especially was this so when the hours for the brandy medicine came round hans like most other hottentots loved spirits and would put up with much to get them even with my fathers fiery indignation  i think it was on the fourth day that at length we pitched and rolled ourselves over the shallow bar of port natal and found ourselves at peace for a while under shelter of the point in the beautiful bay upon the shores of which the town of durban now stands then it was but a miserable place consisting of a few shanties which were afterwards burnt by the zulus and a number of kaffir huts for such white men as dwelt there had for the most part native followings and i may add native wives  we spent two days at this settlement of durban where captain richardson had some cargo to land for the english settlers one or two of whom had started a trade with the natives and with parties of the emigrant boers who were beginning to enter the territory by the overland route those days i passed on shore though i would not allow hans to accompany me lest he should desert employing my time in picking up all the information i could about the state of affairs especially with reference to the zulus a people with whom i was destined ere long to make an intimate acquaintance needless to say i inquired both from natives and from white men whether anything was known of the fate of maraiss party but no one seemed even to have heard of them one thing i did learn however that my old friend pieter retief with a large following had crossed the quathlamba mountains which we now know as the drakensberg and entered the territory of natal here they proposed to settle if they could get the leave of the zulu king dingaan a savage potentate of whom and of whose armies everyone seemed to live in terror  on the third morning to my great relief for i was terrified lest we should be delayed the seven stars sailed with a favouring wind three days later we entered the harbour of delagoa a sheet of water many miles long and broad notwithstanding its shallow entrance it is the best natural port in southeastern africa but now alas lost to the english  six hours later we anchored opposite a sandbank on which stood a dilapidated fort and a dirty settlement known as lorenzo marquez where the portuguese kept a few soldiers most of them coloured i pass over my troubles with the customs if such they could be called suffice it to say that ultimately i succeeded in landing my goods on which the duty chargeable was apparently enormous this i did by distributing twentyfive english sovereigns among various officials beginning with the actinggovernor and ending with a drunken black sweep who sat in a kind of sentry box on the quay  early next morning the seven stars sailed again because of some quarrel with the officials who threatened to seize heri forget why her destination was the east african ports and i think madagascar where a profitable trade was to be done in carrying cattle and slaves captain richardson said he might be back at lorenzo marquez in two or three months time or he might not as a matter of fact the latter supposition proved correct for the seven stars was lost on a sandbank somewhere up the coast her crew only escaping to mombasa after enduring great hardships  well she had served my turn for i heard afterwards that no other ship put into the bay for a whole year from the date she left it so if i had not caught her at port elizabeth i could not have come at all except of course overland this at best must have taken many months and was moreover a journey that no man could enter on alone  now i get back to my story again  there was no inn at lorenzo marquez through the kindness of one of his native or halfbreed wives who could talk a little dutch i managed however to get a lodging in a tumbledown house belonging to a dissolute person who called himself don josé ximenes but who was really himself a halfbreed here good fortune befriended me don josé when sober was a trader with the natives and a year before had acquired from them two good buck wagons probably they were stolen from some wandering boers or found derelict after their murder or death by fever these wagons he was only too glad to sell for a song i think i gave him twenty pounds english for the two and thirty more for twelve oxen that he had bought at the same time as the wagons they were fine beasts of the afrikander breed that after a long rest had grown quite fat and strong  of course twelve oxen were not enough to draw two wagons or even one therefore hearing that there were natives on the mainland who possessed plenty of cattle i at once gave out that i was ready to buy and pay well in blankets cloth beads and so forth the result was that within two days i had forty or fifty to choose from small animals of the zulu character and i should add unbroken still they were sturdy and used to that veld and its diseases here it was that my twelve trained beasts came in by putting six of them to each wagon two as fore and two as afteroxen and two in the middle hans and i were able to get the other ten necessary to make up a team of sixteen under some sort of control  heavens how we worked during the week or so which went by before it was possible for me to leave lorenzo marquez what with mending up and loading the wagons buying and breaking in the wild oxen purchasing provisions hiring native servantsof whom i was lucky enough to secure eight who belonged to one of the zulu tribes and desired to get back to their own country whence they had wandered with some boers i do not think that we slept more than two or three hours out of the twentyfour  but it may be asked what was my aim whither went i what inquiries had i made to answer the last question first i had made every possible inquiry but with little or no result maries letter had said that they were encamped on the bank of the crocodile river about fifty miles from delagoa bay i asked everyone i met among the portuguesewho after all were not manyif they had heard of such an encampment of emigrant boers but these portuguese appeared to have heard nothing except my host don josé who had a vague recollection of somethinghe could not remember what  the fact was at this time the few people who lived at lorenzo marquez were too sodden with liquor and other vices to take any interest in outside news that did not immediately concern them moreover the natives whom they flogged and oppressed if they were their servants or fought with if they were not told them little and almost nothing that was true for between the two races there was an hereditary hate stretching back for generations so from the portuguese i gained no information  then i turned to the kaffirs especially to those from whom i had bought the cattle they had heard that some boers reached the banks of the crocodile moons agohow many they could not tell but that country they said was under the rule of a chief who was hostile to them and killed any of their people who ventured thither therefore they knew nothing for certain still one of them stated that a woman whom he had bought as a slave and who had passed through the district in question a few weeks before told him that someone had told her that these boers were all dead of sickness she added that she had seen their wagon caps from a distance so if they were dead their wagons were still alive  i asked to see this woman but the native refused to produce her after a great deal of talk however he offered to sell her to me saying that he was tired of her so i bargained with the man and finally agreed for her purchase for three pounds of copper wire and eight yards of blue cloth next morning she was produced an extremely ugly person with a large flat nose who came from somewhere in the interior of africa having i gathered been taken captive by arabs and sold from hand to hand her name as near as i can pronounce it was jeel  i had great difficulty in establishing communication with her but ultimately found that one of my newly hired kaffirs could understand something of her language even then it was hard to make her talk for she had never seen a white man and thought i had bought her for some dreadful purpose or other however when she found that she was kindly treated she opened her lips and told me the same story that her late master had repeated neither more nor less finally i asked her whether she could guide me to the place where she had seen the live wagons  she answered oh yes as she had travelled many roads and never forgot any of them  this of course was all i wanted from the woman who i may add ultimately gave me a good deal of trouble the poor creature seemed never to have experienced kindness and her gratitude for the little i showed her was so intense that it became a nuisance she followed me about everywhere trying to do me service in her savage way and even attempted to seize my food and chew it before i put it into my own mouthto save me the trouble i suppose ultimately i married her somewhat against her will i fear to one of the hired kaffirs who made her a very good husband although when he was dismissed from my service she wanted to leave him and follow me  at length under the guidance of this woman jeel we made a start there were but fifty miles to go a distance that on a fair road any good horse would cover in eight hours or less but we had no horses and there was no roadnothing but swamps and bush and rocky hills with our untrained cattle it took us three days to travel the first twelve miles though after that things went somewhat better  it may be asked why did i not send on but whom could i send when no one knew the way except the woman jeel whom i feared to part with lest i should see her no more moreover what was the use of sending since the messengers could take no help if everyone at the camp was dead as rumour told uswell they were dead and if they lived the hope was that they might live a little longer meanwhile i dared not part with my guide nor dared i leave the relief wagons to go on with her alone if i did so i knew that i should never see them again since only the prestige of their being owned by a white man who was not a portuguese prevented the natives from looting them  it was a truly awful journey my first idea had been to follow the banks of the crocodile river which is what i should have attempted had i not chanced on the woman jeel lucky was it that i did not do so since i found afterwards that this river wound about a great deal and was joined by impassable tributaries also it was bordered by forests jeels track on the contrary followed an old slave road that bad as it was avoided the swampy places of the surrounding country and those native tribes which the experience of generations of the traders in this iniquitous traffic showed to be most dangerous   nine days of fearful struggle had gone by we had camped one night below the crest of a long slope strewn with great rocks many of which we were obliged to roll out of the path by main force in order to make a way for the wagons the oxen had to lie in their yokes all night since we dared not let them loose fearing lest they should stray also lions were roaring in the distance although game being plentiful these did not come near to us as soon as there was any light we let out the teams to fill themselves on the tussocky grass that grew about and meanwhile cooked and ate some food  presently the sun rose and i saw that beneath us was a great stretch of plain covered with mist and to the north on our right several denser billows of mist that marked the course of the crocodile river  by degrees this mist lifted tall tops of trees appearing above it till at length it thinned into vapour that vanished away as the sun rose as i watched it idly the woman jeel crept up to me in her furtive fashion touched me on the shoulder and pointed to a distant group of trees  looking closely at these trees i saw between them what at first i took for some white rocks further examination as the mist cleared suggested to my mind however that they might be wagon tilts just then the zulu who understood jeels talk came up i asked him as well as i could for at that time my knowledge of his tongue was very imperfect what she wished to say he questioned her and answered that she desired to tell me that those were the moving houses of the amaboona the boer people just where she had seen them nearly two moons ago  at this tidings my heart seemed to stand still so that for more than a minute i could not speak there were the wagons at last butoh who and what should i find in them i called hans and bade him inspan as quickly as possible explaining to him that yonder was maraiss camp  why not let the oxen fill themselves first baas he answered there is no hurry for though the wagons are there no doubt all the people are dead long ago  do what i bid you you illomened beast i said instead of croaking of death like a crow and listen i am going to walk forward to that camp you must follow with the wagons as fast as they can travel  no baas it is not safe that you should go alone kaffirs or wild beasts might take you  safe or not i am going but if you think it wise tell two of those zulus to come with me  a few minutes later i was on the road followed by the two kaffirs armed with spears in my youth i was a good runner being strong of leg and light in body but i do not think that i ever covered seven miles for that was about the distance to the camp in quicker time than i did that morning indeed i left those active kaffirs so far behind that when i approached the trees they were not in sight here i dropped to a walk as i said to myselfto get my breath really it was because i felt so terrified at what i might find that i delayed the discovery just for one minute more while i approached hope however faint still remained when i arrived hope might be replaced by everlasting despair  now i could see that there were some shanties built behind the wagons doubtless those rude houses of which marie had written but i could not see anyone moving about them or any cattle or any smoke or other sign of life nor could i hear a single sound  doubtless thought i to myself hans is right they are all long dead  my agony of suspense was replaced by an icy calm at length i knew the worst it was finishedi had striven in vain i walked through the outlying trees and between two of the wagons one of these i noticed as we do notice things at such times was the same in which marais had trekked with his daughter his favourite wagon that once i had helped to fit with a new disselboom  before me were the rough houses built of the branches of trees daubed over with mud or rather the backs of them for they faced west i stood still for a moment and as i stood thought that i heard a faint sound as of someone reciting slowly i crept along the end of the outermost house and rubbing the cold sweat from my eyes peeped round the corner for it occurred to me that savages might be in possession then i saw what caused the sound a tattered blackened bearded man stood at the head of a long and shallow hole saying a prayer  it was henri marais although at the time i did not recognise him so changed was he a number of little mounds to the right and left of him told me however that the hole was a grave as i watched two more men appeared dragging between them the body of a woman which evidently they had not strength to carry as its legs trailed upon the ground from the shape of the corpse it seemed to be that of a tall young woman but the features i could not see because it was being dragged face downwards also the long hair hanging from the head hid them it was dark hair like maries they reached the grave and tumbled their sad burden into it but ii could not stir  at length my limbs obeyed my will i went forward to the men and said in a hollow voice in dutch  whom do you bury  johanna meyer answered someone mechanically for they did not seem to have taken the trouble to look at me as i listened to those words my heart which had stood still waiting for the answer beat again with a sudden bound that i could hear in the silence  i looked up there advancing from the doorway of one of the houses very slowly as though overpowered by weakness and leading by the hand a mere skeleton of a child who was chewing some leaves i sawi saw marie marais she was wasted to nothing but i could not mistake her eyes those great soft eyes that had grown so unnaturally large in the white thin face  she too saw me and stared for one moment then loosing the child she cast up her hands through which the sunlight shone as through parchment and slowly sank to the ground  she has gone too said one of the men in an indifferent voice i thought she would not last another day  now for the first time the man at the head of the grave turned lifting his hand he pointed to me whereon the other two men turned also  god above us he said in a choked voice at last i am quite mad look there stands the spook of young allan the son of the english prédicant who lived near cradock  as soon as i heard the voice i knew the speaker  oh mynheer marais i cried i am no ghost i am allan himself come to save you  marais made no answer he seemed bewildered but one of the men cried out crazily  how can you save us youngster unless you are ready to be eaten dont you see we starve we starve  i have wagons and food i answered  allemachte henri exclaimed the man with a wild laugh do you hear what your english spook says he says that he has wagons and food food food  then marais burst into tears and flung himself upon my breast nearly knocking me down i wrenched myself free of him and ran to marie who was lying face upwards on the ground she seemed to hear my step for her eyes opened and she struggled to a sitting posture  is it really you allan or do i dream she murmured  it is i it is i i answered lifting her to her feet for she seemed to weigh no more than a child her head fell upon my shoulder and she too began to weep  still holding her i turned to the men and said  why do you starve when there is game all about and i pointed to two fat elands strolling among the trees not more than a hundred and fifty yards away  can we kill game with stones asked one of them we whose powder was all burnt a month ago those buck he added with a wild laugh come here to mock us every morning but they will not walk into our pitfalls they know them too well and we have no strength to dig others  now when i left my wagons i had brought with me that same purdey rifle with which i had shot the geese in the match against pereira choosing it because it was so light to carry i held up my hand for silence set marie gently on the ground and began to steal towards the elands taking what shelter i could i got within a hundred yards of them when suddenly they took alarm being frightened in fact by my two zulu servants who were now arriving  off they galloped the big bull leading and vanished behind some trees i saw their line and that they would appear again between two clumps of bush about two hundred and fifty yards away hastily i raised the full sight on the rifle which was marked for two hundred yards lifted it and waited praying to god as i did so that my skill might not fail me  the bull appeared its head held forward its long horns lying flat upon the back the shot was very long and the beast very large to bring down with so small a bullet i aimed right forwardclear of it indeedhigh too in a line with its backbone and pressed the trigger  the rifle exploded the bullet clapped and the buck sprang forward faster than ever i had failed but what was this suddenly the great bull swung round and began to gallop towards us when it was not more than fifty yards away it fell in a heap rolled twice over like a shot rabbit and lay still that bullet was in its heart  the two kaffirs appeared breathless and streaming with perspiration  cut meat from the elands flank dont stop to skin it i said in my broken zulu helping the words out with signs  they understood and a minute later were at work with their assegais then i looked about me near by lay a store of dead branches placed there for fuel  have you fire i asked of the skeleton boers for they were nothing more  nein nein they answered our fire is dead  i produced the tinderbox which i carried with me and struck the flint ten minutes later we had a cheerful blaze and within threequarters of an hour good soup for iron pots were not wantingonly food to put into them i think that for the rest of that day those poor creatures did little else but eat sleeping between their meals oh the joy i had in feeding them especially after the wagons arrived bringing with them salthow they longed for that saltsugar and coffee    chapter ix the promise   of the original thirtyfive souls not reckoning natives who had accompanied henri marais upon his illfated expedition there now remained but nine alive at the new maraisfontein these were himself his daughter four prinsloosa family of extraordinary constitutionand three meyers being the husband of the poor woman i had seen committed to the grave and two of her six children the rest hernan pereira excepted had died of fever and actual starvation for when the fever lessened with the change of the seasons the starvation set in it appeared that with the exception of a very little they had stored their powder in a kind of outbuilding which they constructed placing it at a distance for safetys sake when most of the surviving men were away however a grass fire set light to this outbuilding and all the powder blew up  after this for a while they supplied the camp with food by the help of such ammunition as remained to them when that failed they dug pits in which to catch game in time the buck came to know of these pits so that they snared no more  then as the biltong or sundried meat they had made was all consumed they were driven to every desperate expedient that is known to the starving such as the digging up of bulbs the boiling of grass twigs and leaves the catching of lizards and so forth i believe that they actually ate caterpillars and earthworms but after their last fire went out through the neglect of the wretched kaffir who was left to watch it and having no tinder they failed to relight it by friction of course even this food failed them when i arrived they had practically been three days without anything to eat except green leaves and grass such as i saw the child chewing in another seventy hours doubtless every one of them would have been dead  well they recovered rapidly enough for those who had survived its ravages were evidently now impervious to fever who can tell the joy that i experienced as i watched marie returning from the very brink of the grave to a state of full and lovely womanhood after all we were not so far away from the primitive conditions of humanity when the first duty of man was to feed his women and his children and i think that something of that instinct remains with us at least i know i never experienced a greater pleasure than i did when the woman i loved the poor starving woman ate and ate of the food which i was able to give hershe who for weeks had existed upon locusts and herbs  for the first few days we did not talk much except of the immediate necessities of the hour which occupied all our thoughts afterwards when marais and his daughter were strong enough to bear it we had some conversation he began by asking how i came to find them  i replied through maries letter which it appeared he knew nothing of for he had forbidden her to write to me  it seems fortunate that you were disobeyed mynheer i said to which he answered nothing  then i told the tale of the arrival of that letter at the mission station in the cape colony by the hand of a wandering smous and of my desperate ride upon the swift mare to port elizabeth where i just succeeded in catching the brig seven stars before she sailed also i told them of the lucky chances that enabled me to buy the wagons and find a guide to their camp reaching it but a few hours before it was too late  it was a great deed said henri marais taking the pipe from his mouth for i had brought tobacco among my stores but tell me allan why did you do it for the sake of one who has not treated you kindly  i did it i answered for the sake of one who has always treated me kindly and i nodded towards marie who was engaged in washing up the cooking pots at a distance  i suppose so allan but you know she is affianced to another  i know that she is affianced to me and to no other i answered warmly adding and pray where is this other if he lives i do not see him here  no replied marais in a curious voice the truth is allan that hernan pereira left us about a fortnight before you came one horse remained which was his and with two hottentots who were also his servants he rode back upon the track by which we came to try to find help since then we have heard nothing of him  indeed and how did he propose to get food on the way  he had a rifle or rather they all three had rifles and about a hundred charges between them which escaped the fire  with a hundred charges of powder carefully used your camp would have been fed for a month or perhaps two months i remarked yet he went away with all of themto find help  that is so allan we begged him to stay but he would not and after all the charges were his own property no doubt he thought he acted for the best especially as marie would have none of him marais added with emphasis  well i replied it seems that it is i who have brought you the help and not pereira also by the way mynheer i have brought you the money my father collected on your account and some £500 of my own or what is left of it in goods and gold moreover marie does not refuse me say therefore to which of us does she belong  it would seem that it should be to you he answered slowly since you have shown yourself so faithful and were it not for you she would now be lying yonder and he pointed to the little heaps that covered the bones of most of the expedition yes yes it would seem that it should be to you who twice have saved her life and once have saved mine also  now i suppose that he saw on my face the joy which i could not conceal for he added hastily yet allan years ago i swore on the book before god that never with my will should my daughter marry an englishman even if he were a good englishman also just before we left the colony i swore again in her presence and that of hernan pereira that i would not give her to you so i cannot break my oath can i if i did the good god would be avenged upon me  some might think that when i came here the good god was in the way of being avenged upon you for the keeping of that evil oath i answered bitterly glancing in my turn at the graves  yes they might allan he replied without anger for all his troubles had induced a reasonable frame of mind in himfor a while yet his ways are past finding out are they not  now my anger broke out and rising i said  do you mean mynheer marais that notwithstanding the love between us which you know is true and deep and notwithstanding that i alone have been able to drag both of you and the others out of the claws of death i am never to marry marie do you mean that she is to be given to a braggart who deserted her in her need  and what if i do mean that allan  this although i am still young as you know well i am a man who can think and act for himself also i am your master herei have cattle and guns and servants well i will take marie and if any should try to stop me i know how to protect myself and her  this bold speech did not seem to surprise him in the least or to make him think the worse of me he looked at me for a while pulling his long beard in a meditative fashion then answered  i dare say that at your age i should have played the same game and it is true that you have things in your fist but much as she may love you marie would not go away with you and leave her father to starve  then you can come with us as my fatherinlaw mynheer marais at any rate it is certain that i will not go away and leave her here to starve  now i think that something which he saw in my eye showed him that i was in earnest at least he changed his tone and began to argue almost to plead  be reasonable allan he said how can you marry marie when there is no prédicant to marry you surely if you love her so much you would not pour mud upon her name even in this wilderness  she might not think it mud i replied men and women have been married without the help of priests before now by open declaration and public report for instance and their children held to be born in wedlock i know that for i have read of the law of marriage  it may be allan though i hold no marriage good unless the holy words are said but why do you not let me come to the end of my story  because i thought it was ended mynheer marais  not so allan i told you that i had sworn that she should never marry you with my will but when she is of age which will be in some six months time my will counts no longer seeing that then she is a free woman who can dispose of herself also i shall be clear of my oath for no harm will come to my soul if that happens which i cannot help now are you satisfied  i dont know i answered doubtfully for somehow all maraiss casuistry which i thought contemptible did not convince me that he was sincere i dont know i repeated much may chance in six months  of course allan for instance marie might change her mind and marry someone else  or i might not be there to marry mynheer accidents sometimes happen to men who are not wanted especially in wild countries or for the matter of that to those who are  allemachte allan you do not mean that i  no mynheer i interrupted but there are other people in the world besides yourselfhernan pereira for example if he lives still i am not the only one concerned in this matter there is marie yonder shall i call her  he nodded preferring probably that i should speak to her in his presence rather than alone  so i called marie who was watching our talk somewhat anxiously while she went about her tasks she came at once a very different marie to the starving girl of a while before for although she was still thin and drawn her youth and beauty were returning to her fast under the influences of good food and happiness  what is it allan she asked gently i told her all repeating our conversation and the arguments which had been used on either side word for word as nearly as i could remember them  is that right i asked of marais when i had finished  it is right you have a good memory he answered  very well and now what have you to say marie  i dear allan why this my life belongs to you who have twice saved this body of mine from death as my love and spirit belong to you therefore i should have thought it no shame if i had been given to you here and now before the people and afterwards married by a clergyman when we found one but my father has sworn an oath which weighs upon his mind and he has shown you that within six monthsa short six monthsthat oath dies of itself since by the law he can no longer control me so allan as i would not grieve him or perhaps lead him to say and do what is foolish i think it would be well that we should wait for those six months if on his part he promises that he will then do nothing to prevent our marriage  ja ja i promise that then i will do nothing to prevent your marriage answered marais eagerly like one who has suddenly seen some loophole of escape from an impossible position adding as though to himself but god may do something to prevent it for all that  we are every one of us in the hand of god she replied in her sweet voice allan you hear my father has promised  yes marie he has promisedafter a fashion i replied gloomily for somehow his words struck a chill through me  i have promised allan and i will keep my promise to you as i have kept my oath to god attempting to work you no harm and leaving all in his hands but you on your part must promise also that till she is of age you will not take marie as a wifeno not if you were left alone together in the veld you must be as people who are affianced to each other no more  so having no choice i promised though with a heavy heart then i suppose in order to make this solemn contract public marais called the surviving boers who were loitering near and repeated to them the terms of the contract that we had made  the men laughed and shrugged their shoulders but vrouw prinsloo i remember said outright that she thought the business foolish since if anyone had a right to marie i had wherever i chose to take her she added that as for hernan pereira he was a sneak and a stinkcat who had gone off to save his own life and left them all to die if she were marie should they meet again she would greet him with a pailful of dirty water in the face as she herself meant to do if she got the chance  vrouw prinsloo it will be observed was a very outspoken woman and i may add an honest one  so this contract was settled i have set it out at length because of its importance in our story but now i wishah how i wish that i had insisted upon being married to marie then and there if i had done so i think i should have carried my point for i was the master of many legions in the shape of cattle food and ammunition and rather than risk a quarrel with me the other boers would have forced marais to give way but we were young and inexperienced also it was fated otherwise who can question the decrees of fate written immutably perhaps long before we were born in the everlasting book of human destinies  yet when i had shaken off my first fears and doubts my lot and maries were very happy a perfect paradise indeed compared with what we had gone through during that bitter time of silence and separation at any rate we were acknowledged to be affianced by the little society in which we lived including her father and allowed to be as much alone together as we liked this meant that we met at dawn only to separate at nightfall for having little or no artificial light we went to rest with the sun or shortly after it sweet indeed was that companionship of perfect trust and love so sweet that even after all these years i do not care to dwell upon the holy memory of those blessed months  so soon as the surviving boers began to recover by the help of my stores and medicines and the meat which i shot in plenty of course great discussions arose as to our future plans first it was suggested that we should trek to lorenzo marquez and wait for a ship there to take us down to natal for none of them would hear of returning beggared to the cape to tell the story of their failure and dreadful bereavements i pointed out however that no ship might come for a long while perhaps for one or two years and that lorenzo marquez and its neighborhood seemed to be a poisonous place to live in  the next idea was that we should stop where we were one which i rather welcomed as i should have been glad to abide in peace with marie until the six months of probation had gone by  however in the end this was rejected for many good reasons thus half a score of white people of whom four were members of a single family were certainly not strong enough to form a settlement especially as the surrounding natives might become actively hostile at any moment again the worst fever season was approaching in which we should very possibly all be carried off further we had no breeding cattle or horses which would not live in this veld and only the ammunition and goods that i had brought with me  so it was clear that but one thing remained to be done namely to trek back to what is now the transvaal territory or better still to natal for this route would enable us to avoid the worst of the mountains there we might join some other party of the emigrant boersfor choice that of retief of whose arrival over the drakensberg i was able to tell them  that point settled we made our preparations to begin with i had only enough oxen for two wagons whereas even if we abandoned the rest of them we must take at least four therefore through my kaffirs i opened negotiations with the surrounding natives who when they heard that i was not a boer and was prepared to pay for what i bought soon expressed a willingness to trade indeed very shortly we had quite a market established to which cattle were brought that i bargained for and purchased giving cloth knives hoes and the usual kaffir goods in payment for the same  also they brought mealies and other corn and oh the delight with which those poor people who for months and months had existed upon nothing but fleshmeat ate of this farinaceous food never shall i forget seeing marie and the surviving children partake of their first meal of porridge and washing the sticky stuff down with draughts of fresh sugared milk for with the oxen i had succeeded in obtaining two good cows it is enough to say that this change of diet soon completely reestablished their health and made marie more beautiful than she had ever been before  having got the oxen the next thing was to break them to the yoke for although docile creatures enough they had never even seen a wagon this proved a long and difficult process involving many trial trips moreover the selected wagons one of which had belonged to pereira must be mended with very insufficient tools and without the help of a forge indeed had it not chanced that hans the hottentot had worked for a wagonmaker at some indefinite period of his career i do not think that we could have managed the job at all  it was while we were busy with these tasks that some news arrived which was unpleasing enough to everyone except perhaps to henri marais i was engaged on a certain evening in trying to make sixteen of the kaffir cattle pull together in the yoke instead of tying themselves into a double knot and oversetting the wagon when hans who was helping me suddenly called out  look baas here comes one of my brothers or in other words a hottentot  following the line of his hand i saw a thin and wretched creature clad only in some rags and the remains of a big hat with the crown out staggering towards us between the trees  why exclaimed marie in a startled voice for as usual she was at my side it is klaus one of my cousin hernans afterriders  so long as it is not your cousin hernan himself i do not care i said  presently the poor starved totty arrived and throwing himself down begged for food a cold shoulder of buck was given to him which he devoured holding it in both hands and tearing off great lumps of flesh with his teeth like a wild beast  when at last he was satisfied marais who had come up with the other boers asked him whence he came and what was his news of his master  out of the bush he answered and my news of the baas is that he is dead at least i left him so ill that i suppose he must be dead by now  why did you leave him if he was ill asked marais  because he told me to baas that i might find help for we were starving having fired our last bullet  is he alone then  yes yes except for the wild beasts and the vultures a lion ate the other man his servant a long while ago  how far is he off asked marais again  oh baas about five hours journey on horseback on a good road this would be some thirtyfive miles  then he told this story pereira with his two hottentot servants he mounted and they on foot had traversed about a hundred miles of rough country in safety when at night a lion killed and carried off one of the hottentots and frightened away the horse which was never seen again pereira and klaus proceeded on foot till they came to a great river on the banks of which they met some kaffirs who appear to have been zulus on outpost duty these men demanded their guns and ammunition to take to their king and on pereira refusing to give them up said that they would kill them both in the morning after they had made him instruct them in the use of the guns by beating him with sticks  in the night a storm came on under cover of which pereira and klaus escaped as they dared not go forward for fear lest they should fall into the hands of the zulus they fled back northwards running all night only to find in the morning that they had lost their way in the bush this had happened nearly a month beforeor at any rate klaus thought so for no doubt the days went very slowlyduring which time they had wandered about trying to shape some sort of course by the sun with the object of returning to the camp they met no man black or white and supported themselves upon game which they shot and ate raw or sundried till at length all their powder was done and they threw away their heavy roers which they could no longer carry  it was at this juncture that from the top of a tall tree klaus saw a certain koppie a long way off which he recognised as being within fifteen miles or so of maraiss camp by now they were starving only klaus was the stronger of the two for he found and devoured some carrion a dead hyena i think it was pereira also tried to eat this horrible food but not having the stomach of a hottentot the first mouthful of it made him dreadfully ill they sought shelter in a cave on the bank of a stream where grew watercresses and other herbs such as wild asparagus here it was that pereira told klaus to try to make his way back to the camp and should he find anyone alive there to bring him succour  so klaus went taking the remaining leg of the hyena with him and on the afternoon of the second day arrived as has been told    chapter x vrouw prinsloo speaks her mind   now when the hottentots story was finished a discussion arose marais said that someone must go to see whether his nephew still lived to which the other boers replied ja in an indifferent voice then the vrouw prinsloo took up her parable  she remarked as she had done before that in her judgment hernan pereira was a stinkcat and a sneak who had tried to desert them in their trouble and by the judgment of a just god had got into trouble himself personally she wished that the lion had taken him instead of the worthy hottentot although it gave her a higher opinion of lions to conclude that it had not done so because if it did it thought it would have been poisoned well her view was that it would be just as well to let that traitor lie upon the bed which he had made moreover doubtless by now he was dead so what was the good of bothering about him  these sentiments appeared to appeal to the boers for they remarked ja what is the good  is it right asked marais to abandon a comrade in misfortune one of our own blood  mein gott replied vrouw prinsloo he is no blood of mine the evilodoured portuguee but i admit he is of yours heer marais being your sisters son so it is evident that you should be the one to go to seek after him  that seems to be so vrouw prinsloo said marais in his meditative manner yet i must remember that i have marie to look after  ach and so had he too until he remembered his own skin and went off with the only horse and all the powder leaving her and the rest of us to starve well you wont go and prinsloo wont go nor my boy either for ill see to that so meyer must go  nein nein good vrouw answered meyer i have those children that are left to me to consider  then exclaimed vrouw prinsloo triumphantly nobody will go so let us forget this stinkcat as he forgot us  does it seem right asked marais again that a christian man should be left to starve in the wilderness and he looked at me  tell me heer marais i remarked answering the look why should i of all people go to look for the heer pereira one who has not dealt too well with me  i do not know allan yet the book tells us to turn the other cheek and to forget injuries still it is for you to judge remembering that we must answer for all things at the last day and not for me i only know that were i your age and not burdened with a daughter to watch over i should go  why should you talk to me thus i asked with indignation why do you not go yourself seeing that i am quite ready to look after marie here the vrouw prinsloo and the other boers tittered and why do you not address your remarks to these other heeren instead of to me seeing that they are the friends and trekcompanions of your nephew  at this point the male prinsloos and meyer found that they had business elsewhere  it is for you to judge yet remember allan that it is an awful thing to appear before our maker with the blood of a fellow creature upon our hands but if you and these other hardhearted men will not go i at my age and weak as i am with all that i have suffered will go myself  good said vrouw prinsloo that is the best way out of it you will soon get sick of the journey heer marais and we shall see no more of the stinkcat  marais rose in a resigned fashion for he never deigned to argue with vrouw prinsloo who was too many for him and said  farewell marie if i do not return you will remember my wishes and my will may be found between the first leaves of our holy book get up klaus and guide me to your master and he administered a somewhat vicious kick to the gorged and prostrate hottentot  now marie who all this while had stood silent touched me on the shoulder and said  allan is it well that my father should go alone will you not accompany him  of course i answered cheerfully on such a business there should be two and some kaffirs also to carry the man if he still lives  now for the end of the story as the hottentot klaus was too exhausted to move that night it was arranged that we should start at dawn accordingly i rose before the light and was just finishing my breakfast when marie appeared at the wagon in which i slept i got up to greet her and there being no one in sight we kissed each other several times  have done my heart she said pushing me away i come to you from my father who is sick in his stomach and would see you  which means that i shall have to go after your cousin alone i replied with indignant emphasis  she shook her head and led me to the little shanty in which she slept here by the growing light that entered through the doorway for it had no window i perceived marais seated upon a wooden stool with his hands pressed on his middle and groaning  good morning allan he said in a melancholy voice i am ill very ill something that i have eaten perhaps or a chill in the stomach such as often precedes fever or dysentery  perhaps you will get better as you walk mynheer i suggested for to tell the truth i misdoubted me of this chill and knew that he had eaten nothing but what was quite wholesome  walk god alone knows how i can walk with something gripping my inside like a wagonmakers vice yet i will try for it is impossible to leave that poor hernan to die alone and if i do not go to seek him it seems that no one else will  why should not some of my kaffirs go with klaus i asked  allan he replied solemnly if you were dying in a cave far from help would you think well of those who sent raw kaffirs to succour you when they might have come themselves kaffirs who certainly would let you die and return with some false story  i dont know what i should think heer marais but i do know that if i were in that cave and pereira were in this camp neither would he come himself nor so much as send a savage to save me  it may be so allan but even if anothers heart is black should yours be black also oh i will come though it be to my death and rising from the stool with the most dreadful groan he began to divest himself of the tattered blanket in which he was wrapped up  oh allan my father must not go it will kill him exclaimed marie who took a more serious view of his case than i did  very well if you think so i answered and now as it is time for me to be starting goodbye  you have a good heart allan said marais sinking back upon his stool and resuming his blanket while marie looked despairingly first at one and then at the other of us  half an hour later i was on the road in the very worst of tempers  mind what you are about called vrouw prinsloo after me it is not lucky to save an enemy and if i know anything of that stinkcat he will bite your finger badly by way of gratitude bah lad if i were you i should just camp for a few days in the bush and then come back and say that i could find nothing of pereira except the dead hyenas that had been poisoned by eating him good luck to you all the same allan may i find such a friend in need it seems to me that you were born to help others  beside the hottentot klaus my companions on this unwelcome journey were three of the zulu kaffirs for hans i was obliged to leave in charge of my cattle and goods with the other men also i took a packox an active beast that i had been training to carry loads and if necessary a man although as yet it was not very well broken  all that day we marched over extremely rough country till at last darkness found us in a mountainous kloof where we slept surrounded by watchfires because of the lions next morning at the first light we moved on again and about ten oclock waded through a stream to a little natural cave where klaus said he had left his master this cave seemed extremely silent and as i hesitated for a moment at its mouth the thought crossed my mind that if pereira were still there he must be dead indeed do what i would to suppress it with that reflection came a certain feeling of relief and even of pleasure for well i knew that pereira alive was more dangerous to me than all the wild men and beasts in africa put together thrusting back this unworthy sentiment as best i could i entered the cave alone for the natives who dread the defilement of the touch of a corpse lingered outside  it was but a shallow cavity washed out of the overhanging rock by the action of water and as soon as my eyes grew accustomed to its gloom i saw that at the end of it lay a man so still did he lie that now i was almost certain that his troubles were over i went up to him and touched his face which was cold and clammy and then quite convinced turned to leave the place which i thought if a few rocks were piled in the mouth of it would make an excellent sepulchre  just as i stepped out into the sunlight and was about to call to the men to collect the rocks however i thought that i heard a very faint groan behind me which at the moment i set down to imagination still i returned though i did not much like the job knelt down by the figure and waited with my hand over its heart for five minutes or more i stayed here and then quite convinced was about to leave again when for the second time i heard that faint groan pereira was not dead but only on the extreme brink of death  i ran to the entrance of the cave calling the kaffirs and together we carried him out into the sunlight he was an awful spectacle mere bone with yellow skin stretched over it and covered with filth and clotted blood from some hurt i had brandy with me of which i poured a little down his throat whereon his heart began to beat feebly then we made some soup and poured that down his throat with more brandy and the end of it was he came to life again  for three days did i doctor that man and really i believe that if at any time during those days i had relaxed my attentions even for a couple of hours he would have slipped through my fingers for at this business klaus and the kaffirs were no good at all but i pulled him round and on the third morning he came to his senses for a long while he stared at me for i had laid him in the mouth of the cave where the light was good although the overhanging rocks protected him from the sun then he said  allemachte you remind me of someone young man i know it is of that damned english boy who beat me at the goose shooting and made me quarrel with oom uncle retief the jackanapes that marie was so fond of well whoever you are you cant be he thank god  you are mistaken heer pereira i answered i am that same damned young english jackanapes allan quatermain by name who beat you at shooting but if you take my advice you will thank god for something else namely that your life has been saved  who saved it he asked  if you want to know i did i have been nursing you these three days  you allan quatermain now that is strange for certainly i would not have saved yours and he laughed a little then turned over and went to sleep  from that time forward his recovery was rapid and two days later we began our journey back to maraiss camp the convalescent pereira being carried in a litter by the four natives it was a task at which they grumbled a good deal for the load was heavy over rough ground and whenever they stumbled or shook him he cursed at them so much did he curse indeed that at length one of the zulus a man with a rough temper said that if it were not for the inkoos meaning myself he would put his assegai through him and let the vultures carry him after this pereira grew much more polite when the bearers became exhausted we set him on the packox which two of us led while the other two supported him on either side it was in this fashion that at last we arrived at the camp one evening  here the vrouw prinsloo was the first to greet us we found her standing in the game path which we were following quite a quarter of a mile from the wagons with her hands set upon her broad hips and her feet apart her attitude was so defiant and had about it such an air of premeditation that i cannot help thinking she had got wind of our return perhaps from having seen the smoke of our last fires and was watching for us also her greeting was warm  ah here you come hernan pereira she cried riding on an ox while better men walk well now i want a chat with you how came it that you went off in the night taking the only horse and all the powder  i went to get help for you he replied sulkily  did you did you indeed well it seems that it was you who wanted the help after all what do you mean to pay the heer allan quatermain for saving your life for i am sure he has done so you have got no goods left although you were always boasting about your riches they are now at the bottom of a river so it will have to be in love and service  he muttered something about my wanting no payment for a christian act  no he wants no payment hernan pereira he is one of the true sort but youll pay him all the same and in bad coin if you get the chance oh i have come out to tell you what i think of you you are a stinkcat do you hear that a thing that no dog would bite if he could help it you are a traitor also you brought us to this cursed country where you said your relatives would give us wealth and land and then after famine and fever attacked us you rode away and left us to die to save your own dirty skin and now you come back here for help saved by him whom you cheated in the goose kloof by him whose true love you have tried to steal oh mein gott why does the almighty leave such fellows alive while so many that are good and honest and innocent lie beneath the soil because of stinkcats like you  so she went on striding at the side of the packox and reviling pereira in a ceaseless stream of language until at length he thrust his thumbs into his ears and glared at her in speechless wrath  thus it was that at last we arrived in the camp where having seen us coming all the boers were gathered they are not a particularly humorous people but this spectacle of the advance of pereira seated on the packox a steed that is becoming to few riders with the furious and portly vrouw prinsloo striding at his side and shrieking abuse at him caused them to burst into laughter then pereiras temper gave out and he became even more abusive than vrouw prinsloo  is this the way you receive me you veldhogs you common boers who are not fit to mix with a man of position and learning like myself he began  then in gods name why do you mix with us hernan pereira asked the saturnine meyer thrusting his face forward till the newgate fringe he wore by way of a beard literally seemed to curl with wrath when we were hungry you did not wish it for you slunk away and left us taking all the powder but now that we are full again thanks to the little englishman and you are hungry you come back well if i had my way i would give you a gun and six days rations and turn you out to shift for yourself  dont be afraid jan meyer shouted pereira from the back of the packox as soon as i am strong enough i will leave you in charge of your english captain hereand he pointed to meand go to tell our people what sort of folk you are  that is good news interrupted prinsloo a stolid old boer who stood by puffing at his pipe get well get well as soon as you can hernan pereira  it was at this juncture that marais arrived accompanied by marie where he came from i do not know but i think he must have been keeping in the background on purpose to see what kind of a reception pereira would meet with  silence brothers he said is this the way you greet my nephew who has returned from the gate of death when you should be on your knees thanking god for his deliverance  then go on your knees and thank him yourself henri marais screamed the irrepressible vrouw prinsloo i give thanks for the safe return of allan here though it is true they would be warmer if he had left this stinkcat behind him allemachte henri marais why do you make so much of this portuguese fellow has he bewitched you or is it because he is your sisters son or because you want to force marie there to marry him or is it perhaps that he knows of something bad in your past life and you have to bribe him to keep his mouth shut  now whether this last unpleasant suggestion was a mere random arrow drawn from vrouw prinsloos wellstored quiver or whether the vrouw had got hold of the tailend of some longburied truth i do not know of course however the latter explanation is possible many men have done things in their youth which they do not wish to see dug up in their age and pereira may have learned a family secret of the kind from his mother  at any rate the effect of the old ladys words upon marais was quite remarkable suddenly he went into one of his violent and constitutional rages he cursed vrouw prinsloo he cursed everybody else assuring them severally and collectively that heaven would come even with them he said there was a plot against him and his nephew and that i was at the bottom of it i who had made his daughter fond of my ugly little face so furious were his words whereof there were many more which i have forgotten that at length marie began to cry and ran away presently too the boers strolled off shrugging their shoulders one of them saying audibly that marais had gone quite mad at last as he always thought he would  then marais followed them throwing up his arms and still cursing as he went and slipping over the tail of the packox pereira followed him so the vrouw prinsloo and i were left alone for the coloured men had departed as they always do when white people begin to quarrel  there allan my boy said the vrouw in triumph i have found the sore place on the mules back and didnt i make him squeal and kick although on most days of the week he seems to be such a good and quiet muleat any rate of late  i dare say you did vrouw i said wrathfully but i wish you would leave mynheer maraiss sore places alone seeing that if the squeals are for you the kicks are for me  what does that matter allan she asked he always was your enemy so that it is just as well you should see his heels when you are out of reach of them my poor boy i think you will have a bad time of it between the stinkcat and the mule although you have done so much for both of them well there is one thingmarie has a true heart she will never marry any man except yourself allaneven if you are not here to marry she added by an afterthought  the old lady paused a little staring at the ground then she looked up and said  allan my dear for she was really fond of me and called me thus at times you didnt take the advice i gave you namely to look for pereira and not to find him well i will give you some more which you will take if you are wise  what is it i asked doubtfully for although she was upright enough in her own way the vrouw prinsloo could bring herself to look at things in strange lights like many other women she judged of moral codes by the impulses of her heart and was quite prepared to stretch them to suit circumstances or to gain an end which she considered good in itself  just this lad do you make a two days march with marie into the bush i want a little change so i will come too and marry you there for i have got a prayerbook and can spell out the service if we go through it once or twice first  now the vision of marie and myself being married by the vrouw prinsloo in the vast and untrodden veld although attractive was so absurd that i laughed  why do you laugh allan anyone can marry people if there is no one else there indeed i believe that they can marry themselves  i dare say i answered not wishing to enter into a legal argument with the vrouw but you see tante i solemnly promised her father that i would not marry her until she was of age and if i broke my word i should not be an honest man  an honest man she exclaimed with the utmost contempt an honest man well are marais and hernan pereira honest men why do you not cut your stick the same length as theirs allan quatermain i tell you that your verdomde honesty will be your ruin you remember my words later on and she marched off in high dudgeon  when she had gone i went to my wagons where hans was waiting for me with a detailed and interminable report of everything that had happened in my absence glad was i to find that except for the death of one sickly ox nothing had gone wrong when at length he had ended his long story i ate some food which marie sent over for me ready cooked for i was too tired to join any of the boers that night just as i had finished my meal and was thinking of turning in marie herself appeared within the circle of the campfires light i sprang up and ran to her saying that i had not expected to see her that evening and did not like to come to the house  no she answered drawing me back into the shadows i understand my father seems very much upset almost mad indeed if the vrouw prinsloos tongue had been a snakes fang it could not have stung him worse  and where is pereira i asked  oh my cousin sleeps in the other room he is weak and worn out all the same allan he wanted to kiss me so i told him at once how matters stood between you and me and that we were to be married in six months  what did he say to that i asked  he turned to my father and said is this true my uncle and my father answered yes that is the best bargain i could make with the englishman seeing that you were not here to make a better  and what happened then marie  oh then hernan thought a while at last he looked up and said i understand things have gone badly i acted for the best who went away to try to find help for all of you i failed meanwhile the englishman came and saved you afterwards he saved me also uncle in all this i see gods hand had it not been for this allan none of us would be alive yes god used him that we might be kept alive well he has promised that he will not marry marie for six months and you know my uncle that some of these english are great fools they keep their promises even to their own loss now in six months much may happen who knows what will happen  were you present when you heard all this marie i asked  no allan i was the other side of the reed partition but at those words i entered and said my father and cousin hernan please understand that there is one thing which will never happen  what is that asked my cousin  it will never happen that i shall marry you hernan i replied  who knows marie who knows he said  i do hernan i answered even if allan were to die tomorrow i would not marry you either then or twenty years hence i am glad that he has saved your life but henceforth we are cousins nothing more  you hear what the girl tells us said my father why do you not give up the business what is the use of kicking against the pricks  if one wears stout boots and kicks hard enough the pricks give way said hernan six months is a long time my uncle  it may be so cousin i said but remember that neither six months nor six years nor six thousand years are long enough to make me marry any man except allan quatermain who has just rescued you from death do you understand  yes he replied i understand that you will not marry me only then i promise that you shall not marry either allan quatermain or any other man  god will decide that i answered and came away leaving him and my father together and now allan tell me all that has happened since we parted  so i told her everything including the vrouw prinsloos advice  of course allan you were quite right she remarked when i had finished but i am not sure that the vrouw prinsloo was not also right in her own fashion i am afraid of my cousin hernan who holds my father in his handfast fast still we have promised and must keep our word    chapter xi the shot in the kloof   i think it was about three weeks after these events that we began our southward trek on the morning subsequent to our arrival at maraiss camp pereira came up to me when several people were present and taking my hand thanked me in a loud voice for having saved his life thenceforward he declared i should be dearer to him than a brother for was there not a blood bond between us  i answered i did not think any such bond existed indeed i was not sure what it meant i had done my duty by him neither less nor more and there was nothing further to be said  it turned out however that there was a great deal further to be said since pereira desired to borrow money or rather goods from me he explained that owing to the prejudices of the vulgar boers who remained alive in that camp and especially of the scandaloustongued vrouw prinsloo both he and his uncle had come to the conclusion that it would be wise for him to remove himself as soon as possible therefore he proposed to trek away alone  i answered that i should have thought he had done enough solitary travelling in this veld seeing how his last expedition had ended he replied that he had indeed but everyone here was so bitter against him that no choice was left then he added with an outburst of truth  allemachte mynheer quatermain do you suppose that it is pleasant for me to see you making love all day to the maid who was my betrothed and to see her paying back the love with her eyes yes and doubtless with her lips too from all i hear  you could leave her whom you called your betrothed but who never was betrothed to anyone but me with her own will to starve in the veld mynheer why then should you be angry because i picked up that which you threw away that too which was always my own and not yours had it not been for me there would now be no maid left for us to quarrel over as had it not been for me there would be no man left for me to quarrel with about the maid  are you god then englishman that you dispose of the lives of men and women at your will it was he who saved us not you  he may have saved you but it was through me i carried out the rescue of these poor people whom you deserted and i nursed you back to life  i did not desert them i went to get help for them  taking all the powder and the only horse with you well that is done with and now you want to borrow goods to pay for cattlefrom me whom you hate you are not proud mynheer pereira when you have an end to serve whatever that end may be and i looked at him my instinct warned me against this false and treacherous man who i felt was even then plotting in his heart to bring some evil upon me  no i am not proud why should i be seeing that i mean to repay you twice over for anything which you may lend me now  i reflected a while certainly our journey to natal would be pleasanter if pereira were not of the company also if he went with us i was sure that before we came to the end of that trek one or other of us would leave his bones on the road in short not to put too fine a point on it i feared lest in this way or in that he would bring me to my death in order that he might possess himself of marie we were in a wild country with few witnesses and no law courts where such deeds might be done again and again and the doer never called to account for lack of evidence and judges  so i made up my mind to fall in with his wishes and we began to bargain the end of it was that i advanced him enough of my remaining goods to buy the cattle he required from the surrounding natives it was no great quantity after all seeing that in this uncivilised place an ox could be purchased for a few strings of beads or a cheap knife further i sold him a few of the beasts that i had broken a gun some ammunition and certain other necessaries for all of which things he gave me a note of hand written in my pocketbook indeed i did more for as none of the boers would help him i assisted pereira to break in the cattle he bought and even consented when he asked me to give him the services of two of the zulus whom i had hired  all these preparations took a long while if i remember right twelve more days had gone by before pereira finally trekked off from maraiss camp by which time he was quite well and strong again  we all assembled to see the start and marais offered up a prayer for his nephews safe journey and our happy meeting again in natal at the laager of retief which was to be our rendezvous if that leader were still in natal no one else joined in the prayer only vrouw prinsloo audibly added another of her own it was to the effect that he might not come back a second time and that she might never see his face again either at retiefs laager or anywhere else if it would please the good lord so to arrange matters  the boers tittered even the meyer children tittered for by this time the hatred of the vrouw prinsloo for hernan pereira was the joke of the place but pereira himself pretended not to hear said goodbye to us all affectionately adding a special petition for the vrouw prinsloo and off we went  i say we went because with my usual luck to help him with the halfbroken oxen i was commandeered to accompany this man to his first outspan a place with good water about twelve miles from the camp where he proposed to remain for the night  now as we started about ten oclock in the morning and the veld was fairly level i expected that we should reach this outspan by three or four in the afternoon which would give me time to walk back before sunset in fact however so many accidents happened of one sort or another both to the wagon itself of which the woodwork had shrunk with long standing in the sun and to the cattle which being unused to the yoke tied themselves in a double knot upon every opportunity that we only arrived there at the approach of night  the last mile of that trek was through a narrow gorge cut out by water in the native rock here trees grew sparsely also great ferns but the bottom of the gorge along which game were accustomed to travel was smooth enough for wagons save for a few fallen boulders which it was necessary to avoid  when at length we reached the outspan i asked the hottentot klaus who was assisting me to drive the team where his master was for i could not see him anywhere he answered that he had gone back down the kloof to look for something that had fallen from the wagon a bolt i think he said  very good i replied then tell him if we do not meet that i have returned to the camp  as i set out the sun was sinking below the horizon but this did not trouble me overmuch as i had a rifle with me that same light rifle with which i had shot the geese in the great match also i knew that the moon being full would be up presently  the sun sank and the kloof was plunged in gloom the place seemed eerie and lonesome and suddenly i grew afraid i began to wonder where pereira was and what he might be doing i even thought of turning back and finding some way round only having explored all this district pretty thoroughly in my various shooting expeditions from the camp i knew there was no practicable path across those hills so i went on with my rifle at full cock whistling to keep up my courage which of course in the circumstances was a foolish thing to do it occurred to me at the time that it was foolish but in truth i would not give way to the dark suspicions which crossed my mind doubtless by now pereira had passed me and reached the outspan  the moon began to shinethat wonderful african moon which turns night to daythrowing a network of long black shadows of trees and rocks across the game track i was following right ahead of me was a particularly dark patch of this shadow caused by a projecting wall of cliff and beyond it an equally bright patch of moonlight somehow i misdoubted me of that stretch of gloom for although of course i could see nothing there my quick ear caught the sound of movements  i halted for a moment then reflecting that these were doubtless caused by some nightwalking creature which even should it chance to be dangerous would flee at the approach of man i plunged into it boldly as i emerged at the other endthe shadow was eighteen or twenty paces longit occurred to me that if any enemy were lurking there i should be an easy target as i entered the line of clear light so almost instinctively for i do not remember that i reasoned the thing out after my first two steps forward in the light i gave a little spring to the left where there was still shadow although it was not deep well was it for me that i did so for at that moment i felt something touch my cheek and heard the loud report of a gun immediately behind me  now the wisest course would have been for me to run before whoever had fired found time to reload but a kind of fury seized me and run i would not on the contrary i turned with a shout and charged back into the shadow something heard me coming something fled in front of me in a few seconds we were out into the moonlight beyond and as i expected i saw that this something was a manpereira  he halted and wheeled round lifting the stock of his gun club fashion  thank god it is you heer allan he said i thought you were a tiger  then it is your last thought murderer i answered raising my rifle  dont shoot he said would you have my blood upon you why do you want to kill me  why did you try to kill me i answered covering him  i try to kill you are you mad listen for your own sake i sat down on the bank yonder waiting for the moon and being tired fell asleep then i woke up with a start and thinking from the sounds that a tiger was after me fired to scare it allemachte man if i had aimed at you could i have missed at that distance  you did not quite miss and had i not stepped to the left you would have blown my head off say your prayers you dog  allan quatermain he exclaimed with desperate energy you think i lie who speak the truth kill me if you will only then remember that you will hang for it we court one woman that is known and who will believe this story of yours that i tried to shoot you soon the kaffirs will come to look for me probably they are starting already and will find my body with your bullet in my heart then they will take it back to maraiss camp and i saywho will believe your story  some i think murderer but as i spoke the words a chill of fear struck me it was true i could prove nothing having no witnesses and henceforward i should be a cain among the boers one who had slain a man for jealousy his gun was empty yes but it might be said that i had fired it after his death and as for the graze upon my cheekwhy a twig might have caused it what should i do then drive him before me to the camp and tell this tale even then it would be but my word against his no he had me in a forked stick i must let him go and trust that heaven would avenge his crime since i could not moreover by now my first rage was cooling and to execute a man thus  hernan pereira i said you are a liar and a coward you tried to butcher me because marie loves me and hates you and you want to force her to marry you yet i cannot shoot you down in cold blood as you deserve i leave it to god to punish you as soon or late he will here or hereafter you who thought to slaughter me and trust to the hyenas to hide your crime as they would have done before morning get you gone before i change my mind and be swift  without another word he turned and ran swiftly as a buck leaping from side to side as he ran to disturb my aim in case i should shoot  when he was a hundred yards away or more i too turned and ran never feeling safe till i knew there was a mile of ground between us   it was past ten oclock that night when i got back to the camp where i found hans the hottentot about to start to look for me with two of the zulus and told him that i had been detained by accidents to the wagon the vrouw prinsloo was still up also waiting to hear of my arrival  what was the accident allan she asked it looks as though there had been a bullet in it and she pointed to the bloody smear upon my cheek  i nodded  pereiras she asked again  i nodded a second time  did you kill him  no i let him go it would have been said that i murdered him and i told her what had happened  ja allan she remarked when i had finished i think you were wise for you could have proved nothing but oh for what fate i wonder is god almighty saving up that stinkcat well i will go and tell marie that you are back safe for her father wont let her out of the hut so late but nothing more unless you wish it  no tante i think nothing more at any rate at present  here i may state however that within a few days marie and everyone else in the camp knew the story in detail except perhaps marais to whom no one spoke of his nephew evidently vrouw prinsloo had found herself unable to keep secret such an example of the villainy of her aversion pereira so she told her daughter who told the others quickly enough though i gathered that some of them set down what had happened to accident bad as they knew pereira to be they could not believe that he was guilty of so black a crime  about a week later the rest of us started from maraiss camp a place that notwithstanding the sadness of many of its associations i confess i left with some regret the trek before us although not so very long was of an extremely perilous nature we had to pass through about two hundred miles of country of which all we knew was that its inhabitants were the amatonga and other savage tribes here i should explain that after much discussion we had abandoned the idea of retracing the route followed by marais on his illfated journey towards delagoa  had we taken this it would have involved our crossing the terrible lobombo mountains over which it was doubtful whether our light cattle could drag the wagons moreover the country beyond the mountains was said to be very bare of game and also of kaffirs so that food might be lacking on the other hand if we kept to the east of the mountains the veld through which we must pass was thickly populated which meant that in all probability we could buy grain  what finally decided us to adopt this route however was that here in these warm lowlying lands there would be grass for the oxen indeed now at the beginning of spring in this part of africa it was already pushing even if it were not the beasts could live upon what herbage remained over from last summer and on the leaves of trees neither of which in this winter veld ever become quite lifeless whereas on the sere and fireswept plains beyond the mountains they might find nothing at all so we determined to risk the savages and the lions which followed the game into these hot districts especially as it was not yet the fever season or that of the heavy rains so that the rivers would be fordable  i do not propose to set out our adventures in detail for these would be too long until the great one of which i shall have to tell presently they were of an annoying rather than of a serious nature travelling as we did between the mountains and the sea we could not well lose our way especially as my zulus had passed through that country and when their knowledge failed us we generally managed to secure the services of local guides the roads however or rather the game tracks and kaffir paths which we followed were terrible for with the single exception of that of pereira for part of the distance no wagon had ever gone over them before indeed a little later in the year they could not have been travelled at all sometimes we stuck in bogs out of which we had to dig the wheels and sometimes in the rocky bottoms of streams while once we were obliged literally to cut our way through a belt of dense bush from which it took us eight days to escape  our other chief trouble came from the lions whereof there were great numbers in this veld the prevalence of these hungry beasts forced us to watch our cattle very closely while they grazed and at night wherever it was possible to protect them and ourselves in bombast or fences of thorns within which we lit fires to scare away wild beasts notwithstanding these precautions we lost several of the oxen and ourselves had some narrow escapes  thus one night just as marie was about to enter the wagon where the women slept a great lion desperate with hunger sprang over the fence she leapt away from the beast and in so doing caught her foot and fell down whereon the lion came for her in another few seconds she would have been dead or carried off living  but as it chanced vrouw prinsloo was close at hand seizing a flaming bough from the fire that intrepid woman ran at the lion and as it opened its huge mouth to roar or bite thrust the burning end of the bough into its throat the lion closed its jaws upon it then finding the mouthful not to its taste departed even more quickly than it had come uttering the most dreadful noises and leaving marie quite unhurt needless to say after this i really worshipped the vrouw prinsloo though she good soul thought nothing of the business which in those days was but a common incident of travel  i think it was on the day after this lion episode that we came upon pereiras wagon or rather its remains evidently he had tried to trek along a steep rocky bank which overhung a stream with the result that the wagon had fallen into the streambed then almost dry and been smashed beyond repair  the tonga natives of the neighbourhood who had burned most of the woodwork in order to secure the precious iron bolts and fittings informed us that the white man and his servants who were with the wagon had gone forward on foot some ten days before driving their cattle with them whether this story were true or not we had no means of finding out it was quite possible that pereira and his companions had been murdered though as we found the tongas very quiet folk if well treated and given the usual complimentary presents for wayleaves this did not seem probable indeed a week later our doubts upon this point were cleared up thus  we had reached a big kraal called fokoti on the umkusi river which appeared to be almost deserted we asked an old woman whom we met where its people had gone she answered that they had fled towards the borders of swaziland fearing an attack from the zulus whose territories began beyond this umkusi river it seemed that a few days before a zulu impi or regiment had appeared upon the banks of the river and although there was no war at the time between the zulus and the tongas the latter had thought it wise to put themselves out of reach of those terrible spears  on hearing this news we debated whether it would not be well for us to follow their example and trekking westwards try to find a pass in the mountains upon this point there was a division of opinion among us marais who was a fatalist wished to go on saying that the good lord would protect us as he had done in the past  allemachte answered the vrouw prinsloo did he protect all those who lie dead at maraiss camp whither your folly led us mynheer the good lord expects us to look after our own skins and i know that these zulus are of the same blood as umsilikazis kaffirs who have killed so many of our people let us try the mountains say i  of course her husband and son agreed with her for to them the vrouws word was law but marais being as usual obstinate would not give way all that afternoon they wrangled while i held my tongue declaring that i was willing to abide by the decision of the majority in the end as i foresaw they would they appealed to me to act as umpire between them  friends i answered if you had asked me my opinion before i should have voted for trying the mountains beyond which perhaps we might find some boers i do not like this story of the zulu impi i think that someone has told them of our coming and that it is us they mean to attack and not the tongas with whom they are at peace my men say that it is not usual for impis to visit this part of the country  who could have told them asked marais  i dont know mynheer perhaps the natives have sent on word or perhapshernan pereira  i knew that you would suspect my nephew allan he exclaimed angrily  i suspect no one i only weigh what is probable however it is too late for us to move tonight either south or westwards so i think i will sleep over the business and see what i can find out from my zulus  that night or rather the following morning the question was settled for us for when i woke up at dawn it was to see the faint light glimmering on what i knew must be spears we were surrounded by a great company of zulus as i discovered afterwards over two hundred strong thinking that after their fashion they were preparing to attack us at dawn i called the news to the others whereon marais rushed forward just as he had left his bed cocking his roer as he came  for the love of god do not shoot i said how can we resist so many soft words are our only chance  still he attempted to fire and would have done so had i not thrown myself upon him and literally torn the gun from his hand by this time the vrouw prinsloo had come up a very weird spectacle i recollect in what she called her sleepgarments that included a nightcap made of a worn jackal skin and a kind of otterpelt stomacher  accursed fool she said to marais would you cause all our throats to be cut go forward you allan and talk to those swartzels that is black creatures gently as you would to a savage dog you have a tongue steeped in oil and they may listen to you  yes i answered that seems the best thing to do if i should not return give my love to marie  so i beckoned to the headman of my zulus whom i had hired at delagoa to accompany me and marched forward boldly quite unarmed we were encamped upon a rise of ground a quarter of a mile from the river and the impi or those of them whom we could see were at the foot of this rise about a hundred and sixty yards away the light was growing now and when i was within fifty paces of them they saw me at some word of command a number of men rushed toward me their fighting shields held over their bodies and their spears up  we are dead exclaimed my kaffir in a resigned voice i shared his opinion but thought i might as well die standing as running away  now i should explain that though as yet i had never mixed with these zulus i could talk several native dialects kindred to that which they used very well indeed moreover ever since i had hired men of their race at delagoa i had spent all my spare time in conversing with them and acquiring a knowledge of their language history and customs so by this time i knew their tongue fairly although occasionally i may have used terms which were unfamiliar to them  thus it came about that i was able to shout to them asking what was their business with us hearing themselves addressed in words which they understood the men halted and seeing that i was unarmed three of them approached me  we come to take you prisoners white people or to kill you if you resist said their captain  by whose order i asked  by the order of dingaan our king  is it so and who told dingaan that we were here  the boer who came in front of you  is it so i said again and now what do you need of us  that you should accompany us to the kraal of dingaan  i understand we are quite willing since it lies upon our road but then why do you come against us who are peaceful travellers with your spears lifted  for this reason the boer told us that there is among you a child of george an englishman a terrible man who would kill us unless we killed or bound him first show us this child of george that we may make him fast or slay him and we will not hurt the rest of you  i am the child of george i answered and if you think it necessary to make me fast do so  now the zulus burst out laughing  you why you are but a boy who weighs no more than a fat girl exclaimed their captain a great bony fellow who was named kambula  that may be so i answered but sometimes the wisdom of their fathers dwells in the young i am the son of george who saved these boers from death far away and i am taking them back to their own people we desire to see dingaan your king be pleased therefore to lead us to him as he has commanded you to do if you do not believe what i tell you ask this man who is with me and his companions who are of your own race they will tell you everything  then the captain kambula called my servant apart and talked with him for a long while  when the interview was finished he advanced to me and said  now i have heard all about you i have heard that although young you are very clever so clever that you do not sleep but watch by night as well as by day therefore that i kambula name you macumazahn watcherbynight and by that name you shall henceforth be known among us now macumazahn son of george bring out these boers whom you are guiding that i may lead them in their moving huts to the great place umgungundhlovu where dwells dingaan the king see we lay down our spears and will come to meet them unarmed trusting to you to protect us o macumazahn son of george and he cast his assegai to the ground  come i said and led them to the wagons    chapter xii dingaans bet   as i advanced to the wagons accompanied by kambula and his two companions i saw that marais in a state of great excitement was engaged in haranguing the two prinsloo men and meyer while the vrouw prinsloo and marie appeared to be attempting to calm him  they are unarmed i heard him shout let us seize the black devils and hold them as hostages  thereon led by marais the three boer men came towards us doubtfully their guns in their hands  be careful what you are doing i called to them these are envoys and they hung back a little while marais went on with his haranguing  the zulus looked at them and at me then kambula said  are you leading us into a trap son of george  not so i answered but the boers are afraid of you and think to take you prisoners  tell them said kambula quietly that if they kill us or lay a hand on us as no doubt they can do very soon every one of them will be dead and their women with them  i repeated this ultimatum energetically enough but marais shouted  the englishman is betraying us to the zulus do not trust him seize them as i tell you  what would have happened i am sure i do not know but just then the vrouw prinsloo came up and caught her husband by the arm exclaiming  you shall have no part in this fools business if marais wishes to seize the zulus let him do so himself are you mad or drunk that you should think that allan would wish to betray marie to the kaffirs to say nothing of the rest of us and she began to wave an extremely dirty vatdoek or dishcloth which she always carried about with her and used for every purpose towards kambula as a sign of peace  now the boers gave way and marais seeing himself in a minority glowered at me in silence  ask these white people o macumazahn said kambula who is their captain for to the captain i would speak  i translated the question and marais answered  i am  no broke in vrouw prinsloo i am tell them allan that these men are all fools and have given the rule to me a woman  so i told them evidently this information surprised them a little for they discussed together then kambula said  so be it we have heard that the people of george are now ruled by a woman and as you macumazahn are one of that people doubtless it is the same among your party  here i may add that thenceforward the zulus always accepted the vrouw prinsloo as the inkosikaas or chieftainess of our little band and with the single exception of myself whom they looked upon as her mouth or induna would only transact business with or give directions to her the other boers they ignored completely  this point of etiquette settled kambula bade me repeat what he had already told me that we were prisoners whom he was instructed by dingaan to convey to his great place and that if we made no attempt to escape we should not be hurt upon the journey  i did so whereon the vrouw asked as i had done who had informed dingaan that we were coming  i repeated to her word for word what the zulus had told me that it was pereira whose object seems to have been to bring about my death or capture  then the vrouw exploded  do you hear that henri marais she screamed it is your stinkcat of a nephew again oh i thought i smelt him your nephew has betrayed us to these zulus that he may bring allan to his death ask them allan what this dingaan has done with the stinkcat  so i asked and was informed they believed that the king had let pereira go on to his own people in payment of the information that he had given him  my god said the vrouw i hoped that he had knocked him on the head well what is to be done now  i dont know i answered then an idea occurred to me and i said to kambula  it seems to be me the son of george that your king wants take me and let these people go on their road  the three zulus began to discuss this point withdrawing themselves a little way so that i could not overhear them but when the boers understood the offer that i had made marie who until now had been silent grew more angry than ever i had seen her before  it shall not be she said stamping her foot father i have been obedient to you for long but if you consent to this i will be obedient no more allan saved my cousin hernans life as he saved all our lives in payment for that good deed hernan tried to murder him in the kloofoh be quiet allan i know all the story now he has betrayed him to the zulus telling them that he is a terrible and dangerous man who must be killed well if he is to be killed i will be killed with him and if the zulus take him and let us free i go with him now make up your mind  marais tugged at his beard staring first at his daughter and then at me what he would have answered i do not know for at that moment kambula stepped forward and gave his decision  it was to the effect that although it was the son of george whom dingaan wanted his orders were that all with him were to be taken also those orders could not be disobeyed the king would settle the matter as to whether some of us were to be killed and some let free or if all were to be killed or let free when we reached his house therefore he commanded that we should tie the oxen to the moving huts and cross the river at once  this was the end of that scene having no choice we inspanned and continued our journey escorted by the company of two hundred savages i am bound to say that during the four or five days that it took us to reach dingaans kraal they behaved very well to us with kambula and his officers all of them good fellows in their way i had many conversations and from them learned much as to the state and customs of the zulus also the peoples of the districts through which we passed flocked round us at every outspan for most of them had never seen a white man before and in return for a few beads brought us all the food that we required indeed the beads or their equivalents were nothing but a present since by the kings command they must satisfy our wants this they did very thoroughly for instance when on the last days trek some of our oxen gave out numbers of zulus were inspanned in place of them and by their help the wagons were dragged to the great kraal umgungundhlovu  here an outspan place was assigned to us near to the house or rather the huts of a certain missionary of the name of owen who with great courage had ventured into this country we were received with the utmost kindness by him and his wife and household and it is impossible for me to say what pleasure i found after all my journeyings in meeting an educated man of my own race  near to our camp was a stonecovered koppie where on the morning after our arrival i saw six or eight men executed in a way that i will not describe their crime according to mr owen was that they had bewitched some of the kings oxen  while i was recovering from this dreadful spectacle which fortunately marie did not witness the captain kambula arrived saying that dingaan wished to see me so taking with me the hottentot hans and two of the zulus whom i had hired at delagoa bayfor the royal orders were that none of the other white people were to come i was led through the fence of the vast town in which stood two thousand hutsthe multitude of houses as the zulus called itand across a vast open space in the middle  on the farther side of this space where before long i was fated to witness a very tragic scene i entered a kind of labyrinth this was called siklohlo and had high fences with numerous turns so that it was impossible to see where one was going or to find the way in or out ultimately however i reached a great hut named intunkulu a word that means the house of houses or the abode of the king in front of which i saw a fat man seated on a stool naked except for the moocha about his middle and necklaces and armlets of blue beads two warriors held their broad shields over his head to protect him from the sun otherwise he was alone although i felt sure that the numerous passages around him were filled with guards for i could hear them moving  on entering this place kambula and his companions flung themselves upon their faces and began to sing praises of which the king took no notice presently he looked up and appearing to observe me for the first time asked  who is that white boy  then kambula rose and said  o king this is the son of george whom you commanded me to capture i have taken him and the amaboona that is the boers his companions and brought them all to you o king  i remember said dingaan the big boer who was here and whom tambusahe was one of dingaans captainslet go against my will said that he was a terrible man who should be killed before he worked great harm to my people why did you not kill him kambula although it is true he does not look very terrible  because the kings word was that i should bring him to the king living answered kambula then he added cheerfully still if the king wishes it i can kill him at once  i dont know said dingaan doubtfully perhaps he can mend guns next after reflecting a while he bade a shieldholder to fetch someone i could not hear whom  doubtless thought i to myself it is the executioner and at that thought a kind of mad rage seized me why should my life be ended thus in youth to satisfy the whim of a savage and if it must be so why should i go alone  in the inside pocket of my ragged coat i had a small loaded pistol with two barrels one of those barrels would kill dingaanat five paces i could not miss that bulkand the other would blow out my brains for i was not minded to have my neck twisted or to be beaten to death with sticks well if it was to be done i had better do it at once already my hand was creeping towards the pocket when a new idea or rather two ideas struck me  the first was that if i shot dingaan the zulus would probably massacre marie and the othersmarie whose sweet face i should never see again the second was that while there is life there is hope perhaps after all he had not sent for an executioner but for someone else i would wait a few minutes more of existence were worth the having  the shieldbearer returned emerging from one of the narrow reedhedged passages and after him came no executioner but a young white man who as i knew from the look of him was english he saluted the king by taking off his hat which i remember was stuck round with black ostrich feathers then stared at me  o thomaas that is how he pronounced thomas said dingaan tell me if this boy is one of your brothers or is he a boer  the king wants to know if you are dutch or british said the white lad speaking in english  as british as you are i answered i was born in england and come from the cape  that may be lucky for you he said because the old witchdoctor zikali has told him that he must not kill any english what is your name mine is thomas halstead i am interpreter here  allan quatermain tell zikali whoever he may be that if he sticks to his advice i will give him a good present  what are you talking about asked dingaan suspiciously  he says he is english no boer o king that he was born across the black water and that he comes from the country out of which all the boers have trekked  at this intelligence dingaan pricked up his ears  then he can tell me about these boers he said and what they are after or could if he were able to speak my tongue i do not trust you to interpret you thomaas whom i know to be a liar and he glowered at halstead  i can speak your tongue though not very well o king i interrupted and i can tell you all about the boers for i have lived among them  ow said dingaan intensely interested but perhaps you are also a liar or are you a praying man like that fool yonder who is named oweenahe meant the missionary mr owenwhom i spare because it is not lucky to kill one who is mad although he tries to frighten my soldiers with tales of a fire into which they will go after they are dead as though it matters what happens to them after they are dead he added reflectively taking a pinch of snuff  i am no liar i answered what have i to lie about  you would lie to save your own life for all white men are cowards not like the zulus who love to die for their king but how are you named  your people call me macumazahn  well macumazahn if you are no liar tell me is it true that these boers rebelled against their king who was named george and fled from him as the traitor umsilikazi did from me  yes i answered that is true  now i am sure that you are a liar said dingaan triumphantly you say that you are english and therefore serve your king or the inkosikaas that is the great lady who they tell me now sits in his place how does it come about then that you are travelling with a party of these very amaboona who must be your enemies since they are the enemies of your king or of her who follows after him  now i knew that i was in a tight place for on this matter of loyalty zulu and indeed all native ideas are very primitive if i said that i had sympathy with the boers dingaan would set me down as a traitor if i said that i hated the boers then still i should be a traitor because i associated with them and a traitor in his eyes would be one to be killed i do not like to talk religion and anyone who has read what i have written in various works will admit that i have done so rarely if ever yet at that moment i put up a prayer for guidance feeling that my young life hung upon the answer and it came to mewhence i do not know the essence of that guidance was that i should tell the simple truth to this fat savage so i said to him  the answer is this o king among those boers is a maiden whom i love and who betrothed herself to me since we were so high her father took her north but she sent a message to me saying that her people died of fever and she starved so i went up in a ship to save her and have saved her and those who remained alive of her people with her  ow said dingaan i understand that reason it is a good reason however many wives he may have there is no folly that a man will not commit for the sake of some particular girl who is not yet his wife i have done as much myself especially for one who was called nada the lily of whom a certain umslopogaas robbed me one of my own blood of whom i am much afraid       see the authors book named nada the lily  for a while he brooded heavily then went on  your reason is good macumazahn and i accept it more i promise you this perhaps i shall kill these boers or perhaps i shall not kill them but if i make up my mind to kill them this girl of yours shall be spared point her out to kambula herenot to thomaas for he is a liar and would tell me the wrong oneand she shall be spared  i thank you o king i said but what is the use of that if i am to be killed  i did not say that you were to be killed macumazahn though perhaps i shall kill you or perhaps i shall not kill you it depends upon whether i find you to be a liar or not a liar now the boer whom tambusa let go against my wish said that you are a mighty magician as well as a very dangerous man one who can shoot birds flying on the wing with a bullet which is impossible can you do so  sometimes i answered  very good macumazahn now we will see if you are a wizard or a liar i will make a bet with you yonder by your camp is a hill called hloma amabutu a hill of stones where evildoers are slain this afternoon some wicked ones die there and when they are dead the vultures will come to devour them now this is my bet with you when those vultures come you shall shoot at them and if you kill three out of the first five on the wingnot on the ground macumazahnthen i will spare these boers but if you miss them then i shall know that you are a liar and no wizard and i will kill them every one on the hill hloma amabutu i will spare none of them except the girl whom perhaps i will take as a wife as to you i will not yet say what i will do with you  now my first impulse was to refuse this monstrous wager which meant that the lives of a number of people were to be set against my skill in shooting but young thomas halstead guessing the words that were about to break from me said in english  accept unless you are a fool if you dont he will cut the throats of every one of them and stick your girl into the emposeni that is harem while you will become a prisoner as i am  these were words that i could not resent or neglect so although despair was in my heart i said coolly  be it so o king i take your wager if i kill three vultures out of five as they hover over the hill then i have your promise that all those who travel with me shall be allowed to go hence in safety  yes yes macumazahn but if you fail to kill them remember that the next vultures you shoot at shall be those that come to feed upon their flesh for then i shall know that you are no magician but a common liar and now begone thomaas i will not have you spying on me and you macumazahn come hither although you talk my tongue so badly i would speak with you about the boers  so halstead went shrugging his shoulders and muttering as he passed me  i hope you really can shoot  after he had left i sat alone for a full hour with dingaan while he crossexamined me about the dutch their movements and their aims in travelling to the confines of his country  i answered his questions as best i could trying to make out a good case for them  at length when he grew weary of talking he clapped his hands whereon a number of fine girls appeared two of whom carried pots of beer from which he offered me drink  i replied that i would have none since beer made the hand shake and that on the steadiness of my hand that afternoon depended the lives of many to do him justice he quite understood the point indeed he ordered me to be conducted back to the camp at once that i might rest and even sent one of his own attendants with me to hold a shield over my head as i walked so that i should be protected from the sun  hamba gachlé that is go softly said the wicked old tyrant to me as i departed under the guidance of kambula this afternoon one hour before sundown i will meet you at hloma amabutu and there shall be settled the fate of these amaboona your companions   when i reached the camp it was to find all the boers clustered together waiting for me and with them the reverend mr owen and his people including a welsh servant of his a woman of middle age who i remember was called jane  well said the vrouw prinsloo and what is your news young man  my news aunt i answered is that one hour before sundown today i have to shoot vultures on the wing against the lives of all of you this you owe to that falsehearted hound hernan pereira who told dingaan that i am a magician now dingaan would prove it he thinks that only by magic can a man shoot soaring vultures with a bullet and as he is determined to kill you all except perhaps marie in the form of a bet he has set me a task which he believes to be impossible if i fail the bet is lost and so are your lives if i succeed i think your lives will be spared since kambula there tells me that the king always makes it a point of honour to pay his bets now you have the truth and i hope you like it and i laughed bitterly  when i had finished a perfect storm of execration broke from the boers if curses could have killed pereira surely he would have died upon the spot wherever he might be only two of them were silent marie who turned very pale poor girl and her father presently one of them i think it was meyer rounded on him viciously and asked him what he thought now of that devil his nephew  i think there must be some mistake answered marais quietly since hernan cannot have wished that we should all be put to death  no shouted meyer but he wished that allan quatermain should which is just as bad and now it has come about that once more our lives depend upon this english boy  at any rate replied marais looking at me oddly it seems that he is not to be killed whether he shoots the vultures or misses them  that remains to be proved mynheer i answered hotly for the insinuation stung me but please understand that if all of you my companions are to be slaughtered and marie is to be put among this black brutes women as he threatens i have no wish to live on  my god does he threaten that said marais surely you must have misunderstood him allan  do you think that i should lie to you on such a matter i began  but before i could proceed the vrouw prinsloo thrust herself between us crying  be silent you marais and you too allan is this a time that you should quarrel and upset yourself allan so that when the trial comes you will shoot your worst and not your best and is this a time henri marais that you should throw insults at one on whom all our lives hang instead of praying for gods vengeance upon your accursed nephew come allan and take food i have fried the liver of that heifer which the king sent us it is ready and very good after you have eaten it you must lie down and sleep a while  now among the household of the reverend mr owen was an english boy called william wood who was not more than twelve or fourteen years of age this lad knew both dutch and zulu and acted as interpreter to the owen family during the absence on a journey of a certain mr hulley who really filled that office while this conversation was taking place in dutch he was engaged in rendering every word of it into english for the benefit of the clergyman and his family when mr owen understood the full terror of the situation he broke in saying  this is not a time to eat or to sleep but a time to pray that the heart of the savage dingaan may be turned come let us pray  yes rejoined vrouw prinsloo when william wood had translated do you pray prédicant and all the rest of you who have nothing else to do and while you are about it pray also that the bullets of allan quatermain may not be turned as for me and allan we have other things to see to so you must pray a little harder to cover us as well as yourselves now you come along nephew allan or that liver may be overdone and give you indigestion which is worse for shooting than even bad temper no not another word if you try to speak any more henri marais i will box your ears and she lifted a hand like a leg of mutton then as marais retreated before her seized me by the collar as though i were a naughty boy and led me away to the wagons    chapter xiii the rehearsal   by the womens wagon we found the liver cooked in its fryingpan as the vrouw had said indeed it was just done to a turn selecting a particularly massive slice she proceeded to take it from the pan with her fingers in order to set it upon a piece of tin from which she had first removed the more evident traces of the morning meal with her constant companion the ancient and unwashen vatdoek as it chanced the effort was not very successful since the boiling liver fat burnt the vrouws fingers causing her to drop it on the grass and i am sorry to add to swear as well not to be defeated however having first sucked her fingers to ease their smart she seized the sizzling liver with the vatdoek and deposited it upon the dirty tin  there nephew she said triumphantly there are more ways of killing a cat than by drowning what a fool i was not to think of the vatdoek at first allemachte how the flesh has burnt me i dont suppose that being killed would hurt much more also if the worst comes to the worst it will soon be over think of it allan by tonight i may be an angel dressed in a long white nightgown like those my mother gave me when i was married which i cut up for babyclothes because i found them chilly wear having always been accustomed to sleep in my vest and petticoat yes and i shall have wings too like those on a white gander only bigger if they are to carry my weight  and a crown of glory i suggested  yes of course a crown of gloryvery large since i shall be a martyr but i hope one will only have to wear it on sundays as i never could bear anything heavy on my hair moreover it would remind me of a kaffirs headring done in gold and i shall have had enough of kaffirs then there will be the harp she went on as her imagination took fire at the prospect of these celestial delights have you ever seen a harp allan i havent except that which king david carries in the picture in the book which looks like a broken rimpi chair frame set up edgeways as for playing the thing they will have to teach me thats all which will be a difficult business seeing that i would sooner listen to cats on the roof than to music and as for making it  so she chattered on as i believe with the object of diverting and amusing me for she was a shrewd old soul who knew how important it was that i should be kept in an equable frame of mind at this crisis in our fates  meanwhile i was doing my best with the lump of liver that tasted painfully of vatdoek and was gritty with sand indeed when the vrouws back was turned i managed to throw the most of it to hans behind me who swallowed it at a gulp as a dog does since he did not wish to be caught chewing it  god in heaven how fast you eat nephew said the vrouw catching sight of my empty tin then eyeing the voracious hottentot suspiciously she added that yellow dog of yours hasnt stolen it has he if so ill teach him  no no vrouw answered hans in alarm no meat has passed my lips this day except what i licked out of the pan after breakfast  then allan you will certainly have indigestion which is just what i wanted to avoid have i not often told you that you should chew your bit twenty times before you swallow which i would do myself if i had any back teeth left here drink this milk it is only a little sour and will settle your stomach and she produced a black bottle and subjected it to the attentions of the vatdoek growing quite angry when i declined it and sent for water  next she insisted upon my getting into her own bed in the wagon to sleep forbidding me to smoke which she said made the hand shake thither then i went after a brief conversation with hans whom i directed to clean my rifle thoroughly for i wished to be alone and knew that i had little chance of solitude outside of that somewhat fusty couch  to tell the truth although i shut my eyes to deceive the vrouw who looked in occasionally to see how i was getting on no sleep came to me that afternoonat least not for a long while how could i sleep in that hot place when my heart was torn with doubt and terror think of it reader think of it an hour or two and on my skill would hang the lives of eight white peoplemen women and children and the safety or the utter shame of the woman whom i loved and who loved me no she should be spared the worst i would give her my pistol and if there were need she would know what to do  the fearful responsibility was more than i could bear i fell into a veritable agony i trembled and even wept a little then i thought of my father and what he would do in such circumstances and began to pray as i had never prayed before  i implored the power above me to give me strength and wisdom not to let me fail in this hour of trouble and thereby bring these poor people to a bloody death i prayed till the perspiration streamed down my face then suddenly i fell into sleep or swoon i dont know how long i lay thus but i think it must have been the best part of an hour at last i woke up all in an instant and as i woke i distinctly heard a tiny voice unlike any other voice in the whole world speak inside my head or so it seemed to me saying  go to the hill hloma amabutu and watch how the vultures fly do what comes into your mind and even if you seem to fail fear nothing  i sat up on the old vrouws bed and felt that some mysterious change had come over me i was no longer the same man my doubts and terrors had gone my hand was like a rock my heart was light i knew that i should kill those three vultures of course the story seems absurd and easy to be explained by the state of my nerves under the strain which was being put upon them and for aught i know that may be its true meaning yet i am not ashamed to confess that i have always held and still hold otherwise i believe that in my extremity some kindly power did speak to me in answer to my earnest prayers and to those of others giving me guidance and what i needed still more judgment and calmness at any rate that this was my conviction at the moment may be seen from the fact that i hastened to obey the teachings of that tiny unnatural voice  climbing out of the wagon i went to hans who was seated near by in the full glare of the hot sun at which he seemed to stare with unblinking eyes  wheres the rifle hans i said  intombi is here baas where i have put her to keep her cool so that she may not go off before it is wanted and he pointed to a little gravelike heap of gathered grass at his side  the natives i should explain named this particular gun intombi which means a young girl because it was so much slimmer and more graceful than other guns  is it clean i asked  never was she cleaner since she was born out of the fire baas also the powder has been sifted and set to dry in the sun with the caps and the bullets have been trued to the barrel so that there may be no accidents when it comes to the shooting if you miss the aasvogels baas it will not be the fault of intombi or of the powder and the bullets it will be your own fault  thats comforting i answered well come on i want to go to the deathhill yonder  why baas before the time asked the hottentot shrinking back a little it is no place to visit till one is obliged these zulus say that ghosts sit there even in the daylight haunting the rocks where they were made ghosts  vultures sit or fly there also hans and i would see how they fly that i may know when and where to shoot at them  that is right baas said the clever hottentot this is not like firing at geese in the groote kloof the geese go straight like an assegai to its mark but the aasvogels wheel round and round always on the turn it is easy to miss a bird that is turning baas  very easy come on  just as we were starting vrouw prinsloo appeared from behind the other wagon and with her marie who i noticed was very pale and whose beautiful eyes were red as though with weeping  the vrouw asked me where we were going i told her after considering a little she said that was a good thought of mine as it was always well to study the ground before a battle  i nodded and led marie aside behind some thorn trees that grew near  oh allan what will be the end of this she asked piteously high as was her courage it seemed to fail her now  a good end dearest i answered we shall come out of this hole safely as we have of many others  how do you know that allan which is known to god alone  because god told me marie and i repeated to her the story of the voice i had heard in my dream which seemed to comfort her  yet yet she exclaimed doubtfully it was but a dream allan and dreams are such uncertain things you may fail after all  do i look like one who will fail marie  she studied me from head to foot then answered  no you do not although you did when you came back from the kings huts now you are quite changed still allan you may fail and thenwhat some of those dreadful zulus have been here while you were sleeping bidding us all make ready to go to the hill of death they say that dingaan is in earnest if you do not kill the vultures he will kill us it seems that they are sacred birds and if they escape he will think he has nothing to fear from the white men and their magic and so will make a beginning by butchering us i mean the rest of us for i am to be kept alive and oh what shall i do allan  i looked at her and she looked at me then i took the doublebarrelled pistol out of my pocket and gave it to her  it is loaded and on the halfcock i said  she nodded and hid it in her dress beneath her apron then without more words we kissed and parted for both of us feared to prolong that scene   the hill hloma amabutu was quite close to our encampment and the huts of the reverend mr owen scarcely a quarter of a mile off i should say rising from the flat veld on the further side of a little depression that hardly amounted to a valley as we approached it i noticed its peculiar and blasted appearance for whereas all around the grass was vivid with the green of spring on this place none seemed to grow an eminence strewn with tumbled heaps of blackish rock and among them a few struggling darkleaved bushes that was its appearance moreover many of these boulders looked as though they had been splashed and lined with whitewash showing that they were the restingplace of hundreds of gorged vultures  i believe it is the chinese who declare that particular localities have good or evil influences attached to them some kind of spirit of their own and really hloma amabutu and a few other spots that i am acquainted with in africa give colour to the fancy certainly as i set foot upon that accursed ground that golgotha that place of skulls a shiver went through me it may have been caused by the atmosphere moral and actual of the mount or it may have been a prescience of a certain dreadful scene which within a few months i was doomed to witness there or perhaps the place itself and the knowledge of the trial before me sent a sudden chill through my healthy blood i cannot say which it was but the fact remains as i have stated although a minute or two later when i saw what kind of sleepers lay upon that mount it would not have been necessary for me to seek any farfetched explanation of my fear  across this hill winding in and out between the rough rocks that lay here there and everywhere like hailstones after a winter storm ran sundry paths it seems that the shortest road to various places in the neighbourhood of the great kraal ran over it and although no zulu ever dared to set foot there between sunset and rise in the daytime they used these paths freely enough but i suppose that they also held that this evilomened field of death had some spirit of its own some invisible but imminent fiend who needed to be propitiated lest soon he should claim them also  this was their method of propitiation a common one enough i believe in many lands though what may be its meaning i cannot tell as the traveller came to those spots where the paths cut across each other he took a stone and threw it on to a heap that had been accumulated there by the hands of other travellers there were many such heaps upon the hill over a dozen i think and the size of them was great i should say that the biggest contained quite fifty loads of stones and the smallest not fewer than twenty or thirty  now hans although he had never set foot there before seemed to have learned all the traditions of the place and what rites were necessary to avert its curse at any rate when we came to the first heap he cast a stone upon it and begged me to do the same i laughed and refused but when we reached the second heap the same thing happened again i refused whereon before we came to a third and larger pile hans sat down upon the ground and began to groan swearing that he would not go one step farther unless i promised to make the accustomed offering  why not you fool i asked  because if you neglect it baas i think that we shall stop here for ever oh you may laugh but i tell you that already you have brought illluck upon yourself remember my words baas when you miss two of the five aasvogels  bosh i exclaimed or rather its dutch equivalent still as this talk of missing vultures touched me nearly and it is always as well to conform to native prejudices at the next and two subsequent heaps i cast my stone as humbly as the most superstitious zulu in the land  by this time we had reached the summit which may have been two hundred yards long it was hogbacked in shape with a kind of depression in the middle cleared of stones either by the hand of man or nature and not unlike a large circus in its general conformation  oh the sight that met my eyes all about lay the picked and scattered bones of men and women many of them broken up by the jaws of hyenas some were quite fresh for the hair still clung to the skulls others blanched and old but new or ancient there must have been hundreds of them moreover on the sides of the hill it was the same story though there for the most part the bones had been gathered into gleaming heaps no wonder that the vultures loved hloma amabutu the place of slaughter of the bloody zulu king  of these horrible birds however at the moment not one was to be seen as there had been no execution for a few hours they were seeking their food elsewhere now for my own purposes i wanted to see them since otherwise my visit was in vain and presently bethought myself of a method of securing their arrival  hans i said i am going to pretend to kill you and then you must lie quite still out there like one dead even if the aasvogels settle on you you must lie quite still so that i may see whence they come and how they settle  the hottentot did not take at all kindly to this suggestion indeed he flatly refused to obey me giving sundry good reasons he said that this kind of rehearsal was illomened that coming events have a way of casting their shadow before and he did not wish to furnish the event he said that the zulus declared that the sacred aasvogels of hloma amabutu were as savage as lions and that when once they saw a man down they would tear him to pieces dead or living in short hans and i came to an acute difference of opinion as for every reason it was necessary that my view should prevail however i did not hesitate to put matters to him very plainly  hans i said you have to be a bait for vultures choose if you will be a live bait or a dead bait and i cocked the rifle significantly although in truth the last thing that i wished or intended to do was to shoot my faithful old hottentot friend but hans knowing all i had at stake came to a different conclusion  allemachte baas he said i understand and i do not blame you well if i obey alive perhaps my guardian snake or spirit will protect me from the evil omen and perhaps the aasvogels will not pick out my eyes but if once you send a bullet through my stomachwhy then everything is finished and for hans it is good night sleep well i will obey you baas and lie where you wish only i pray you do not forget me and go away leaving me with those devil birds  i promised him faithfully that i would not then we went through a very grim little pantomime proceeding to the centre of the arenalike space i lifted the gun and appeared to dash out hans brains with its butt he fell upon his back kicked about a little and lay still this finished act 1  act 2 was that capering like a brute of a zulu executioner i retired from my victim and hid myself in a bush on the edge of the plateau at a distance of forty yards after this there was a pause the place was intensely bright with sunshine and intensely silent as silent as the skeletons of the murdered men about me as silent as hans who lay there looking so very small and dead in that big theatre where no grass grew it was an eerie wait in such surroundings but at length the curtain rang up for act 3  in the infinite arch of blue above me i perceived a speck no larger than a mote of dust the aasvogel on watch up there far out of the range of mans vision had seen the deed and by sinking downwards signalled it to his companions that were quartering the sky for fifty miles round for these birds prey by sight not by smell down he came and down and long before he had reached the neighbourhood of earth other specks appeared in the distant blue now he was not more than four or five hundred yards above me and began to wheel floating round the place upon his wide wings and sinking as he wheeled so he sank softly and slowly until he was about a hundred and fifty feet above hans then suddenly he paused hung quite steady for a few seconds shut his wings and fell like a bolt only opening them again just before he reached the earth  here he settled tilting forward in that odd way which vultures have and scrambling a few awkward paces until he gained his balance then he froze into immobility gazing with in awful stony glare at the prostrate hans who lay within about fifteen feet of him scarcely was this aasvogel down when others summoned from the depths of sky did as he had done they appeared they sank they wheeled always from east to west the way the sun travels they hovered for a few seconds then fell like stones pitched on to their beaks recovered themselves waddled forward into line and sat gazing at hans soon there was a great ring of them about him all immovable all gazing all waiting for something  presently that something appeared in the shape of an aasvogel which was nearly twice as big as any of the others this was what the boers and the natives call the king vulture one of which goes with every flock he it is who rules the roost and also the carcase which without his presence and permission none dare to attack whether this vile fowl is of a different species from the others or whether he is a bird of more vigorous growth and constitution that has outgrown the rest and thus become their overlord is more than i can tell at least it is certain as i can testify from long and constant observation that almost every flock of vultures has its king  when this particular royalty had arrived the other aasvogels of which perhaps there were now fifty or sixty gathered round hans began to show signs of interested animation they looked at the king bird they looked at hans stretching out their naked red necks and winking their brilliant eyes i however did not pay particular attention to those upon the earth being amply occupied in watching their fellows in the air  with delight i observed that the vulture is a very conservative creature they all did what doubtless they have done since the days of adam or earlierwheeled and then hung that little space of time before they dropped to the ground like lead this then would be the moment at which to shoot them when for four or five seconds they offered practically a sitting target now at that distance always under a hundred yards i knew well that i could hit a tea plate every shot and a vulture is much larger than a tea plate so it seemed to me that barring accidents i had little to fear from the terrible trial of skill which lay before me again and again i covered the hovering birds with my rifle feeling that if i had pressed the trigger i should have pierced them through  thinking it well to practise i continued this game for a long while till at last it came to an unexpected end suddenly i heard a scuffling sound dropping my glance i saw that the whole mob of aasvogels were rushing in upon hans helping themselves forward by flapping their great wings and that about three feet in front of them was their king next instant hans vanished and from the centre of that fluffy stinking mass there arose a frightful yell  as a matter of fact as i found afterwards the king vulture had fastened on to his snub nose whilst its dreadful companions having seized other portions of his frame were beginning to hang back after their fashion in order to secure some chosen morsel hans kicked and screamed and i rushed in shouting causing them to rise in a great flapping cloud that presently vanished this way and that within a minute they had all gone and the hottentot and i were left alone  that is good i said you played well  good baas he answered and i with two cuts in my nose in which i can lay my finger and bites all over me look how my trousers are torn look at my headwhere is the hair look at my nose good played well it is those verdomde aasvogels that played oh baas if you had seen and smelt them you would not say that it was good see one more second and i who have two nostrils should have had four  never mind hans i said it is only a scratch and i will make you a present of some new trousers also here is tobacco for you come to the bush let us talk  so we went and when hans was a little composed i told him all that i had observed about the habits of the aasvogel in the air and he told me all that he had observed about their habits on the ground which as i might not shoot them sitting did not interest me still he agreed with me that the right moment to fire would be just before they pounced  whilst we were still talking we heard a sound of shouts and looking over the brow of the hill that faced towards umgungundhlovu we saw a melancholy sight being driven up the slope towards us by three executioners and a guard of seven or eight soldiers their hands tied behind their backs were three men one very old one of about fifty years of age and one a lad who did not look more than eighteen as i soon heard they were of a single family the grandfather the father and the eldest son who had been seized upon some ridiculous charge of witchcraft but really in order that the king might take their cattle  having been tried and condemned by the nyangas or witchdoctors these poor wretches were now doomed to die indeed not content with thus destroying the heads of the tribe present and to come for three generations all their descendants and collaterals had already been wiped out by dingaan so that he might pose as sole heir to the family cattle  such were the dreadful cruelties that happened in zululand in those days    chapter xiv the play   the doomed three were driven by their murderers into the centre of the depression within a few yards of which hans and i were standing  after them came the head executioner a great brute who wore a curiously shaped leopardskin capi suppose as a badge of officeand held in his hand a heavy kerry the shaft of which was scored with many notches each of them representing a human life  see white man he shouted here is the bait which the king sends to draw the holy birds to you had it not been that you needed such bait perhaps these wizards would have escaped but the black one said the little son of george who is named macumazahn needs them that he may show his magic and therefore they must die today  now at this information i turned positively sick nor did it make me feel better when the youngest of the victims hearing the executioners words flung himself upon his knees and began to implore me to spare him his grandfather also addressed me saying  chief will it not be enough if i die i am old and my life does not matter or if one is not sufficient take me and my son and let the lad my grandson go free we are all of us innocent of any witchcraft and he is not even old enough to practise such things being but an unmarried boy chief you also are young would not your heart be heavy if you had to be slain when the sun of your life was still new in the sky think white chief what your father would feel if you have one should he be forced to see you killed before his eyes that some stranger might use your body to show his skill with a magic weapon by slaying the wild things that would eat it  now almost with tears i broke in explaining to the venerable man as well as i could that their horrible fate had nothing to do with me i told him that i was innocent of their blood who was forced to be there to try to shoot vultures on the wing in order to save my white companions from a doom similar to their own he listened attentively asking a question now and again and when he had mastered my meaning said with a most dignified calmness  now i understand white man and am glad to learn that you are not cruel as i thought my children he added turning to the others let us trouble this inkoos no more he only does what he must do to save the lives of his brethren by his skill if he can if we continue to plead with him and stir his heart to pity the sorrow swelling in it may cause his hand to shake and then they will die also and their blood be on his head and ours my children it is the kings will that we should be slain let us make ready to obey the king as men of our house have always done white lord we thank you for your good words may you live long and may good fortune sleep in your hut to the end may you shoot straight also with your magic tool and thereby win the lives of your company out of the hand of the king farewell inkoos and since he could not lift his bound hands in salutation he bowed to me as did the others  then they walked to a little distance and seating themselves on the ground began to talk together and after a while to drone some strange chant in unison the executioners and the guards also sat down not far away laughing chatting and passing a horn of snuff from hand to hand indeed i observed that the captain of them even took some snuff to the victims and held it in his palm beneath their noses while they drew it up their nostrils and politely thanked him between the sneezes  as for myself i lit a pipe and smoked it for i seemed to require a stimulant or rather a sedative before it was finished hans who was engaged in doctoring his scratches made by the vultures beaks with a concoction of leaves which he had been chewing exclaimed suddenly in his matteroffact voice  see baas here they come the white people on one side and the black on the other just like the goats and the sheep at judgment day in the book  i looked and there to my right appeared the party of boers headed by the vrouw prinsloo who held the remnants of an old umbrella over her head to the left advanced a number of zulu nobles and councillors in front of whom waddled dingaan arrayed in his bead dancing dress he was supported by two stalwart bodyservants whilst a third held a shield over his head to protect him from the sun and a fourth carried a large stool upon which he was to sit behind each party also i perceived a number of zulus in their wardress all of them armed with broad stabbing spears  the two parties arrived at the stone upon which i was sitting almost simultaneously as probably it had been arranged that they should do and halted staring at each other as for me i sat still upon my stone and smoked on  allemachte allan puffed the vrouw prinsloo who was breathless with her walk up the hill so here you are as you did not come back i thought you had run away and left us like that stinkcat pereira  yes tante aunt here i am i answered gloomily and i wish to heaven that i was somewhere else  just then dingaan having settled his great bulk upon the stool and recovered his breath called to the lad halstead who was with him and said  o thomaas ask your brother macumazahn if he is ready to try to shoot the vultures if not as i wish to be fair i will give him a little more time to make his magic medicine  i replied sulkily that i was as ready as i was ever likely to be  then the vrouw prinsloo understanding that the king of the zulus was before her advanced upon him waving her umbrella catching hold of halstead who understood dutch she forced him to translate an harangue which she addressed to dingaan  had he rendered it exactly as it came from her lips we should all have been dead in five minutes but luckily that unfortunate young man had learnt some of the guile of the serpent during his sojourn among the zulus and varied her vigorous phrases the gist of her discourse was that he dingaan was a blackhearted and bloodyminded villain with whom the almighty would come even sooner or later as indeed he did and that if he dared to touch one hair of her or of her companions heads the boers her countrymen would prove themselves to be the ministers of the almighty in that matter as indeed they did as translated by halstead into zulu what she said was that dingaan was the greatest king in the whole world in fact that there was not and never had been any such a king either in power wisdom or personal beauty and that if she and her companions had to die the sight of his glory consoled them for their deaths  indeed said dingaan suspiciously if that is what this manwoman says her eyes tell one story and her lips another oh thomaas lie no more speak the true words of the white chieftainess lest i should find them out otherwise and give you to the slayers  thus adjured halstead explained that he had not yet told all the words the manwoman who was as he dingaan supposed a great chieftainess among the dutch added that if he the mighty and glorious king the earthshaker the worldeater killed her or any of her subjects her people would avenge her by killing him and his people  does she say that said dingaan then as i thought these boers are dangerous and not the peaceful folk they make themselves out to be and he brooded for a while staring at the ground presently he lifted his head and went on well a bet is a bet and therefore i will not wipe out this handful as otherwise i would have done at once tell the old cow of a chieftainess that notwithstanding her threats i stick to my promise if the little son of george macumazahn can shoot three vultures out of five by help of his magic then she and her servants shall go free if not the vultures which he has missed shall feed on them and afterwards i will talk with her people when they come to avenge her now enough of this indaba bring those evildoers here that they may thank and praise me who give them so merciful an end  so the grandfather the father and the son were hustled before dingaan by the soldiers and greeted him with the royal salute of bayéte  o king said the old man i and my children are innocent yet if it pleases you o king i am ready to die and so is my son yet we pray you to spare the little one he is but a boy who may grow up to do you good service as i have done to you and your house for many years  be silent you whiteheaded dog answered dingaan fiercely this lad is a wizard like the rest of you and would grow up to bewitch me and to plot with my enemies know that i have stamped out all your family and shall i then leave him to breed another that would hate me begone to the world of spirits and tell them how dingaan deals with sorcerers  the old man tried to speak again for evidently he loved this grandchild of his but a soldier struck him in the face and dingaan shouted  what are you not satisfied i tell you that if you say more i will force you to kill the boy with your own hand take them away  then i turned and hid my face as did all the white folk presently i heard the old man whom they had saved to the last that he might witness the deaths of his descendants cry in a loud voice  on the night of the thirtieth full moon from this day i the farsighted i the prophet summon thee dingaan to meet me and mine in the land of ghosts and there to pay  then with a roar of horror the executioners fell on him and he died when there was silence i looked up and saw that the king who had turned a dirty yellow hue with fright for he was very superstitious was trembling and wiping the sweat from his brow  you should have kept the wizard alive he said in a shaky voice to the head slayer who was engaged in cutting three more nicks on the handle of his dreadful kerry fool i would have heard the rest of his lying message  the man answered humbly that he thought it best it should remain unspoken and got himself out of sight as soon as possible here i may remark that by an odd coincidence dingaan actually was killed about thirty moons from that time mopo his general who slew his brother chaka slew him also with the help of umslopogaas the son of chaka in after years umslopogaas told me the story of the dreadful ghosthaunted death of this tyrant but of course he could not tell me exactly upon what day it happened therefore i do not know whether the prophecy was strictly accurate       for the history of the death of dingaan see the      authors nada the lily  the three victims lay dead in the hollow of the hill of death presently the king recovering himself gave orders that the spectators should be moved back to places where they could see what happened without frightening the vultures so the boers attended by their band of soldiers who were commanded to slay them at once if they attempted to escape went one way and dingaan and his zulus went the other leaving hans and myself alone behind our bush as the white people passed me vrouw prinsloo wished me good luck in a cheerful voice although i could see that her poor old hand was shaking and she was wiping her eyes with the vatdoek henri marais also in broken tones implored me to shoot straight for his daughters sake then came marie pale but resolute who said nothing but only looked me in the eyes and touched the pocket of her dress in which i knew the pistol lay hid of the rest of them i took no notice  the moment that dreadful moment of trial had come at last and oh the suspense and the waiting were hard to bear it seemed an age before the first speck that i knew to be a vulture appeared thousands of feet above me and began to descend in wide circles  oh baas said poor hans this is worse than shooting at the geese in the groote kloof then you could only lose your horse but now  be silent i hissed and give me the rifle  the vulture wheeled and sank sank and wheeled i glanced towards the boers and saw that they were all of them on their knees i glanced towards the zulus and saw that they were watching as i think they had never watched anything before for to them this was a new excitement then i fixed my eyes upon the bird  its last circle was accomplished before it pounced it hung on wide outstretched wings as the others had done its head towards me i drew a deep breath lifted the rifle got the foresight dead upon its breast and touched the hairtrigger as the charge exploded i saw the aasvogel give a kind of backward twist next instant i heard a loud clap and a surge of joy went through me for i thought that the bullet had found its billet but alas it was not so  the clap was that of the air disturbed by the passing of the ball and the striking of this air against the stiff feathers of the wings anyone who has shot at great birds on the wing with a bullet will be acquainted with the sound instead of falling the vulture recovered itself not knowing the meaning of this unaccustomed noise it dropped quietly to earth and sat down near the bodies pitching forward in the natural way and running a few paces as the others had done that afternoon evidently it was quite unhurt  missed gasped hans as he grasped the rifle to load it oh why did you not throw a stone on to the first heap  i gave hans a look that must have frightened him at any rate he spoke no more from the boers went up a low groan then they began to pray harder than ever while the zulus clustered round the king and whispered to him i learned afterwards that he was giving heavy odds against me ten to one in cattle which they were obliged to take unwillingly enough  hans finished loading capped and cocked the rifle and handed it to me by now other vultures were appearing being desperately anxious to get the thing over one way or another at the proper moment i took the first of them again i covered it dead and pressed again as the gun exploded i saw that backward lurch of the bird and heard the clap of the air upon its wings thenoh horrorthis aasvogel turned quietly and began to mount the ladder of the sky in the same fashion as it had descended i had missed once more  the second heap of stones has done this baas said hans faintly and this time i did not even look him i only sat down and buried my face in my hands one more such miss and then  hans began to whisper to me  baas he said those aasvogels see the flash of the gun and shy at it like a horse baas you are shooting into their faces for they all hang with their beaks toward you before they drop you must get behind them and fire into their tails for even an aasvogel cannot see with its tail  i let fall my hands and stared at him surely the poor fellow had been inspired from on high i understood it all now while their beaks were towards me i might fire at fifty vultures and never hit one for each time they would swerve from the flash causing the bullet to miss them though but by a little  come i gasped and began to walk quickly round the edge of the depression to a rock which i saw opposite about a hundred yards away my journey took me near the zulus who mocked me as i passed asking where my magic was and if i wished to see the white people killed presently dingaan was now offering odds of fifty cattle to one against me but no one would take the bet even with the king  i made no answer no not even when they asked me if i had thrown down my spear and was running away grimly despairingly i marched on to the rock and took shelter behind it with hans the boers i saw were still upon their knees but seemed to have ceased praying the children were weeping the men stared at each other vrouw prinsloo had her arm about maries waist waiting there behind the rock my courage returned to me as it sometimes does in the last extremity i remembered my dream and took comfort surely god would not be so cruel as to suffer me to fail and thereby bring all those poor people to their deaths  snatching the rifle from hans i loaded it myself nothing must be trusted to another as i put on the cap a vulture made its last circle it hung in the air just as the others had done and oh its tail was towards me i lifted i aimed between the gatheredup legs i pressed and shut my eyes for i did not dare to look  i heard the bullet strike or seem to strike and a few seconds later i heard something elsethe noise of a heavy thud upon the ground i looked and there with outstretched wings lay the foul bird dead stone dead eight or ten paces from the bodies  allemachte thats better said hans you threw stones on to all the other heaps didnt you baas  the zulus grew excited and the odds went down a little the boers stretched out their white faces and stared at me i saw them out of the corner of my eye as i loaded again another vulture came seeing one of its companions on the ground if in a somewhat unnatural attitude perhaps it thought that there could be nothing to fear i leaned against my rock aimed and fired almost carelessly so sure was i of the result this time i did not shut my eyes but watched to see what happened  the bullet struck the bird between its thighs raked it from end to end and down it came like a stone almost upon the top of its fellow  good good said hans with a guttural chuckle of delight now baas make no mistake with the third and als sall recht kommen all shall be well  yes i answered if i make no mistake with the third  i loaded the rifle again myself being very careful to ram down the powder well and to select a bullet that fitted perfectly true to the bore moreover i cleared the nipple with a thorn and shook a little fine powder into it so as to obviate any chance of a missfire then i set on the cap and waited what was going on among the boers or the zulus i do not know in this last crisis of all our fates i never looked being too intent upon my own part in the drama  by now the vultures appeared to have realised that something unusual was in progress which threatened danger to them at any rate although by this time they had collected in hundreds from east west north and south and were wheeling the heavens above in their vast majestic circles none of them seemed to care to descend to prey upon the bodies i watched and saw that among their number was that great king bird which had bitten hans in the face it was easy to distinguish him because he was so much larger than the others also he had some white at the tips of his wings i observed that certain of his company drew near to him in the skies where they hung together in a knot as though in consultation  they separated out again and the king began to descend deputed probably to spy out the land down he came in evernarrowing turns till he reached the appointed spot for the plunge and according to the immemorial custom of these birds hung a while before he pounced with his head to the south and his great spreading tail towards me  this was my chance and rejoicing in having so large a mark i got the sight upon him and pulled the bullet thudded some feathers floated from his belly showing that it had gone home and i looked to see him fall as the others had done but alas he did not fall for a few seconds he rocked to and fro upon his great wings then commenced to travel upwards in vast circles which grew gradually more narrow till he appeared to be flying almost straight into the empyrean i stared and stared everybody stared till that enormous bird became first a mere blot upon the blue and at length but a speck then it vanished altogether into regions far beyond the sight of man  now there is an end i said to hans  ja baas answered the hottentot between his chattering teeth there is an end you did not put in enough powder presently we shall all be dead  not quite i said with a bitter laugh hans load the rifle load it quick before they die there shall be another king in zululand  good good he exclaimed as he loaded desperately let us take that fat pig of a dingaan with us shoot him in the stomach baas shoot him in the stomach so that he too may learn what it is to die slowly then cut my throat here is my big knife and afterwards cut your own if you have not time to load the gun again and shoot yourself which is easier  i nodded for it was in my mind to do these things never could i stand still and see those poor boers killed and i knew that marie would look after herself  meanwhile the zulus were coming towards me and the soldiers who had charge of them were driving up maraiss people making pretence to thrust them through with their assegais and shouting at them as men do at cattle both parties arrived in the depression at about the same time but remained separated by a little space in this space lay the corpses of the murdered men and the two dead aasvogels with hans and myself standing opposite to them  well little son of george puffed dingaan you have lost your bet for you did but kill two vultures out of five with your magic which was good as far as it went but not good enough now you must pay as i would have paid had you won  then he stretched out his hand and issued the dreadful order of bulala amalongu kill the white people kill them one by one that i may see whether they know how to die all except macumazahn and the tall girl whom i keep  some of the soldiers made a dash and seized the vrouw prinsloo who was standing in front of the party  wait a little king she called out as the assegais were lifted over her how do you know that the bet is lost he whom you call macumazahn hit that last vulture it should be searched for before you kill us  what does the old woman say asked dingaan and halstead translated slowly  true said dingaan well now i will send her to search for the vulture in the sky come back thence fat one and tell us if you find it  the soldiers lifted their assegais waiting the kings word i pretended to look at the ground and cocked my rifle being determined that if he spoke it it should be his last hans stared upwardsi suppose to avoid the sight of deaththen suddenly uttered a wild yell which caused everyone even the doomed people to turn their eyes to him he was pointing to the heavens and they looked to see at what he pointed  this was what they saw far far above in that infinite sea of blue there appeared a tiny speck which his sharp sight had already discerned a speck that grew larger and larger as it descended with terrific and evergrowing speed  it was the king vulture falling from the heavensdead  down it came between the vrouw prinsloo and the slayers smashing the lifted assegai of one of them and hurling him to the earth down it came and lay there a mere mass of pulp and feathers  o dingaan i said in the midst of the intense silence that followed it seems that it is i who have won the bet not you i killed this king of birds but being a king it chose to die high up and alone that is all  dingaan hesitated for he did not wish to spare the boers and i noting his hesitation lifted my rifle a little perhaps he saw it or perhaps his sense of honour as he understood the word overcame his wish for their blood at any rate he said to one of his councillors  search the carcase of that vulture and see if there is a bullet hole in it  the man obeyed feeling at the mass of broken bones and flesh by good fortune he found not the hole for that was lost in the general destruction of the tissues but the ball itself which having pierced the thick body from below upwards had remained fast in the tough skin just by the backbone where the long red neck emerges from between the wings he picked it out for it was only hanging in the skin and held it up for all to see  macumazahn has won his bet said dingaan his magic has conquered though by but a very little macumazahn take these boers they are yours and begone with them out of my country    chapter xv retief asks a favour   now and again during our troubled journey through life we reach little oases of almost perfect happiness set jewellike here and there in the thorny wilderness of time sometimes these are hours of mere animal content in others they are made beautiful by waters blowing from our spiritual springs of being as in those rare instances when the material veil of life seems to be rent by a mighty hand and we feel the presence and the comfort of god within us and about us guiding our footsteps to the ineffable end which is himself occasionally however all these physical satisfaction and love divine and human are blended to a whole like soul and body and we can say now i know what is joy  such an hour came to me on the evening of that day of the winning of my bet with dingaan when a dozen lives or so were set against my nerve and skill these had not failed me although i knew that had it not been for the inspiration of the hottentot hans who sent it i wonder they would have been of no service at all with all my thought and experience it had never occurred to me that the wonderful eyes of the vultures would see the flash of the powder even through the pervading sunlight and swerve before the deadly bullet could reach them  on that night i was indeed a hero in a small way even henri marais thawed and spoke to me as a father might to his child he who always disliked me in secret partly because i was an englishman partly because i was everything to his daughter and he was jealous and partly for the reason that i stood in the path of his nephew hernan pereira whom he either loved or feared or both as for the rest of them men women and children they thanked and blessed me with tears in their eyes vowing that young as i was thenceforth i and no other should be their leader as may be imagined although it is true that she set down my success to her meal of bullocks liver and the nap which she had insisted on my taking the vrouw prinsloo was the most enthusiastic of them all  look at him she said pointing with her fat finger at my insignificant self and addressing her family if only i had such a husband or a son instead of you lumps that god has tied to me like clogs to the heels of a sheass i should be happy  god did that in order to prevent you from kicking old vrouw said her husband a quiet man with a vein of sardonic humour if only he had tied another clog to your tongue i should be happy also whereon the vrouw smacked his head and her children got out of the way sniggering  but the most blessed thing of all was my interview with marie all that took place between us can best be left to the imagination since the talk of lovers even in such circumstances is not interesting to others also in a sense it is too sacred to repeat one sentence i will set down however because in the light of after events i feel that it was prophetic and not spoken merely by chance it was at the end of our talk as she was handing me back the pistol that i had given her for a certain dreadful purpose  three times you have saved my life allanonce at maraisfontein once from starvation and now from dingaan whose touch would have meant my death i wonder whether it will ever be my turn to save yours  she looked down for a little while then lifted her head and laid her hand upon my shoulder adding slowly do you know allan i think that it will at the and suddenly she turned and left me with her sentence unfinished   so thus it came about that by the help of providence i was enabled to rescue all these worthy folk from a miserable and a bloody death and yet i have often reflected since that if things had gone differently if for instance that king aasvogel had found strength to carry itself away to die at a distance instead of soaring straight upwards like a towering partridge as birds injured in the lungs will often doi suppose in search of airit might have been better in the end then i should certainly have shot dingaan dead and every one of us would as certainly have been killed on the spot but if dingaan had died that day retief and his companions would never have been massacred also as the peaceful panda his brother would i suppose have succeeded to the throne probably the subsequent slaughter at weenen and all the after fighting would never have taken place but so it was fated and who am i that i should quarrel with or even question the decrees of fate doubtless these things were doomed to happen and they happened in due course there is nothing more to be said  early on the following morning we collected our oxen which although still footsore were now full fed and somewhat rested an hour or two later began our trek word having come to us from dingaan that we must start at once also he sent us guides under the command of the captain kambula to show us the road to natal  i breakfasted that day with the reverend mr owen and his people my object being to persuade him to come away with us as i did not consider that zululand was a safe place for white women and children my mission proved fruitless mrs hulley the wife of the absent interpreter who had three little ones miss owen and the servant jane williams were all of them anxious enough to do as i suggested but mr and mrs owen who were filled with the true fervour of missionaries would not listen they said that god would protect them that they had only been a few weeks in the country and that it would be the act of cowards and of traitors to fly at the very beginning of their work here i may add that after the massacre of retief they changed their opinion small blame to them and fled as fast as anyone else  i told mr owen how very close i had gone to shooting dingaan in which event they might all have been killed with us this news shocked him much indeed he lectured me severely on the sins of bloodthirstiness and a desire for revenge so finding that we looked at things differently and that it was of no use wasting breath in argument i wished him and his people goodbye and good fortune and went upon my way little guessing how we should meet again  an hour later we trekked passing by the accursed hill hloma amabutu where i saw some gorged vultures sleeping on the rocks we came to the gate of the great kraal here to my surprise i saw dingaan with some of his councillors and an armed guard of over a hundred men seated under the shade of two big milk trees fearing treachery i halted the wagons and advised the boers to load their rifles and be ready for the worst a minute or so later young thomas halstead arrived and told me that dingaan wished to speak with us i asked him if that meant that we were to be killed he answered no you are quite safe the king had received some news that had put him in a good humour with the white people and he desired to bid us farewell that was all  so we trekked boldly to where dingaan was and stopping the wagons went up to him in a body he greeted us kindly enough and even gave me his fat hand to shake  macumazahn he said although it has cost me many oxen i am glad that your magic prevailed yesterday had it not done so i should have killed all these your friends which would have been a cause of war between me and the amaboona now this morning i have learned that these amaboona are sending a friendly embassy to me under one of their great chiefs and i think that you will meet them on the road i charge you therefore to tell them to come on having no fear as i will receive them well and listen to all they have to say  i answered that i would do so  good he replied i am sending twelve head of cattle with you six of them for your food during your journey and six as a present to the embassy of the amaboona also kambula my captain has charge to see you safely over the tugela river  i thanked him and turned to go when suddenly his eye fell upon marie who foolishly enough took this opportunity to advance from among the others and speak to me about somethingi forget what  macumazahn is that the maiden of whom you spoke to me asked dingaan she whom you are going to marry  i answered yes  by the head of the black one he exclaimed she is very fair will you not make a present of her to me macumazahn  i answered no she is not mine to give away  well then macumazahn i will pay you a hundred head of cattle for her which is the price of a royal wife and give you ten of the fairest girls in zululand in exchange  i answered that it could not be  now the king began to grow angry  i will keep her whether you wish it or no he said  then you will keep her dead o dingaan i replied for there is more of that magic which slew the vultures  of course i meant that marie would be dead but as my knowledge of the zulu tongue was imperfect he understood the words to mean that he would be dead and i think they frightened him at any rate he said  well i promised you all safeconduct if you won your bet so hamba gachlé go in peace i wish to have no quarrel with the white folk but macumazahn you are the first of them who has refused a gift to dingaan still i bear you no grudge and if you choose to come back again you will be welcome for i perceive that although so small you are very clever and have a will of your own also that you mean what you say and speak the truth tell the people of george that my heart is soft towards them then he turned and walked away through the gates of the kraal  glad enough was i to see the last of him for now i knew that we were safe except from such accidents as may overtake any travellers through a wild country for the present at any rate until after he had seen this embassy dingaan wished to stand well with the boers therefore it was obvious that he would never make an irreparable quarrel with them by treacherously putting us to death as we trekked through his country being sure of this we went on our way with light hearts thanking heaven for the mercies which had been shown to us  it was on the third day of our trek when we were drawing near to the tugela that we met the boer embassy offsaddled by a little stream where we proposed to outspan to rest the oxen while we ate our midday meal they were sleeping in the heat of the day and saw nothing of us till we were right on to them when catching sight of our zulu advance guard they sprang up and ran for their rifles then the wagons emerged from the bush and they stared astonished wondering who could be trekking in that country  we called to them in dutch not to be afraid and in another minute we were among them while we were yet some way off my eye fell upon a burly whitebearded man whose figure seemed to be familiar to me and towards him i went taking no heed of the others of whom there may have been six or seven soon i was sure and advancing with outstretched hand said  goodday mynheer piet retief who would have thought that we who parted so far away and so long ago would live to meet among the zulus  he stared at me  who is it who is it allemachte i know now the little englishman allan quatermain who shot the geese down in the old colony well i should not be surprised for the man you beat in that match told me that you were travelling in these parts only i understood him to say that the zulus had killed you  if you mean hernan pereira i answered where did you meet him  why down by the tugela there in a bad way however he can tell you all about that himself for i have brought him with me to show us the path to dingaans kraal where is pereira send pereira here i want to speak with him  here i am answered a sleepy voice the hated voice of pereira himself from the other side of a thick bush where he had been slumbering what is it commandant i come and he emerged stretching himself and yawning just as the remainder of my party came up he caught sight of henri marais first of all and began to greet him saying thank god my uncle you are safe  then his eyes fell on me and i do not think i ever saw a mans face change more completely his jaw dropped the colour left his cheeks leaving them of the yellow which is common to persons of portuguese descent his outstretched hand fell to his side  allan quatermain he ejaculated why i thought that you were dead  as i should have been mynheer pereira twice over if you could have had your way i replied  what do you mean allan broke in retief  i will tell you what he means exclaimed the vrouw prinsloo shaking her fat fist at pereira that yellow dog means that twice he has tried to murder allanallan who saved his life and ours once he shot at him in a kloof and grazed his cheek look there is the scar of it and once he plotted with the zulus to slaughter him telling dingaan that he was an evildoer and a wizard who would bring a curse upon his land  now retief looked at pereira  what do you say to this he asked  what do i say repeated pereira recovering himself why that it is a lie or a misunderstanding i never shot at heer allan in any kloof is it likely that i should have done so when he had just nursed me back to life i never plotted with the zulus for his death which would have meant the deaths of my uncle and my cousin and of all their companions am i mad that i should do such a thing  not mad but bad screamed the vrouw i tell you heer retief it is no lie ask those with me she added appealing to the others who with the exception of marais answered as with one voice  no it is no lie  silence said the commandant now nephew allan tell us your story  so i told him everything of course leaving out all details even then the tale was long though it did not seem to be one that wearied my hearers  allemachte said retief when i had finished this is a strange story the strangest that ever i heard if it is true hernan pereira you deserve to have your back set against a tree and to be shot  god in heaven he answered am i to be condemned on such a talei an innocent man where is the evidence this englishman tells all this against me for a simple reasonthat he has robbed me of the love of my cousin to whom i was affianced where are his witnesses  as to the shooting at me in the kloof i have none except god who saw you i answered as to the plot that you laid against me among the zulus as it chances however there is one kambula the captain who was sent to take me as you had arranged and who now commands our escort  a savage exclaimed pereira is the tale of a savage to be taken against that of a white man also who will translate his story you mynheer quatermain are the only one here who knows his tongue if you do know it and you are my accuser  that is true remarked retief such a witness should not be admitted without a sworn interpreter now listen i pass judgment as commandant in the field hernan pereira i have known you to be a rogue in the past for i remember that you cheated this very young man allan quatermain at a friendly trial of skill at which i was present but since then till now i have heard nothing more of you good or bad today this allan quatermain and a number of my own countrymen bring grave charges against you which however at present are not capable of proof or disproof well i cannot decide those charges whatever my own opinion may be i think that you had better go back with your uncle henri marais to the trekboers where they can be laid before a court and settled according to law  if so he will go back alone said the vrouw prinsloo he will not go back with us for we will elect a fieldcornet and shoot himthe stinkcat who left us to starve and afterwards tried to kill little allan quatermain who saved our lives and the chorus behind her echoed  ja ja we will shoot him  hernan pereira said retief rubbing his broad forehead i dont quite know why it is but no one seems to want you as a companion indeed to speak truth i dont myself still i think you would be safer with me than with these others whom you seem to have offended therefore i suggest that you come on with us but listen here man he added sternly if i find you plotting against us among the zulus that hour you are dead do you understand  i understand that i am one slandered replied pereira still it is christian to submit to injuries and therefore i will do as you wish as to these bearers of false witness i leave them to god  and i leave you to the devil shouted vrouw prinsloo who will certainly have you soon or late get out of my sight stinkcat or i will pull your hair off and she rushed at him flapping her dreadful vatdoekwhich she produced from some recess in her raimentin his face driving him away as though he were a noxious insect  well he went i know not where and so strong was public opinion against him that i do not think that even his uncle henri marais sought him out to console him  when pereira was gone our party and that of retief fell into talk and we had much to tell especially was the commandant interested in the story of my bet with dingaan whereby i saved the lives of all my companions by shooting the vultures  it was not for nothing nephew that god almighty gave you the power of holding a gun so straight said retief to me when he understood the matter i remember that when you killed those wildfowl in the groote kloof with bullets which no other man could have done i wondered why you should have such a gift above all the rest of us who have practised for so many more years well now i understand god almighty is no fool he knows his business i wish you were coming back with me to dingaan but as that tainted man hernan pereira is of my company perhaps it is better that you should stay away tell me now about this dingaan does he mean to kill us  not this time i think uncle i answered because first he wishes to learn all about the boers still do not trust him too far just because he speaks you softly remember that if i had missed the third vulture we should all have been dead by now and if you are wise keep an eye upon hernan pereira  these things i will do nephew especially the last of them and now we must be getting on stay come here henri marais i have a word to say to you i understand that this little englishman allan quatermain who is worth ten bigger men loves your daughter whose life he has saved again and again and that she loves him why then do you not let them marry in a decent fashion  because before god i have sworn her to another manto my nephew hernan pereira whom everyone slanders answered marais sulkily until she is of age that oath holds  oho said retief you have sworn your lamb to that hyena have you well look out that he does not crack your bones as well as hers and perhaps some others also why does god give some men a worm in their brains as he does to the wildebeeste a worm that always makes them run the wrong way i dont know i am sure but you who are very religious henri marais might think the matter over and tell me the answer when next we meet well this girl of yours will soon be of age and then as i am commandant down yonder where she is going ill see she marries the man she wants whatever you say henri marais heaven above us i only wish it were my daughter he was in love with a fellow who can shoot to such good purpose might have the lot of them and uttering one of his great hearty laughs he walked off to his horse   on the morrow of this meeting we forded the tugela and entered the territory that is now called natal two days short trekking through a beautiful country brought us to some hills that i think were called pakadi or else a chief named pakadi lived there i forget which crossing these hills on the further side of them as retief had told us we should do we found a large party of the trekboers who were already occupying this land on the hither side of the bushmans river little knowing poor people that it was fated to become the grave of many of them today and for all future time that district is and will be known by the name of weenen or the place of weeping because of those pioneers who here were massacred by dingaan within a few weeks of the time of which i write  nice as the land was for some reason or other it did not quite suit my fancy and therefore in view of my approaching marriage with marie having purchased a horse from one of the trekboers i began to explore the country round my object was to find a stretch of fertile veld where we could settle when we were wedded and such a spot i discovered after some trouble it lay about thirty miles away to the east in the loop of a beautiful stream that is now known as the mooi river  enclosed in this loop were some thirty thousand acres of very rich lowlying soil almost treeless and clothed with luxuriant grasses where game was extraordinarily numerous at the head of it rose a flattopped hill from the crest of which oddly enough flowed a plentiful stream of water fed by a strong spring halfway down this hill facing to the east and irrigable by the stream was a plateau several acres in extent which furnished about the best site for a house that i know in all south africa here i determined we would build our dwellingplace and become rich by the breeding up of great herds of cattle i should explain that this ground which once as the remains of their old kraals showed had belonged to a kaffir tribe killed out by chaka the zulu king was to be had for the taking  indeed as there was more land than we could possibly occupy i persuaded henri marais the prinsloos and the meyers with whom i had trekked from delagoa to visit it with me when they had seen it they agreed to make it their home in the future but meanwhile elected to return to the other boers for safetys sake so with the help of some kaffirs of whom there were a few in the district remnants of those tribes which chaka had destroyed i pegged out an estate of about twelve thousand acres for myself and selecting a site set the natives to work to build a rough mud house upon it which would serve as a temporary dwelling i should add that the prinsloos and the meyers also made arrangements for the building of similar shelters almost alongside of my own this done i returned to marie and the trekboers  on the morning after my return to the camp piet retief appeared there with his five or six companions i asked him how he had got on with dingaan  well enough nephew he answered at first the king was somewhat angry saying that we boers had stolen six hundred head of his cattle but i showed him that it was the chief sikonyela who lives yonder on the caledon river who had dressed up his people in white mens clothes and put them upon horses and afterwards drove the cattle through one of our camps to make it appear that we were the thieves then he asked me what was my object in visiting him i answered that i sought a grant of the land south of the tugela to the sea  bring me back the cattle that you say sikonyela has stolen he said and we will talk about this land to this i agreed and soon after left the kraal  what did you do with hernan pereira uncle i asked  this allan when i was at umgungundhlovu i sought out the truth of that story you told me as to his having made a plot to get you killed by the zulus on the ground that you were a wizard  and what did you discover uncle  i discovered that it was true for dingaan told me so himself then i sent for pereira and ordered him out of my camp telling him that if he came back among the boers i would have him put on his trial for attempted murder he said nothing but went away  whither did he go  to a place that dingaan gave him just outside his kraal the king said that he would be useful to him as he could mend guns and teach his soldiers to shoot with them so there i suppose he remains unless he has thought it wiser to make off at any rate i am sure that he will not come here to trouble you or anyone  no uncle but he may trouble you there i said doubtfully  what do you mean allan  i dont quite know but he is blackhearted a traitor by nature and in one way or the other he will stir up sorrow do you think that he will love you for instance after you have hunted him out like a thief  retief shrugged his shoulders and laughed as he answered  i will take my chance of that what is the use of troubling ones head about such a snake of a man and now allan i have something to ask you are you married yet  no uncle nor can be for another five weeks when marie comes of age her father still holds that his oath binds him and i have promised that i will not take her till then  does he indeed allan i think that henri marais is kransick that is cracked or else his cursed nephew hernan has fascinated him as a snake does a bird still i suppose that he has the law on his side and as i am commandant i cannot advise anyone to break the law now listen it is no use your staying here looking at the ripe peach you may not pluck for that only makes the stomach sick therefore the best thing that you can do is to come with me to get those cattle from sikonyela for i shall be very glad of your company afterwards too i want you to return with me to zululand when i go for the grant of all this country  but how about my getting married i asked in dismay  oh i dare say you will be able to marry before we start or if not it must be when we return listen now do not disappoint me in this matter allan none of us can speak zulu except you who takes to these savage languages like a duck to water and i want you to be my interpreter with dingaan also the king specially asked that you should come with me when i brought the cattle as he seems to have taken a great fancy to you he said that you would render his words honestly but that he did not trust the lad whom he has there to translate into dutch and english so you see it will help me very much in this big business if you come with me  still i hesitated for some fear of the future lay heavy on my heart warning me against this expedition  allemachte said retief angrily if you will not grant me a favour let it be or is it that you want reward if so all i can promise you is twenty thousand acres of the best land in the country when we get it  no mynheer retief i replied it is no question of reward and as for the land i have already pegged out my farm on a river about thirty miles to the east it is that i do not like to leave marie alone fearing lest her father should play some trick on me as regards her and hernan pereira  oh if that is all you are afraid of allan i can soon settle matters for i will give orders to the prédicant celliers that he is not to marry marie marais to anyone except yourself even if she asks him also i will order that if hernan pereira should come to the camp he is to be shut up until i return to try him lastly as commandant i will name henri marais as one of those who are to accompany us so that he will be able to plot nothing against you now are you satisfied  i said yes as cheerfully as i could though i felt anything but cheerful and we parted for of course the commandant retief had much to occupy him  then i went and told marie what i had promised somewhat to my surprise she said that she thought i had acted wisely  if you stayed here she added perhaps some new quarrel would arise between you and my father which might make bitterness afterwards also dear it would be foolish for you to offend the commandant retief who will be the great man in this country and who is very fond of you after all allan we shall only be separated for a little while and when that is done we have the rest of our lives to spend together as for me do not be afraid for you know i will never marry anyone but youno not to save myself from death  so i left her somewhat comforted knowing how sound was her judgment and went off to make my preparations for the expedition to sikonyelas country  all this conversation with retief i have set down in full as nearly as i can remember it because of its fateful consequences ah if i could have foreseen if only i could have foreseen    chapter xvi the council   two days later we started to recover dingaans cattle sixty or seventy of us all well armed and mounted with us went two of dingaans captains and a number of zulus perhaps a hundred who were to drive the cattle if we recovered them as i could speak their language i was more or less in command of this zulu contingent and managed to make myself very useful in that capacity also during the month or so of our absence by continually conversing with them i perfected myself considerably in my knowledge of their beautiful but difficult tongue  now it is not my intention to write down the details of this expedition during which there was no fighting and nothing serious happened we arrived in due course at sikonyelas and stated our errand when he saw how numerous and well armed we were and that behind us was all the might of the zulu army that wily old rascal thought it well to surrender the stolen cattle without further todo and with these some horses which he had lifted from the boers so having received them we delivered them over to the zulu captains with instructions to drive them carefully to umgungundhlovu the commandant sent a message by these men to the effect that having fulfilled his part of the compact he would wait upon dingaan as soon as possible in order to conclude the treaty about the land  this business finished retief took me and a number of the boers to visit other bodies of the emigrant dutch who were beyond the drakensberg in what is now the transvaal territory this occupied a long time as these boers were widely scattered and at each camp we had to stop for several days while retief explained everything to its leaders also he arranged with them to come down into natal so as to be ready to people it as soon as he received the formal cession of the country from dingaan indeed most of them began to trek at once although jealousies between the various commandants caused some of the bands luckily for themselves to remain on the farther side of the mountains  at length everything being settled we rode away and reached the bushmans river camp on a certain saturday afternoon here to my joy we found all well nothing had been heard of hernan pereira while the zulus if we might judge from messengers who came to us seemed to be friendly marie also had now quite recovered from the fears and hardships which she had undergone never had i seen her look so sweet and beautiful as she did when she greeted me arrayed no longer in rags but in a simple yet charming dress made of some stuff that she had managed to buy from a trader who came up to the camp from durban moreover i think that there was another reason for the change since the light of dawning happiness shone in her deep eyes  the day as i have said was saturday and on the monday she would come of age and be free to dispose of herself in marriage for on that day lapsed the promise which we had given to her father but alas by a cursed perversity of fate on this very monday at noon the commandant retief had arranged to ride into zululand on his second visit to dingaan and with retief i was in honour bound to go  marie i said will not your father soften towards us and let us be married tomorrow so that we may have a few hours together before we part  i do not know my dear she answered blushing since about this matter he is very strange and obstinate do you know that all the time you were absent he never mentioned your name and if anyone else spoke it he would get up and go away  thats bad i said still if you are willing we might try  indeed and indeed allan i am willing who am sick of being so near to you and yet so far but how shall we do so  i think that we will ask the commandant retief and the vrouw prinsloo to plead for us marie let us go to seek them  she nodded and hand in hand we walked through the boers who nudged each other and laughed at us as we passed to where the old vrouw was seated on a stool by her wagon drinking coffee i remember that her vatdoek was spread over her knees for she also had a new dress which she was afraid of staining  well my dears she said in her loud voice are you married already that you hang so close together  no my aunt i answered but we want to be and have come to you to help us  that i will do with all my heart though to speak truth young people at your age as things are i should have been inclined to help myself as i have told you before heaven above us what is it that makes marriage in the sight of god it is that male and female should declare themselves man and wife before all folk and live as such the pastor and his mumblings are very well if you can get them but it is the giving of the hand not the setting of the ring upon it it is the vowing of two true hearts and not words read out of a book that make marriage still this is bold talk for which any reverend prédicant would reprove me for if young folk acted on it although the tie might hold good in law what would become of his fee come let us seek the commandant and hear what he has to say allan pull me up off this stool where if i had my way after so much travelling i should like to sit while a house was built over my head and for the rest of my life  i obeyed not without difficulty and we went to find retief  at the moment he was standing alone watching two wagons that had just trekked away these contained his wife with other members of his family and some friends whom he was sending under the charge of the heer smit to a place called doornkop that lay at a distance of fifteen miles or more at this doornkop he had already caused a rough house or rather shed to be built for the vrouw retiefs occupation thinking that she would be more comfortable and perhaps safer there during his absence than at the crowded camp in a wagon  allemachte allan he said catching sight of me my heart is sore i do not know why i tell you that when i kissed my old woman goodbye just now i felt as though i should never see her again and the tears came into my eyes i wish we were all safe back from dingaan but there there i will try to get over to see her tomorrow as we dont start till monday what is it that you want allan with that mooi mesje of yoursand he pointed to the tall marie  what would any man want with such a one save to marry her broke in the vrouw prinsloo now commandant listen while i set out the tale  all right aunt only be brief for i have no time to spare  she obeyed but i cannot say that she was brief  when at last the old lady paused breathless retief said  i understand everything there is no need for you young people to talk now we will go and see henri marais and if he is not madder than usual make him listen to reason  so we walked to where maraiss wagon stood at the end of the line and found him sitting on the disselboom cutting up tobacco with his pocketknife  goodday allan he said for we had not met since my return have you had a nice journey  i was about to answer when the commandant broke in impatiently  see here see here henri we have not come to talk about allans journey but about his marriage which is more important he rides with me to zululand on monday as you do and wants to wed your daughter tomorrow which is sunday a good day for the deed  it is a day to pray not to give and be given in marriage commented marais sulkily moreover marie does not come of age before monday and until then the oath that i made to god holds  my vatdoek for your oath exclaimed the vrouw flapping that awful rag in his face how much do you suppose that god cares what you in your folly swore to that stinkcat of a nephew of yours do you be careful henri marais that god does not make of your precious oath a stone to fall upon your head and break it like a peanutshell  hold your chattering tongue old woman said marais furiously am i to be taught my duty to my conscience and my daughter by you  certainly you are if you cannot teach them to yourself began the vrouw setting her hands upon her hips  but retief pushed her aside saying  no quarrelling here now henri marais your conduct about these two young people who love each other is a scandal will you let them be married tomorrow or not  no commandant i will not by the law i have power over my daughter till she is of age and i refuse to allow her to marry a cursed englishman moreover the prédicant celliers is away so there is none to marry them  you speak strange words mynheer marais said retief quietly especially when i remember all that this cursed englishman has done for you and yours for i have heard every bit of that story though not from him now hearken you have appealed to the law and as commandant i must allow your appeal but after twelve oclock tomorrow night according to your own showing the law ceases to bind your daughter therefore on monday morning if there is no clergyman in the camp and these two wish it i as commandant will marry them before all men as i have the power to do  then marais broke into one of those raving fits of temper which were constitutional in him and to my mind showed that he was never quite sane oddly enough it was on poor marie that he concentrated his wrath he cursed her horribly because she had withstood his will and refused to marry hernan pereira he prayed that evil might fall on her that she might never bear a child and that if she did it might die and other things too unpleasant to mention  we stared at him astonished though i think that had he been any other man than the father of my betrothed i should have struck him retief i noticed lifted his hand to do so then let it fall again muttering let be he is possessed with a devil  at last marais ceased not i think from lack of words but because he was exhausted and stood before us his tall form quivering and his thin nervous face working like that of a person in convulsions then marie who had dropped her head beneath this storm lifted it and i saw that her deep eyes were all ablaze and that she was very white  you are my father she said in a low voice and therefore i must submit to whatever you choose to say to me moreover i think it likely that the evil which you call down will fall upon me since satan is always at hand to fulfil his own wishes but if so my father i am sure that this evil will recoil upon your own head not only here but hereafter there justice will be done to both of us perhaps before very long and also to your nephew hernan pereira  marais made no answer his rage seemed to have spent itself he only sat himself again upon the disselboom of the wagon and went on cutting up the tobacco viciously as though he were slicing the heart of a foe even the vrouw prinsloo was silent and stared at him whilst she fanned herself with the vatdoek but retief spoke  i wonder if you are mad or only wicked henri marais he said to curse your own sweet girl like this you must be one or the othera single child who has always been good to you well as you are to ride with me on monday i pray that you will keep your temper under control lest it should bring us into trouble and you also as for you marie my dear do not fret because a wild beast has tried to toss you with his horns although he happens to be your father on monday morning you pass out of his power into your own and on that day i will marry you to allan quatermain here meanwhile i think you are safest away from this father of yours who might take to cutting your throat instead of that tobacco vrouw prinsloo be so good as to look after marie marais and on monday morning next bring her before me to be wed until then henri marais i as commandant shall set a guard over you with orders to seize you if it should be necessary now i advise you to take a walk and when you are calm again to pray god to forgive you your wicked words lest they should be fulfilled and drag you down to judgment  then we all went leaving henri marais still cutting up his tobacco on the disselboom  on the sunday i met marais walking about the camp followed by the guard whom retief had set over him to my surprise he greeted me almost with affection  allan he said you must not misunderstand me i do not really wish ill to marie whom i love more dearly than i do my life god alone knows how much i love her but i made a promise to her cousin hernan my only sisters only child and you will understand that i cannot break that promise although hernan has disappointed me in many waysyes in many ways but if he is bad as they say it comes with that portuguese blood which is a misfortune that he cannot help does it not however bad he may be as an honest man i am bound to keep my promise am i not also allan you must remember that you are english and although you may be a good fellow in yourself that is a fault which you cannot expect me to forgive still if it is fated that you should marry my daughter and breed english childrenheaven above to think of it english childrenwell there is nothing more to be said dont remember the words i spoke to marie indeed i cant remember them myself when i grow angry a kind of rush of blood comes into my brain and then i forget what i have said and he stretched out his hand to me  i shook it and answered that i understood he was not himself when he spoke those dreadful words which both marie and i wished to forget  i hope you will come to our wedding tomorrow i added and wipe them out with a fathers blessing  tomorrow are you really going to be married tomorrow he exclaimed his sallow face twitching nervously o god it was another man that i dreamed to see standing by maries side but he is not here he has disgraced and deserted me well i will come if my gaolers will suffer it goodbye you happy bridegroom of tomorrow goodbye  then he swung round and departed followed by the guards one of whom touched his brow and shook his head significantly as he passed me  i think that sunday seemed the longest day i ever spent the vrouw prinsloo would scarcely allow me even a glimpse of marie because of some fad she had got into her mind that it was either not proper or not fortunate i forget which that a bride and bridegroom should associate on the eve of their marriage so i occupied myself as best i could first i wrote a long letter to my father the third that i had sent telling him everything that was going to happen and saying how grieved i was that he could not be present to marry us and give us his blessing  this letter i gave to a trader who was trekking to the bay on the following morning begging him to forward it by the first opportunity  that duty done i saw about the horses which i was taking into zululand three of them two for myself and one for hans who accompanied me as afterrider also the saddlery saddlebags guns and ammunition must be overhauled all of which took some time  you are going to spend a strange wittebroodsweek whitebreadweek or in other words honeymoon baas said hans squinting at me with his little eyes as he brayed away at a buckskin which was to serve as a saddlecloth now if i was to be married tomorrow i should stop with my pretty for a few days and only ride off somewhere else when i was tired of her especially if that somewhere else chanced to be zululand where they are so fond of killing people  i dare say you would hans and so would i if i could you be sure but you see the commandant wants me to interpret and therefore it is my duty to go with him  duty what is duty baas love i understand it is for love of you that i go with you also for fear lest you should cause me to be beaten if i refused otherwise i would certainly stop here in the camp where there is plenty to eat and little work to do as were i you i should do also for love of that white missie but dutypah that is a foolword which makes bones of a man before his time and leaves his girl to others  of course you do not understand hans any more than you coloured people understand what gratitude is but what do you mean about this trek of ours are you afraid  he shrugged his shoulders a little perhaps baas at least i should be if i thought about the morrow which i dont since today is enough for me and thinking about what one cant know makes the head ache dingaan is not a nice man baas we saw that didnt we he is a hunter who knows how to set a trap also he has the baas pereira up there to help him so perhaps you might be more comfortable here kissing missie marie why do you not say that you have hurt your leg and cannot run it would not be much trouble to walk about on a crutch for a day or two and when the commandant was well gone your leg might heal and you could throw the stick away  get thee behind me satan i muttered to myself and was about to give hans a piece of my mind when i recollected that the poor fellow had his own way of looking at things and could not be blamed also as he said he loved me and only suggested what he thought would tend to my joy and safety how could i suppose that he would be interested in the success of a diplomatic mission to dingaan or think anything about it except that it was a risky business so i only said  hans if you are afraid you had better stop behind i can easily find another afterrider  is the baas angry with me that he should speak so asked the hottentot have i not always been true to him and if i should be killed what does it matter have i not said that i do not think about tomorrow and we must all go to sleep sometime no unless the baas beats me back i shall come with him but baasthis in a wheedling toneyou might give me some brandy to drink your health in tonight it is very good to get drunk when one has to be sober and perhaps dead for a long time afterwards it would be nice to remember when one is a spook or an angel with white wings such as the old baas your father used to tell us about in school on the sabbath  at this point finding hans hopeless i got up and walked away leaving him to finish our preparations  that evening there was a prayermeeting in the camp for although no pastor was present one of the boer elders took his place and offered up supplications which if simple and even absurd in their wording at least were hearty enough amongst other requests i remember that he petitioned for the safety of those who were to go on the mission to dingaan and of those who were to remain behind alas those prayers were not heard for it pleased the power to whom they were addressed to decree otherwise  after this meeting in which i took an earnest share retief who just before it began had ridden in from doornkop whither he had been to visit his wife held a kind of council whereat the names of those who had volunteered or been ordered to accompany him were finally taken down at this council there was a good deal of discussion since many of the boers did not think the expedition wiseat any rate if it was to be carried out on so large a scale one of them i forget which an old man pointed out that it might look like a war party and that it would be wiser if only five or six went as they had done before since then there could be no mistake as to the peaceful nature of their intentions  retief himself combated this view and at last turned suddenly to me who was listening near by and said  allan quatermain you are young but you have a good judgment also you are one of the very few who know dingaan and can speak his language tell us now what do you think  thus adjured i answered perhaps moved thereto more than i thought by hanss talk that i too considered the thing dangerous and that someone whose life was less valuable than the commandants should go in command  why do you say so nephew he said irritably seeing that all white mens lives are of equal value and i can smell no danger in the business  because commandant i do smell danger though what danger i cannot say any more than a dog or a buck can when it sniffs something in the air and barks or runs dingaan is a tamed tiger just now but tigers are not house cats that one can play with them as i know who have felt his claws and just only just come out from between them  what do you mean nephew asked retief in his direct fashion do you believe that this swartzel that is black creature means to kill us  i believe that it is quite possible i answered  then nephew being a reasonable man as you are you must have some ground for your belief come now out with it  i have none commandant except that one who can set the lives of a dozen folk against a mans skill in shooting at birds on the wing and who can kill people to be a bait for those birds is capable of anything moreover he told me that he did not love you boers and why should he  now all those who were standing about seemed to be impressed with this argument at any rate they turned towards retief anxiously waiting for his reply  doubtless answered the commandant who as i have said was irritable that night doubtless those english missionaries have poisoned the kings mind against us boers also he added suspiciously i think you told me allan that the king said he liked you and meant to spare you even if he killed your companions just because you also are english are you sure that you do not know more than you choose to tell us has dingaan perhaps confided something to youjust because you are english  then noting that these words moved the assembled boers in whom race prejudice and recent events had created a deep distrust of any born of british blood i grew very angry and answered  commandant dingaan confided nothing to me except that some kaffir witchdoctor who is named zikali a man i never saw had told him that he must not kill an englishman and therefore he wished to spare me although one of your people hernan pereira had whispered to him that i ought to be killed yet i say outright that i think you are foolish to visit this king with so large a force still i am ready to do so myself with one or two others let me go then and try to persuade him to sign this treaty as to the land if i am killed or fail you can follow after me and do better  allemachte exclaimed retief that is a fair offer but how do i know nephew that when we came to read the treaty we should not find that it granted all the land to you english and not to us boers no no dont look angry that was not a right thing to say for you are honest whatever most of your blood may be nephew allan you who are a brave man are afraid of this journey now why is that i wonder ah i have it i had forgotten you are to be married tomorrow morning to a very pretty girl and it is not natural that you should wish to spend the next fortnight in zululand dont you see brothers he wants to get out of it because he is going to be married as it is natural that he should and therefore he tries to frighten us all when we were going to be married should we have wished to ride away at once to visit some stinking savage ach i am glad i thought of that just as i was beginning to turn his gloomy colour like a chameleon on a black hat for it explains everything and he struck his thigh with his big hand and burst into a roar of laughter  all the company of boers who stood around began to laugh also uproariously for this primitive joke appealed to them moreover their nerves were strained they also dreaded this expedition and therefore they were glad to relieve themselves in bucolic merriment everything was clear to them now feeling myself in honour bound to go on the embassy as i was their only interpreter i artful dog was trying to play upon their fears in order to prevent it from starting so that i might have a week or two of the company of my newwed wife they saw and appreciated the joke  hes slim this little englishman shouted one  dont be angry with him we should have done as much ourselves replied another  leave him behind said a third even the zulus do not send a newmarried man on service then they smacked me on the back and hustled me in their rude kindly manner till at length i fell into a rage and hit one of them on the nose at which he only laughed the louder although i made it bleed  see here friends i said as soon as silence was restored married or no whoever does not ride to dingaan i ride to him although it is against my judgment let those laugh loudest who laugh last  good cried one if you set the pace we shall soon be home again allan quatermain who would not with marie marais at the end of the journey  then followed by their rough and mocking laughter i broke away from them and took refuge in my wagon little guessing that all this talk would be brought up against me on a day to come  in a certain class of uneducated mind foresight is often interpreted as guilty knowledge    chapter xvii the marriage   i was awakened on my wedding morning by the crash and bellowing of a great thunderstorm the lightning flashed fearfully all about us killing two oxen quite near to my wagon and the thunder rolled and echoed till the very earth seemed to shake then came a wail of cold wind and after that the swish of torrential rain although i was well accustomed to such natural manifestations especially at this season of the year i confess that these sights and sounds did not tend to raise my spirits which were already lower than they should have been on that eventful day hans however who arrived to help me put on my best clothes for the ceremony was for once consoling  dont look sick baas he said for if there is storm in the morning there is shine at night  yes i answered speaking more to myself than to him but what will happen between the storm of the morning and the peace of the night  it was arranged that the commission which counting the native afterriders consisted of over a hundred people among them several boys who were little more than children was to ride at one hour before noon nobody could get about to make the necessary preparations until the heavy rain had passed away which it did a little after eight oclock therefore when i left the wagon to eat or try to eat some breakfast i found the whole camp in a state of bustle  boers were shouting to their servants horses were being examined women were packing the saddlebags of their husbands and fathers with spare clothes the packbeasts were being laden with biltong and other provisions and so forth  in the midst of all this tumult i began to wonder whether my private business would not be forgotten since it seemed unlikely that time could be found for marriages however about ten oclock when having done everything that i had to do i was sitting disconsolately upon my wagon box being too shy to mix with that crowd of busy mockers or to go to the prinsloos camp to make inquiries the vrouw herself appeared  come on allan she said the commandant is waiting and swearing because you are not there also there is another waiting and oh she looks lovely when they see her every man in the camp will want her for himself whether he has got a wife or not for in that matter although you maynt think so just now they are all the same as the kaffirs oh i know them i know them a white skin makes no difference  while she held forth thus in her usual outspoken fashion the vrouw was dragging me along by the hand just as though i were a naughty little boy nor could i get free from that mighty grip or when once her great bulk was in motion match my weight against it of course some of the younger boers who knowing her errand had followed her set up a shout of cheers and laughter which attracted everybody to the procession  it is too late to hang back now englishman you must make the best of a bad business if you wanted to change your mind you should have done it before men and women roared and screamed with many other such bantering words till at length i felt myself turn the colour of a red vlei lily  so we came at last to where marie stood the centre of an admiring circle she was clothed in a soft white gown made of some simple but becoming stuff and she wore upon her dark hair a wreath woven by the other maidens in the camp a bevy of whom stood behind her  now we were face to face our eyes met and oh hers were full of love and trust they dazzled and bewildered me feeling that i ought to speak and not knowing what to say i merely stammered good morning whereon everyone broke into a roar of laughter except vrouw prinsloo who exclaimed  did any one ever see such a fool and even marie smiled  then piet retief appeared from somewhere dressed in tall boots and rough riding clothes such as the boers wore in those days handing the roer he was carrying to one of his sons after much fumbling he produced a book from his pocket in which the place was marked with a piece of grass  now then he said be silent all and show respect for remember i am not a man just now i am a parson which is quite a different thing and being a commandant and a veld cornet and other officers all rolled into one by virtue of the law i am about to marry these young people so help me god dont any of you witnesses ever say afterwards that they are not rightly and soundly married because i tell you that they are or will be he paused for breath and someone said hear hear or its dutch equivalent whereon having glared the offender into silence retief proceeded  young man and young woman what are your names  dont ask silly questions commandant broke in vrouw prinsloo you know their names well enough  of course i do aunt he answered but for this purpose i must pretend not to know them are you better acquainted with the law than i am but stay where is the father henri marais  someone thrust marais forward and there he stood quite silent staring at us with a queer look upon his face and his gun in his hand for he too was ready to ride  take away that gun said retief it might go off and cause disturbance or perhaps accidents and somebody obeyed now henri marais do you give your daughter to be married to this man  no said marais softly  very well that is just like you but it doesnt matter for she is of age and can give herself is she not of age henri marais dont stand there like a horse with the staggers but tell me is she not of age  i believe so he answered in the same soft voice  then take notice people all that this woman is of age and gives herself to be married to this man dont you my dear  yes answered marie  all right now for it and opening the book he held it up to the light and began to read or rather to stumble through the marriage service  presently he stuck fast being like most boers of his time no great scholar and exclaimed  here one of you help me with these hard words  as nobody volunteered retief handed the book to me for he knew that marais would not assist him saying  you are a scholar allan being a clergymans son read on till we come to the important bits and i will say the words after you which will do just as well and be quite according to law  so i read heaven knows how for the situation was trying enough until i came to the crucial questions when i gave the book back  ah said retief this is quite easy now then allan do you take this woman to be your wife answer putting in your name which is left blank in the book  i replied that i did and the question was repeated to marie who did likewise  well then there you are said retief for i wont trouble you with all the prayers which i dont feel myself parson enough to say oh no i forgot have you a ring  i drew one off my finger that had been my mothersi believe it had served this same purpose at the wedding of her grandmotherand set the thin little hoop of gold upon the third finger of maries left hand i still wear that ring today  it should have been a new one muttered vrouw prinsloo  be silent aunt said retief are there any jewellers shops here in the veld a ring is a ring even if it came off a horses bit there i think that is all no wait a minute i am going to say a prayer of my own over you not one out of this book which is so badly printed that i cannot read it kneel down both of you the rest may stand as the grass is so wet  now bethinking herself of maries new dress the vrouw produced her vatdoek from a capacious pocket and doubled up that dingy article for marie to kneel on which she did then pieter retief flinging down the book clasped his hands and uttered this simple earnest prayer whereof strangely enough every word remains fast in my mind coming as it did not from a printed page but from his honest and believing heart it was very impressive and solemn  o god above us who sees all and is with us when we are born when we are married when we die and if we do our duty for all time afterwards in heaven hear our prayer i pray thee bless this man and this woman who appear here before thee to be wed make them love each other truly all their lives be these long or short be they sick or well be they happy or in sorrow be they rich or poor give them children to be reared up in thy word give them an honest name and the respect of all who know them and at last give them thy salvation through the blood of jesus the saviour if they are together let them rejoice in each other if they are apart let them not forget each other if one of them dies and the other lives let that one who lives look forward to the day of reunion and bow the head to thy will and keep that one who dies in thy holy hand o thou who knowest all things guide the lives of these two according to thy eternal purpose and teach them to be sure that whatever thou doest is done for the best for thou art a faithful creator who wishes good to his children and not evil and at the last thou wilt give them that good if they do but trust in thee through daylight and through darkness now let no man dare to put asunder those whom thou hast joined together o lord god almighty father of us all amen  so he prayed and all the company echoed that amen from their hearts that is all except one for henri marais turned his back on us and walked away  so said retief wiping his brow with the sleeve of his coat you are the last couple that ever i mean to marry the work is too hard for a layman who has bad sight for print now kiss each other it is the right thing to do  so we kissed and the congregation cheered  allan went on the commandant pulling out a silver watch like a turnip you have just half an hour before we ride and the vrouw prinsloo says that she has made you a wedding meal in that tent there so you had best go eat it  to the tent we went accordingly to find a simple but bounteous feast prepared of which we partook helping each other to food as is or was the custom with newwedded folk also many boers came in and drank our healths although the vrouw prinsloo told them that it would have been more decent to leave us alone but henri marais did not come or drink our healths  thus the halfhour went all too swiftly and not a word did we get alone at last in despair seeing that hans was already waiting with the horses i drew marie aside motioning to everyone to stand back  dearest wife i said in broken words this is a strange beginning to our married life but you see it cant be helped  no allan she answered it cant be helped but oh i wish my heart were happier about your journey i fear dingaan and if anything should chance to you i shall die of grief  why should anything chance marie we are a strong and wellarmed party and dingaan looks on us peacefully  i dont know husband but they say hernan pereira is with the zulus and he hates you  then he had better mind his manners or he will not be here long to hate anybody i answered grimly for my gorge rose at the thought of this man and his treacheries  vrouw prinsloo i called to the old lady who was near be pleased to come hither and listen and marie do you listen also if by chance i should hear anything affecting your safety and send you a message by someone you can trust such as that you should remove yourselves elsewhere or hide promise me that you will obey it without question  of course i will obey you husband have i not just sworn to do so marie said with a sad smile  and so will i allan said the vrouw not because i have sworn anything but because i know you have a good head on your shoulders and so will my man and the others of our party though why you should think you will have any message to send i cant guess unless you know something that is hidden from us she added shrewdly you say you dont well it is not likely you would tell us if you did look they are calling you must go come on marie let us see them off  so we went to where the commission was gathered on horseback just in time to hear retief addressing the people or rather the last of his words  friends he said we go upon an important business from which i hope we shall return happily within a very little time still this is a rough country and we have to deal with rough people therefore my advice to all you who stay behind is that you should not scatter but keep together so that in case of any trouble the men who are left may be at hand to defend this camp for if they are here you have nothing to fear from all the savages in africa and now god be with you and goodbye come trek brothers trek  then followed a few moments of confusion while men kissed their wives children and sisters in farewell or shook each other by the hand i too kissed marie and tumbling on to my horse somehow rode away my eyes blind with tears for this parting was bitter when i could see clearly again i pulled up and looked back at the camp which was now at some distance it seemed a peaceful place indeed for although the storm of the morning was returning and a pall of dark cloud hung over it the sun still shone upon the white wagon caps and the people who went to and fro among them  who could have thought that within a little time it would be but a field of blood that those wagons would be riddled with assegais and that the women and children who were moving there must most of them lie upon the veld mutilated corpses dreadful to behold alas the boers always impatient of authority and confident that their own individual judgment was the best did not obey their commandants order to keep together they went off this way and that to shoot the game which was then so plentiful leaving their families almost without protection thus the zulus found and slew them  presently as i rode forward a little apart from the others someone overtook me and i saw that it was henri marais  well allan he said so god has given you to me for a soninlaw who would have thought it you do not look to me like a newmarried man for that marriage is not natural when the bridegroom rides off and leaves the bride of an hour perhaps you will never be really married after all for god who gives sonsinlaw can also take them away especially when he was not asked for them ah he went on lapsing into french as was his wont when moved qui vivra verra qui vivra verra then shouting this excellent but obvious proverb at the top of his voice he struck his horse with the butt of his gun and galloped away before i could answer him  at that moment i hated henri marais as i had never hated anyone before not even his nephew hernan almost did i ride to the commandant to complain of him but reflecting to myself first that he was undoubtedly half mad and therefore not responsible for his actions and secondly that he was better here with us than in the same camp with my wife i gave up the idea yet alas it is the halfmad who are the most dangerous of lunatics  hans who had observed this scene and overheard all maraiss talk and who also knew the state of the case well enough sidled his horse alongside of me and whispered in a wheedling voice  baas i think the old baas is kransick and not safe he looks like one who is going to harm someone now baas suppose i let my gun off by accident you know we coloured people are very careless with guns the heer marais would never be troubled with any more fancies and you and the missie marie and all of us would be safer also you could not be blamed nor could i for who can help an accident guns will go off sometimes baas when you dont want them to  get out i answered yet if hanss gun had chanced to go off i believe it might have saved a multitude of lives    chapter xviii the treaty   our journey to umgungundhlovu was prosperous and without incident when we were within half a days march from the great kraal we overtook the herd of cattle that we had recaptured from sikonyela for these beasts had been driven very slowly and well rested that they might arrive in good condition also the commandant was anxious that we should present them ourselves to the king  driving this multitude of animals before usthere were over five thousand head of themwe reached the great place on saturday the 3rd of february about midday and forced them through its gates into the cattle kraals then we offsaddled and ate our dinner under those two milk trees near the gate of the kraal where i had bid goodbye to dingaan  after dinner messengers came to ask us to visit the king and with them the youth thomas halstead who told the commandant that all weapons must be left behind since it was the zulu law that no man might appear before the king armed to this retief demurred whereon the messengers appealed to me whom they had recognised asking if that were not the custom of their country  i answered that i had not been in it long enough to know then there was a pause while they sent for someone to bear evidence at the time i did not know whom as i was not near enough to thomas halstead to make inquiries presently this someone appeared and turned out to be none other than hernan pereira  he advanced towards us attended by zulus as though he were a chief looking fat and well and handsomer than ever seeing retief he lifted his hat with a flourish and held out his hand which i noted the commandant did not take  so you are still here mynheer pereira he said coldly now be good enough to tell me what is this matter about the abandoning of our arms  the king charges me to say began hernan  charges you to say mynheer pereira are you then this black mans servant but continue  that none must come into his private enclosure armed  well then mynheer be pleased to go tell this king that we do not wish to come to his private enclosure i have brought the cattle that he desired me to fetch and i am willing to deliver them to him wherever he wishes but we will not unarm in order to do so  now there was talk and messengers were despatched who returned at full speed presently to say that dingaan would receive the boers in the great dancing place in the midst of the kraal and that they might bring their guns as he wished to see how they fired them  so we rode in making as fine a show as we could to find that the dancing place which measured a good many acres in extent was lined round with thousands of plumed but unarmed warriors arranged in regiments  you see i heard pereira say to retief these have no spears  no answered the commandant but they have sticks which when they are a hundred to one would serve as well  meanwhile the vast mob of cattle were being driven in a double stream past a knot of men at the head of the space and then away through gates behind when the beasts had all gone we approached these men among whom i recognised the fat form of dingaan draped in a bead mantle we ranged ourselves in a semicircle before him and stood while he searched us with his sharp eyes presently he saw me and sent a councillor to say that i must come and interpret for him  so dismounting i went with retief thomas halstead and a few of the leading boers  sakubona good day macumazahn said dingaan i am glad that you have come as i know that you will speak my words truly being one of the people of george whom i love for thomaas here i do not trust although he is also a son of george  i told retief what he said  oh he exclaimed with a grunt it seems that you english are a step in front of us boers even here  then he went forward and shook hands with the king whom it will be remembered he had visited before  after that the indaba or talk began which i do not propose to set out at length for it is a matter of history it is enough to say that dingaan after thanking retief for recovering the cattle asked where was sikonyela the chief who had stolen them as he wished to kill him when he learned that sikonyela remained in his own country he became or affected to become angry then he asked where were the sixty horses which he heard we had captured from sikonyela as they must be given up to him  retief by way of reply touched his grey hairs and inquired whether dingaan thought that he was a child that he dingaan should demand horses which did not belong to him he added that these horses had been restored to the boers from whom sikonyela had stolen them  when dingaan had expressed himself satisfied with this answer retief opened the question of the treaty the king replied however that the white men had but just arrived and he wished to see them dance after their own fashion as for the business it might sit still till another day  so in the end the boers danced for his amusement that is they divided into two parties and charged each other at full gallop firing their guns into the air an exhibition which seemed to fill all present with admiration and awe when they paused the king wished them to go on firing a hundred shots apiece but the commandant declined saying he had no more powder to waste  what do you want powder for in a peaceful country asked dingaan suspiciously  retief answered through me  to kill food for ourselves or to protect ourselves if any evilminded men should attack us  then it will not be wanted here said dingaan since i will give you food and as i the king am your friend no man in zululand dare be your enemy  retief said he was glad to hear it and asked leave to retire with the boers to his camp outside the gate as they were all tired with riding this dingaan granted and we said goodbye and went away before i reached the gate however a messenger i remember it was my old friend kambula overtook me and said that the king wished to speak with me alone i answered him that i could not speak with the king alone without the permission of the commandant thereon kambula said  come with me i pray you o macumazahn since otherwise you will be taken by force  now i told hans to gallop on to retief and tell him of my predicament for already i saw that at some sign from kambula i was being surrounded by zulus he did so and presently retief came back himself accompanied only by one man and asked me what was the matter now i informed him translating kambulas words which he repeated in his presence  does the fellow mean that you will be seized if you do not go or i refuse to allow you to do so  to this question kambulas answer was  that is so inkoos since the king has private words for the ear of macumazahn therefore we must obey orders and take him before the king living or dead  allemachte exclaimed retief this is serious and as though to summon them to my help he looked behind him towards the main body of the boers who by this time were nearly all of them through the gate which was guarded by a great number of zulus allan he went on if you are not afraid i think that you must go perhaps it is only that dingaan has some message about the treaty to send to me through you  i am not afraid i answered what is the use of being afraid in a place like this  ask that kaffir if the king gives you safe conduct said retief  i did so and kambula answered  yes for this visit who am i that i can speak the kings unspoken words which meant guarantee his will in the future  a dark saying commented retief but go allan since you must and god bring you back safe again it is clear that dingaan did not ask that you should come with me for nothing now i wish i had left you at home with that pretty wife of yours  so we parted i going to the kings private enclosure on foot and without my rifle since i was not allowed to appear before him armed and the commandant towards the gate of the kraal accompanied by hans who led my horse ten minutes later i stood before dingaan who greeted me kindly enough and began to ask a number of questions about the boers especially if they were not people who had rebelled against their own king and run away from him  i answered yes they had run away as they wanted more room to live but i had told him all about that when i saw him before he said he knew i had but he wished to hear whether the same words came out of the same mouth or different words so that he might know if i were a true man or not then after pausing a while he looked at me in his piercing fashion and asked  have you brought me a present of that tall white girl with eyes like two stars macumazahn i mean the girl whom you refused to me and whom i could not take because you had won your bet which gave all the white people to you she for whose sake you make brothers of these boers who are traitors to their king  no o dingaan i answered there are no women among us moreover this maid is now my wife  your wife he exclaimed angrily by the head of the black one have you dared to make a wife of her whom i desired now say boy you clever watcher by night you little white ant who work in the dark and only peep out at the end of your tunnel when it is finished you wizard who by your magic can snatch his prey out of the hand of the greatest king in all the worldfor it was magic that killed those vultures on hloma amabutu not your bullets macumazahnsay why should i not make an end of you at once for this trick  i folded my arms and looked at him a strange contrast we must have made this huge black tyrant with the royal air for to do him justice he had that at whose nod hundreds went the way of death and i a mere insignificant white boy for in appearance at any rate i was nothing more  o dingaan i said coolly knowing that coolness was my only chance i answer you in the words of the commandant retief the great chief do you take me for a child that i should give up my own wife to you who already have so many moreover you cannot kill me because i have the word of your captain kambula that i am safe with you  this reply seemed to amuse him at any rate with one of those almost infantile changes of mood which are common to savages of every degree he passed from wrath to laughter  you are quick as a lizard he said why should i who have so many wives want one more who would certainly hate me just because she is white and would make the others who are black jealous i suppose indeed they would poison her or pinch her to death in a month and then come to tell me she had died of fretting also you are right you have my safe conduct and must go hence unharmed this time but look you little lizard although you escape me between the stones i will pull off your tail i have said that i want to pluck this tall white flower of yours and i will pluck her i know where she dwells yes just where the wagon she sleeps in stands in the line for my spies have told me and i will give orders that whoever is killed she is to be spared and brought to me living so perhaps you will meet this wife of yours here macumazahn  now at these ominous words that might mean so much or so little the sweat started to my brow and a shiver went down my back  perhaps i shall and perhaps i shall not o king i answered the world is as full of chances today as it was not long ago when i shot at the sacred vultures on hloma amabutu still i think that my wife will never be yours o king  ow said dingaan this little white ant is making another tunnel thinking that he will come up at my back but what if i put down my heel and crush you little white ant do you know he added confidentially that the boer who mends my guns and whom here we call twofaces because he looks towards you whites with one eye and towards us blacks with the other is still very anxious that i should kill you indeed when i told him that my spies said that you were to ride with the boers as i had requested that you should be their tongue he answered that unless i promised to give you to the vultures he would warn them against coming so since i wanted them to come as i had arranged with him i promised  is it so o king i asked and pray why does this twofaces whom we name pereira desire that i should be killed  ow chuckled the obese old ruffian cannot you with all your cleverness guess that o macumazahn perhaps it is he who needs the tall white maiden and not i perhaps if he does certain things for me i have promised her to him in payment and perhaps he added laughing quite loud i shall trick him after all keeping her for myself and paying him in another way for can a cheat grumble if he is outcheated  i answered that i was an honest man and knew nothing about cheats or at what they could or could not grumble  yes macumazahn replied dingaan quite genially that is where you and i are alike we are both honest quite honest and therefore friends which i can never be with these amaboona who as you and others have told me are traitors we play our game in the light like men and who wins wins and who loses loses now hear me macumazahn and remember what i say whatever happens to others whatever you may see you are safe while i live dingaan has spoken whether i get the tall white girl or do not get her still you are safe it is on my head and he touched the gumring in his hair  and why should i be safe if others are unsafe o king i asked  oh if you would know that ask a certain ancient prophet named zikali who was in this land in the days of senzangacona my father and before thenthat is if you can find him also i like you who are not a flatfaced fool like these amaboona but have a brain that turns in and out through difficulties as a snake does through reeds and it would be a pity to kill one who can shoot birds wheeling high above him in the air which no one else can do so whatever you see and whatever you hear remember that you are safe and shall go safely from this land or stay safely in it if you will to be my voice to speak with the sons of george  now return to the commandant and say to him that my heart is his heart and that i am very pleased to see him here tomorrow and perhaps the next day i will show him some of the dances of my people and after that i will sign the writing giving him all the land he asks and everything else he may desire more than he can wish indeed hamba gachlé macumazahn and rising with surprising quickness from his chair which was cut out of a single block of wood he turned and vanished through the little opening in the reed fence behind him that led to his private huts  as i was being conducted back to the boer camp by kambula who was waiting for me outside the gate of the labyrinth which is called isiklohlo i met thomas halstead who was lounging about i think in order to speak with me halting i asked him straight out what the kings intentions were towards the boers  dont know he answered shrugging his shoulders but he seems so sweet on them that i think he must be up to mischief he is wonderfully fond of you too for i heard him give orders that the word was to be passed through all the regiments that if anyone so much as hurt you he should be killed at once also you were pointed out to the soldiers when you rode in with the rest that they might all of them know you  thats good for me as far as it goes i replied but i dont know why i should need special protection above others unless there is someone who wants to harm me  there is that allan quatermain the indunas tell me that the goodlooking portugee whom they call twofaces asks the king to kill you every time he sees him indeed ive heard him myself  thats kind of him i answered but then hernan pereira and i never got on tell me what is he talking about to the king when he isnt asking him to kill me  dont know he said again something dirty ill be bound one may be sure of that by the native name they have given him i think however he added in a whisper that he has had a lot to do with the boers being allowed to come here at all in order to get their treaty signed at least one day when i was interpreting and dingaan swore that he would not give them more land than was enough to bury them in pereira told him that it didnt matter what he signed as what was written with the pen could be scratched out with the spear  indeed and what did the king say to that  oh he laughed and said it was true and that he would give the boer commission all their people wanted and something over for themselves but dont you repeat that quatermain for if you do and it gets to the ear of dingaan i shall certainly be killed and i say youre a good fellow and i won a big bet on you over that vulture shooting so i will give you a bit of advice which you will be wise to take you get out of this country as soon as you can and go to look after that pretty miss marais whom you are sweet on dingaan wants her and what dingaan wants he gets in this part of the world  then without waiting to be thanked he turned and disappeared among a crowd of zulus who were following us from curiosity leaving me wondering whether or no dingaan was right when he called this young man a liar his story seemed to tally so well with that told by the king himself that on the whole i thought he was not  just after i had passed the main gateway of the great town where his office done kambula saluted and left me i saw two white men engaged in earnest conversation beneath one of the milk trees which as i think i have already mentioned grow or grew there they were henri marais and his nephew catching sight of me marais walked off but pereira advanced and spoke to me although warned perhaps by what had happened to him in the case of retief i am glad to say he did not offer me his hand  good day to you allan he said effusively i have just heard from my uncle that i have to congratulate you about marie i mean and believe me i do so with all my heart  now as he spoke these words remembering what i had just heard my blood boiled in me but i thought it wise to control myself and therefore only answered  thank you  of course he went on we have both striven for this prize but as it has pleased god that you should win it why i am not one to bear malice  i am glad to hear it i replied i thought that perhaps you might be now tell me to change the subject how long will dingaan keep us here  oh two or three days at most you see allan luckily i have been able to persuade him to sign the treaty about the land without further trouble so as soon as that is done you can all go home  the commandant will be very grateful to you i said but what are you going to do  i do not know allan you see i am not a lucky fellow like yourself with a wife waiting for me i think that perhaps i shall stop here a while i see a way of making a great deal of money out of these zulus and having lost everything upon that delagoa bay trek i want money  we all do i answered especially if we are starting in life so when it is convenient to you to settle your debts i shall be glad  oh have no fear he exclaimed with a sudden lighting up of his dark face i will pay you what i owe you every farthing with good interest thrown in  the king has just told me that is your intention i remarked quietly looking him full in the eyes then i walked on leaving him staring after me apparently without a word to say  i went straight to the hut that was allotted to retief in the little outlying guardkraal which had been given to us for a camp here i found the commandant seated on a kaffir stool engaged in painfully writing a letter using a bit of board placed on his knees as a desk  he looked up and asked me how i had got on with dingaan not being sorry as i think of an excuse to pause in his clerical labours  listen commandant i said and speaking in a low voice so as not to be overheard i told him every word that had passed in the interviews i had just had with dingaan with thomas halstead and with pereira  he heard me out in silence then said  this is a strange and ugly story allan and if it is true pereira must be an even bigger scoundrel than i thought him but i cant believe that it is true i think that dingaan has been lying to you for his own purposes i mean about the plot to kill you  perhaps commandant i dont know and i dont much care but i am sure that he was not lying when he said he meant to steal away my wife either for himself or for pereira  what then do you intend to do allan  i intend commandant with your permission to send hans my afterrider back to the camp with a letter for marie telling her to remove herself quietly to the farm i have chosen down on the river of which i told you and there to lie hid till i come back  i think it needless allan still if it will ease your mind do so since i cannot spare you to go yourself only you must not send this hottentot who would talk and frighten the people i am despatching a messenger to the camp to tell them of our safe arrival and good reception by dingaan he can take your letter in which i order you to say to your wife that if she and the prinsloos and the meyers go to this farm of yours they are to go without talking just as though they wanted a change that is all have the letter ready by dawn tomorrow morning as i trust mine may be he added with a groan  it shall be ready commandant but what about hernan pereira and his tricks  this about the accursed hernan pereira exclaimed retief striking the writingboard with his fist on the first opportunity i will myself take the evidence of dingaan and of the english lad halstead if i find they tell me the same story they have told you i will put pereira on his trial as i threatened to do before and should he be found guilty by god i will have him shot but for the present it is best to do nothing except keep an eye on him lest we should cause fear and scandal in the camp and after all not prove the case now go and write your letter and leave me to write mine  so i went and wrote telling marie something but by no means all of that i have set down i bade her and the prinsloos and the meyers if they would accompany her as i was sure they would move themselves off at once to the farm i had beaconed out thirty miles away from the bushmans river under pretence of seeing how the houses that were being built there were getting on or if they would not go i bade her go alone with a few hottentot servants or any other companions she could find  this letter i took to retief and read it to him at my request also he scrawled at the foot of it   i have seen the above and approve it knowing all the story which may be true or false do as your husband bids you but do not talk of it in the camp except to those whom he mentionspieter retief   so the messenger departed at dawn and in due course delivered my letter to marie  the next day was sunday in the morning i went to call upon the reverend mr owen the missionary who was very glad to see me he informed me that dingaan was in good mind towards us and had been asking him if he would write the treaty ceding the land which the boers wanted i stopped for service at the huts of mr owen and then returned to the camp in the afternoon dingaan celebrated a great war dance for us to witness in which about twelve thousand soldiers took part  it was a wonderful and aweinspiring spectacle and i remember that each of the regiments employed had a number of trained oxen which manoeuvred with them apparently at given words of command we did not see dingaan that day except at a distance and after the dance was over returned to our camp to eat the beef which he had provided for us in plenty  on the third daythat was monday the 5th of february there were more dancings and sham fights so many more indeed that we began to weary of this savage show late in the afternoon however dingaan sent for the commandant and his men to come to see him saying that he wished to talk with him about the matter of the treaty so we went but only three or four of whom i was one were admitted to dingaans presence the rest remaining at a little distance where they could see us but were out of earshot  dingaan then produced a paper which had been written by the reverend mr owen this document which i believe still exists for it was found afterwards was drawn up in legal or semilegal form beginning like a proclamation know all men  it ceded the place called port natal together with all the land annexedthat is to say from tugela to the umzimvubu river westward and from the sea to the northto the boers for their everlasting property at the kings request as the deed was written in english by mr owen i translated it to him and afterwards the lad halstead translated it also being called in to do so when i had finished  this was done that my rendering might be checked and the fact impressed all the boers very favourably it showed them that the king desired to understand exactly what he was to sign which would not have been the case had he intended any trick or proposed to cheat them afterwards from that moment forward retief and his people had no further doubts as to dingaans good faith in this matter and foolishly relaxed all precautions against treachery  when the translating was finished the commandant asked the king if he would sign the paper then and there he answered no he would sign it on the following morning before the commission returned to natal it was then that retief inquired of dingaan through thomas halstead whether it was a true story which he had heard that the boer called pereira who had been staying with him and whom the zulus knew by the name of twofaces had again asked him dingaan to have me allan quatermain whom they called macumazahn killed dingaan laughed and answered  yes that is true enough for he hates this macumazahn but let the little white son of george have no fear since my heart is soft towards him and i swear by the head of the black one that he shall come to no harm in zululand is he not my guest as you are  he then went on to say that if the commandant wished it he would have twofaces seized and killed because he had dared to ask for my life retief answered that he would look into that matter himself and after thomas halstead had confirmed the kings story as to pereiras conduct he rose and said goodbye to dingaan  of this matter of hernan pereira retief said little as we went back to the camp outside the kraal though the little that he did say showed his deep anger when we arrived at the camp however he sent for pereira and marais and several of the older boers i remember that among these were gerrit bothma senior hendrik labuschagne and matthys pretorius senior all of them persons of standing and judgment i also was ordered to be present when pereira arrived retief charged him openly with having plotted my murder and asked him what he had to say of course his answer was a flat denial and an accusation against me of having invented the tale because we had been at enmity over a maiden whom i had since married  then mynheer pereira said retief as allan quatermain here has won the maiden who is now his wife it would seem that his cause of enmity must have ceased whereas yours may well have remained however i have no time to try cases of the sort now but i warn you that this one will be looked into later on when we get back to natal whither i shall take you with me and that meanwhile an eye is kept on you and what you do also i warn you that i have evidence for all that i say now be so good as to go and to keep out of my sight as much as possible for i do not like a man whom these kaffirs name twofaces as for you friend henri marais i tell you that you would do well to associate yourself less with one whose name is under so dark a cloud although he may be your own nephew whom all know you love blindly  so far as i recollect neither of them made any answer to this direct speech they simply turned and went away but on the next morning that of the fatal 6th of february when i chanced to meet the commandant retief as he was riding through the camp making arrangements for our departure to natal he pulled up his horse and said  allan hernan pereira has gone and henri marais with him and for my part i am not sorry for doubtless we shall meet again in this world or the next and find out all the truth here read this and give it back to me afterwards and he threw me a paper and rode on  i opened the folded sheet and read as follows   to the commandant retief governor of the emigrant boers  mynheer commandant  i will not stay here where such foul accusations are laid on me by black kaffirs and the englishman allan quatermain who like all his race is an enemy of us boers and although you do not know it a traitor who is plotting great harm against you with the zulus therefore i leave you but am ready to meet every charge at the right time before a proper court my uncle henri marais comes with me as he feels that his honour is also touched moreover he has heard that his daughter marie is in danger from the zulus and returns to protect her which he who is called her husband neglects to do allan quatermain the englishman who is the friend of dingaan can explain what i mean for he knows more about the zulu plans than i do as you will find out before the end  then followed the signatures of hernan pereira and henri marais  i put the letter in my pocket wondering what might be its precise meaning and in particular that of the absurd and undefined charge of treachery against myself it seemed to me that pereira had left us because he was afraid of somethingeither that he might be placed upon his trial or of some ultimate catastrophe in which he would be involved marais probably had gone with him for the same reason that a bit of iron follows a magnet because he never could resist the attraction of this evil man his relative by birth or perhaps he had learned from him the story of his daughters danger upon which i had already acted and really was anxious about her safety for it must always be remembered that marais loved marie passionately however ill the reader of this history may think that he behaved to her she was his darling the apple of his eye and her great offence in his sight was that she cared for me more than she did for him that is one of the reasons why he hated me as much as he loved her  almost before i had finished reading this letter the order came that we were to go in a body to bid farewell to dingaan leaving our arms piled beneath the two milk trees at the gate of the town most of our afterriders were commanded to accompany usi think because retief wished to make as big a show as possible to impress the zulus a few of these hottentots however were told to stay behind that they might collect the horses that were kneehaltered and grazing at a distance and saddle them up among these was hans for as it chanced i saw and sent him with the others so that i might be sure that my own horses would be found and made ready for the journey  just as we were starting i met the lad william wood who had come down from the mission huts where he lived with mr owen and was wandering about with an anxious face  how are you william i asked  not very well mr quatermain he answered the fact is he added with a burst of confidence i feel queerly about you all the kaffirs have told me that something is going to happen to you and i think you ought to know it i darent say any more and he vanished into the crowd  at that moment i caught sight of retief riding to and fro and shouting out orders going to him i caught him by the sleeve saying  commandant listen to me  well what is it now nephew he asked absently  i told him what wood had said adding that i also was uneasy i did not know why  oh he answered with impatience this is all hailstones and burnt grass meaning that the one would melt and the other blow away or in our english idiom stuff and rubbish why are you always trying to scare me with your fancies allan dingaan is our friend not our enemy so let us take the gifts that fortune gives us and be thankful come march  this he said about eight oclock in the morning  we strolled through the gates of the great kraal most of the boers who as usual had piled their arms under the two milk trees lounging along in knots of four or five laughing and chatting as they went i have often thought since that although every one of them there except myself was doomed within an hour to have taken the dreadful step from time into eternity it seems strange that advancing fate should have thrown no shadow on their hearts on the contrary they were quite gay being extremely pleased at the successful issue of their mission and the prospect of an immediate return to their wives and children even retief was gay for i heard him joking with his companions about myself and my whitebreadweek or honeymoon which he said was drawing very near  as we went i noticed that most of the regiments who had performed the great military dances before us on the previous day were gone two however remainedthe ischlangu inhlope that is the white shields who were a corps of veterans wearing the ring on their heads and the ischlangu umnyama that is the black shields who were all of them young men without rings the white shields were ranged along the fence of the great open place to our left and the black shields were similarly placed to our right each regiment numbering about fifteen hundred men except for their kerries and dancingsticks they were unarmed  presently we reached the head of the dancing ground and found dingaan seated in his chair with two of his great indunas umhlela and tambusa squatting on either side of him behind him standing in and about the entrance to the labyrinth through which the king had come were other indunas and captains on arriving in front of dingaan we saluted him and he acknowledged the salutation with pleasant words and smiles then retief two or three of the other boers thomas halstead and i went forward whereon the treaty was produced again and identified as the same document that we had seen on the previous day  at the foot of it someonei forget whowrote in dutch de merk van koning dingaan that is the mark of king dingaan in the space left between the words merk and van dingaan made a cross with a pen that was given to him thomas halstead holding his hand and showing him what to do  after this three of his indunas or great councillors who were named nwara yuliwana and manondo testified as witnesses for the zulus and m oosthuyzen a c greyling and b j liebenberg who were standing nearest to retief as witnesses for the boers  this done dingaan ordered one of his isibongos or praisers to run to and fro in front of the regiments and others there assembled and proclaim that he had granted natal to the boers to be their property for ever information which the zulus received with shouts then dingaan asked retief if he would not eat and large trenchers of boiled beef were brought out and handed round this however the boers refused saying they had already breakfasted thereon the king said that at least they must drink and pots of twala or kaffir beer were handed round of which all the boers partook  while they were drinking dingaan gave retief a message to the dutch farmers to the effect that he hoped they would soon come and occupy natal which henceforth was their country also blackhearted villain that he was that they would have a pleasant journey home next he ordered the two regiments to dance and sing war songs in order to amuse his guests  this they began to do drawing nearer as they danced  it was at this moment that a zulu appeared pushing his way through the captains who were gathered at the gate of the labyrinth and delivered some message to one of the indunas who in turn passed it on to the king  ow is it so said the king with a troubled look then his glance fell on me as though by accident and he added macumazahn one of my wives is taken very ill suddenly and says she must have some of the medicine of the white men before they go away now you tell me that you are a newmarried man so i can trust you with my wives i pray you to go and find out what medicine it is that she needs for you can speak our tongue  i hesitated then translated what he had said to retief  you had best go nephew said the commandant but come back quickly for we ride at once  still i hesitated not liking this business whereon the king began to grow angry  what he said do you white men refuse me this little favour when i have just given you so muchyou who have wonderful medicines that can cure the sick  go allan go said retief when he understood his words or he will grow cross and everything may be undone  so having no choice i went through the gateway into the labyrinth  next moment men pounced on me and before i could utter a word a cloth was thrown over my mouth and tied tight behind my head  i was a prisoner and gagged    chapter xix depart in peace   a tall kaffir one of the kings household guards who carried an assegai came up to me and whispered  hearken little son of george the king would save you if he can because you are not dutch but english yet know that if you try to cry out if you even struggle you die and he lifted the assegai so as to be ready to plunge it through my heart  now i understood and a cold sweat broke out all over me my companions were to be murdered every one oh gladly would i have given my life to warn them but alas i could not for the cloth upon my mouth was so thick that no sound could pass it  one of the zulus inserted a stick between the reeds of the fence working it to and fro sideways he made an opening just in a line with my eyesout of cruelty i suppose for now i must see everything  for some timeten minutes i dare saythe dancing and beerdrinking went on then dingaan rose from his chair and shook the hand of retief warmly bidding him hamba gachlé that is depart gently or in peace he retreated towards the gate of the labyrinth and as he went the boers took off their hats waving them in the air and cheering him he was almost through it and i began to breathe again  doubtless i was mistaken after all no treachery was intended  in the very opening of the gate dingaan turned however and said two words in zulu which mean  seize them  instantly the warriors who had now danced quite close and were waiting for these words rushed upon the boers i heard thomas halstead call out in english  we are done for and then add in zulu let me speak to the king  dingaan heard also and waved his hand to show that he refused to listen and as he did so shouted thrice  bulala abatagati that is slay the wizards  i saw poor halstead draw his knife and plunge it into a zulu who was near him the man fell and again he struck at another soldier cutting his throat the boers also drew their knivesthose of them who had timeand tried to defend themselves against these black devils who rushed on them in swarms i heard afterwards that they succeeded in killing six or eight of them and wounding perhaps a score but it was soon over for what could men armed only with pocketknives do against such a multitude  presently amidst a hideous tumult of shouts groans curses prayers for mercy and zulu battle cries the boers were all struck downyes even the two little lads and the hottentot servants then they were dragged away still living by the soldiers their heels trailing on the ground just as wounded worms or insects are dragged by the black ants  dingaan was standing by me now laughing his fat face working nervously  come son of george he said and let us see the end of these traitors to your sovereign  then i was pulled along to an eminence within the labyrinth whence there was a view of the surrounding country here we waited a little while listening to the tumult that grew more distant till presently the dreadful procession of death reappeared coming round the fence of the great kraal and heading straight for the hill of slaughter hloma amabutu soon its slopes were climbed and there among the darkleaved bushes and the rocks the black soldiers butchered them every one  i saw and swooned away   i believe that i remained senseless for many hours though towards the end of that time my swoon grew thin as it were and i heard a hollow voice speaking over me in zulu  i am glad that the little son of george has been saved said the echoing voice which i did not know for he has a great destiny and will be useful to the black people in time to come then the voice went on  o house of senzangacona now you have mixed your milk with blood with white blood of that bowl you shall drink to the dregs and afterwards must the bowl be shattered and the speaker laugheda deep dreadful laugh that i was not to hear again for years  i heard him go away shuffling along like some great reptile and then with an effort opened my eyes i was in a large hut and the only light in the hut came from a fire that burned in its centre for it was night time a zulu woman young and goodlooking was bending over a gourd near the fire doing something to its contents i spoke to her lightheadedly  o woman i said is that a man who laughed over me  not altogether macumazahn she answered in a pleasant voice that was zikali the mighty magician the counsellor of kings the opener of roads he whose birth our grandfathers do not remember he whose breath causes the trees to be torn out by the roots he whom dingaan fears and obeys  did he cause the boers to be killed i asked  mayhap she answered who am i that i should know of such matters  are you the woman who was sick whom i was sent to visit i asked again  yes macumazahn i was sick but now i am well and you are sick for so things go round drink this and she handed me a gourd of milk  how are you named i inquired as i took it  naya is my name she replied and i am your jailer dont think that you can escape me though macumazahn for there are other jailers without who carry spears drink  so i drank and bethought me that the draught might be poisoned yet so thirsty was i that i finished it every drop  now am i a dead man i asked as i put down the gourd  no no macumazahn she who called herself naya replied in a soft voice not a dead man only one who will sleep and forget  then i lost count of everything and sleptfor how long i know not  when i awoke again it was broad daylight in fact the sun stood high in the heavens perhaps naya had put some drug into my milk or perhaps i had simply slept i do not know at any rate i was grateful for that sleep for without it i think that i should have gone mad as it was when i remembered which it took me some time to do for a while i went near to insanity  i recollect lying there in that hut and wondering how the almighty could have permitted such a deed as i had seen done how could it be reconciled with any theory of a loving and merciful father those poor boers whatever their faults and they had many like the rest of us were in the main good and honest men according to their lights yet they had been doomed to be thus brutally butchered at the nod of a savage despot their wives widowed their children left fatherless or as it proved in the end in most cases murdered or orphaned  the mystery was too greatgreat enough to throw off its balance the mind of a young man who had witnessed such a fearsome scene as i have described  for some days really i think that my reason hung just upon the edge of that mental precipice in the end however reflection and education of which i had a certain amount thanks to my father came to my aid i recalled that such massacres often on an infinitely larger scale had happened a thousand times in history and that still through them often indeed by means of them civilisation has marched forward and mercy and peace have kissed each other over the bloody graves of the victims  therefore even in my youth and inexperience i concluded that some ineffable purpose was at work through this horror and that the lives of those poor men which had been thus sacrificed were necessary to that purpose this may appear a dreadful and fatalistic doctrine but it is one that is corroborated in nature every day and doubtless the sufferers meet with their compensations in some other state indeed if it be not so faith and all the religions are vain  or of course it may chance that such monstrous calamities happen not through the will of the merciful power of which i have spoken but in its despite perhaps the devil of scripture at whom we are inclined to smile is still very real and active in this world of ours perhaps from time to time some evil principle breaks into eruption like the prisoned forces of a volcano bearing death and misery on its wings until in the end it must depart strengthless and overcome who can say  the question is one that should be referred to the archbishop of canterbury and the pope of rome in conclave with the lama of thibet for umpire in case they disagreed i only try to put down the thoughts that struck me so long ago as my mind renders them today but very likely they are not quite the same thoughts for a full generation has gone by me since then and in that time the intelligence ripens as wine does in a bottle  besides these general matters i had questions of my own to consider during those days of imprisonmentfor instance that of my own safety though of this to be honest i thought little if i were going to be killed i was going to be killed and there was an end but my knowledge of dingaan told me that he had not massacred retief and his companions for nothing this would be but the prelude to a larger slaughter for i had not forgotten what he said as to the sparing of marie and the other hints he gave me  from all this i concluded quite rightly as it proved that some general onslaught was being made upon the boers who probably would be swept out to the last man and to think that here i was a prisoner in a kaffir kraal with only a young woman as a jailer and yet utterly unable to escape to warn them for round my hut lay a courtyard and round it again ran a reed fence about five feet six inches high whenever i looked over this fence by night or by day i saw soldiers stationed at intervals of about fifteen yards there they stood like statues their broad spears in their hands all looking inwards towards the fence there they stoodonly at night their number was doubled clearly it was not meant that i should escape  a week went by thusbelieve me a very terrible week during that time my sole companion was the pretty young woman naya we became friends in a way and talked on a variety of subjects only at the end of our conversations i always found that i had gained no information whatsoever about any matter of immediate interest on such points as the history of the zulu and kindred tribes or the character of chaka the great king or anything else that was remote she would discourse by the hour but when we came to current events she dried up like water on a redhot brick still naya grew or pretended to grow quite attached to me she even suggested naïvely that i might do worse than marry her which she said dingaan was quite ready to allow as he was fond of me and thought i should be useful in his country when i told her that i was already married she shrugged her shining shoulders and asked with a laugh that revealed her beautiful teeth  what does that matter cannot a man have more wives than one and macumazahn she added leaning forward and looking at me how do you know that you have even one you may be divorced or a widower by now  what do you mean i asked  i i mean nothing do not look at me so fiercely macumazahn surely such things happen in the world do they not  naya i said you are two bad thingsa bait and a spyand you know it  perhaps i do macumazahn she answered am i to blame for that if my life is on it especially when i really like you for yourself  i dont know i said tell me when am i going to get out of this place  how can i tell you macumazahn naya replied patting my hand in her genial way but i think before long when you are gone macumazahn remember me kindly sometimes as i have really tried to make you as comfortable as i could with a watcher staring through every straw in the hut  i said whatever seemed to be appropriate and next morning my deliverance came while i was eating my breakfast in the courtyard at the back of the hut naya thrust her handsome and pleasant face round the corner and said that there was a messenger to see me from the king leaving the rest of the meal unswallowed i went to the doorway of the yard and there found my old friend kambula  greeting inkoos he said to me i am come to take you back to natal with a guard but i warn you to ask me no questions for if you do i must not answer them dingaan is ill and you cannot see him nor can you see the white prayingman or anyone you must come with me at once  i do not want to see dingaan i replied looking him in the eyes  i understand answered kambula dingaans thoughts are his thoughts and your thoughts are your thoughts and perhaps that is why he does not want to see you still remember inkoos that dingaan has saved your life snatching you unburned out of a very great fire perhaps because you are of a different sort of wood which he thinks it a pity to burn now if you are ready let us go  i am ready i answered  at the gate i met naya who said  you never thought to say goodbye to me white man although i have tended you well ah what else could i expect still i hope that if i should have to fly from this land for my life as may chance you will do for me what i have done for you  that i will i answered shaking her by the hand and as it happened in after years i did  kambula led me not through the kraal umgungundhlovu but round it our road lay immediately past the death mount hloma amabutu where the vultures were still gathered in great numbers indeed it was actually my lot to walk over the newpicked bones of some of my companions who had been despatched at the foot of the hill one of these skeletons i recognised by his clothes to be that of samuel esterhuizen a very good fellow at whose side i had slept during all our march his empty eyesockets seemed to stare at me reproachfully as though they asked me why i remained alive when he and all his brethren were dead i echoed the question in my own mind why of that great company did i alone remain alive  an answer seemed to rise within me that i might be one of the instruments of vengeance upon that devilish murderer dingaan looking upon those poor shattered and desecrated frames that had been men i swore in my heart that if i lived i would not fail in that mission nor did i fail although the history of that great repayment cannot be told in these pages  turning my eyes from this dreadful sight i saw that on the opposite slope where we had camped during our southern trek from delagoa still stood the huts and wagons of the reverend mr owen i asked kambula whether he and his people were also dead  no inkoos he answered they are of the children of george as you are and therefore the king has spared them although he is going to send them out of the country  this was good news so far as it went and i asked again if thomas halstead had also been spared since he too was an englishman  no said kambula the king wished to save him but he killed two of our people and was dragged off with the rest when the slayers got to their work it was too late to stay their hands  again i asked whether i might not join mr owen and trek with him to which kambula answered briefly  no macumazahn the kings orders are that you must go by yourself  so i went nor did i ever again meet mr owen or any of his people i believe however that they reached durban safely and sailed away in a ship called the comet  in a little while we came to the two milk trees by the main gate of the kraal where much of our saddlery still lay scattered about though the guns had gone here kambula asked me if i could recognise my own saddle  there it is i answered pointing to it but what is the use of a saddle without a horse  the horse you rode has been kept for you macumazahn he replied  then he ordered one of the men with us to bring the saddle and bridle also some other articles which i selected such as a couple of blankets a waterbottle two tins containing coffee and sugar a little case of medicines and so forth  about a mile further on i found one of my horses tethered by an outlying guard hut and noted that it had been well fed and cared for by kambulas leave i saddled it and mounted as i did so he warned me that if i tried to ride away from the escort i should certainly be killed since even if i escaped them orders had been given throughout the land to put an end to me should i be seen alone  i replied that unarmed as i was i had no idea of making any such attempt so we went forward kambula and his soldiers walking or trotting at my side  for four full days we journeyed thus keeping so far as i could judge about twenty or thirty miles to the east of that road by which i had left zululand before and reentered it with retief and his commission evidently i was an object of great interest to the zulus of the country through which we passed perhaps because they knew me to be the sole survivor of all the white men who had gone up to visit the king they would come down in crowds from the kraals and stare at me almost with awe as though i were a spirit and not a man only not one of them would say anything to me probably because they had been forbidden to do so indeed if i spoke to any of them invariably they turned and walked or ran out of hearing  it was on the evening of the fourth day that kambula and his soldiers received some news which seemed to excite them a great deal a messenger in a state of exhaustion who had an injury to the fleshy part of his left arm which looked to me as though it had been caused by a bullet appeared out of the bush and said something of which by straining my ears i caught two wordsgreat slaughter then kambula laid his fingers on his lips as a signal for silence and led the man away nor did i see or hear any more of him afterwards i asked kambula who had suffered this great slaughter whereon he stared at me innocently and replied that he did not know of what i was speaking  what is the use of lying to me kambula seeing that i shall find out the truth before long  then macumazahn wait till you do find it out and may it please you he replied and went off to speak with his people at a distance  all that night i heard them talking off and oni who lay awake plunged into new miseries i was sure that some other dreadful thing had happened probably dingaans armies had destroyed all the boers and if so oh what had become of marie was she dead or had she perhaps been taken prisoner as dingaan had told me would be done for his own vile purposes for aught i knew she might now be travelling under escort to umgungundhlovu as i was travelling to natal  the morning came at last and that day about noon we reached a ford of the tugela which luckily was quite passable here kambula bade me farewell saying that his mission was finished also he delivered to me a message that i was to give from dingaan to the english in natal it was to this effect that he dingaan had killed the boers who came to visit him because he found out that they were traitors to their chief and therefore not worthy to live but that he loved the sons of george who were truehearted people and therefore had nothing to fear from him indeed he begged them to come and see him at his great place where he would talk matters over with them  i said that i would deliver the message if i met any english people but of course i could not say whether they would accept dingaans invitation to umgungundhlovu indeed i feared lest that town might have acquired such a bad name that they would prefer not to come there without an army  then before kambula had time to take any offence i shook his outstretched hand and urged my horse into the stream i never met kambula again living though after the battle of blood river i saw him dead  once over the tugela i rode forward for half a mile or so till i was clear of the bush and reeds that grew down to the water fearing lest the zulus should follow and take me back to dingaan to explain my rather imprudent message seeing no signs of them i halted a desolate creature in a desolate country which i did not know wondering what i should do and whither i should ride then it was that there happened one of the strangest experiences of all my adventurous life  as i sat dejectedly upon my horse which was also dejected amidst some tumbled rocks that at a distant period in the worlds history had formed the bank of the great river i heard a voice which seemed familiar to me say  baas is that you baas  i looked round and could see no one so thinking that i had been deceived by my imagination i held my peace  baas said the voice again are you dead or are you alive because if you are dead i dont want to have anything to do with spooks until i am obliged  now i answered who is it that speaks and whence though really as i could see no one i thought that i must be demented  the next moment my horse snorted and shied violently and no wonder for out of a great antbear hole not five paces away appeared a yellow face crowned with black wool in which was set a broken feather i looked at the face and the face looked at me  hans i said is it you i thought that you were killed with the others  and i thought that you were killed with the others baas are you sure that you are alive  what are you doing there you old fool i asked  hiding from the zulus baas i heard them on the other bank and then saw a man on a horse crossing the river and went to ground like a jackal i have had enough of zulus  come out i said and tell me your story  he emerged a thin and bedraggled creature with nothing left on him but the upper part of a pair of old trousers but still hans undoubtedly hans he ran to me and seizing my foot kissed it again and again weeping tears of joy and stuttering  oh baas to think that i should find you who were dead alive and find myself alive too oh baas never again will i doubt about the big man in the sky of whom your reverend father is so fond for after i had tried all our own spirits and even those of my ancestors and met with nothing but trouble i said the prayer that the reverend taught us asking for my daily bread because i am so very hungry then i looked out of the hole and there you were have you anything to eat about you baas  as it chanced in my saddlebags i had some biltong that i had saved against emergencies i gave it to him and he devoured it as a famished hyena might do tearing off the tough meat in lumps and bolting them whole when it was all gone he licked his fingers and his lips and stood still staring at me  tell me your story i repeated  baas i went to fetch the horses with the others and ours had strayed i got up a tree to look for them then i heard a noise and saw that the zulus were killing the boers so knowing that presently they would kill us too i stopped in that tree hiding myself as well as i could in a storks nest well they came and assegaied all the other totties and stood under my tree cleaning their spears and getting their breath for one of my brothers had given them a good run but they never saw me although i was nearly sick from fear on the top of them indeed i was sick but into the nest  well i sat in that nest all day though the sun cooked me like beef on a stick and when night came i got down and ran for i knew it was no good to stop to look for you and every man for himself when a black devil is behind you as your reverend father says all night i ran and in the morning hid up in a hole then when night came again i went on running oh they nearly caught me once or twice but never quite for i know how to hide and i kept where men do not go only i was hungry hungry yes i lived on snails and worms and grass like an ox till my middle ached still at last i got across the river and near to the camp  then just before the day broke and i was saying now hans although your heart is sad your stomach will rejoice and sing what did i see but those zulu devils thousands of them rush down on the camp and kill all the poor boers men and women and the little children they killed them by the hundred till at last other boers came and drove them away although they took all the cattle with them well as i was sure that they would come back i did not stop there i ran down to the side of the river and have been crawling about in the reeds for days living on the eggs of waterbirds and a few small fish that i caught in the pools till this morning when i heard the zulus again and slipped up here into this hole then you came and stood over the hole and for a long while i thought you were a ghost  but now we are together once more and all is right just as what your reverend father always said it would be with those who go to church on sunday like me when there was nothing else to do and again he fell to kissing my foot  hans i said you saw the camp was the missie marie there  baas how can i tell who never went into it but the wagon she slept in was not there no nor that of the vrouw prinsloo or of the heer meyer  thank god i gasped then added where were you trying to get to hans when you ran away from the camp  baas i thought perhaps that the missie and the prinsloos and the meyers had gone to that fine farm which you pegged out and that i would go and see if they were there because if so i was sure that they would be glad to know that you were really dead and give me some food in payment for my news but i was afraid to walk across the open veld for fear lest the zulus should see me and kill me therefore i came round through the thick bush along the river where one can only travel slowly especially if hollow and he patted his wasted stomach  but hans i asked are we near my farm where i set the men to build the houses on the hill above the river  of course baas has your brain gone soft that you cannot find your way about the veld four or at most five hours on horseback riding slow and you are there  come on hans i said and be quick for i think that the zulus are not far behind  so we started hans hanging to my stirrup and guiding me for i knew well enough that although he had never travelled this road his instinct for locality would not betray a coloured man who can find his way across the pathless veld as surely as a buck or a bird of the air  on we went over the rolling plain and as we travelled i told him my story briefly enough for my mind was too torn with fears to allow me to talk much he too told me more of his escape and adventures now i understood what was that news which had so excited kambula and his soldiers it was evident that the zulu impis had destroyed a great number of the boers whom they found unprepared for attack and then had been driven off by reinforcements that arrived from other camps  that was why i had been kept prisoner for all those days dingaan feared lest i should reach natal in time to warn his victims    chapter xx the courtmartial   one hour two hours three hours and then suddenly from the top of a rise the sight of the beautiful mooi river winding through the plain like a vast snake of silver and there in a loop of it the flatcrested koppie on which i had hoped to make my home had hopedwhy should i not still hope for aught i knew everything might yet be well marie might have escaped the slaughter as i had done and if so after all our troubles perchance many years of life and happiness awaited us only it seemed too good to be true  i flogged my horse but the poor beast was tired out and could only break into short canters that soon lapsed to a walk again but whether it cantered or whether it walked its hoofs seemed to beat out the wordstoo good to be true sometimes they beat them fast and sometimes they beat them slow but always their message seemed the same  hans too was outworn and weak from starvation also he had a cut upon his foot which hampered him so much that at last he said i had better go on alone he would follow more slowly then i dismounted and set him on the horse walking by it myself  thus it came about that the gorgeous sunset was finished and the sky had grown grey with night before we reached the foot of the koppie yet the last rays of the sinking orb had shown me something as they died there on the slope of the hill stood some mud and wattle houses such as i had ordered to be built and near to them several whitecapped wagons only i did not see any smoke rising from those houses as there should have been at this hour of the day when men cooked their evening food the moon would be up presently i knew but meanwhile it was dark and the tired horse stumbled and floundered among the stones which lay about at the foot of the hill  i could bear it no longer  hans i said do you stay here with the horse i will creep to the houses and see if any dwell there  be careful baas he answered lest you should find zulus for those black devils are all about  i nodded for i could not speak and then began the ascent for several hundred yards i crept from stone to stone feeling my way for the kaffir path that led to the little plateau where the spring was above which the shanties stood ran at the other end of the hill i struck the spruit or rivulet that was fed by this spring being guided to it by the murmur of the water and followed up its bank till i heard a sound which caused me to crouch and listen  i could not be sure because of the ceaseless babble of the brook but the sound seemed like that of sobs while i waited the great moon appeared suddenly above a bank of inky cloud flooding the place with light and oh by that light looking more ethereal than woman i sawi saw marie  she stood not five paces from me by the side of the stream whither she had come to draw water for she held a vessel in her hand she was clothed in some kind of a black garment such as widows wear but made of rough stuff and above it her face showed white in the white rays of the moon gazing at her from the shadow i could even see the tears running down her cheeks for it was she who wept in this lonely place wept for one who would return no more  my voice choked in my throat i could not utter a single word rising from behind a rock i moved towards her she saw me and started then said in a thrilling whisper  oh husband has god sent you to call me i am ready husband i am ready and she stretched out her arms wildly letting fall the vessel that clanked upon the ground  marie i gasped at length and at that word the blood rushed to her face and brow and i saw her draw in her breath as though to scream  hush i whispered it is i allan who have escaped alive  the next thing i remember was that she lay in my arms   what has happened here i asked when i had told my tale or some of it  nothing allan she answered i received your letter at the camp and we trekked away as you bade us without telling the others why because you remember the commandant retief wrote to us not to do so so we were out of the great slaughter for the zulus did not know where we had gone and never followed us here although i have heard that they sought for me my father and my cousin hernan only arrived at the camp two days after the attack and discovering or guessing our hidingplacei know not whichrode on hither they say they came to warn the boers to be careful for they did not trust dingaan but were too late so they too were out of the slaughter for allan many many have been killedthey say five or six hundred most of them women and children but thank god many more escaped since the men came in from the other camps farther off and from their shooting parties and drove away the zulus killing them by scores  are your father and pereira here now i asked  no allan they learned of the massacre and that the zulus were all gone yesterday morning also they got the bad news that retief and everyone with him had been killed at dingaans town it is said through the treachery of the english who arranged with dingaan that he should kill them  that is false i said but go on  then allan they came and told me that i was a widow like many other womeni who had never been a wife allan hernan said that i should not grieve for you as you deserved your fate since you had been caught in your own snare being one of those who had betrayed the boers the vrouw prinsloo answered to his face that he lied and allan i said that i would never speak to him again until we met before the judgment seat of god nor will i do so  but i will speak to him i muttered well where are they now  they rode this morning back to the other boers i think they want to bring a party of them here to settle if they like this place as it is so easy to defend they said they would return tomorrow and that meanwhile we were quite safe as they had sure tidings that all the zulus were back over the tugela taking some of their wounded with them and also the boer cattle as an offering to dingaan but come to the house allanour home that i had made ready for you as well as i could oh my god our home on the threshold of which i believed you would never set a foot yes when the moon rose from that cloud i believed it and look they are still quite close together hark what is that  i listened and caught the sound of a horses hoofs stumbling among the rocks  dont be frightened i answered it is only hans with my horse he escaped also i will tell you how afterwards and as i spoke he appeared a woebegone and exhausted object  good day missie he said with an attempt at cheerfulness now you should give me a fine dinner for you see i have brought the baas back safe to you did i not tell you baas that everything would come right  then he grew silent from exhaustion nor were we sorry who at that moment did not wish to listen to the poor fellows talk   something over two hours had gone by since the moon broke out from the clouds i had greeted the vrouw prinsloo and all my other friends and been received by them with rapture as one risen from the dead if they had loved me before now a new gratitude was added to their love since had it not been for my warning they also must have made acquaintance with the zulu spears and perished it was on their part of the camp that the worst of the attack fell indeed from those wagons hardly anyone escaped  i had told them all the story to which they listened in dead silence only when it was finished the heer meyer whose natural gloom had been deepened by all these events said  allemachte but you have luck allan to be left when everyone else is taken now did i not know you so well like hernan pereira i should think that you and that devil dingaan had winked at each other  the vrouw prinsloo turned on him furiously  how dare you say such words carl meyer she exclaimed must allan always be insulted just because he is english which he cannot help for my part i think that if anyone winked at dingaan it was the stinkcat pereira otherwise why did he come away before the killing and bring that madman henri marais with him  i dont know i am sure aunt said meyer humbly for like everyone else he was afraid of the vrouw prinsloo  then why cant you hold your tongue instead of saying silly things which must give pain asked the vrouw no dont answer for you will only make matters worse but take the rest of that meat to the poor hottentot hansi should explain that we had been suppingwho although he has eaten enough to burst any white stomach i dare say can manage another pound or two  meyer obeyed meekly and the others melted away also as they were wont to do when the vrouw showed signs of war so that she and we two were left alone  now said the vrouw everyone is tired and i say that it is time to go to rest good night nephew allan and niece marie and she waddled away leaving us together  husband said marie presently will you come and see the home that i made ready for you before i thought that you were dead it is a poor place but i pray god that we may be happy there and she took me by the hand and kissed me once and twice and thrice   about noon on the following day when my wife and i were laughing and arguing over some little domestic detail of our meagre establishmentso soon are great griefs forgotten in an overwhelming joy of a sudden i saw her face change and asked what was the matter  hist she said i hear horses and she pointed in a certain direction  i looked and there round the corner of the hill came a body of boers with their afterriders thirtytwo or three of them in all of whom twenty were white men  see said marie my father is among them and my cousin hernan rides at his side  it was true there was henri marais and just behind him talking into his ear rode hernan pereira i remember that the two of them reminded me of a tale i had read about a man who was cursed with an evil genius that drew him to some dreadful doom in spite of the promptings of his better nature the thin worn wildeyed marais and the richfaced carnal pereira whispering slyly into his ear they were exact types of that man in the story and his evil genius who dragged him down to hell prompted by some impulse i threw my arms round marie and embraced her saying  at least we have been very happy for a while  what do you mean allan she asked doubtfully  only that i think our good hours are done with for the present  perhaps she answered slowly but at least they have been very good hours and if i should die today i am glad to have lived to win them  then the cavalcade of boers came up  hernan pereira his senses sharpened perhaps by the instincts of hate and jealousy was the first to recognise me  why mynheer allan quatermain he said how is it that you are here how is it that you still live commandant he added turning to a dark sadfaced man of about sixty whom at that time i did not know here is a strange thing this heer quatermain an englishman was with the governor retief at the town of the zulu king as the heer henri marais can testify now as we know for sure pieter retief and all his people are dead murdered by dingaan how then does it happen that this man has escaped  why do you put riddles to me mynheer pereira asked the dark boer doubtless the englishman will explain  certainly i will mynheer i said is it your pleasure that i should speak now  the commandant hesitated then having called henri marais apart and talked to him for a little while he replied  no not now i think the matter is too serious after we have eaten we will listen to your story mynheer quatermain and meanwhile i command you not to leave this place  do you mean that i am a prisoner commandant i asked  if you put it soyes mynheer quatermaina prisoner who has to explain how some sixty of our brothers who were your companions came to be butchered like beasts in zululand while you escaped now no more words by and by doubtless there will be plenty of them here you carolus and johannes keep watch upon this englishman of whom i hear strange stories with your guns loaded please and when we send to you lead him before us  as usual your cousin hernan brings evil gifts i said to marie bitterly well let us also eat our dinner which perhaps the heeren carolus and johannes will do us the honour to sharebringing their loaded guns with them  carolus and johannes accepted the invitation and from them we heard much news all of it terrible enough to learn especially the details of the massacre in that district which because of this fearful event is now and always will be known as weenen or the place of weeping suffice it to say that they were quite enough to take away all our appetite although carolus and johannes who by this time had recovered somewhat from the shock of that night of blood and terror ate in a fashion which might have filled hans himself with envy  shortly after we had finished our meal hans who by the way seemed to have quite recovered from his fatigues came to remove the dishes he informed us that all the boers were having a great talk and that they were about to send for me sure enough a few minutes later two armed men arrived and ordered me to follow them i turned to say some words of farewell to marie but she said  i go where you do husband and as no objection was made by the guard she came  about two hundred yards away sitting under the shade of one of the wagons we found the boers six of them were seated in a semicircle upon stools or whatever they could find the blackbrowed commandant being in the centre and having in front of him a rough table on which were writing materials  to the left of these six were the prinsloos and meyers being those folk whom i had rescued from delagoa and to the right the other boers who had ridden into the camp that morning i saw at a glance that a courtmartial had been arranged and that the six elders were the judges the commandant being the president of the court  i do not give their names purposely since i have no wish that the actual perpetrators of the terrible blunder that i am about to describe should be known to posterity after all they acted honestly according to their lights and were but tools in the hand of that villain hernan pereira  allan quatermain said the commandant you are brought here to be tried by a courtmartial duly constituted according to the law published in the camps of the emigrant boers do you acknowledge that law  i know that there is such a law commandant i answered but i do not acknowledge the authority of your courtmartial to try a man who is no boer but a subject of the queen of great britain  we have considered that point allan quatermain said the commandant and we disallow it you will remember that in the camp at bushmans river before you rode with the late pieter retief to the chief sikonyela when you were given command of the zulus who went with him you took an oath to interpret truly and to be faithful in all things to the general retief to his companions and to his cause that oath we hold gives this court jurisdiction over you  i deny your jurisdiction i answered although it is true that i took an oath to interpret faithfully and i request that a note of my denial may be made in writing  it shall be done said the commandant and laboriously he made the note on the paper before him  when he had finished he looked up and said the charge against you allan quatermain is that being one of the commission who recently visited the zulu king dingaan under command of the late governor and general pieter retief you did falsely and wickedly urge the said dingaan to murder the said pieter retief and his companions and especially henri marais your fatherinlaw and hernando pereira his nephew with both of whom you had a quarrel further that afterwards you brought about the said murder having first arranged with the king of the zulus that you should be removed to a place of safety while it was done do you plead guilty or not guilty  now when i heard this false and abominable charge my rage and indignation caused me to laugh aloud  are you mad commandant i exclaimed that you should say such things on what evidence is this wicked lie advanced against me  no allan quatermain i am not mad he replied although it is true that through your evil doings i who have lost my wife and three children by the zulu spears have suffered enough to make me mad as for the evidence against you you shall hear it but first i will write down that you plead not guilty  he did so then said  if you will acknowledge certain things it will save us all much time of which at present we have little to spare those things are that knowing what was going to happen to the commission you tried to avoid accompanying it is that true  no i answered i knew nothing of what was going to happen to the commission though i feared something having but just saved my friends thereand i pointed to the prinsloosfrom death at the hands of dingaan i did not wish to accompany it for another reason that i had been married on the day of its starting to marie marais still i went after all because the general retief who was my friend asked me to come to interpret for him  now some of the boers present said  that is true we remember  but the commandant continued taking no heed of my answer or these interruptions  do you acknowledge that you were on bad terms with henri marais and with hernan pereira  yes i answered because henri marais did all in his power to prevent my marriage with his daughter marie behaving very ill to me who had saved his life and that of his people who remained to him up by delagoa and afterwards at umgungundhlovu because too hernan pereira strove to rob me of marie who loved me moreover although i had saved him when he lay sick to death he afterwards tried to murder me by shooting me down in a lonely place here is the mark of it and i touched the little scar upon the side of my forehead  that is true he did so the stinkcat shouted the vrouw prinsloo and was ordered to be silent  do you acknowledge went on the commandant that you sent to warn your wife and those with her to depart from the camp on the bushmans river because it was going to be attacked charging them to keep the matter secret and that afterwards both you and your hottentot servant alone returned safely from zululand where all those who went with you lie dead  i acknowledge i answered that i wrote to tell my wife to come to this place where i had been building houses as you see and to bring with her any of our companions who cared to trek here or failing that to go alone this i did because dingaan had told me whether in jest or in earnest i did not know that he had given orders that my said wife should be kidnapped as he desired to make her one of his women having thought her beautiful when he saw her also what i did was done with the knowledge and by the wish of the late governor retief as can be shown by his writing on my letter i acknowledge also that i escaped when all my brothers were killed as did the hottentot hans and if you wish to know i will tell you how we escaped and why  the commandant made a further note then he said  let the witness hernan pereira be called and sworn  this was done and he was ordered to tell his tale  as may be imagined it was a long tale and one that had evidently been prepared with great care i will only set down its blackest falsehoods he assured the court that he had no enmity against me and had never attempted to kill me or do me any harm although it was true that his heart felt sore because against her fathers will i had stolen away the affection of his betrothed who was now my wife he said that he had stopped in zululand because he knew that i should marry her as soon as she came of age and it was too great pain for him to see this done he said that while he was there before the arrival of the commission dingaan and some of his captains had told him that i had again and again urged him dingaan to kill the boers because they were traitors to the sovereign of england but that he dingaan had refused to do so he said that when retief came up with the commission he tried to warn him against me but that retief would not listen being infatuated with me as many others were and he looked towards the prinsloos  then came the worst of all he said that while he was engaged in mending some guns for dingaan in one of his private huts he overheard a conversation between myself and dingaan which took place outside the hut i of course not knowing that he was within the substance of this conversation was that i again urged dingaan to kill the boers and afterwards to send an impi to massacre their wives and families only i asked him to give me time to get away a girl whom i had married from among them and with her a few of my own friends whom i wished should be spared as i intended to become a kind of chief over them and if he would grant it me to hold all the land of natal under his rule and the protection of the english to these proposals dingaan answered that they seemed wise and good and that he would think them over very carefully  pereira said further that coming out of the hut after dingaan had gone away he reproached me bitterly for my wickedness and announced that he would warn the boers which he did subsequently by word of mouth and in writing that thereon i caused him to be detained by the zulus while i went to retief and told him some false story about him pereira which caused retief to drive him out of his camp and give orders that none of the boers should so much as speak to him that then he did the only thing he could going to his uncle henri marais he told him not all the truth but that he had learnt for certain that his daughter marie was in dreadful danger of her life because of some intended attack of the zulus and that all the boers among whom she dwelt were also in danger of their lives  therefore he suggested to henri marais that as the general retief was besotted and would not listen to his story the best thing they could do was to ride away and warn the boers this then they did secretly without the knowledge of retief but being delayed upon their journey by one accident and another which he set out in detail they only reached the bushmans river too late after the massacre had taken place subsequently as the commandant knew hearing a rumour that marie marais and other boers had trekked to this place before the slaughter they came here and learned that they had done so upon a warning sent to them by allan quatermain whereon they returned and communicated the news to the surviving boers at bushmans river  that was all he had to say  then as i reserved my crossexamination until i heard all the evidence against me henri marais was sworn and corroborated his nephews testimony on many points as to my relations to his daughter his objection to my marriage to her because i was an englishman whom he disliked and mistrusted and so forth he added further that it was true pereira had told him he had sure information that marie and the boers were in danger from an attack upon them which had been arranged between allan quatermain and dingaan that he also had written to retief and tried to speak to him but was refused a hearing thereon he had ridden away from umgungundhlovu to try to save his daughter and warn the boers that was all he had to say  as there were no further witnesses for the prosecution i crossexamined these two at full length but absolutely without results since every vital question that i asked was met with a direct negative  then i called my witnesses marie whose evidence they refused to hear on the ground that she was my wife and prejudiced the vrouw prinsloo and her family and the meyers one and all told a true story of my relations with hernan pereira henri marais and dingaan so far as they knew them  after this as the commandant declined to take the evidence of hans because he was a hottentot and my servant i addressed the court relating exactly what had taken place between me and dingaan and how i and hans came to escape on our second visit to his kraal i pointed out also that unhappily for myself i could not prove my words since dingaan was not available as a witness and all the others were dead further i produced my letter to marie which was endorsed by retief and the letter to retief signed by marais and pereira which remained in my possession  by the time that i had finished my speech the sun was setting and everyone was tired out i was ordered to withdraw under guard while the court consulted which it did for a long while then i was called forward again and the commandant said  allan quatermain after prayer to god we have considered this case to the best of our judgment and ability on the one hand we note that you are an englishman a member of a race which hates and has always oppressed our people and that it was to your interest to get rid of two of them with whom you had quarrelled the evidence of henri marais and hernan pereira which we cannot disbelieve shows that you were wicked enough either in order to do this or because of your malice against the boer people to plot their destruction with a savage the result is that some seven hundred men women and children have lost their lives in a very cruel manner whereas you your servant your wife and your friends have alone escaped unharmed for such a crime as this a hundred deaths could not pay indeed god alone can give to it its just punishment and to him it is our duty to send you to be judged we condemn you to be shot as a traitor and a murderer and may he have mercy on your soul  at these dreadful words marie fell to the ground fainting and a pause ensued while she was carried off to the prinsloos house whither the vrouw followed to attend her then the commandant went on  still although we have thus passed judgment on you because you are an englishman against whom it might be said that we had prejudices and because you have had no opportunity of preparing a defence and no witnesses to the facts since all those whom you say you could have called are dead we think it right that this unanimous sentence of ours should be confirmed by a general court of the emigrant boers therefore tomorrow morning you will be taken with us to the bushmans river camp where the case will be settled and if necessary execution done in accordance with the verdict of the generals and veldcornets of that camp meanwhile you will be kept in custody in your own house now have you anything to say against this sentence  yes this i answered that although you do not know it it is an unjust sentence built up on the lies of one who has always been my enemy and of a man whose brain is rotten i never betrayed the boers if anyone betrayed them it was hernan pereira himself who as i proved to the general retief had been praying dingaan to kill me and whom retief threatened to put upon his trial for this very crime for which reason and no other pereira fled from the kraal taking his tool henri marais with him you have asked god to judge me well i ask god to judge him and henri marais also and i know he will in one way or another as for me i am ready to die as i have been for months while serving the cause of you boers shoot me now if you will and make an end but i tell you that if i escape your hands i will not suffer this treatment to go unpunished i will lay my case before the rulers of my people and if necessary before my queen yes if i have to travel to london to do it and you boers shall learn that you cannot condemn an innocent englishman upon false testimony and not pay the price i tell you that price shall be great if i live and if i die it shall be greater still  now these words very foolish words i admit which being young and inexperienced i spoke in my british pride i could see made a great impression upon my judges they believed to be fair to them that they had passed a just sentence blinded by prejudice and falsehood and maddened by the dreadful losses their people had suffered during the past few days at the hands of a devilish savage they believed that i was the instigator of those losses one who ought to die indeed all or nearly all the boers were persuaded that dingaan was urged to this massacre by the counsels of englishmen the mere fact of my own and my servants miraculous escape when all my companions had perished proved my guilt to them without the evidence of pereira which being no lawyers they thought sufficient to justify their verdict  still they had an uneasy suspicion that this evidence was not conclusive and might indeed be rejected in toto by a more competent court upon various grounds also they knew themselves to be rebels who had no legal right to form a court and feared the power of the long arm of england from which for a little while they had escaped if i were allowed to tell my tale to the parliament in london what might not happen to them they wonderedto them who had ventured to pass sentence of death upon a subject of the queen of great britain might not this turn the scale against them might not britain arise in wrath and crush them these men who dared to invoke her forms of law in order to kill her citizen those as i learned afterwards were the thoughts that passed through their minds  also another thought passed through their mindsthat if the sentence were executed at once a dead man cannot appeal and that here i had no friends to take up my cause and avenge me but of all this they said nothing only at a sign i was marched away to my little house and imprisoned under guard  now i propose to tell the rest of the history of these tragic events as they happened although some of them did not come to my knowledge till the morrow or afterwards for i think this will be the more simple and the easier plan    chapter xxi the innocent blood   after i had been taken away it seems that the court summoned hernan pereira and henri marais to accompany them to a lonely spot at a distance where they thought that their deliberations would not be overheard in this however they were mistaken having forgotten the foxlike cunning of the hottentot hans hans had heard me sentenced and probably enough feared that he who also had committed the crime of escaping from dingaan might be called on to share that sentence also he wished to know the secret counsel of these boers whose language of course he understood as well as he did his own  so making a circuit up the hillside he crept towards them on his belly as a snake creeps wriggling in and out between the tufts of last years dead grass which grew here in plenty without so much as moving their tops at length he lay still in the centre of a bush that grew behind a stone not five paces from where they were talking whence he listened intently to every word that passed their lips  this was the substance of their talk that for the reasons i have already mentioned it would be best that i should die at once sentence said the commandant had been passed and could not be rescinded since even if it were their offence would remain as heavy in the eyes of the english authorities but if they took me to their main camp to be retried by their great council possibly that sentence might be rescinded and they be left individually and collectively to atone for what they had done also they knew that i was very clever and might escape in some other way to bring the english or possibly the zulus upon them since they felt convinced that dingaan and i were working together for their destruction and that while i had breath in my body i should never cease my efforts to be avenged  when it was found that they were all of one mind in this matter the question arose what should be done somebody suggested that i should be shot at once but the commandant pointed out that such a deed worked at night would look like murder especially as it violated the terms of their verdict  then another suggestion was made that i should be brought out of my house just before the dawn on pretence that it was time to ride that then i should be given the opportunity of escape and instantly shot down or it might be pretended that i had tried to escape with a like result who they urged was to know in that halflight whether i had or had not actually attempted to run for my life or to threaten their lives circumstances under which the law said it was justifiable to shoot a prisoner already formally condemned to death  to this black counsel they all agreed being so terribly afraid of a poor english lad whose existence although most of them did not know this was to be taken from him upon false evidence but then arose another question by whose hand should the thing be done not one of them it would seem was anxious to fulfil this bloody office indeed they one and all refused to do so a proposal was put forward that some of their native servants should be forced to serve as executioners but when this had been vetoed by the general sense of the court their counsels came to a deadlock  then after a whispered conference the commandant spoke some dreadful words  hernando pereira and henri marais he said it is on your evidence that this young man has been condemned we believe that evidence but if by one jot or one tittle it is false then not justice but a foul murder will have been committed and his innocent blood will be upon your heads for ever hernando pereira and henri marais the court appoints you to be the guards who will bring the prisoner out of his house tomorrow morning just when the sky begins to lighten it is from you that he will try to escape and you will prevent his escape by his death then you must join us where we shall be waiting for you and report the execution  when henri marais heard this he exclaimed  i swear by god that i cannot do it is it right or natural that a man should be forced to kill his own soninlaw  you could bear evidence against your own soninlaw henri marais answered the sternfaced commandant why then cannot you kill with your rifle one whom you have already helped to kill with your tongue  i will not i cannot said marais tearing at his beard but the commandant only answered coldly  you have the orders of the court and if you choose to disobey them we shall begin to believe that you have sworn falsely then you and your nephew will also appear before the great council when the englishman is tried again still it matters nothing to us whether you or hernando pereira shall fire the shot see you to it as the jews said to judas who had betrayed the innocent lord  then he paused and went on addressing pereira  do you also refuse hernando pereira remember before you answer that if you do refuse we shall draw our own conclusions remember too that the evidence which you have given showing that this wicked englishman plotted and caused the deaths of our brothers and of our wives and children which we believe to be true evidence shall be weighed and investigated word by word before the great council  to give evidence is one thing and to shoot the traitor and murderer another said pereira then he added with an oath or so vowed hans yet why should i who know all this villains guilt refuse to carry out the sentence of the law on him have no fear commandant the accursed allan quatermain shall not succeed in his attempt to escape tomorrow before the dawn  so be it said the commandant now do all you who have heard those words take note of them  then hans seeing that the council was about to break up and fearing lest he should be caught and killed slipped away by the same road that he had come his thought was to warn me but this he could not do because of the guards so he went to the prinsloos and finding the vrouw alone with marie who had recovered her mind told them everything that he had heard  as he said marie knelt down and prayed or thought for a long while then rose and spoke  tante she said to the vrouw one thing is clear that allan will be murdered at the dawn now if he is hidden away he may escape  but where and how can we hide him asked the vrouw seeing that the place is guarded  tante said marie again at the back of your house is an old cattle kraal made by kaffirs and in that cattle kraal as i have seen there are mealiepits where those kaffirs stored their grain now i suggest that we should put my husband into one of those mealiepits and cover it over there the boers might not find him however close they searched  that is a good idea said the vrouw but how in the name of god are we to get allan out of a guarded house into a mealiepit  tante i have a right to go to my husbands house and there i will go afterwards too i shall have the right to leave his house before he is taken away well he might leave it in my place as me and you and hans might help him then in the morning the boers would come to search the house and find no one except me  that is all very pretty answered the vrouw but do you think my niece that those accursed vultures will go away until they have picked allans bones not they for too much hangs on it they will know that he cannot be far off and slink about the place until they have found him in his mealiehole or until he comes out it is blood they are after thanks to your cousin hernan the liar and blood they will have for their own safetys sake never will they go away from here until they see allan lying dead upon the ground  now according to hans marie thought again very deeply then she answered  there is a great risk tante but we must take it send your husband to chat with those guards and give him a bottle of spirits i will talk with hans here and see what can be arranged  so marie went aside with hans as he told me afterwards and asked him if he knew of any medicine that made people sleep for a long while without waking he answered yes all the coloured people had plenty of such medicine without doubt he could get some from the kaffirs who dwelt upon the place or if not he could dig the roots of a plant that he had seen growing near by which would serve the purpose so she sent him to procure this stuff afterwards she spoke to the vrouw prinsloo saying  my plan is that allan should escape from our house disguised as myself but as i know well that he will not run away while he has his senses seeing that to do so in his mind would be to confess his guilt i propose to take his senses from him by means of a drugged drink then i propose that you and hans should carry him into the shadow of this house and when no one is looking to the old grainpit that lies but a few yards away covering the mouth of it with dead grass there he will remain till the boers grow tired of searching for him and ride away or if it should chance that they find him he will be no worse off than he was before  a good plan enough marie though not one that allan would have anything to do with if he kept his wits answered the vrouw seeing that he was always a man for facing things out although so young in years still we will try to save him in spite of himself from the claws of that stinkcat pereira whom may god curse and his tool your father as you say at the worst no harm will be done even if they find him as probably they will seeing that they will not leave this place without blood  such then was the trick which marie arranged with the vrouw prinsloo or rather i should say seemed to arrange since she told her nothing of her real mind she who knew that the vrouw was right and that for their own sakes as well as because they believed it to be justice the boers would never leave that place until they saw blood running on the grass  this oh this was maries true and dreadful planto give her life for mine she was sure that once he had slain his victim hernan pereira would not stop to make examination of the corpse he would ride away hounded by his guilty conscience and meanwhile i could escape  she never thought the thing out in all its details she who was maddened with terror and had no time she only felt her way from step to step dimly seeing my deliverance at the end of the journey marie told the vrouw prinsloo nothing except that she proposed to drug me if i would not go undrugged then the vrouw must hide me as best she could in the grainpit or elsewhere or if i had my senses about me let me hide myself afterwards she marie would face the boers and tell them to find me if they wanted me  the vrouw answered that she had now thought of a better plan it was that she should arrange with her husband and son and the meyers all of whom loved me that they should rescue me or if need be kill or disable pereira before he could shoot me  marie replied that this was good if it could be done and the vrouw went out to find her husband and the other men presently however she returned with a long face saying that the commandant had them all under guard it seemed that it had occurred to him or more probably to pereira that the prinsloos and the meyers who looked on me as a brother might attempt some rescue or make themselves formidable in other ways therefore as a matter of precaution they had been put under arrest and their arms taken from them as mine had been what the commandant said however was that he took these somewhat highhanded measures in order to be sure that they the prinsloos and the meyers should be ready on the following morning to ride with him and the prisoner to the main camp where the great council might wish to interrogate them  one concession however the vrouw had won from the commandant who knowing what was about to happen to me had not i suppose the heart to refuse it was that my wife and she might visit me and give me food on the stipulation that they both left the house where i was confined by ten oclock that night  so it came to this that if anything was to be done these two women and a hottentot must do it since they could hope for no help in their plans here i should add that the vrouw told marie in hanss presence that she had thought of attacking the commandant as to this matter of my proposed shooting by pereira on reflection however she refrained for two reasons first because she feared lest she might only make matters worse and rob me of my sole helpers and secondly for fear lest she should bring about the death of hans to whom the story would certainly be traced  as he was the solitary witness to the plot it seemed to her that he would scarcely be allowed to escape to repeat it far and wide especially was this so as the unexplained death of a hottentot suspected of treachery like his master was not a matter that would have been thought worth notice in those rough and bloody times she may have been right or she may have been wrong but in weighing her decision it must always be borne in mind that she was and until the end remained in utter ignorance of maries heroic design to go to her death in place of me  so the two women and the hottentot proceeded to mature the plans which i have outlined one other alternative however hans did suggest it was that they should try to drug the guards with some of the medicated drink that was meant for me and that then marie i and he should slip away and get down to the river there to hide in the weeds thence perhaps we might escape to port natal where lived englishmen who would protect us  of course this idea was hopeless from the first the moonlight was almost as bright as day and the veld quite open for a long way round so that we should certainly have been seen and recaptured which of course would have meant instant death further as it happened the guards had been warned against touching liquor of any sort since it was thought probable that an attempt would be made to intoxicate them still the women determined to try this scheme if they could find a chance at least it was a second string to their bow  meanwhile they made their preparations hans went away for a little and returned with a supply of his sleepproducing drug though whether he got this from the kaffirs or gathered it himself i do not remember if i ever heard at any rate it was boiled up in the water with which they made the coffee that i was to drink though not in that which marie proposed to drink with me the strong taste and black hue of the coffee effectually hiding any flavour or colour that there might be in the herb also the vrouw cooked some food which she gave to hans to carry first however he went to investigate the old mealiepit which was within a few paces of the back door of the prinsloos house he reported that it would do well to hide a man in especially as tall grass and bushes grew about its mouth  then the three of them started and arriving at the door of my house which was about a hundred yards away were of course challenged by the sentries  heeren said marie the commandant has given us leave to bring food to my husband whom you guard within pray do not prevent us from entering  no answered one of them gently enough for he was touched with pity at her plight we have our orders to admit you the vrouw prinsloo and the native servant though why three of you should be needed to carry food to one man i dont know i should have thought that at such a time he would have preferred to be alone with his wife  the vrouw prinsloo wishes to ask my husband certain questions about his property here and what is to be done while he and her men are away at the main camp for the second trial as i whose heart is full of sorrow have no head for such things also the hottentot must have orders as to where he is to get a horse to ride with him so pray let us pass mynheer  very good it is no affair of ours vrouw quatermain stay i suppose that you have no arms under that long cloak of yours  search me if you will mynheer she answered opening the cloak whereon after a quick glance he nodded and bade them enter saying  mind you are to come out by ten oclock you must not pass the night in that house or we shall have the little englishman oversleeping himself in the morning  then they entered and found me seated at a table preparing notes for my defence and setting down the heads of the facts of my relations with pereira dingaan and the late commandant retief  here i may state that my condition at the time was not one of fear but rather of burning indignation indeed i had not the slightest doubt but that when my case was retried before the great council i should be able to establish my complete innocence of the abominable charges that had been brought against me therefore it came about that when marie suggested that i should try to escape i begged her almost roughly not to mention such a thing again  run away i said why that would be to confess myself guilty for only the guilty run away what i want is to have all this business thrashed out and that devil pereira exposed  but allan said marie how if you should never live to have it thrashed out how if you should be shot first then she rose and having looked to see that the shutterboard was fast in the little windowplace and the curtain that she had made of sacking drawn over it returned and whispered hans here has heard a horrible tale allan tell it to the baas hans  so while vrouw prinsloo in order to deceive any prying eyes if such by chance could see us busied herself with lighting a fire on the hearth in the second room on which to warm the food hans told his story much as it has already been set out  i listened to it with growing incredulity the thing seemed to me impossible either hans was deceived or lying the latter probably for well i knew the hottentot powers of imagination or perhaps he was drunk indeed he smelt of liquor of which i was aware he could carry a great quantity without outward signs of intoxication  i cannot believe it i said when he had finished even if pereira is such a fiend as is possible would henri marais your fatherwho at any rate has always been a good and godfearing manconsent to work such a crime upon his daughters husband though he does dislike him  my father is not what he was allan said marie sometimes i think that his brain has gone  he did not speak like a man whose brain has gone this afternoon i replied but let us suppose that this tale is true what is it that you wish me to do  allan i wish you to dress up in my clothes and get away to a hidingplace which hans and the vrouw know leaving me here instead of you  why marie i said then you might get yourself shot in my place always supposing that they mean to shoot me also i should certainly be caught and killed as they would have a right to kill me for trying to escape in disguise that is a mad plan and i have a better vrouw prinsloo go straight to the commandant ad tell him all this story or if he will not listen to you scream it out at the top of your voice so that everyone may hear and then come back and tell us the result of one thing i am sure that if you do this even if there was any thought of my being shot tomorrow morning it will be abandoned you can refuse to say who told you the tale  yes please do that muttered hans else i know one who will be shot  good i will go said the vrouw and she went the guards letting her pass after a few words which we could not hear  half an hour later she returned and called to us to open the door  well i asked  well she said i have failed nephew except those sentries outside the door the commandant and all the boers have ridden off i know not where taking our people with them  thats odd i answered but i suppose they thought they had not enough grass for their horses or heaven knows what they thought stay now i will do something and opening the door i called to the guards honest fellows in their way whom i had known in past times  listen friends i said a tale has been brought to me that i am not to be taken to the big camp to have my case inquired of by the council but am to be shot down in cold blood when i come out of this house tomorrow morning is that true  allemachte englishman answered one of them do you take us for murderers our orders are to lead you to the commandant wherever he may appoint so have no fear that we shall shoot you like a kaffir either you or they who told you such a story are mad  so i thought friends i answered but where is the commandant and where are the others the vrouw prinsloo here has been to see them and reports that they are all gone  that is very likely said the boer there is a rumour that some of your zulu brothers have come across the tugela again to hunt us which if you want to know the truth is why we visited this place well the commandant has taken his men for a ride to see if he can meet them by this bright moonlight pity he could not take you too since you would have known so well where to find them if they are there at all now please talk no more nonsense to us which it makes us sick to hear and dont think that you can slip away because we are only two for you know our roers are loaded with slugs and we have orders to use them  there i said when i had shut the door now you have heard for yourselves as i thought there is nothing in this fine story so i hope you are convinced  neither the vrouw nor marie made any answer and hans also held his tongue yet as i remembered afterwards i saw a strange glance pass between the two women who were not at all convinced and although i never dreamed of such a thing had now determined to carry out their own desperate plan but of this i repeat the vrouw and hans only knew one half the rest was locked in maries loving heart  perhaps you are right allan said the vrouw in the tone of one who gives way to an unreasonable child i hope so and at any rate you can refuse to come out of the house tomorrow morning until you are quite sure and now let us eat some supper for we shall not make matters better by going hungry hans bring the food  so we ate or made pretence to eat and i being thirsty drank two cups of the black coffee dashed with spirit to serve as milk after this i grew strangely sleepy the last thing i remember was marie looking at me with her beautiful eyes that were fullah so full of tender love and kissing me again and again upon the lips   i dreamed all sorts of dreams rather pleasant dreams on the whole then i woke up by degrees to find myself in an earthen pit shaped like a bottle and having the remains of polished sides to it it made me think of joséph who was let down by his brethren into a well in the desert now who on earth could have let me down into a well especially as i had no brethren perhaps i was not really in a well perhaps this was a nightmare or i might be dead i began to remember that there were certain good reasons why i should be dead only onlywhy should they have buried me in womans clothes as i seemed to wear  and what was that noise that had wakened me  it could not be the trump of doom unless the trumping of doom went off like a doublebarrelled gun  i began to try to climb out of my hole but as it was nine feet deep and bottleshaped which the light flowing in from the neck showed i found this impossible just as i was giving up the attempt a yellow face appeared in that neck which looked to me like the face of hans and an arm was projected downwards  jump if you are awake baas said a voicesurely it was the voice of hansand i will pull you out  so i jumped and caught the arm above the wrist then the owner of the arm pulled desperately and the end of it was that i succeeded in gripping the edge of the bottlelike hole and with the help of the arm in dragging myself out  now baas said hans for it was hans run run before the boers catch you  what boers i asked sleepily and how can i run with these things flapping about my legs  then i looked about me and although the dawn was only just breaking began to recognise my surroundings surely this was the prinsloos house to my right and that faintly seen through the mist about a hundred paces away was maries and my own there seemed to be something going on yonder which excited my awakening curiosity i could see figures moving in an unusual manner and desired to know what they were doing i began to walk towards them and hans for his part began to try to drag me in an opposite direction uttering all sorts of gibberish as to the necessity of my running away but i would not be dragged indeed i struck at him until at last with an exclamation of despair he let go of me and vanished  so i went on alone i came to my house or what i thought resembled it and there saw a figure lying on its face on the ground some ten or fifteen yards to the right of the doorway and noted abstractedly that it was dressed in my clothes the vrouw prinsloo in her absurd night garments was waddling towards the figure and a little way off stood hernan pereira apparently in the act of reloading a doublebarrelled gun beyond staring at him stood the lanternfaced henri marais pulling at his long beard with one hand and holding a rifle in the other behind were two saddled horses in the charge of a raw kaffir who looked on stupidly  the vrouw prinsloo reached the body that lay upon the ground dressed in what resembled my clothes and bending down her stout shape with an effort turned it over she glared into its face and then began to shriek  come here henri marais she shrieked come see what your beloved nephew has done you had a daughter who was all your life to you henri marais well come look at her after your beloved nephew has finished his work with her  henri marais advanced slowly like one who does not understand he stood over the body on the ground and looked down upon it through the morning mists  then suddenly he went mad his broad hat fell from his head and his long hair seemed to stand up also his beard grew big and bristled like the feathers of a bird in frosty weather he turned on hernan pereira you devil he shouted and his voice sounded like the roar of a wild beast you devil you have murdered my daughter because you could not get marie for yourself you have murdered her well i will pay you back  without more ado he lifted his gun and fired straight at hernan pereira who sank slowly to the ground and lay there groaning  just then i grew aware that horsemen were advancing upon us a great number of horsemen though whence they came at that time i did not know one of these i recognised even in my halfdrunken state for he had impressed himself very vividly upon my mind he was the darkbrowed commandant who had tried and condemned me to death he dismounted and staring at the two figures that lay upon the ground said in a loud and terrible voice  what is this who are these men and why are they shot explain henri marais  men wailed henri marais they are not men one is a womanmy only child and the other is a devil who being a devil will not die see he will not die give me another gun that i may make him die  the commandant looked about him wildly and his eye fell upon the vrouw prinsloo  what has chanced vrouw he asked  only this she replied in a voice of unnatural calm your murderers whom you set on in the name of law and justice have made a mistake you told them to murder allan quatermain for reasons of your own well they have murdered his wife instead  now the commandant struck his hand upon his forehead and groaned and i half awakened at last ran forward shaking my fists and gibbering  who is that asked the commandant is it a man or a woman  it is a man in womans clothing it is allan quatermain answered the vrouw whom we drugged and tried to hide from your butchers  god above us exclaimed the commandant is this earth or hell  then the wounded pereira raised himself upon one hand  i am dying he cried my life is bleeding away but before i die i must speak all that story i told against the englishman is false he never plotted with dingaan against the boers it was i who plotted with dingaan although i hated him because he found me out i did not wish retief and our people to be killed but i did wish allan quatermain to be killed because he had won her whom i loved though as it happened all the others were slain and he alone escaped then i came here and learned that marie was his wifeyes his wife indeedand grew mad with hate and jealousy so i bore false witness against him and you fools you believed me and ordered me to shoot him who is innocent before god and man then things went wrong the woman tricked me againfor the last time she dressed herself as the man and in the dawnlight i was deceived i killed her her whom i love alone and now her father who loved her also has killed me  by this time i understood all for my drugged brain had awakened at last i ran to the brute upon the ground grotesque in my womans garments all awry i leaped on him and stamped out the last of his life then standing over his dead body i shook my fists and cried  men see what you have done may god pay you back all you owe her and me  they dismounted they came round me they protested they even wept and i i raved at them upon the one side while the mad henri marais raved upon the other and the vrouw prinsloo waving her big arms called down the curse of god and the blood of the innocent upon their heads and those of their children for ever  then i remember no more   when i came to myself two weeks afterwards for i had been very ill and in delirium i was lying in the house of the vrouw prinsloo alone the boers had all gone east and west and north and south and the dead were long buried they had taken henri marais with them so i was told dragging him away in a bullock cart to which he was tied for he was raving mad afterwards he became quieter and indeed lived for years walking about and asking all whom he met if they could lead him to marie but enough of himpoor man poor man  the tale which got about was that pereira had murdered marie out of jealousy and been shot by her father but there were so many tragic histories in those days of war and massacre that this particular one was soon quite forgotten especially as those concerned in it for one reason and another did not talk overmuch of its details nor did i talk of it since no vengeance could mend my broken heart   they brought me a letter that had been found on maries breast stained with her blood  here it is   my husband  thrice have you saved my life and now it is my turn to save yours for there is no other path it may be that they will kill you afterwards but if so i shall be glad to have died first in order that i may be ready to greet you in the land beyond  i drugged you allan then i cut off my hair and dressed myself in your clothes the vrouw prinsloo hans and i set my garments upon you they led you out as though you were fainting and the guards seeing me whom they thought was you standing in the doorway let them pass without question  what may happen i do not know for i write this after you are gone i hope however that you will escape and lead some full and happy life though i fear that its best moments will always be shadowed by memories of me for i know you love me allan and will always love me as i shall always love you  the light is burning outlike mineso farewell farewell farewell all earthly stories come to an end at last but at that end we shall meet again till then adieu would that i could have done more for you since to die for one who is loved with body heart and soul is but a little thing still i have been your wife allan and your wife i shall remain when the world is old heaven does not grow old allan and there i shall greet you  the light is dead butohin my heart another light arises  your marie   this was her letter  i do not think there is anything more to be said   such is the history of my first love those who read it if any ever do will understand why i have never spoken of her before and do not wish it to be known until i too am dead and have gone to join the great soul of marie marais   allan quatermain
